Brother van Elburg was a young Dutchman

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
raised during the post-World War I era,

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who enjoyed life like all young men his age.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved playing chess
and following the latest football results

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was the proud father of two children

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his daughter, Henny, and his son, Fritz.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together with his wife, Lies,

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he created a cozy home for them,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was located in the Azaleastraat,

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the city of Zwolle, in the Netherlands.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:35.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My parents had the habit

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of studying together on Saturday evening,

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to read the first two paragraphs.

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I also had to answer the questions.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this stayed with me

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the rest of my life.

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman loved sharing the Bible’s message

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a peaceful future
with his fellow citizens of Zwolle,

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing that the day will come when nations

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:03.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no longer will go to war against each other.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things were about to change.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1939,

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neighboring Germany started World War II.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Nazis were set
on exterminating Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of them had to flee the country.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moved by unselfish love,
Herman opened his home to offer them shelter.

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, my father said to my mother:

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lies, I received a letter from the Society.

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother is coming to stay with us.”

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:43.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother said:
“Oh, Herman, this can’t go on like that.

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be able to feed all of them.”

00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:50.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To which my father replied:
“But, Lies, I’m a butcher.

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be enough meat for all.”

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 10, 1940,

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.015 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Germany invaded the Netherlands.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Herman and his family were also

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at risk of falling prey to the Nazi regime.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among their neighbors

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was a family that was very active

00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:15.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in pro-German politics during the war.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Another man was responsible for the arrest

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.285 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of a significant number of Jews.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:24.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In between these two
lived the van Elburg family.

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, Herman was betrayed
to the police and was arrested.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:32.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His arrestors were determined

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get information concerning
the people he was helping.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police resorted to violence,

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beating him severely.

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of his love for his fellow Christians
and his love for God,

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman kept his lips sealed.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mister van Elburg
never revealed any names.

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the war that meant
signing your own death warrant.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not knowing what had happened
to her husband,

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lies van Elburg
went to the local police station.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While she was away,
the authorities raided their home.

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:10.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, the door flung open
and two men entered the room

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:13.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started moving things around.

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They pushed a table to one side,
pulled up the carpet,

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started looking under the floor.

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found all the literature we had hidden,

00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as clothing of brothers,

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which my father had hidden
in the cavity wall.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The authorities confiscated the literature
Herman had hidden in his home.

00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The literature found at his place
wasn’t his but that of his congregation,

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he never mentioned the names
of those who had brought it.

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That to me makes this very special.

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unwilling to waver in their determination

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:49.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect their fellow believers,

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:53.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman and Lies van Elburg
were both imprisoned.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together with my grandfather,

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I visited my mother.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to walk across the huge courtyard.

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were walking,

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suddenly heard, “Henny.”

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:16.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was my father,
and he gave me an apple.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the last I ever saw of my father.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, Herman and Lies

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were sent to concentration camps.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman was sent to Dachau.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lies was transferred

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Ravensbrück concentration camp.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While she returned home after a while,

00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:38.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman van Elburg did not.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:43.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died on February 17, 1943,

00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the age of 30,

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:48.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leaving behind
his bereaved wife and two children.

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:56.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Witnesses as a whole
were deeply impacted by the war.

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:59.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really strikes me is that they

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never considered themselves heroes.

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman was one

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of at least 132 Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Netherlands

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:10.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who died at the hands of the Nazi regime

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their belief in a better world

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the Kingdom of God.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they had to do to be freed

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to renounce their faith or,

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as in the case of Herman van Elburg,

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply provide names of fellow believers.

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:30.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To love your brothers
more than you love yourself

00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that really meant something to him.

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:35.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down to this very day,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray every day
that I may be just like them.

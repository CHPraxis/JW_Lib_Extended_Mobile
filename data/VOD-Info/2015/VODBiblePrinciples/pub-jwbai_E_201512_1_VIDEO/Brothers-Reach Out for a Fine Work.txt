00:00:05 They say that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body.
00:00:11 And I take good care of mine
00:00:14 —not a day without exercising.
00:00:19 And I do my best to stick to a spiritual routine too.
00:00:24 Oh, no, the meeting for field service!
00:00:27 I’ve got to get going.
00:00:30 By the way, my name is Ryan.
00:00:36 I’m glad I could work with Andrew this morning.
00:00:39 He’s always so well-prepared for the ministry.
00:00:43 You see, I’m not so good at starting conversations
00:00:47 with people I don’t know.
00:00:49 And then it’s great to have Andrew on your team.
00:00:52 He’s really good at that.
00:00:55 And once we’re done here,
00:00:57 I’m off into the woods for a long hike.
00:01:00 It’s, like, the only place I can recharge my batteries.
00:01:05 Andrew suggests that we first do some of my return visits.
00:01:11 Well, I’m afraid I don’t have any
00:01:15 —sorry, Andrew, maybe next weekend.
00:01:23 I like our meetings,
00:01:25 but I wish I’d prepared better.
00:01:30 Now the study is over, and again I couldn’t comment.
00:01:36 Man, I need to be at the cinema in ten minutes.
00:01:41 Oh, yeah! Thanks, Edgar!
00:01:44 My field service report.
00:01:46 My group overseer always has to remind me.
00:01:52 How come I always forget?
00:02:00 Andrew and I are good friends.
00:02:03 To be honest,
00:02:05 he seems to be the only friend I’ve got in our congregation.
00:02:10 Last week, he was appointed as a ministerial servant.
00:02:14 I’m not surprised at all.
00:02:17 He is  a great example,
00:02:19 especially for me.
00:02:22 I wonder why I haven’t qualified to be a ministerial servant?
00:02:32 Wow, Andrew is always busy for the congregation
00:02:36 —helping the friends,
00:02:38 taking care of our older brothers and sisters.
00:02:41 He really cares for them.
00:02:45 How come I never think of that?
00:02:49 That evening
00:02:51 Edgar and Martin, the assistant group overseer, came over.
00:02:55 They’ve noticed how hard I train to stay in good shape physically.
00:02:59 But am I working as hard to be in good shape spiritually?
00:03:04 Martin reminded me of 1 Timothy 3:1.
00:03:08 “This statement is trustworthy:
00:03:11 “If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,
00:03:14 he is desirous of a fine work.”
00:03:19 This principle applies to me,
00:03:22 since an overseer qualifies first as a ministerial servant.
00:03:26 The brothers asked me,
00:03:29 “How is the apostle Paul an example to someone
00:03:31 who’s ‘desirous of a fine work’?”
00:03:35 Paul strengthened the friends by giving encouraging talks.
00:03:39 He showed personal interest for the elderly,
00:03:42 for the fatherless boys,
00:03:47 and had a good share in the ministry.
00:03:55 The brothers were right.
00:03:58 Having a good share in the ministry gives so much happiness!
00:04:02 Edgar commended me for how I handled that last return visit.
00:04:06 Who knows, maybe I will conduct a Bible study soon!
00:04:13 I didn’t realize that we had so many nice friends in our congregation!
00:04:17 Perhaps I just didn’t give them a chance in the past.
00:04:21 I guess I had a spiritual routine before,
00:04:24 but I was too distracted by what I  wanted to do.
00:04:28 But there is so much I can do for others.
00:04:31 With better preparation,
00:04:33 I feel more comfortable giving comments.
00:04:36 And I was able to stand-in
00:04:38 for a part during the midweek meeting.
00:04:40 Martin gave me some great advice afterwards.
00:04:44 The apostle Paul worked hard,
00:04:46 gave to others, and reached out.
00:04:50 Following his example
00:04:53 gives me so much joy in life.
00:04:59 Now I realize what it really  means to reach out.
00:05:04 It’s all about being a spiritual man!

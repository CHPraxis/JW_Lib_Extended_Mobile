00:00:10 I love music.
00:00:13 When I sing,
00:00:17 I feel I can do or be anything;  it sets me free.
00:00:27 My classmates tell me  to pursue what I want,
00:00:30 and my teachers think
00:00:33 that I could have  a career doing what I love.
00:00:44 Wouldn’t it be  awesome to be
00:00:47 a famous musician  who is known by everyone?
00:01:05 I know I would  never leave Jehovah.
00:01:08 But would it be so wrong
00:01:10 to get my career sorted first,  and then serve Jehovah whole souled?
00:01:15 Now I have an offer  that can do that.
00:01:19 You see,  our family has never
00:01:22 had a lot of money,  and this could change everything.
00:01:26 We could be rich!
00:01:43 When I told dad  my plans
00:01:46 —how we could have  more money—
00:01:48 he was really grateful  I wanted to help.
00:01:54 He liked the idea  of using my talent.
00:01:57 But he also mentioned someone  who I had never thought about,
00:02:04 someone who had  many opportunities in life
00:02:07 and needed to make a choice —Moses.
00:02:13 Dad left me to think
00:02:15 about Hebrews chapter 11  verses 24 to 26,
00:02:21 “By faith Moses,  when grown up,
00:02:23 “refused to be called  the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
00:02:27 “choosing to be mistreated  with the people of God
00:02:30 “rather than to have  the temporary enjoyment of sin,
00:02:33 “because he considered  the reproach of the Christ
00:02:37 “to be riches greater than  the treasures of Egypt,
00:02:39 for he looked intently  toward the payment of the reward.”
00:02:46 Moses had it all.
00:02:49 Yet, he knew  that while living
00:02:53 in that Egyptian palace  he could never give Jehovah 100 percent.
00:02:57 There were  too many temptations
00:03:00 —idol worship,  spiritism, materialism.
00:03:03 He rejected  this lifestyle
00:03:07 and chose  to serve Jehovah.
00:03:10 Clearly, Moses made  the right career choice.
00:03:15 What would  my career be?
00:03:19 Even if I am successful,
00:03:22 is the dream that  they are selling me a reality?
00:03:26 Or will they throw me out as soon as  the next big thing comes along?
00:03:31 What are the risks —immorality, materialism?
00:03:36 Would I have the strength  to resist these?
00:03:41 What a change one scripture
00:03:44 and thinking things through  can make.
00:03:49 My teachers and classmates  may never
00:03:52 understand why I chose  not to pursue a career in music.
00:03:55 But that’s OK.
00:03:57 The career I chose  gives me
00:03:59 purpose and happiness now
00:04:02 and has an eternal future.
00:04:11 Now, instead of being  the only thing I do in life,
00:04:15 teaching music helps me  to support my career, pioneering.
00:04:25 My life is free of regret.
00:04:32 What career choice  will you make?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love music.

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:17.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I sing, 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel I can do or be anything; 
it sets me free.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
My classmates tell me 
to pursue what I want, 

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:33.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my teachers think 

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could have 
a career doing what I love.

00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:47.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t it be 
awesome to be 

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:49.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
a famous musician 
who is known by everyone?

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I would 
never leave Jehovah. 

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
But would it be so wrong 

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:14.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get my career sorted first, 
and then serve Jehovah whole souled?

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I have an offer 
that can do that. 

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, 
our family has never 

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a lot of money, 
and this could change everything. 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could be rich!

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I told dad 
my plans

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how we could have 
more money—

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:52.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was really grateful 
I wanted to help.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
He liked the idea 
of using my talent. 

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he also mentioned someone 
who I had never thought about, 

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who had 
many opportunities in life 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and needed to make a choice
—Moses.

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:15.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad left me to think 

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Hebrews chapter 11 
verses 24 to 26, 

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By faith Moses, 
when grown up, 

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:27.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“refused to be called 
the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“choosing to be mistreated 
with the people of God 

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
“rather than to have 
the temporary enjoyment of sin, 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because he considered 
the reproach of the Christ 

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be riches greater than 
the treasures of Egypt, 

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:43.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he looked intently 
toward the payment of the reward.”

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses had it all. 

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he knew 
that while living 

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that Egyptian palace 
he could never give Jehovah 100 percent. 

00:02:57.293 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were 
too many temptations

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
—idol worship, 
spiritism, materialism. 

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rejected 
this lifestyle 

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:10.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and chose 
to serve Jehovah. 

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Moses made 
the right career choice. 

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would 
my career be?

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if I am successful, 

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the dream that 
they are selling me a reality? 

00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or will they throw me out as soon as 
the next big thing comes along? 

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:36.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are the risks
—immorality, materialism? 

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:41.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would I have the strength 
to resist these?

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a change one scripture 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thinking things through 
can make.

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
My teachers and classmates 
may never 

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:55.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
understand why I chose 
not to pursue a career in music. 

00:03:55.952 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s OK. 

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
The career I chose 
gives me 

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:02.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
purpose and happiness now 

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:06.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has an eternal future.

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:15.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, instead of being 
the only thing I do in life, 

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
teaching music helps me 
to support my career, pioneering.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:29.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life is free of regret.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
What career choice 
will you make?

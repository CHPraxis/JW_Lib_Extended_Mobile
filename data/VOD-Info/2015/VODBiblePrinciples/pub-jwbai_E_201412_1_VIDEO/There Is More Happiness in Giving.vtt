I love my family very much.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:12.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we don’t have a lot,
we’re glad we have each other.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom works really hard to provide for us.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just the four of us.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all been feeling
just a little sad lately.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can tell she’s really tired
and worries a lot.

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:51.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to help out.

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I help
to get everyone ready for the meeting.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We seem to manage all right.

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But things are really hard.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the elders
could tell we were struggling.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They came to visit us.
They were so loving.

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really listened to Mom

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even read her some scriptures.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped her to see
that Jehovah still cared about all of us

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we still had the love
of the congregation to strengthen us.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell Mom felt a lot better afterward.

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At our next family worship,

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:10.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom read to us 2 Corinthians 8:1-4.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That story is about the Macedonians.

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom had us close our eyes
so we could imagine the scene.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the Macedonians were very poor,

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found happiness
by giving what they could to others.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:32.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even begged the apostles
for the opportunity to give.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we read Acts 20:35,

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“There is more happiness

00:02:49.118 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in giving than there is in receiving.”

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister said,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But we don’t have anything to give.”

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom said: “But we do.
We have ourselves.”

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It got us all thinking.

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom had a great idea.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent the rest of our family worship

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making special gifts
for the friends in our congregation.

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was pretty amazing!

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we don’t have a lot materially,

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is still so much we can give,

00:04:04.193 --> 00:04:08.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like putting a little in the contribution box
each week and helping to clean.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, sharing in the ministry

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the very best way we can give to others.

00:04:20.777 --> 00:04:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we are even closer as a family.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have learned that there
truly “is more happiness in giving.”

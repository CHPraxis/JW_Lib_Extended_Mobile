00:00:04 I love my family very much.
00:00:08 Even though we don’t have a lot, we’re glad we have each other.
00:00:18 Mom works really hard to provide for us.
00:00:22 It’s just the four of us.
00:00:34 We’ve all been feeling just a little sad lately.
00:00:43 I can tell she’s really tired and worries a lot.
00:00:49 I try to help out.
00:00:51 Sometimes I help to get everyone ready for the meeting.
00:00:55 We seem to manage all right.
00:01:02 But things are really hard.
00:01:14 I think the elders could tell we were struggling.
00:01:18 They came to visit us. They were so loving.
00:01:37 They really listened to Mom
00:01:41 and even read her some scriptures.
00:01:45 They helped her to see that Jehovah still cared about all of us
00:01:50 and that we still had the love of the congregation to strengthen us.
00:01:58 I could tell Mom felt a lot better afterward.
00:02:05 At our next family worship,
00:02:07 Mom read to us 2 Corinthians 8:1-4.
00:02:11 That story is about the Macedonians.
00:02:14 Mom had us close our eyes so we could imagine the scene.
00:02:19 Even though the Macedonians were very poor,
00:02:23 they found happiness by giving what they could to others.
00:02:28 They even begged the apostles for the opportunity to give.
00:02:42 Then we read Acts 20:35,
00:02:45 where it says: “There is more happiness
00:02:49 in giving than there is in receiving.”
00:02:51 My sister said,
00:02:53 “But we don’t have anything to give.”
00:02:56 Mom said: “But we do. We have ourselves.”
00:02:59 It got us all thinking.
00:03:05 Mom had a great idea.
00:03:24 We spent the rest of our family worship
00:03:26 making special gifts for the friends in our congregation.
00:03:55 It was pretty amazing!
00:03:58 Even though we don’t have a lot materially,
00:04:00 there is still so much we can give,
00:04:04 like putting a little in the contribution box each week and helping to clean.
00:04:10 And, of course, sharing in the ministry
00:04:12 is the very best way we can give to others.
00:04:20 Now we are even closer as a family.
00:04:29 And we have learned that there truly “is more happiness in giving.”

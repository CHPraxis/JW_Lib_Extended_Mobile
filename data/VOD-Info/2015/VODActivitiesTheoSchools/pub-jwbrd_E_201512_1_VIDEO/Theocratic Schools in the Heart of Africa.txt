00:00:02 Theocratic schools are equipping more and more
00:00:05 of our brothers and sisters with a strong spiritual foundation.
00:00:08 After graduation, they’re able
00:00:10 to fill needed assignments in the organization.
00:00:13 For example, the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:00:17 is training ones who make themselves available
00:00:19 to serve where the harvest is great —often within their own branch territory.
00:00:24 That’s the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
00:00:28 where over one million people attended last year’s Memorial
00:00:32 —that’s more than five times the number of publishers.
00:00:36 Because of this tremendous need in the field
00:00:39 and the lack of other facilities
00:00:41 to conduct theocratic schools and house the students,
00:00:44 an exception was made to have a dedicated school facility.
00:00:49 Now things are different after a busy renovation
00:00:52 and an exciting dedication program.
00:00:56 In the very heart of Africa lies the Democratic Republic of Congo
00:01:01 and the Republic of Congo.
00:01:03 Jehovah’s creation
00:01:05 brings praise to him.
00:01:07 However, the greatest shout of praise to Jehovah
00:01:09 comes from the more than 200,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:01:13 who are zealously preaching and teaching the good news of the Kingdom.
00:01:16 In our branch territory, over 40,000
00:01:21 were baptized in the last three years.
00:01:23 This means the formation
00:01:26 of many new congregations.
00:01:28 This accelerated growth
00:01:30 produces a need for more qualified brothers and sisters.
00:01:35 We needed a school facility that could satisfy this growing need.
00:01:39 Because of economic reasons
00:01:41 and the great number
00:01:42 of potential students in Congo,
00:01:44 the Governing Body made a loving exception
00:01:47 and decided that we could have a School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:01:50 with two classrooms.
00:01:52 We were so happy when we received the approval
00:01:55 to go ahead and renovate
00:01:57 some buildings located near Bethel.
00:01:59 International and local volunteers worked very hard
00:02:02 to renovate the buildings into a theocratic school complex that would bring praise
00:02:07 to Jehovah God.
00:02:10 This schools complex is unique
00:02:11 because it is an oasis of order
00:02:13 and cleanliness in an overcrowded city.
00:02:16 One day, a passerby got a glimpse of the school because the gates were left open.
00:02:20 He was so impressed
00:02:22 with the well-maintained buildings, the beautiful garden setting, and the sign
00:02:26 —Bible Schools Complex.
00:02:28 He came right in and asked if he could enroll in the school.
00:02:30 On January 17, 2015,
00:02:33 Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body
00:02:35 dedicated the complex to Jehovah
00:02:37 with the theme “Growth Praises Jehovah.”
00:02:40 I would never have thought
00:02:42 this could happen 15 years ago
00:02:44 —that a member of the Governing Body
00:02:45 would come to dedicate this building
00:02:48 that has been used for many things
00:02:50 but now, the pinnacle, a school.
00:02:53 We are very happy.
00:02:55 Jehovah is really the Creator.
00:02:57 Fifty-one students were invited from all over Congo
00:03:00 for the first and second classes of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:03:03 For many of the students,
00:03:06 it is the first time
00:03:07 to see a theocratic school facility or Bethel for that matter.
00:03:11 I couldn’t believe my eyes
00:03:14 when Jehovah granted me
00:03:16 one of the desires of my heart
00:03:18 —to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:03:22 At Isaiah 54:13,
00:03:25 the Bible says that every son
00:03:28 “will be taught by Jehovah.”
00:03:30 I felt very privileged to have been chosen by the Branch Committee
00:03:34 to learn more about Jehovah and his organization.
00:03:39 The students will never forget
00:03:41 that they enjoyed three good meals served to them graciously each day,
00:03:44 that their clothes were washed
00:03:46 and well pressed,
00:03:49 that they enjoyed a modern, air-conditioned classroom in the tropics
00:03:52 with computers and printers freely available for their use,
00:03:55 and also that they slept in safety at night in clean rooms.
00:03:59 Do you have the spirit of an evangelizer?
00:04:02 We believe that you do have it.
00:04:05 In general, secular school education can make people more proud.
00:04:11 This divine education helps the students
00:04:14 to be more humble and thus more useful in Jehovah’s hands.
00:04:18 I understand better now
00:04:20 how much Jehovah appreciates humble people,
00:04:24 but he opposes the proud.
00:04:27 I am a very small atom of dust,
00:04:30 so there is no need for me to think
00:04:33 I am better than someone else.
00:04:35 The training helped me
00:04:37 to look at myself honestly.
00:04:39 I discovered parts of my personality that I needed to improve.
00:04:44 My desire to serve others is stronger than ever.
00:04:47 I have the privilege to take care
00:04:51 of this school complex.
00:04:53 I saw the quality
00:04:54 of divine education with my own eyes.
00:04:56 Now I am motivated to try even harder
00:05:00 to make the experience pleasant for any future students
00:05:03 and thus bring praise to Jehovah.
00:05:06 It helped me to cherish my place in Jehovah’s organization
00:05:10 and to love Jehovah and my brothers and sisters even more.
00:05:15 The school helps the students
00:05:17 not just to help new ones
00:05:20 but also to work along with the other publishers
00:05:23 so that they also can progress
00:05:27 and stabilize in the faith.
00:05:30 I make an effort to share the training
00:05:33 with others in the congregation.
00:05:35 I like to encourage the young ones
00:05:38 to take up the pioneer service.
00:05:40 With the training I have received,
00:05:42 I now find it easier to approach anyone.
00:05:45 I am conducting several Bible studies,
00:05:48 and some of them are attending meetings.
00:05:50 The divine education that I received
00:05:53 helped me to have
00:05:55 a clearer understanding of the truth.
00:05:57 I am also much more effective in my ministry.
00:06:01 Deborah and Cathy were assigned
00:06:03 to a distant, isolated territory
00:06:06 1,500 kilometers (930 miles)
00:06:08 up the Congo River in northern Congo.
00:06:12 In the congregation,
00:06:13 the brothers were surprised
00:06:14 because they know that usually the school will send out brothers,
00:06:17 but it was two sisters.
00:06:19 But now they see that we help the congregation.
00:06:23 Yes,
00:06:25 we were very happy when our circuit overseer informed us that two sisters
00:06:28 were coming to our congregation.
00:06:30 We were very happy.
00:06:31 They encourage other sisters in the congregation;
00:06:34 also, they add enthusiasm to the congregation,
00:06:38 especially in the ministry.
00:06:42 The presence of these graduates in the various congregations has helped
00:06:47 to improve the quality of teaching
00:06:49 and has energized the preaching activity.
00:06:52 The benefits reach the far corners of Congo,
00:06:55 so that a great shout of praise is given to Jehovah.
00:07:00 What a blessing from Jehovah!
00:07:02 Every year, more than 200 brothers and sisters
00:07:05 can receive divine education from Jehovah
00:07:07 and then disperse this over the far-reaching territory of the Congo branch.
00:07:20 How encouraging it is to see
00:07:22 that the School for Kingdom Evangelizers in Congo
00:07:25 is now able to move forward with Jehovah’s blessing!

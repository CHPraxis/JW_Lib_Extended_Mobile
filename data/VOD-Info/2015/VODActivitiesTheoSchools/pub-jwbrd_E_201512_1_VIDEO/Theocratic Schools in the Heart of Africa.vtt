Theocratic schools
are equipping more and more

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters
with a strong spiritual foundation.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After graduation, they’re able

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fill needed assignments
in the organization.

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is training ones
who make themselves available

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:24.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve where the harvest is great
—often within their own branch territory.

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the situation
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where over one million people
attended last year’s Memorial

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s more than five times
the number of publishers.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of this tremendous need in the field

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lack of other facilities

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct theocratic schools
and house the students,

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:49.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an exception was made
to have a dedicated school facility.

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now things are different
after a busy renovation

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an exciting dedication program.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the very heart of Africa
lies the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Republic of Congo.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s creation

00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings praise to him.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the greatest shout
of praise to Jehovah

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes from the more than 200,000
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are zealously preaching and teaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:21.064 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In our branch territory, over 40,000

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were baptized in the last three years.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means the formation

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of many new congregations.

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This accelerated growth

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produces a need
for more qualified brothers and sisters.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a school facility
that could satisfy this growing need.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:41.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because of economic reasons

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:42.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the great number

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of potential students in Congo,

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body made a loving exception

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and decided that we could have
a School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:52.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with two classrooms.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so happy
when we received the approval

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go ahead and renovate

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some buildings located near Bethel.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
International and local volunteers
worked very hard

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to renovate the buildings into a theocratic
school complex that would bring praise

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This schools complex is unique

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:13.817 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because it is an oasis of order

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and cleanliness in an overcrowded city.

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:20.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a passerby got a glimpse of the
school because the gates were left open.

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was so impressed

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the well-maintained buildings,
the beautiful garden setting, and the sign

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Bible Schools Complex.

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:30.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came right in
and asked if he could enroll in the school.

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On January 17, 2015,

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.939 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.841 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
dedicated the complex to Jehovah

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the theme “Growth Praises Jehovah.”

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would never have thought

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:44.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this could happen 15 years ago

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:45.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—that a member of the Governing Body

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:48.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would come to dedicate this building

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:50.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has been used for many things

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:53.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now, the pinnacle, a school.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are very happy.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is really the Creator.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fifty-one students
were invited from all over Congo

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first and second classes
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For many of the students,

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:07.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it is the first time

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see a theocratic school facility
or Bethel for that matter.

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe my eyes

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah granted me

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the desires of my heart

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:25.255 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah 54:13,

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:28.191 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says that every son

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be taught by Jehovah.”

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:34.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very privileged to have been chosen
by the Branch Committee

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:39.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn more
about Jehovah and his organization.

00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The students will never forget

00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they enjoyed three good meals
served to them graciously each day,

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their clothes were washed

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and well pressed,

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they enjoyed a modern,
air-conditioned classroom in the tropics 

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with computers and printers
freely available for their use,

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also that they slept
in safety at night in clean rooms.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:02.825 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you have the spirit of an evangelizer?

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:05.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We believe that you do have it.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In general, secular school education
can make people more proud.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This divine education helps the students

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be more humble
and thus more useful in Jehovah’s hands.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.910 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I understand better now

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how much Jehovah appreciates humble people,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he opposes the proud.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:30.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am a very small atom of dust,

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so there is no need for me to think

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am better than someone else.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:37.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The training helped me

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:39.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to look at myself honestly.

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I discovered parts of my personality
that I needed to improve.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:47.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My desire to serve others
is stronger than ever.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have the privilege to take care

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this school complex.

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the quality

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of divine education with my own eyes.

00:04:56.612 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am motivated to try even harder

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the experience pleasant
for any future students

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus bring praise to Jehovah.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped me to cherish my place
in Jehovah’s organization

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to love Jehovah
and my brothers and sisters even more.

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The school helps the students

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just to help new ones

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:23.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to work
along with the other publishers

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they also can progress

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize in the faith.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I make an effort to share the training

00:05:33.983 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with others in the congregation.

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to encourage the young ones

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:39.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take up the pioneer service.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With the training I have received,

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now find it easier to approach anyone.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am conducting several Bible studies,

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them are attending meetings.

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.870 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The divine education that I received

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to have

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a clearer understanding of the truth.

00:05:57.874 --> 00:05:59.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am also much more effective
in my ministry.

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deborah and Cathy were assigned

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a distant, isolated territory

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1,500 kilometers (930 miles)

00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up the Congo River in northern Congo.

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:13.623 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation,

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:14.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the brothers were surprised

00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they know that usually
the school will send out brothers,

00:06:17.393 --> 00:06:19.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was two sisters.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now they see
that we help the congregation.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,

00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were very happy when our
circuit overseer informed us that two sisters

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.306 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were coming to our congregation.

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:31.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy.

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:34.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They encourage
other sisters in the congregation;

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also, they add enthusiasm
to the congregation,

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the ministry.

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The presence of these graduates
in the various congregations has helped

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve the quality of teaching

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:52.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has energized the preaching activity.

00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:55.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The benefits reach the far corners of Congo,

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that a great shout of praise
is given to Jehovah.

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing from Jehovah!

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:05.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every year,
more than 200 brothers and sisters

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:07.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can receive divine education from Jehovah

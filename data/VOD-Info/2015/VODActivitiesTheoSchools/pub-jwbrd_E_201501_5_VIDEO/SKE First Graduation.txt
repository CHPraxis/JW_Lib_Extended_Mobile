00:00:12 I’m Joy Allen, and I’m a single sister,
00:00:14 and I’m in the first class
00:00:16 of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:00:27 We’re just thrilled at the idea of being invited.
00:00:30 Now, when they raised the age limit
00:00:32 and allowed us to apply,
00:00:34 we were just so thrilled.
00:00:39 Well, with the schools, we’ve seen constant refinement
00:00:42 —from MTS
00:00:43 to BSCC to now the School
00:00:46 for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:00:47 It’s become much more visual.
00:00:49 We have historic presentations to help them with their spiritual heritage.
00:00:54 We have workshops that help them to see
00:00:57 how to really carry out their ministry properly.
00:01:01 I feel better equipped
00:01:04 to be a Kingdom evangelizer.
00:01:06 Jehovah has really sat us down
00:01:08 and showed us how to do it.
00:01:11 So now I would like to express that genuine care for people as well,
00:01:15 and just be patient and, at the same time, be bold like Jehovah is.
00:01:21 I am so happy that single sisters
00:01:23 are being accepted to attend this school.
00:01:26 It is an amazing privilege
00:01:28 being able to see so many different aspects
00:01:30 of Jehovah’s personality with different class discussions.
00:01:34 Of course, this helped me as an evangelizer.
00:01:36 I feel the urgent need to really go and preach.
00:01:41 Being selected to the first class of SKE
00:01:44 was really, really amazing to me.
00:01:48 Jehovah was listening to my prayers,
00:01:50 and he said, “OK, you can come.”
00:01:58 Living with our host family has been like a home away from home.
00:02:01 It’s amazing how quickly
00:02:03 you can feel like you’re family
00:02:05 with somebody that you just met.
00:02:07 And they’ve gone out of their way to make us feel comfortable
00:02:09 and make sure that we have what we need
00:02:12 so we could study and get the most out of the course.
00:02:14 But it’s just been nice to also have a friendship along the way.
00:02:21 I was nervous and anxious
00:02:24 because of English
00:02:26 not being my first language.
00:02:29 But all those worries, you know,
00:02:32 went away immediately.
00:02:35 The instructors are really loving and caring;
00:02:37 and classmates are cheering for each other, supporting each other;
00:02:42 and Jehovah helped me through every step.
00:02:46 Proverbs 16:16
00:02:48 —the essence of it says
00:02:50 that wisdom and understanding are better than silver and gold.
00:02:53 And the students came to school rich;
00:02:57 they had gold.
00:02:59 Some of them got it because they were raised in the truth—it was handed to them.
00:03:02 Some gold they gleaned
00:03:04 from some surface study.
00:03:07 But what SKE did for the students
00:03:09 was that it taught them
00:03:11 how to mine for gold.
00:03:13 So when they leave the school,
00:03:17 they are delving into the Bible
00:03:19 as they have never dug into it before,
00:03:22 and that will sustain them in any assignment they are given.
00:03:29 Oh, the students are ready for their assignments, no doubt about that.
00:03:33 They are anxious to get to the field.
00:03:36 They really want to get out there and apply what they have learned.
00:03:40 They want to “do the work of an evangelizer”
00:03:43 and “fully accomplish [their] ministry.”
00:03:54 We welcome you to class number one
00:03:58 of the revised curriculum, and the name has been changed
00:04:01 to School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:04:05 which includes single brothers and sisters.
00:04:09 And this class has some single sisters along with the couples.
00:04:12 So this is some history here.
00:04:15 I would recommend this school to anyone
00:04:17 who is in a position to accept it.
00:04:19 It will strengthen your bond with Jehovah and with your brothers and sisters.
00:04:22 And it’s a beautiful gift
00:04:25 and provision that he has made for all of us.
00:04:27 A school like this is evidence
00:04:30 (and we have almost a dozen schools functioning
00:04:35 that are educating Jehovah’s Witnesses)
00:04:37 that we’re big about education, but it’s divine education.
00:04:45 One thing we’ve learned is
00:04:48 that Jehovah can bless more than we can sacrifice.
00:04:51 SKE is a beautiful manifestation of Jehovah’s desire
00:04:55 to bless each and every one of us.
00:04:56 I highly encourage it.
00:04:59 Stay grateful for the privilege you’ve enjoyed,
00:05:02 and set a good example.
00:05:04 Prove to yourselves that you’re better ministers
00:05:06 than when you got here a couple of months ago
00:05:10 and that you’re better citizens of the Kingdom now
00:05:13 because of your divine education.
00:05:15 First Corinthians 8:1 really helped us to see that this world today
00:05:20 may offer things, but “knowledge puffs up.”
00:05:22 “Love builds up” in this course.
00:05:25 We’re built up; we’re built up.
00:05:28 So I would say, “If you want, come be built up by Jehovah.”

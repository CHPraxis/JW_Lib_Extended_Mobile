I’m Joy Allen, and I’m a single sister,

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:16.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I’m in the first class

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just thrilled
at the idea of being invited.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, when they raised the age limit

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and allowed us to apply,

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:36.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were just so thrilled.

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with the schools,
we’ve seen constant refinement

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:43.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from MTS

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to BSCC to now the School

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:47.297 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s become much more visual.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have historic presentations
to help them with their spiritual heritage.

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have workshops that help them to see

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to really carry out
their ministry properly.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel better equipped

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:06.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be a Kingdom evangelizer.

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has really sat us down

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed us how to do it.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now I would like to express
that genuine care for people as well,

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just be patient and,
at the same time, be bold like Jehovah is.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:23.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so happy that single sisters

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are being accepted to attend this school.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is an amazing privilege

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being able to see
so many different aspects

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:34.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s personality
with different class discussions.

00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:36.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this helped me as an evangelizer.

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel the urgent need
to really go and preach.

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:44.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being selected to the first class of SKE

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really, really amazing to me.

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was listening to my prayers,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “OK, you can come.”

00:01:58.568 --> 00:02:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living with our host family
has been like a home away from home.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing how quickly

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:05.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you can feel like you’re family

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:07.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with somebody that you just met.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ve gone out of their way
to make us feel comfortable

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make sure that we have what we need

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:14.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could study
and get the most out of the course.

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:19.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s just been nice
to also have a friendship along the way.

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was nervous and anxious

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.729 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because of English

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not being my first language.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all those worries, you know,

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went away immediately.

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:37.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The instructors are really loving and caring;

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and classmates are cheering for each other,
supporting each other;

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah helped me through every step.

00:02:46.316 --> 00:02:48.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:16

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.320 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the essence of it says

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wisdom and understanding
are better than silver and gold.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the students came to school rich;

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had gold.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them got it because they were raised
in the truth—it was handed to them.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some gold they gleaned

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from some surface study.

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:09.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what SKE did for the students

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that it taught them

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to mine for gold.

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:17.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they leave the school,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are delving into the Bible

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:22.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they have never dug into it before,

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that will sustain them
in any assignment they are given.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, the students are ready
for their assignments, no doubt about that.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:35.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are anxious to get to the field.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really want to get out there
and apply what they have learned.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to “do the work of an evangelizer”

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “fully accomplish [their] ministry.”

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We welcome you to class number one

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:01.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the revised curriculum,
and the name has been changed

00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:09.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which includes single brothers and sisters.

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this class has some single sisters
along with the couples.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is some history here.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:17.607 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would recommend this school to anyone

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:19.642 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who is in a position to accept it.

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will strengthen your bond with Jehovah
and with your brothers and sisters.

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a beautiful gift

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provision
that he has made for all of us.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A school like this is evidence

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we have almost
a dozen schools functioning

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are educating Jehovah’s Witnesses)

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re big about education,
but it’s divine education.

00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing we’ve learned is

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can bless
more than we can sacrifice.

00:04:51.507 --> 00:04:55.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
SKE is a beautiful manifestation
of Jehovah’s desire

00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bless each and every one of us.

00:04:56.612 --> 00:04:59.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I highly encourage it.

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:02.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay grateful
for the privilege you’ve enjoyed,

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:04.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and set a good example.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prove to yourselves
that you’re better ministers

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than when you got here a couple of months ago

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you’re better citizens
of the Kingdom now

00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your divine education.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 8:1
really helped us to see that this world today

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may offer things,
but “knowledge puffs up.”

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Love builds up” in this course.

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re built up;
we’re built up.

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would say, “If you want,
come be built up by Jehovah.”

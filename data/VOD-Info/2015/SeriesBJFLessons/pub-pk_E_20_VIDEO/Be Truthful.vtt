00:00:12.437 --> 00:00:13.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, nothing.

00:00:16.687 --> 00:00:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, do you know why
Jehovah wants us to tell the truth?

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:30.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Telling the truth
is like building a bridge with your friends.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you lie, they can’t believe you.

00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:38.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they might not want to be your friend.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Dad, what if it’s not such a big lie?

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All lies are bad, even little ones.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One lie leads to another,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cause much harm.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember who told the first lie?

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan?

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Jesus?

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he ever lie?

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who do you want to be like?

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be like Jesus.

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:06.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, my son.

00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:08.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened there?

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:10.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I broke it.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an accident.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I crashed my plane.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for telling the truth.

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:18.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time something like this happens,

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:19.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should you do?

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell the truth.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:23.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can I tell Mom that I’m sorry?

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:25.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good idea.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go do that right now,

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll pick up the broken pieces.

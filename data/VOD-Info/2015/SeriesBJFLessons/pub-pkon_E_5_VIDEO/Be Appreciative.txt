00:00:06 Dear Mom and Dad, Here’s a card to let you know
00:00:13 You’re the best parents I could have, And I want to tell you so.
00:00:21 You get up early ev’ry day To get the fam’ly out the door.
00:00:29 There are about a million things That I’d like to thank you for.
00:00:37 You teach me ev’ry day To live Jehovah’s way,
00:00:45 And you show me how In all you say and do.
00:00:53 Mom and Dad, I really love you.
00:00:57 Ev’rything I’ve said is true. I thank Jehovah I’ve got you.

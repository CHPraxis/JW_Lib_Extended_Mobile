Children, Jehovah wants you
to be happy and keep you safe,

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some people want to do bad things to you.

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah gives you a conscience.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like an alarm system

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:22.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps you to know right from wrong.

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will protect you from danger.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:27.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Mommy and I
will help you test your alarm system.

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:28.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ready?

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if someone tells you something

00:00:31.312 --> 00:00:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes you feel uncomfortable or scares you?

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:35.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do?

00:00:35.312 --> 00:00:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure, but that’s weird.

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop!”

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:43.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell them to stop it,
and you tell Mommy and Daddy.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what someone tells you,

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never keep a secret from us.

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:51.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if they ask you to do something

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes you feel uncomfortable?

00:00:55.312 --> 00:00:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say, “No!”

00:00:57.104 --> 00:01:00.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right, you should say, “No!” and walk away.

00:01:01.604 --> 00:01:04.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if they try to touch you
where they shouldn’t?

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t let them!

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:07.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d get out of there!

00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:08.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, Caleb.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if it’s an adult you know and trust,

00:01:11.687 --> 00:01:13.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should say, “No!” and run away.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you should yell,

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop doing that!
I’m gonna tell on you.”

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop doing that!
I’m gonna tell on you.

00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world can be a scary place,

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you are never alone.

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:29.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you have your conscience,

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:31.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your mom and dad who love you,

00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:34.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have Jehovah.

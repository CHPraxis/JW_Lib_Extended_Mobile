So, kids, what did you learn at the meeting tonight?

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:36.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No sleeping at the meeting.

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:38.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no playing at the meeting.

00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good!

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we pay attention at the meetings?

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine if Noah didn’t pay attention

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah explained how to build the ark.

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:05.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not what happened, Dad!

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right!

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He paid attention, and it saved his life.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paying attention at the meetings
can help save your life!

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“And Noah did according
to all that God had commanded him.

He did just so.”

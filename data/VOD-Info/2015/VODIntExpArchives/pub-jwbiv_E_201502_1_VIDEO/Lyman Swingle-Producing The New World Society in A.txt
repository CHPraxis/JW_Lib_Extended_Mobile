00:00:01 Think back for a moment
00:00:02 on how Jehovah supported
00:00:03 his organization in ancient times.
00:00:06 One example is Bezalel.
00:00:09 Do you remember him?
00:00:11 Jehovah appointed him to make furnishings for the tabernacle.
00:00:15 That’s quite a responsibility.
00:00:17 But what experience did Bezalel have?
00:00:20 His last job was making bricks in Egypt.
00:00:24 While it is possible that he had some other skills,
00:00:27 how would he accomplish something as grand as the tabernacle?
00:00:31 Exodus chapter 35 teaches us that it was Jehovah
00:00:35 who gave Bezalel the wisdom
00:00:37 and the understanding to do the work.
00:00:40 Jehovah’s earthly organization today faces similar challenges.
00:00:44 The brothers who took the lead in setting up our first printery
00:00:48 had no prior experience,
00:00:50 and the same applies to the brothers who produced our very first video.
00:00:54 You will enjoy this archive interview with Brother Lyman Swingle,
00:00:59 who was part of that very first video team.
00:01:02 Brother Swingle was later appointed as a member of the Governing Body
00:01:05 until he finished his earthly course in 2001.
00:01:10 The headquarters of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society
00:01:14 —a center of new world action.
00:01:16 We were given instructions, “Well, why not make
00:01:19 “a film of world headquarters and what we do here,
00:01:23 and show it in film.”
00:01:26 Well, I thought it was a great idea myself,
00:01:28 because I was interested in photography.
00:01:31 “Bethel” means the “House of God.”
00:01:34 How many people would like to visit here but don’t have the opportunity?
00:01:38 Let them see what the New World Society is in action
00:01:43 because, I think, a tour through this place
00:01:46 will give them the concept of the whole organization.
00:01:49 They appointed a team of three
00:01:53 to write a script,
00:01:54 so they put this script together.
00:01:57 Just across the East River from all of this . . .
00:01:59 There was a brother in Hollywood
00:02:02 who was connected with the film industry.
00:02:06 He was sort of an amateur photographer,
00:02:10 and he was around them all the time and knew their techniques.
00:02:14 It’s like many of the other things that the Society does;
00:02:16 they don’t have professionals to do it.
00:02:18 No, most are brought in here, and they learn.
00:02:23 Maybe they have a brother like this brother who came here
00:02:27 and knew some of the basics.
00:02:31 We went over to New York and rented the lights
00:02:36 and much of the equipment that was necessary.
00:02:39 All he did was bring his camera here.
00:02:42 At his desk, the Society’s president, Brother Knorr . . .
00:02:45 We thought, well, it would be best to start with the president’s office
00:02:50 and work down through copy
00:02:52 —following the copy through its various processes.
00:02:57 We all work together for one purpose.
00:03:00 Someone does one thing, and someone does something else.
00:03:02 Some work in the Treasurer’s Office;
00:03:05 some have to be president;
00:03:07 some have to be dishwashers and serve food.
00:03:11 So it’s like the organs in the body.
00:03:15 Paul said:
00:03:17 ‘The hand can’t say to the foot, “I have no need of you.”’
00:03:20 We all need everyone.
00:03:22 Here is the publication of the New World Society.
00:03:26 Jehovah has fed us through its pages, and he will continue to do so.
00:03:30 After they shot it, well, it had run longer,
00:03:34 taking longer than they expected.
00:03:36 It got into the time of the convention, and the brother said, “Oh!”
00:03:39 He said: “Why don’t we take the convention and put it on here too?
00:03:44 Why don’t we do it in color?”
00:03:47 Color in those days was really something,
00:03:50 and that even gave the film a much bigger boost
00:03:55 since they’d been looking at black and white,
00:03:57 and then suddenly they get a burst of color for the convention.
00:04:03 They had the trailer camp
00:04:05 (where everybody camped out there)
00:04:08 at Yankee Stadium, and all of that was shown in color.
00:04:11 That really made a real climax to that picture
00:04:15 because you weren’t used to seeing color except in the big theaters.
00:04:21 In the evening, the students told of life at Gilead
00:04:23 and entertained us with a pleasant program of songs from their native lands.
00:04:28 There were some very trying moments,
00:04:31 wondering whether it was ever going to be completed.
00:04:34 Because after we shot it
00:04:36 (the brother that shot it was going to edit it too),
00:04:42 something came up in his life, and he couldn’t do it.
00:04:46 Now, we’re stuck. What are we going to do?
00:04:50 So then the decision was made: “Well, let’s do it ourselves.
00:04:55 “We have never done it before,
00:04:57 but we will tackle it and see what we can do.”
00:04:59 We got a lab over in New York, and we made a deal with them:
00:05:04 “Look, we’ll give you the business to duplicate these
00:05:08 “if you take somebody over there
00:05:11 and show them how to edit this thing.”
00:05:13 So for a few weeks, I went over there.
00:05:19 It’s like any project here, every job here.
00:05:22 For the average Bethelite when he comes in
00:05:24 —he doesn’t know anything about running a press
00:05:28 or washing dishes or anything else —we teach him.
00:05:31 So that was just another job.
00:05:33 You learn how to do it.
00:05:35 Amazing things, these.
00:05:37 But it is Jehovah’s spirit that makes them possible.
00:05:40 It is his work, not man’s.
00:05:43 After we filmed the original, we started editing it.
00:05:47 We saw there were some gaps in the film,
00:05:50 not smooth dissolves from one department to another.
00:05:55 And the brother had gone away,
00:05:58 so we rented
00:06:02 a camera again and lights and so on.
00:06:04 And we came back and did it all on our own —the brothers here.
00:06:08 We filled in some gaps so we could go
00:06:13 from one scene to another scene real smooth.
00:06:18 In one of those scenes, it shows
00:06:20 how you get the paper from the docks up to the pressroom.
00:06:25 So we had a scene where they’re rolling the paper off the truck
00:06:29 right into the camera,
00:06:31 and then the next scene shows
00:06:33 a roll of paper being rolled onto the press.
00:06:37 That made a nice transition
00:06:39 from the docks, where the paper comes in, to the pressroom.
00:06:44 And there were some others like that that we filled in later.
00:06:48 It was a complement to Jehovah’s people,
00:06:51 putting out something like that back in those days.
00:06:54 It illustrates that you don’t have to go off to college
00:06:57 and get a high education to do something
00:07:01 if Jehovah’s spirit is upon it and blesses the project.
00:07:06 Many people have benefited from it.
00:07:10 It often, in my mind, throws me back to what the brothers did
00:07:13 when they made the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”
00:07:16 They too were amateurs at it.
00:07:19 But, my goodness, look at the final product!
00:07:22 But this one was really the only film, I think, the Society made
00:07:27 where they planned out a script, wrote the script,
00:07:30 and then followed through on shooting it and editing it
00:07:33 and producing it themselves.
00:07:37 It’s the same way today.
00:07:38 When the Society undertakes something,
00:07:41 they strike out in open space and start flying.
00:07:46 They never flew before,
00:07:48 and maybe they have a few crash landings along the way,
00:07:51 but they pick themselves up
00:07:54 and get back up flying again.
00:07:57 The New World Society is indeed in action.
00:08:01 I think it’s another example
00:08:03 of how the Society has used technology
00:08:08 and various features
00:08:10 to further the advertising of the King and the Kingdom
00:08:13 all down through the years.

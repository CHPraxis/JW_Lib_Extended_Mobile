00:00:07 In one way or another, each person that I see
00:00:12 Is diff’rent in their own way, not ev’ryone’s like me.
00:00:16 They come in diff’rent colors, and some can’t run or walk.
00:00:21 Some speak another language or use their hands to talk.
00:00:25 But when I give a greeting, I start to see how it can be.
00:00:33 I see them smile; we both feel happy, ‘Cause they’re a lot like me.
00:00:42 Jehovah loves all sorts of people; He’s always good to you and me.
00:00:51 Let’s be like him and welcome others To join Jehovah’s family.

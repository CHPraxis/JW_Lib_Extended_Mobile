In one way or another,
each person that I see

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is diff’rent in their own way,
not ev’ryone’s like me.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:21.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They come in diff’rent colors,
and some can’t run or walk.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some speak another language
or use their hands to talk.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I give a greeting,
I start to see how it can be.

00:00:33.812 --> 00:00:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see them smile; we both feel happy,
‘Cause they’re a lot like me.

00:00:42.812 --> 00:00:51.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves all sorts of people;
He’s always good to you and me.

00:00:51.312 --> 00:01:00.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be like him and welcome others
To join Jehovah’s family.

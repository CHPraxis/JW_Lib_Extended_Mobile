I like to listen
to older ones

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And learn
from friends like you.

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love
when you talk about

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ev’rything
that you’ve been through:

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:28.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the places
you have seen

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:32.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who you helped
along the way

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how you
served so faithfully

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:40.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in your
younger days.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you were young
you gave your best

00:00:43.562 --> 00:00:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looked for ways
of doing good,

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can see
that now you’re glad

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:55.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did
what you could.

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:59.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to listen
to older ones

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:02.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And show them
honor too.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope someday
when I grow up,

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I
can be like you.

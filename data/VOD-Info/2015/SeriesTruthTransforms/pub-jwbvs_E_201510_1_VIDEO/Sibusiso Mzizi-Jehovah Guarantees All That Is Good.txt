00:00:01 For some, living a life dedicated to God
00:00:04 meant giving up something they loved to do
00:00:07 but that demanded their full attention.
00:00:10 We met a brother in South Africa
00:00:12 who had to decide what would be his life’s devotion.
00:00:16 What factors led him to make the better choice?
00:00:22 I love soccer very much.
00:00:24 It was one thing that gave me pleasure.
00:00:26 Growing up in Newcastle
00:00:28 in the township of Osizweni
00:00:30 was quite a nice experience.
00:00:32 As kids (young boys) playing soccer on the streets
00:00:36 with bare feet, using bricks as goal posts,
00:00:39 and playing right till after sunset
00:00:42 —even at school, playing at lunch breaks—
00:00:44 playing soccer was like culture for us.
00:00:53 I couldn’t see anything else better than soccer.
00:00:55 I ended up representing the province
00:00:58 and then played for the Youth National Teams representing the country
00:01:03 and then got chosen to play professional soccer
00:01:06 with one of the local clubs.
00:01:08 And then eventually
00:01:09 I went overseas to play in different tournaments
00:01:11 in countries like Belgium,
00:01:13 Netherlands, France, and Germany.
00:01:40 I had fun at the time and enjoyed it, you know, because it’s something
00:01:43 that you grow up hoping to achieve.
00:01:45 Then, when it does happen, it makes you happy
00:01:49 and proud of yourself and, of course, your family is proud,
00:01:52 your community,
00:01:54 everyone who worked hard in getting you there.
00:02:00 While I was on holiday from soccer, I went over to visit my brother,
00:02:03 who was studying the Bible with the Witnesses.
00:02:06 I asked him about it.
00:02:08 He explained to me —basically, preached to me—
00:02:11 and he took me to my first meeting.
00:02:13 I was amazed to see so much emphasis in the Bible
00:02:18 and to look at young kids
00:02:21 who knew how to look up the scriptures.
00:02:23 I didn’t know the Bible,
00:02:25 although I had been going to church all my life.
00:02:27 And seeing the love at the Kingdom Hall there
00:02:30 just made me realize that there was something in this,
00:02:33 and I had to look closely to see what it was.
00:02:37 Deep personal study,
00:02:39 Bible reading,
00:02:41 and meditation helped me realize that,
00:02:44 hey, Jehovah requires that I put him first
00:02:47 and that professional soccer requires the same thing
00:02:50 —full dedication.
00:02:51 What now?
00:02:52 I must say, deciding to quit professional soccer
00:02:55 and serve Jehovah more fully was not an easy decision
00:02:59 because I knew what it would involve
00:03:02 —disappointing my whole family, relatives,
00:03:04 friends, my whole community,
00:03:06 the whole country,
00:03:08 people who were very close to me, who really loved me.
00:03:13 With a professional sport, soccer,
00:03:15 or any career in this world, there are no guarantees, you know.
00:03:19 And with Jehovah, everything is guaranteed as long as we put him first.
00:03:22 And I realized that I had to make a decision:
00:03:27 to quit professional soccer and put Jehovah to the test
00:03:30 and “taste and see that [he] is good.”
00:03:33 And, of course, coming to Bethel was a special privilege,
00:03:35 because here
00:03:37 you give Jehovah everything you have every day.
00:03:41 And that’s where I met my wife
00:03:44 —thanks to coming to full-time service.
00:03:46 Meeting someone who is very supportive of me, who loves Jehovah primarily,
00:03:51 who loves me
00:03:54 and having a teammate like that is a wonderful blessing.
00:03:57 Working in the sign-language field
00:03:59 is a special blessing also.
00:04:02 Here you’re teaching deaf people the truth.
00:04:06 It’s a quiet world for them,
00:04:09 and here they see you as a hearing person,
00:04:13 and they can see you’ve worked hard to learn the language.
00:04:15 And you introduce them to Jehovah in a special way.
00:04:21 You see them growing in the truth,
00:04:23 despite being deaf, and understanding that Jehovah understands sign language
00:04:27 —he understands their language.
00:04:29 You see them growing in appreciation
00:04:31 and even accepting that they’re deaf
00:04:33 not because of Jehovah; and they understand why they’re deaf,
00:04:37 and they come to understand
00:04:39 why others have disabilities.
00:04:41 And to see them being happy in their lives
00:04:43 for a change thanks to the truth,
00:04:45 I’m grateful that I chose to play for Jehovah’s team,
00:04:49 because in the world
00:04:51 the very same people
00:04:52 that you play with on the same team (your teammates)
00:04:56 you’re competing with all the time;
00:04:58 you’re always competing to be chosen;
00:05:00 you’re fighting for positions.
00:05:02 And you come to this side in the organization
00:05:07 being with fellow brothers and sisters,
00:05:10 and we don’t compete for Jehovah’s approval.
00:05:12 Jehovah appreciates each and every one of us.
00:05:19 Success in this world can look like security,
00:05:23 but Brother Mzizi realized only Jehovah can secure our everlasting future.
00:05:29 Instead of accepting a high-paying contract in professional soccer,
00:05:33 he took the path that enabled him to “let [his] light shine” in the ministry
00:05:38 and for ten years in Bethel service.

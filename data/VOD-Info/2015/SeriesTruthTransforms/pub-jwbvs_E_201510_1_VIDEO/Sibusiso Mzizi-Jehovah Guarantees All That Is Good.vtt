For some, living a life dedicated to God 

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant giving up something they loved to do 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that demanded their full attention.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:12.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met a brother in South Africa

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had to decide
what would be his life’s devotion.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What factors led him
to make the better choice?

00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love soccer very much.

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:26.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one thing that gave me pleasure.

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:28.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in Newcastle

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the township of Osizweni

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was quite a nice experience.

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:36.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As kids (young boys)
playing soccer on the streets

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with bare feet, using bricks as goal posts, 

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and playing right till after sunset

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even at school, playing at lunch breaks—

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing soccer was like culture for us.

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t see anything else
better than soccer.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I ended up representing the province 

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then played for the Youth National Teams
representing the country

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:06.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then got chosen
to play professional soccer

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one of the local clubs.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then eventually

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went overseas
to play in different tournaments

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in countries like Belgium,

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Netherlands, France, and Germany.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had fun at the time and enjoyed it,
you know, because it’s something

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:45.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you grow up hoping to achieve.

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:49.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, when it does happen,
it makes you happy 

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and proud of yourself
and, of course, your family is proud,

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your community,

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who worked hard
in getting you there.

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I was on holiday from soccer,
I went over to visit my brother,

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was studying the Bible
with the Witnesses.

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:08.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him about it.

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explained to me
—basically, preached to me—

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he took me to my first meeting.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was amazed to see
so much emphasis in the Bible

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to look at young kids

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who knew how to look up the scriptures.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know the Bible,

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:27.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although I had been going
to church all my life.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing the love
at the Kingdom Hall there

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just made me realize
that there was something in this,

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to look closely to see what it was.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep personal study,

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible reading, 

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditation helped me realize that,

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hey, Jehovah requires that I put him first

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that professional soccer
requires the same thing

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—full dedication.

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What now?

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must say, deciding to quit
professional soccer

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serve Jehovah more fully
was not an easy decision

00:02:59.562 --> 00:03:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I knew what it would involve

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—disappointing my whole family, relatives,

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friends, my whole community,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole country,

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:11.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who were very close to me,
who really loved me.

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a professional sport, soccer,

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or any career in this world,
there are no guarantees, you know.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with Jehovah, everything is guaranteed
as long as we put him first.

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that I had to make a decision:

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to quit professional soccer
and put Jehovah to the test

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “taste and see that [he] is good.”

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, coming to Bethel
was a special privilege,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:37.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you give Jehovah
everything you have every day.

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:44.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where I met my wife

00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thanks to coming to full-time service.

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:51.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meeting someone who is very supportive of me,
who loves Jehovah primarily,

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who loves me

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having a teammate like that
is a wonderful blessing.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working in the sign-language field

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a special blessing also.

00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you’re teaching deaf people the truth.

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a quiet world for them,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here they see you as a hearing person,

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can see
you’ve worked hard to learn the language.

00:04:15.772 --> 00:04:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you introduce them
to Jehovah in a special way.

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see them growing
in the truth,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being deaf, and understanding
that Jehovah understands sign language

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he understands their language.

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see them growing in appreciation

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even accepting that they’re deaf

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not because of Jehovah;
and they understand why they’re deaf,

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they come to understand

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:41.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why others have disabilities.

00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:43.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to see them being happy in their lives

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a change thanks to the truth,

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m grateful that I chose to play
for Jehovah’s team,

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in the world

00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very same people

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you play with on the same team
(your teammates)

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re competing with all the time;

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re always competing to be chosen;

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re fighting for positions.

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you come to this side
in the organization

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being with fellow brothers and sisters,

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we don’t compete for Jehovah’s approval.

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah appreciates each and every one of us.

00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Success in this world can look like security,

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Brother Mzizi realized only Jehovah
can secure our everlasting future.

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of accepting a high-paying contract
in professional soccer,

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:38.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he took the path that enabled him
to “let [his] light shine” in the ministry

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for ten years in Bethel service.

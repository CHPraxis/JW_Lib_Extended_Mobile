00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
American motorcycles were my passion.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d make them louder,

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faster,

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lots of chrome.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just the bike.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a great American sports car;

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a brand new house; I had a good job.

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, I had the American dream,

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had a great life!

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was always looking for fun,

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I always seemed to find it!

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I thought I had everything,

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was still something missing.

00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Vietnam War was brewing, was raging.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were dying, and it really bothered me.

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was six years old,

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my aunt, who’d just become a Witness,

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she showed me this book,

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a picture inside I remember so well.

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of Armageddon.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that scares a little kid!

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘I don’t want to be there,’

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a few pages later there’s a picture

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Paradise.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:12.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never forgot it, and I always thought,

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:15.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I wanted to be there someday.’

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Maybe my aunt has something.

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:18.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have I got to lose?’

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I called her and said, “Send over some Witnesses.”

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had a couple of studies with the brother,

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it didn’t really make sense yet,

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my lifestyle hadn’t changed.

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:33.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 21, riding my motorcycle,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing about 75 miles an hour,

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because speed limits were for wimps,

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I hit a parked truck.

00:01:40.316 --> 00:01:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I nearly died

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:46.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, I now use this to walk.

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two days prior I actually had Witnesses over,

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then my aunt invited me to a special talk

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
given by the Watch Tower Society’s president

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:58.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in San Francisco,

00:01:58.034 --> 00:01:59.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said, “OK, I’ll see.”

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well you gotta remember, at this time,

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the drug culture was in full swing

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was part of my life too.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I partied,

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:10.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got home after 2:00 a.m.,

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I tried something—I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “If you’re real,

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if this is true, get me up in the morning.”

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at 6:00 a.m. I woke up.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:22.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not sleep, and I thought,

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is really weird,’

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I thought, ‘I better go!’

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went with my aunt to this function,

00:02:29.332 --> 00:02:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought, ‘If nothing else,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll just check out the chicks!’

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, I was 21.

00:02:34.838 --> 00:02:37.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what I found when I got there?

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody paid attention.

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brother said turn to a scripture,

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they all turned to that scripture.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a unified group of harmony;

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that I always wanted.

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made rapid changes in my life.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I soon qualified

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go out in the public preaching.

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:56.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after that I was baptized,

00:02:56.526 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and six months later

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:00.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started in the full-time ministry.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so for over 40 years now,

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I have enjoyed this work

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of going door to door

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teaching others the Bible.

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:09.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1998,

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:11.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was dignified with the opportunity

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as the apostle Paul did

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—visiting and encouraging congregations.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the chance to do that

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different parts of the United States

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a traveling overseer.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So really I’ve gone from a life

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of pursuit of happiness

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:28.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never found it.

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:30.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to make it happen, but it wasn’t there.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:32.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I have a life of purpose,

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a family worldwide,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I have a secure future.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s better than that?

Some accuse the Bible of being
a collection of myths

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and legends written
by well-intentioned humans.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
By contrast, the Bible says

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is “the word of God,”
“who cannot lie.”

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the Bible was authored by God,

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
it should be like no other book ever written.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
when it mentions scientific matters,

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
what it says should be in harmony
with proved science.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it foretells the future, its prophecies 

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
should come true 100 percent of the time.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if the Bible contains
God’s message to mankind,

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
it should be available
no matter where a person lives

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no matter what is done
to stop its distribution.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:58.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the Bible full of myths,
or is it accurate?

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider just some of the evidence

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating that the Bible is truly

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
an extraordinary and trustworthy book.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the time when the Bible was written,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people had mistaken ideas

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the shape of the earth.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
A theory written
after the Bible was completed

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that the universe emerged
from a cosmic egg

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:26.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the earth
was supported by various creatures.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast, about the year 1473 B.C.E.,

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses wrote that the earth
is suspended “upon nothing.”

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
And around the year 732 B.C.E.,

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:43.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth
is a circle, or sphere.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
These Bible writers contradicted ideas

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were popular at the time.

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:52.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was some 200 years after Isaiah’s day

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more than 3,000 years passed

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Moses’ writings until scientists
such as Isaac Newton

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
realized that the earth seemed
to hang upon nothing.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:17.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
No human can foretell
the future in exact detail.

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, about the year 732 B.C.E.,

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Isaiah foretold
that a man named Cyrus

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
would conquer the mighty city of Babylon,

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would “dry up” a river,

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he would enter the city
through open gates.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
History confirms that every detail

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this prophecy was fulfilled.

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Concerning the same city,
the prophet Jeremiah

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
foretold that Babylon
would “become piles of stones”

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “never again be inhabited.”

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:51.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite its strategic location,
Babylon eventually became

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
a pile of stones and remains that way!

00:02:56.572 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout history, powerful men

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
have tried to stop the distribution
or translation of the Bible.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
They burned at the stake
those who translated it

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
into common languages
and persecuted those who read it.

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible has weathered the most 
sustained attack of any book in history.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:23.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, it has become the most widely translated
and published book of all time.

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Billions of copies have been produced

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some 2,700 languages.

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is scientifically accurate,

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
contains reliable prophecy,

00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:36.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is available to all mankind.

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have good reason to believe
that it is inspired by Jehovah,

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God who cannot lie.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, you may ask:
‘Is the Bible still relevant today?

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:53.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why are there so many
different versions of the Bible?

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are the keys
to understanding the Bible?’

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:04.014 line:90% position:50% align:center

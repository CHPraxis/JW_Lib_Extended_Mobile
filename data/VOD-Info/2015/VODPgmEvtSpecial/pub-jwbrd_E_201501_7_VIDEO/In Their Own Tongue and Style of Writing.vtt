Imagine living in a world

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.857 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
without any Bible

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:12.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—no knowledge of Jehovah or Jesus Christ,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.831 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:18.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no understanding of why we’re here

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or where we’re going.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you feel?

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:28.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just like the apostle Paul told
the Ephesians when he said:

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You had no hope

00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [you] were without God in the world.”

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bethelite told me
that when he reads these words,

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it sends a chill through him.

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes him feel stone cold.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can be thankful

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:52.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t live in a world
where Jehovah is unknown.

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t live in that world,
but billions of people do.

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to invite you
to turn your Bibles, please,

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Isaiah chapter 60.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what we’re going to see
is that the Bible does foretell a time

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the world would be in darkness.

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:16.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 60,
and we’re going to start with verse 1:

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Arise, O woman,

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“shed light, for your light has come.

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The glory of Jehovah shines on you.

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For look! darkness will cover the earth

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and thick gloom the nations;

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but on you Jehovah will shine,

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and on you his glory will be seen.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nations will go to your light

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kings to your shining splendor.”

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did the world

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to be filled with so much darkness?

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that from the beginning,
Satan tried to snuff out worship of Jehovah.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he probably figured
that if the world was going to be dark,

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could keep it that way

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by destroying either Jehovah’s people

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Jehovah’s Word

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:15.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or preferably both.

00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has shown
that he’s in full control of matters.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:21.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says here in these verses

00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would raise up his “woman”

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:27.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that “nations [would] go
to [this] light.”

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we think of nations,
we think of various countries,

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cultures, customs,

00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:36.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and languages.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it only stands to reason

00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:42.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in order for these nations
to be attracted to this light,

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would need to understand the message.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:48.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would need to be made available to them
in their language.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah has shown
that it’s easy for him to do this.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can bring the message to people
in their own language.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to look at an example.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is in Acts 2,

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:05.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at the account here

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some of the things
that took place at Pentecost

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:15.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts 2.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to start reading
with verse 3:

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And tongues as if of fire
became visible to them

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were distributed,

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and one came to rest on each one of them,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they all became filled with holy spirit

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and started to speak in different languages,

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:43.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as the spirit enabled them to speak.

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time devout Jews
from every nation under heaven

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were staying in Jerusalem.

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when this sound occurred,

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a crowd gathered and was bewildered,

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because each one heard them speaking
in his own language.

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, they were utterly amazed and said:

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘See here, all these who are speaking
are Galileans, are they not?

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How is it, then, that each one of us

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is hearing his own native language?’”

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then down to verse 11:

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We hear them speaking in our languages

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:22.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“about the magnificent things of God.’

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, they were all

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“astonished and perplexed,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying to one another:
‘What does this mean?’”

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know that what happened here

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in contrast to what Jehovah did
at the Tower of Babel,

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:40.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there, people were banding together
in rebellion against him,

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did something about it
to stop that rebellion.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:48.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He erased the knowledge of the language
that they knew before

00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave them a new language.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here in this case at Pentecost,

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that Jehovah did not erase
the language that they knew before;

00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:58.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he just gave them a new one.

00:04:59.816 --> 00:05:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was Jehovah’s purpose here?

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jehovah choose this miracle

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:09.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he had gathered all of these devout Jews
together in Jerusalem?

00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, these devout Jews
probably knew Greek

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and attended the synagogue.

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew the lessons of the Messiah,

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but these scriptures tell us

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were bewildered,

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“utterly amazed,” “astonished,”

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“perplexed” at what they were hearing.

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:34.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This word “astonished” in verse 12

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the same Greek word
that is used in Luke (the 8th chapter)

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jairus’ twelve-year-old daughter
was resurrected.

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 56 tells us

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:48.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “her parents were beside themselves.”

00:05:48.865 --> 00:05:51.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very strong word.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why did these people
have such a strong reaction?

00:05:55.071 --> 00:05:57.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look back at verse 8:

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How is it, then, that each one of us

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is hearing his own native language?”

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to take a look
at the footnote, and it says:

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or ‘the language of his birth.’”

00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see, this wasn’t
the language of education for them.

00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the language of the womb.

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:23.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the language
that their moms spoke to them in.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that scientists tell us
that language development starts in the womb

00:06:28.104 --> 00:06:30.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that newborns just a couple of days old

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are already crying
in the rhythm of the language

00:06:35.578 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve been hearing
for the last three months

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their mother’s womb.

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:42.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s interesting
that Jehovah chose the language

00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they started learning in the womb.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made a very deep impact on them.

00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah did this;

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wanted to make this deep emotional impact

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they would go back home

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “every nation under heaven”

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never ever in their lifetime

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forget what they saw and heard
there at Pentecost.

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they would spread
the good news about this

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all of the people where they went.

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:15.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we learn from this
is that Jehovah has power over language.

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had used it before,
and he would use it again.

00:07:19.755 --> 00:07:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we said before that one of Satan’s goals

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be to try to destroy Jehovah’s people.

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re going to take a look at some events

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that show examples of this.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to invite you, please,
to turn to the back of your Bibles

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Appendix B9.

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:47.917 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll see some maps there,

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:48.784 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and please look

00:07:48.784 --> 00:07:53.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the upper right-hand corner of the page.

00:07:53.256 --> 00:07:54.423 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going to see

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:55.825 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the gray, shaded area

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:59.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is the vast Medo-Persian Empire.

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:04.500 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, while you’re looking at that map,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.468 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I want to just read

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:08.004 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the first two verses of Esther:

00:08:09.105 --> 00:08:11.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Now in the days of Ahasuerus,

“in those days

“when King Ahasuerus was sitting

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on his royal throne in Shushan the citadel,”

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and you see that right just about

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:46.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of the map.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:47.243 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So this creates the setting

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.278 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for these verses that we’re going to read.

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:52.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to invite you
to turn your Bibles now

00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Esther the third chapter,

00:08:55.885 --> 00:09:00.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to start reading at verse 6.

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know the story of Esther.

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:05.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:09.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Haman was furious.

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:11.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s start reading in verse 6:

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he [Haman]

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:18.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“despised the thought
of doing away with Mordecai alone,

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for they had told him
about Mordecai’s people.

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Haman began seeking to annihilate

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the Jews
who were in the entire realm of Ahasuerus,

00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:33.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Mordecai’s people.”

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:35.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then verse 8:

00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:37.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Haman then said to King Ahasuerus:

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘There is a certain people

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:44.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘scattered and dispersed among the peoples
in all the provinces of your realm,

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘whose laws are different
from those of all other peoples;

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they do not obey the king’s laws,

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and it is not in the king’s interests
to let them be.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it pleases the king,
let a decree be written

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that they be destroyed.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will pay 10,000 silver talents
to the officials

00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put into the royal treasury.’”

00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see that his lies and deception

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
misled the king

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he said “a certain people.”

00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t say who.

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:18.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They do not obey the king’s laws.”

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:20.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a lie.

00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he said
that “they [should] be destroyed.”

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 11, King Ahasuerus said:

00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do with them as you see fit.”

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue our reading in verse 12:

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The king’s secretaries were then called

00:10:35.318 --> 00:10:38.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the 13th day of the first month.

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:42.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They put in writing all of Haman’s orders
to the king’s satraps,

00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the governors who were over the provinces,

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:46.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the princes of the different peoples,

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:50.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to each province in its own script

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to each people in its own language.

00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[They wanted to get the word out.]

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was written
in the name of King Ahasuerus

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and sealed with the king’s signet ring.

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The letters were sent by means of couriers
to all the king’s provinces,

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“giving the order to annihilate,

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:15.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to kill, and to destroy all the Jews,

00:11:15.157 --> 00:11:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“young and old alike, children and women,

00:11:17.727 --> 00:11:20.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on a single day,
on the 13th day of the 12th month,

00:11:20.863 --> 00:11:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is, the month of Adar,

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to seize their possessions.”

00:11:26.135 --> 00:11:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, this message “Kill the Jews!”
went viral,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it meant death
for all of Jehovah’s servants.

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:38.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their goal was complete annihilation.

00:11:38.914 --> 00:11:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’ve learned
that Haman was a descendant of Agag.

00:11:43.052 --> 00:11:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was likely seeking revenge

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah had decreed
the eventual extermination of the Amalekites,

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Agag was one of them.

00:11:53.229 --> 00:11:55.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what we read here in the book of Esther

00:11:55.231 --> 00:12:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds us of what we read
in the book <i>God’s Kingdom Rules,</i>

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a nice account on page 93

00:12:02.738 --> 00:12:05.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our Brother Zacharie Elegbe.

00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he talks about the ban

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Jehovah’s Witnesses in Benin.

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what he says:

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In 1976,

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when we had 2,300 publishers,

00:12:20.523 --> 00:12:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our work was banned

00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:25.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the government ordered
the ban to be broadcast

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in every local language.

00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That was unheard of.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though Benin’s population
speaks more than 60 languages,

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:39.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“radio programs back then
were usually broadcast

00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:41.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in only five.”

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, in both cases here,

00:12:44.947 --> 00:12:48.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they feared the spread of Jehovah’s people.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to ensure success, they felt like
they had to get the message out

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everyone in their language.

00:12:53.656 --> 00:12:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did it work?

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what our brother continues to relate:

00:13:00.963 --> 00:13:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘When the ban was broadcast

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘in <i>all</i>  local languages,

00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:09.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘many thousands of people
living in remote areas

00:13:09.672 --> 00:13:12.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘heard of us for the very first time.

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They wondered,

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:18.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses,
and why are they banned?”

00:13:18.314 --> 00:13:20.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Later, when we reached those areas,

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“many accepted the truth in short order.’

00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Today, there are more than 11,500 Witnesses

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Benin.”

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, their plan backfired.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their intent was to stop God’s people,

00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:40.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it ended up helping our brothers
spread the good news.

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not what they intended.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s go back to the book of Esther,

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to start again
in chapter 8.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Esther risked her life
to approach the king.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She exposed Haman’s plot to kill the Jews.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haman was killed.

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was hanged on a stake.

00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:10.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since the king’s decree

00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not be revoked,

00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:14.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he allowed a new command to be written

00:14:14.737 --> 00:14:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would cancel out the documents
that Haman sent,

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:19.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first ones that went out.

00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did these new documents say?

00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start reading in Esther 8:11:

00:14:28.884 --> 00:14:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In these documents
the king granted permission

00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the Jews in all the different cities

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to gather together and defend their lives

00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to annihilate, kill, and destroy

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:45.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“any forces of any people or province
that might attack them,

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:48.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“including women and children,

00:14:48.337 --> 00:14:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to seize their possessions.”

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the scriptures tell us
that “the Jews defeated

00:14:53.842 --> 00:14:55.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[all of] those who hated them. . . .

00:14:55.544 --> 00:14:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a man could stand against them.”

00:14:58.347 --> 00:15:02.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also killed the ten sons of Haman

00:15:02.384 --> 00:15:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 75,000 others who hated them.

00:15:07.723 --> 00:15:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice who this second order was sent to.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to verse 9:

00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the secretaries of the king
were summoned

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:19.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at that time in the third month,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is, the month of Sivan,

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:24.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the 23rd day,

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they wrote all that Mordecai commanded
to the Jews,

00:15:27.443 --> 00:15:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as well as to the satraps, the governors,
and the princes of the provinces

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:35.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from India to Ethiopia,

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“127 provinces,

00:15:37.987 --> 00:15:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to each province in its own script

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or as the footnote says,
in their own “style of writing”]

00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:52.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to each people in its own language

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:57.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the Jews
in their own script and language.”

00:15:57.306 --> 00:16:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we think of
when we think of this word “script”?

00:16:00.576 --> 00:16:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the picture here.

00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have symbols and characters
that are recognizable to us

00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(our alphabet in English),

00:16:10.586 --> 00:16:12.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s basically the same
in Spanish, French,

00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:15.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Western European languages.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have accents and extra dots.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:21.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, basically, all of these are considered
the Roman script.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course, there are others,
such as Cyrillic

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(that’s used by Russia
and the former Soviet Republics),

00:16:29.038 --> 00:16:31.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Korean, Chinese.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are main language families—Arabic.

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it appears
that this decree in the book of Esther

00:16:36.445 --> 00:16:39.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was translated into scores of languages

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many different scripts,

00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:46.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they recognized that for everyone
to comprehend the message

00:16:46.488 --> 00:16:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to act on it,

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it had to be made available to them
in their language.

00:16:50.893 --> 00:16:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, it meant life for the Jews

00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:57.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the survival of the whole Jewish race.

00:16:57.232 --> 00:17:00.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about what the result
would have been

00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:05.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had this satanic plot been successful.

00:17:05.007 --> 00:17:07.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that the events in the book of Esther

00:17:07.576 --> 00:17:12.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concluded by about the year 475 B.C.E.

00:17:12.581 --> 00:17:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just imagine if at that point

00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:18.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s servants had been killed.

00:17:18.353 --> 00:17:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that after that:

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no Jewish race,

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:28.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no walls of Jerusalem rebuilt in 455 B.C.E.,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no book of Malachi written,

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:34.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no Greek Scriptures recorded,

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no seed of Abraham,

00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:39.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no Messiah.

00:17:39.274 --> 00:17:41.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we be?

00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:48.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This second message of life that went out

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to supersede that first message of death
that went out.

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It couldn’t get to one person less.

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine if you were
one of the condemned ones

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you were living
in the mountains of Tajikistan.

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important would it be to you

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that everyone in your town

00:18:09.538 --> 00:18:13.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually understood the message?

00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:17.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we want to get from this is
that when it comes to saving people’s lives

00:18:17.813 --> 00:18:21.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ensure
they are going to act on the message,

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:24.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it needs to come to them
in their own language and script.

00:18:24.787 --> 00:18:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we saw from what we read in Pentecost,

00:18:27.756 --> 00:18:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is perfectly capable
of delivering that.

00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when it comes to this message of life,

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will do anything he can

00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:43.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to block it, to destroy it.

00:18:43.672 --> 00:18:45.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some examples of this.

00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:50.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn your Bibles
to Jeremiah 36.

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:55.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Jehovah told Jeremiah

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to write in a scroll

00:18:59.021 --> 00:19:01.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a message of warning to the people

00:19:01.523 --> 00:19:06.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jerusalem was going to be destroyed
unless they changed their ways.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this message in the scroll

00:19:08.063 --> 00:19:11.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was later read to King Jehoiakim.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehoiakim didn’t like what he heard.

00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he cut the scroll into pieces,
and he threw them into the fire.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, was that the end of Jehovah’s word?

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start reading

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 36:28,

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah told Jeremiah:

00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:36.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take another scroll

00:19:36.024 --> 00:19:40.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and write on it all the same words
that were on the first scroll,

00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which King Jehoiakim of Judah burned up.”

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:44.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then down to verse 32:

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jeremiah then took another scroll

00:19:46.969 --> 00:19:50.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah,
the secretary,

00:19:50.572 --> 00:19:55.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and at Jeremiah’s dictation
he wrote on it all the words of the scroll

00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that King Jehoiakim of Judah
had burned in the fire.

00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many more words like those were added.”

00:20:05.654 --> 00:20:10.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see that it turned out exactly
as Jehovah foretold.

00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:14.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 17 years later,
Jerusalem was destroyed,

00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of the rulers were killed,
the people were taken as exiles into Babylon.

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:23.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the message that was in that scroll
that Jehoiakim threw into the fire

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as all the circumstances
surrounding that event

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were recorded here in the book of Jeremiah
and are preserved till our day.

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to look at another example,

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d like to invite you
to turn to the back of your Bible again.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to look at Appendix A3.

00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:47.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know
that centuries after Jeremiah’s time,

00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:50.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus came as “the light of the world.”

00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:52.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did say

00:20:52.701 --> 00:20:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an ‘enemy would plant weeds
among the wheat.’

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:01.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that enemy is the Devil.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul also spoke about the apostasy.

00:21:04.947 --> 00:21:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re going to read something here.

00:21:07.249 --> 00:21:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking at Appendix A3, you’ll see
in the middle of the page a subheading,

00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:15.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Copyists Preserve God’s Word.”

00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:17.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then count to the third paragraph,

00:21:17.993 --> 00:21:21.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one that begins with
“What about the 27 books . . . ?”

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the middle of the paragraph
is Colossians 4:16;

00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:27.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to start reading
right after that:

00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Despite attempts

00:21:29.338 --> 00:21:33.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by Roman Emperor Diocletian and others

00:21:33.642 --> 00:21:36.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to destroy all . . . Christian literature,

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:40.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thousands of ancient fragments
and manuscripts

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:44.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been preserved until our day.”

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:50.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, who was this Roman Emperor Diocletian?

00:21:50.325 --> 00:21:53.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he’s someone who started

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vicious persecution against Christians

00:21:56.365 --> 00:21:59.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the year 303 C.E.,

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it lasted for about eight years.

00:22:01.203 --> 00:22:04.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his goal to eradicate Christians.

00:22:04.573 --> 00:22:07.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the first things he did
was that he decreed

00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the copies of their Scriptures
be destroyed

00:22:10.278 --> 00:22:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he took it for granted
that every Christian community,

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever they were,
had a collection of holy books

00:22:16.018 --> 00:22:18.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were vital for their survival.

00:22:18.453 --> 00:22:23.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his men hunted high and low
for these books,

00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:26.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they burned them publicly
in the marketplaces.

00:22:26.461 --> 00:22:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The persecution was intense and barbaric,

00:22:31.033 --> 00:22:35.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many Christians were maimed and killed.

00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very difficult time

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:40.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so difficult that this time period

00:22:40.108 --> 00:22:43.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ended in 311 C.E.

00:22:43.478 --> 00:22:46.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is called, even by secular historians,

00:22:46.214 --> 00:22:49.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “great persecution.”

00:22:49.418 --> 00:22:52.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s actually
what happened right after this

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:55.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that catapulted Christianity into darkness.

00:22:55.457 --> 00:22:59.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in 312 C.E.,
Constantine marched on Rome,

00:22:59.995 --> 00:23:03.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he eventually became the emperor.

00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:07.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the first things that he did
was that he officially ended the persecution,

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:11.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he gave back
the property to the Christians,

00:23:11.773 --> 00:23:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he gave them special privileges.

00:23:14.009 --> 00:23:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can just imagine
this was a sweet victory for Christians.

00:23:17.712 --> 00:23:21.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They welcomed Constantine with open arms.

00:23:21.116 --> 00:23:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Constantine surrounded himself
with Christians,

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:27.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he called them “brothers.”

00:23:27.189 --> 00:23:30.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to unify
all the people in his realm

00:23:30.058 --> 00:23:33.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under one universal religion.

00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:34.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even wrote a letter to everyone

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that they
should all become Christians.

00:23:38.567 --> 00:23:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we know
that pagan customs and celebrations

00:23:44.573 --> 00:23:47.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were given Christian names.

00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:52.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Christian elders were given the clothing,

00:23:52.214 --> 00:23:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the status, the salary,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the prestige of the pagan priests.

00:23:59.387 --> 00:24:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, not all of the Christians,
but very many of them,

00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
welcomed Constantine.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They embraced his intervention,
and they even praised him and said,

00:24:08.163 --> 00:24:11.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are an angel sent from God

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:14.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our protection.”

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these Christians also embraced
the masses of unconverted pagans

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who flooded into Christianity.

00:24:20.775 --> 00:24:23.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, they called themselves “Christians,”

00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were not
genuine disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These Christians considered Constantine
a Christian, but he wasn’t one.

00:24:33.622 --> 00:24:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was still officially

00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the high priest of Roman paganism,

00:24:39.127 --> 00:24:43.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he took it upon himself
to appoint and remove church leaders.

00:24:43.298 --> 00:24:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the year 325 C.E.,
when there was a big dispute

00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:51.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about whether God and Jesus
are the same person,

00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:54.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they held this council at Nicaea,

00:24:54.676 --> 00:24:58.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in came the Christians
—some of them maimed and scarred

00:24:58.813 --> 00:25:02.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all those years of persecution.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was actually Constantine

00:25:05.387 --> 00:25:09.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who proposed the wording and said,

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God and Jesus

00:25:11.493 --> 00:25:14.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are of the same substance.”

00:25:14.896 --> 00:25:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he said that,
many of them were just gasping.

00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:21.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said, “Inspired!”

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fell for it.

00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:29.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what laid the foundation
for the Trinity doctrine,

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which came a few years later.

00:25:31.046 --> 00:25:34.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you see, it wasn’t the force 
of Diocletian and the “great persecution”

00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was so effective.

00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:38.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t conquer the Christians,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was the embrace of the world
that made them fall.

00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:44.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One writer

00:25:44.826 --> 00:25:47.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likened it to a great judo throw.

00:25:47.762 --> 00:25:49.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “You see, in judo,

00:25:49.764 --> 00:25:52.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you don’t have to be bigger or stronger
than your opponent;

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you just have to push,

00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:57.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he pushes back.

00:25:57.906 --> 00:26:02.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And when he pushes,
you pull and you flip him.

00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:06.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And it’s his weight and his strength
that sends him,

00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:08.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s amazing how far he will go.”

00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:11.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Diocletian pushed on the church,

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Constantine did the pull and the throw,

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:17.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the church crashed to the ground

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:20.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that a century later,
it wasn’t even recognizable

00:26:20.395 --> 00:26:22.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the Christianity that we know,

00:26:22.397 --> 00:26:25.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because by then,
Christians were characterized

00:26:25.367 --> 00:26:28.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their violence, their bloodshed,

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their political intrigue and envy.

00:26:30.972 --> 00:26:34.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostasy was truly entrenched.

00:26:34.075 --> 00:26:37.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this darkness was so great

00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:40.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this control by Rome and the church

00:26:40.915 --> 00:26:45.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to be known as the Dark Ages.

00:26:45.186 --> 00:26:47.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we know what happened after that.

00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For centuries the Inquisition, the Crusades

00:26:51.493 --> 00:26:55.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these Christians who were persecuted

00:26:55.463 --> 00:26:58.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became the persecutors.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:01.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how bad is it when even the world

00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:06.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calls the influence of the church “darkness”?

00:27:07.242 --> 00:27:09.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Isaiah 60:2 said

00:27:09.377 --> 00:27:13.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “darkness [would] cover the earth.”

00:27:13.348 --> 00:27:15.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another way to restrict the Bible

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be to limit it
to just one or two languages.

00:27:19.587 --> 00:27:22.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that’s exactly
what this church did.

00:27:22.257 --> 00:27:26.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For centuries, they forbid church services

00:27:26.061 --> 00:27:28.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in any other language besides Latin

00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:30.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forbid Bible translation.

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:34.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you had a Bible,
you could be sent to prison for life

00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:37.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or burned at the stake for doing so.

00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:40.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this routine continued for centuries,

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because well into the 1900’s,

00:27:43.345 --> 00:27:47.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Catholic priests
were still confiscating Bibles

00:27:47.215 --> 00:27:49.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and burning them.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:52.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that all of these attacks failed.

00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reason why they were

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as successful as King Jehoiakim was

00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:00.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he tried to destroy Jehovah’s Word

00:28:00.261 --> 00:28:04.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because the Bible tells us at Isaiah 40:8:

00:28:04.899 --> 00:28:09.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that it’s only
because of Jehovah’s intervention,

00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:16.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because from the very, very beginning

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:19.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the very first scrolls were written,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah commanded that copies be made.

00:28:22.817 --> 00:28:27.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And professionals
—skilled scribes and copyists—

00:28:27.088 --> 00:28:29.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made these copies.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these early scrolls
were translated into other languages.

00:28:32.894 --> 00:28:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the first century,
the apostles used

00:28:35.864 --> 00:28:38.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Greek Septuagint Bible.

00:28:40.368 --> 00:28:45.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also know that Jehovah protected
the integrity of the message itself.

00:28:45.206 --> 00:28:49.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know this
because we can look at manuscripts

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are just a few hundred years old,

00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:55.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can compare them
with oldest known manuscripts

00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:59.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Dead Sea Scrolls,
some of which are more than 2,000 years old.

00:28:59.421 --> 00:29:00.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we compare them, we see

00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is no difference in meaning
between them.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The differences in wording
are very, very minor.

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that gives us confidence
that the contents of the Bible

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:18.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not changed from the very beginning.

00:29:18.206 --> 00:29:22.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s interesting is that these scrolls,
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:29:22.243 --> 00:29:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were right there in a cave in plain sight

00:29:25.447 --> 00:29:27.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land of Israel

00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:30.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for hundreds and hundreds of years.

00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:32.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the way until 1947,
they weren’t discovered.

00:29:32.487 --> 00:29:35.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why were they not discovered
during all those years

00:29:35.123 --> 00:29:38.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of hunting down and destroying
Jehovah’s Word?

00:29:38.493 --> 00:29:42.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, his protection is evident.

00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:44.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was Jehovah who would ensure

00:29:44.966 --> 00:29:49.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible would go on to become
the most widely translated

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:52.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and most widely distributed document
in history,

00:29:52.507 --> 00:29:55.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because parts of the Bible exist

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:58.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in nearly 2,700 languages.

00:29:58.646 --> 00:30:01.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see
Jehovah has been victorious in this.

00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:06.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know it’s the Bible that is the key

00:30:06.621 --> 00:30:09.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help people to learn about God

00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:12.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to learn to love him, to serve him,

00:30:12.327 --> 00:30:17.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn about the blessings
of living forever in his Kingdom

00:30:17.332 --> 00:30:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the Kingdom good news.

00:30:18.867 --> 00:30:23.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Jesus said
would be “preached in all the inhabited earth

00:30:23.204 --> 00:30:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:30:26.508 --> 00:30:29.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the end [would] come.”

00:30:29.811 --> 00:30:33.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible also tells us
that as we get closer to the end,

00:30:33.381 --> 00:30:36.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life will be very, very difficult.

00:30:36.217 --> 00:30:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People would be “lovers of themselves,
. . . blasphemers,

00:30:40.355 --> 00:30:43.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“disobedient . . . ,
without love of goodness,

00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:47.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

00:30:47.562 --> 00:30:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how would the King be able to raise up

00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:55.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an army of preachers during these last days

00:30:55.503 --> 00:30:58.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be willing to preach the good news?

00:30:58.606 --> 00:31:01.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells us what his plan was.

00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:04.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn, please,
to Malachi the 3rd chapter

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:13.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Malachi 3:1.

00:31:13.755 --> 00:31:17.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah speaking: “‘Look!

00:31:17.625 --> 00:31:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am sending my messenger

00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[his anointed ones],

00:31:23.998 --> 00:31:26.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and he will clear up a way before me.

00:31:26.534 --> 00:31:30.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And suddenly the true Lord [Jehovah],

00:31:30.538 --> 00:31:33.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘whom you are seeking,
will come to his temple;

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the messenger of the covenant
[Jesus Christ] will come,

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:40.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘in whom you take delight.

00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:41.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:31:41.082 --> 00:31:45.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will certainly come,’
says Jehovah of armies.”

00:31:45.587 --> 00:31:49.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is telling us that his messenger
would be on the scene

00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:53.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well before Christ’s presence,
clearing up the way.

00:31:53.595 --> 00:31:56.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s history that tells us,
that shows us,

00:31:56.531 --> 00:32:01.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was just one small group
of faithful ones active at that time

00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:06.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who stood out
as the one and only genuine Christians

00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:11.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had the privilege of shaking off

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:13.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the legacy that was handed to them,

00:32:13.414 --> 00:32:16.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the layers and layers of false teachings

00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:18.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated with the Bible.

00:32:18.953 --> 00:32:22.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning, they were so few
and things were not clear.

00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:25.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
strengthened them organizationally,

00:32:25.627 --> 00:32:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cleansed them spiritually,

00:32:27.996 --> 00:32:31.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he equipped them to preach the good news

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:36.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make genuine disciples.

00:32:36.037 --> 00:32:39.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus made it very clear
what their role would be,

00:32:39.474 --> 00:32:41.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Matthew 24:45.

00:32:41.776 --> 00:32:46.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that he would have
a “faithful and discreet slave”

00:32:46.014 --> 00:32:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would appoint him “over his domestics,

00:32:48.316 --> 00:32:53.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give them their food at the proper time.”

00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:55.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this faithful slave knows

00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that much is at stake
—people’s lives—

00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:03.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because their commission is the same

00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:07.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as what Jesus told the apostle Paul
his commission was

00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:10.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus appeared to him and blinded him,

00:33:10.438 --> 00:33:13.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Acts 26:17, 18.

00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:16.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told him: “I am sending you

00:33:16.978 --> 00:33:19.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to open their eyes,

00:33:19.614 --> 00:33:23.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to turn them from darkness to light

00:33:23.284 --> 00:33:27.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from the authority of Satan to God,

00:33:27.655 --> 00:33:30.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they may receive forgiveness of sins

00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:35.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an inheritance among those sanctified
by their faith in me.”

00:33:35.863 --> 00:33:39.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just like in the days of Esther,

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful slave understands

00:33:41.836 --> 00:33:44.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have a message of life

00:33:44.972 --> 00:33:48.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that must be given ‘to each people

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in its own language and in their own script.’

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, was this too difficult
for Jehovah to accomplish

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this small group of Witnesses?

00:33:59.587 --> 00:34:02.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could they possibly do it?

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:06.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s as Jesus said:
“With men this is impossible,

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:11.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with God all things are possible.”

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:15.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so today, what we see
is that the good news is being preached

00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:20.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in every nation under heaven.

00:34:20.408 --> 00:34:24.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s being translated
into more than 700 languages.

00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:26.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the eyes of the world,

00:34:26.314 --> 00:34:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is being accomplished
by Jehovah’s organization

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an impossibility.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes, maybe even we feel

00:34:35.256 --> 00:34:37.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s an impossibility.

00:34:37.291 --> 00:34:41.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be overwhelmed
by all that’s being produced

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results that are being had.

00:34:44.132 --> 00:34:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is Jehovah’s view on this?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles, please,

00:34:48.102 --> 00:34:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Zechariah 8,

00:34:57.044 --> 00:34:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah 8,

00:35:00.648 --> 00:35:05.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read
starting with verse 6:

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:09.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:35:09.857 --> 00:35:12.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Although it may seem too difficult

00:35:12.326 --> 00:35:16.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to the remaining ones of this people
in those days,

00:35:16.831 --> 00:35:20.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should it seem too difficult also to me?’

00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:23.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah of armies.

00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:26.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here I am saving my people

00:35:28.643 --> 00:35:32.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘from the lands of the east and the west.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says,
“from the land of the sunrise

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:39.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the land of the setting sun”]

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:43.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will bring them in,
and they will reside in Jerusalem;

00:35:43.491 --> 00:35:45.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will become my people,

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will become their God
in truth and in righteousness.’”

00:35:50.464 --> 00:35:55.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we can say that in this year of 2015,
without hesitation,

00:35:55.303 --> 00:35:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news is being preached
around the world

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the land of the sunrise

00:36:01.976 --> 00:36:05.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the land of the setting sun.”

00:36:05.346 --> 00:36:08.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “faithful and discreet slave”

00:36:08.082 --> 00:36:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has done things Jehovah’s way,

00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:13.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are reaping his blessings for it.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is we who have the privilege

00:36:16.057 --> 00:36:19.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of seeing the fulfillment
of Jehovah’s purposes.

00:36:19.794 --> 00:36:22.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as an organization
we’ve been translating

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 130 years.

00:36:25.867 --> 00:36:29.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve always used the resources
that are available to us.

00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:32.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I would just like to mention one briefly,

00:36:32.807 --> 00:36:35.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is the MEPS system

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:39.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was developed in the early 1980’s.

00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:42.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And back in those days,
it was actually impossible;

00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:46.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was not a way to type
very many scripts around the world

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a computer.

00:36:48.623 --> 00:36:51.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could just do some basic scripts

00:36:51.192 --> 00:36:54.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Roman script and a few others.

00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:59.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body
had the foresight to understand

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:04.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we needed to create a computer system,
hardware and software,

00:37:04.205 --> 00:37:07.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could bring the message of life

00:37:07.608 --> 00:37:10.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to each people in their own language

00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:12.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and in their own style of writing,

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own script.’

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:19.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s still this computer program
that’s being used to this day

00:37:19.287 --> 00:37:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help publish our literature

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:25.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to share our information on our website.

00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:28.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting
(this is kind of a coincidence)

00:37:28.029 --> 00:37:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of these languages
that you are seeing here

00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:34.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are ones that are spoken today

00:37:34.268 --> 00:37:36.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that area that you saw
in that map earlier,

00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Medo-Persian Empire.

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:39.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not all of the languages.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a few.

00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:45.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it shows that Jehovah’s Word
is reaching into every corner of the earth.

00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:50.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, though the Bible is available

00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:53.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2,700 languages,

00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:57.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reality is that many of those languages
are dead languages.

00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:00.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not spoken by people anymore.

00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:02.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Governing Body also understands

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:07.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we cannot rely on Bible societies

00:38:07.668 --> 00:38:11.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Bible translations

00:38:11.572 --> 00:38:13.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are distributed by them

00:38:13.874 --> 00:38:15.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there are several problems.

00:38:15.876 --> 00:38:18.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their Bibles are hard to get,

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:20.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re expensive,

00:38:20.081 --> 00:38:22.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are on a mission

00:38:22.083 --> 00:38:25.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to eradicate Jehovah’s name.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so now, we have
the <i>New World Translation </i> available

00:38:28.322 --> 00:38:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 128 languages.

00:38:32.126 --> 00:38:34.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, the faithful slave has taken on

00:38:34.962 --> 00:38:37.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a tremendous work with Bible translation.

00:38:37.565 --> 00:38:39.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is more important

00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than making the Bible available to people?

00:38:43.104 --> 00:38:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, it’s so easy for us
to take it for granted

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have a Bible in our language

00:38:48.476 --> 00:38:52.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because most of us here in the audience
have been given a Bible

00:38:52.213 --> 00:38:54.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the time we were born.

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:56.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many of us,
it was the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the reality is that for many
of our brothers and sisters around the world,

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went a very long time
without having Bibles.

00:39:04.191 --> 00:39:06.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they could get a Bible,

00:39:06.193 --> 00:39:10.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often it was something
that used archaic language

00:39:10.398 --> 00:39:12.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they were just bad translations.

00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:17.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they still needed
to read the Bible every day.

00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:21.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they would see words
like <b>“</b>hell” and “cross.”

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:24.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they knew these were wrong,

00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:26.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then they would read other things
and ask:

00:39:26.147 --> 00:39:28.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I wonder if this is also wrong?

00:39:28.182 --> 00:39:30.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I really trust this?”

00:39:30.284 --> 00:39:34.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if they’re reading the Bible
with their foot on the brake,

00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:38.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not quite sure if this is
what the Bible actually says.

00:39:39.894 --> 00:39:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s as one sister said,

00:39:42.897 --> 00:39:47.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With the <i>New World Translation,</i>
I understand it,

00:39:47.368 --> 00:39:50.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I can trust it.”

00:39:50.337 --> 00:39:52.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how many people does it take

00:39:52.339 --> 00:39:56.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get this message of life out

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to each people in their own language

00:40:00.114 --> 00:40:02.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in their own script’?

00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:05.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About eight million.

00:40:05.886 --> 00:40:08.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we’re all part

00:40:08.322 --> 00:40:12.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one large army of Jehovah’s servants,

00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need each other.

00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:19.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this large army
is made up of more than 31,000

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:22.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are working at Bethel worldwide.

00:40:22.103 --> 00:40:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this figure includes

00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:28.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 6,300 commuters

00:40:28.142 --> 00:40:30.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and temporary volunteers.

00:40:30.344 --> 00:40:32.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is
that it’s a collective effort

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between all of us along with Jehovah’s spirit

00:40:35.249 --> 00:40:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes this work possible.

00:40:37.485 --> 00:40:39.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it shows that it’s his work

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:43.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there is no individual
who can take credit for it.

00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:48.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of you Bethelites
are setting a very good example

00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:52.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to reaching out
to people who speak other languages.

00:40:52.933 --> 00:40:56.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
here in the United States branch territory,

00:40:56.003 --> 00:40:58.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 2,400 of you

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:03.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
support congregations other than English.

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:06.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, 161 of you

00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:10.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
support Chinese congregations.

00:41:10.084 --> 00:41:13.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are 56 of you

00:41:13.187 --> 00:41:16.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are currently enrolled
in a foreign-language class.

00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:20.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are doing a wonderful work.

00:41:20.628 --> 00:41:24.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that it is not as easy
as if you were just born into that language

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:26.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if you could just pioneer
in that language.

00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:29.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard work to learn a language.

00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:32.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no doubt your efforts
are encouraging to others,

00:41:32.273 --> 00:41:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you contribute a lot
to the stability of the congregation

00:41:35.843 --> 00:41:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are supporting.

00:41:38.846 --> 00:41:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes a lot of work.

00:41:41.348 --> 00:41:45.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we encourage you not just to be satisfied
with learning the basics of the language

00:41:45.152 --> 00:41:48.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to make it your aim
to keep making progress,

00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:50.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get better and better,

00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:53.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can really be of support
to the brothers and sisters.

00:41:53.827 --> 00:41:56.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be done.

00:41:56.096 --> 00:42:00.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, no matter the language
of the congregation that you attend,

00:42:00.134 --> 00:42:03.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can confidently say to foreigners,

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have literature in your language.”

00:42:09.243 --> 00:42:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like Acts 17:27 tells us,

00:42:13.047 --> 00:42:16.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people should “seek God,

00:42:16.417 --> 00:42:19.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they might grope for him
and . . . find him.”

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can just imagine
somebody groping for something.

00:42:22.356 --> 00:42:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can’t see it.

00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:27.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s dark, but they understand
that it’s something within reach,

00:42:27.695 --> 00:42:32.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re just trying to feel for it,
just to see if they can get it.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible tells us that, yes,

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:40.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people can really find God
“if they . . . grope for him.”

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:44.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, “he is not far off

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from any one of us.”

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s amazing that we have so many gifts

00:42:51.118 --> 00:42:54.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make this message of life accessible.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:59.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a freshly revised Bible translation.

00:42:59.426 --> 00:43:01.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have <i>The Watchtower </i>

00:43:01.428 --> 00:43:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a few simplified languages.

00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:08.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have songs that touch our hearts.

00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:12.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have Bible education material for babies,

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:15.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for children, for teenagers.

00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:18.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have audio recordings, videos,

00:43:18.379 --> 00:43:22.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publications in braille and in sign language,

00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:24.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Internet Web pages.

00:43:24.184 --> 00:43:28.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of these are available
in dozens or hundreds of languages.

00:43:29.823 --> 00:43:33.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see that Jehovah
doesn’t want to leave anybody out.

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to make this message of life
available to everybody

00:43:37.631 --> 00:43:40.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what their station in life.

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:43.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
this brochure has been translated

00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:47.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into over 600 languages.

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:50.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some could say that it’s possibly

00:43:50.778 --> 00:43:53.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most widely translated

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I should say,
the second most widely translated)

00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:58.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
document in history

00:43:58.352 --> 00:44:00.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
next to the Bible.

00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:05.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we are thankful to the Governing Body

00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of this spiritual food

00:44:09.029 --> 00:44:13.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made available for free,

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without charge.

00:44:15.703 --> 00:44:18.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re thankful to them for their courage,

00:44:18.939 --> 00:44:22.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when it comes to Bible translation

00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and restoring Jehovah’s name.

00:44:24.812 --> 00:44:27.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank them
for not just being concerned

00:44:27.448 --> 00:44:29.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the numbers like some religions are;

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they just want to go around
and baptize people

00:44:31.652 --> 00:44:34.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can count them up and say,
“We have a lot of members.”

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the anointed are genuinely concerned
with the quality of our faith.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they untiringly keep encouraging us

00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:46.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cheering us on

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our relationship with Jehovah

00:44:49.503 --> 00:44:51.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to not lose our faith.

00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:57.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This planet is now seeing
the greatest preaching work

00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:59.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s ever been done
in the history of mankind.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His word has pierced through the darkness

00:45:04.017 --> 00:45:07.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and conquered all of these obstacles
that Satan has put in the way.

00:45:07.888 --> 00:45:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if—
It’s just like Isaiah 11:9 says:

00:45:12.092 --> 00:45:16.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The earth will certainly be filled

00:45:16.363 --> 00:45:19.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the knowledge of Jehovah
as the waters cover the sea.”

00:45:22.002 --> 00:45:26.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so many good things
to look forward to.

00:45:26.507 --> 00:45:29.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that in the Bible
Jehovah showed his power

00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:31.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some spectacular ways,

00:45:31.912 --> 00:45:35.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example, at Babel

00:45:35.149 --> 00:45:37.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at Pentecost

00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:40.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the days of Esther and Mordecai

00:45:40.187 --> 00:45:45.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he stopped a genocide in its tracks.

00:45:45.192 --> 00:45:47.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has brought

00:45:47.795 --> 00:45:50.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the light of truth to a dark world.

00:45:50.664 --> 00:45:54.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s preserved his Word and his people.

00:45:54.435 --> 00:45:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we have every reason to believe

00:45:57.104 --> 00:45:59.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at the end of this system of things

00:45:59.706 --> 00:46:02.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the climax is going to be
even more spectacular

00:46:02.976 --> 00:46:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than anything Jehovah has ever done before.

00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:12.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we can be to Jehovah
for allowing us the privilege

00:46:12.052 --> 00:46:14.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of seeing his hand at work

00:46:14.988 --> 00:46:17.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these last days!

00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:19.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we are

00:46:19.426 --> 00:46:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not live in a world
where Jehovah is unknown!

00:46:26.266 --> 00:46:28.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how happy we can be

00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:33.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news
is being made known to people,

00:46:33.073 --> 00:46:35.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to each people

00:46:35.175 --> 00:46:38.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in its own language
and . . . in their own script”!

00:00:01 Imagine living in a world
00:00:04 without any Bible
00:00:07 —no knowledge of Jehovah or Jesus Christ,
00:00:12 no Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:14 no understanding of why we’re here
00:00:18 or where we’re going.
00:00:21 How would you feel?
00:00:23 It’s just like the apostle Paul told the Ephesians when he said:
00:00:28 “You had no hope
00:00:31 and [you] were without God in the world.”
00:00:34 One Bethelite told me that when he reads these words,
00:00:37 it sends a chill through him.
00:00:39 It makes him feel stone cold.
00:00:44 Well, we can be thankful
00:00:47 that we don’t live in a world where Jehovah is unknown.
00:00:52 We don’t live in that world, but billions of people do.
00:00:58 I’d like to invite you to turn your Bibles, please,
00:01:00 to Isaiah chapter 60.
00:01:02 And what we’re going to see is that the Bible does foretell a time
00:01:07 when the world would be in darkness.
00:01:12 Isaiah 60, and we’re going to start with verse 1:
00:01:19 “Arise, O woman,
00:01:21 “shed light, for your light has come.
00:01:25 “The glory of Jehovah shines on you.
00:01:29 “For look! darkness will cover the earth
00:01:33 “and thick gloom the nations;
00:01:36 “but on you Jehovah will shine,
00:01:39 “and on you his glory will be seen.
00:01:43 “Nations will go to your light
00:01:46 and kings to your shining splendor.”
00:01:50 So how did the world
00:01:52 come to be filled with so much darkness?
00:01:56 We know that from the beginning, Satan tried to snuff out worship of Jehovah.
00:02:00 And he probably figured that if the world was going to be dark,
00:02:03 he could keep it that way
00:02:05 by destroying either Jehovah’s people
00:02:10 or Jehovah’s Word
00:02:12 or preferably both.
00:02:15 But Jehovah has shown that he’s in full control of matters.
00:02:18 It says here in these verses
00:02:21 that he would raise up his “woman”
00:02:23 and that “nations [would] go to [this] light.”
00:02:27 And when we think of nations, we think of various countries,
00:02:30 cultures, customs,
00:02:34 and languages.
00:02:36 And it only stands to reason
00:02:38 that in order for these nations to be attracted to this light,
00:02:42 they would need to understand the message.
00:02:45 It would need to be made available to them in their language.
00:02:50 Now, Jehovah has shown that it’s easy for him to do this.
00:02:54 He can bring the message to people in their own language.
00:02:58 And we’re going to look at an example.
00:03:00 This is in Acts 2,
00:03:02 and we’re going to look at the account here
00:03:05 of some of the things that took place at Pentecost
00:03:13 —Acts 2.
00:03:19 And we’re going to start reading with verse 3:
00:03:24 “And tongues as if of fire became visible to them
00:03:29 “and were distributed,
00:03:31 “and one came to rest on each one of them,
00:03:34 “and they all became filled with holy spirit
00:03:37 “and started to speak in different languages,
00:03:39 “just as the spirit enabled them to speak.
00:03:43 “At that time devout Jews from every nation under heaven
00:03:48 “were staying in Jerusalem.
00:03:51 “So when this sound occurred,
00:03:53 “a crowd gathered and was bewildered,
00:03:56 “because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
00:03:59 “Indeed, they were utterly amazed and said:
00:04:04 “‘See here, all these who are speaking are Galileans, are they not?
00:04:08 “‘How is it, then, that each one of us
00:04:11 is hearing his own native language?’”
00:04:14 And then down to verse 11:
00:04:16 “‘We hear them speaking in our languages
00:04:19 “about the magnificent things of God.’
00:04:22 “Yes, they were all
00:04:24 “astonished and perplexed,
00:04:27 saying to one another: ‘What does this mean?’”
00:04:31 Well, we know that what happened here
00:04:33 is in contrast to what Jehovah did at the Tower of Babel,
00:04:36 because there, people were banding together in rebellion against him,
00:04:40 and he did something about it to stop that rebellion.
00:04:44 He erased the knowledge of the language that they knew before
00:04:48 and gave them a new language.
00:04:51 But here in this case at Pentecost,
00:04:53 it seems that Jehovah did not erase the language that they knew before;
00:04:56 he just gave them a new one.
00:04:59 But what was Jehovah’s purpose here?
00:05:02 Why did Jehovah choose this miracle
00:05:06 when he had gathered all of these devout Jews together in Jerusalem?
00:05:10 You see, these devout Jews probably knew Greek
00:05:14 and attended the synagogue.
00:05:16 They knew the lessons of the Messiah,
00:05:19 but these scriptures tell us
00:05:21 they were bewildered,
00:05:24 “utterly amazed,” “astonished,”
00:05:27 “perplexed” at what they were hearing.
00:05:30 This word “astonished” in verse 12
00:05:34 is the same Greek word that is used in Luke (the 8th chapter)
00:05:37 when Jairus’ twelve-year-old daughter was resurrected.
00:05:41 And verse 56 tells us
00:05:43 that “her parents were beside themselves.”
00:05:48 It’s a very strong word.
00:05:51 But why did these people have such a strong reaction?
00:05:55 Let’s look back at verse 8:
00:05:57 “How is it, then, that each one of us
00:06:00 is hearing his own native language?”
00:06:03 And we’re going to take a look at the footnote, and it says:
00:06:06 “Or ‘the language of his birth.’”
00:06:11 So, you see, this wasn’t the language of education for them.
00:06:14 This was the language of the womb.
00:06:18 This is the language that their moms spoke to them in.
00:06:23 And we know that scientists tell us that language development starts in the womb
00:06:28 and that newborns just a couple of days old
00:06:30 are already crying in the rhythm of the language
00:06:35 that they’ve been hearing for the last three months
00:06:37 in their mother’s womb.
00:06:39 So it’s interesting that Jehovah chose the language
00:06:42 that they started learning in the womb.
00:06:44 This made a very deep impact on them.
00:06:48 You see, Jehovah did this;
00:06:50 he wanted to make this deep emotional impact
00:06:53 so they would go back home
00:06:55 to “every nation under heaven”
00:06:58 and never ever in their lifetime
00:07:01 forget what they saw and heard there at Pentecost.
00:07:05 And they would spread the good news about this
00:07:07 to all of the people where they went.
00:07:10 What we learn from this is that Jehovah has power over language.
00:07:15 He had used it before, and he would use it again.
00:07:19 Now, we said before that one of Satan’s goals
00:07:23 would be to try to destroy Jehovah’s people.
00:07:27 So we’re going to take a look at some events
00:07:31 that show examples of this.
00:07:33 I’d like to invite you, please, to turn to the back of your Bibles
00:07:36 to Appendix B9.
00:07:45 And you’ll see some maps there,
00:07:47 and please look
00:07:48 at the upper right-hand corner of the page.
00:07:53 And you’re going to see
00:07:54 that the gray, shaded area
00:07:55 is the vast Medo-Persian Empire.
00:08:02 Now, while you’re looking at that map,
00:08:04 I want to just read
00:08:05 the first two verses of Esther:
00:08:09 “Now in the days of Ahasuerus,
00:08:11 “that is, the Ahasuerus
00:08:13 “who ruled over 127 provinces
00:08:16 “from India to Ethiopia
00:08:20 “[So you see that there on your map
00:08:21 “[on the lower right-hand corner
00:08:23 “[of that gray, shaded area.
00:08:24 “[You see that the Medo-Persian Empire
00:08:26 “[goes all the way down into India
00:08:29 “[and in the lower left,
00:08:31 “[the southwest corner,
00:08:32 “all the way down into Ethiopia],
00:08:35 “in those days
00:08:37 “when King Ahasuerus was sitting
00:08:39 on his royal throne in Shushan the citadel,”
00:08:43 and you see that right just about
00:08:45 in the middle of the map.
00:08:46 So this creates the setting
00:08:47 for these verses that we’re going to read.
00:08:50 I’d like to invite you to turn your Bibles now
00:08:52 to Esther the third chapter,
00:08:55 and we’re going to start reading at verse 6.
00:09:00 We know the story of Esther.
00:09:02 Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.
00:09:05 And Haman was furious.
00:09:09 So let’s start reading in verse 6:
00:09:11 “But he [Haman]
00:09:14 “despised the thought of doing away with Mordecai alone,
00:09:18 “for they had told him about Mordecai’s people.
00:09:21 “So Haman began seeking to annihilate
00:09:25 “all the Jews who were in the entire realm of Ahasuerus,
00:09:30 all of Mordecai’s people.”
00:09:33 And then verse 8:
00:09:35 “Haman then said to King Ahasuerus:
00:09:37 “‘There is a certain people
00:09:39 “‘scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your realm,
00:09:44 “‘whose laws are different from those of all other peoples;
00:09:47 “‘and they do not obey the king’s laws,
00:09:49 “‘and it is not in the king’s interests to let them be.
00:09:53 “‘If it pleases the king, let a decree be written
00:09:56 “‘that they be destroyed.
00:09:58 “‘I will pay 10,000 silver talents to the officials
00:10:01 to put into the royal treasury.’”
00:10:07 We can see that his lies and deception
00:10:10 misled the king
00:10:13 because he said “a certain people.”
00:10:15 He didn’t say who.
00:10:16 “They do not obey the king’s laws.”
00:10:18 This was a lie.
00:10:20 And then he said that “they [should] be destroyed.”
00:10:22 Well, in verse 11, King Ahasuerus said:
00:10:25 “Do with them as you see fit.”
00:10:28 Let’s continue our reading in verse 12:
00:10:32 “The king’s secretaries were then called
00:10:35 “on the 13th day of the first month.
00:10:38 “They put in writing all of Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps,
00:10:42 “the governors who were over the provinces,
00:10:44 “and the princes of the different peoples,
00:10:46 “to each province in its own script
00:10:50 “and to each people in its own language.
00:10:55 “[They wanted to get the word out.]
00:10:57 “It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus
00:10:59 “and sealed with the king’s signet ring.
00:11:03 “The letters were sent by means of couriers to all the king’s provinces,
00:11:07 “giving the order to annihilate,
00:11:10 “to kill, and to destroy all the Jews,
00:11:15 “young and old alike, children and women,
00:11:17 “on a single day, on the 13th day of the 12th month,
00:11:20 “that is, the month of Adar,
00:11:23 and to seize their possessions.”
00:11:26 So you see, this message “Kill the Jews!” went viral,
00:11:31 and it meant death for all of Jehovah’s servants.
00:11:35 Their goal was complete annihilation.
00:11:38 Now, we’ve learned that Haman was a descendant of Agag.
00:11:43 And he was likely seeking revenge
00:11:45 because Jehovah had decreed the eventual extermination of the Amalekites,
00:11:50 and Agag was one of them.
00:11:53 Now, what we read here in the book of Esther
00:11:55 reminds us of what we read in the book God’s Kingdom Rules,
00:12:00 and there’s a nice account on page 93
00:12:02 from our Brother Zacharie Elegbe.
00:12:05 And he talks about the ban
00:12:08 against Jehovah’s Witnesses in Benin.
00:12:12 And this is what he says:
00:12:14 “In 1976,
00:12:17 “when we had 2,300 publishers,
00:12:20 “our work was banned
00:12:22 “and the government ordered the ban to be broadcast
00:12:25 “in every local language.
00:12:28 “That was unheard of.
00:12:31 “Though Benin’s population speaks more than 60 languages,
00:12:35 “radio programs back then were usually broadcast
00:12:39 in only five.”
00:12:41 So you see, in both cases here,
00:12:44 they feared the spread of Jehovah’s people.
00:12:48 And to ensure success, they felt like they had to get the message out
00:12:51 to everyone in their language.
00:12:53 But did it work?
00:12:57 Notice what our brother continues to relate:
00:13:00 “‘When the ban was broadcast
00:13:03 “‘in all  local languages,
00:13:06 “‘many thousands of people living in remote areas
00:13:09 “‘heard of us for the very first time.
00:13:12 “‘They wondered,
00:13:14 “‘“Who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and why are they banned?”
00:13:18 “‘Later, when we reached those areas,
00:13:20 “many accepted the truth in short order.’
00:13:24 “Today, there are more than 11,500 Witnesses
00:13:28 in Benin.”
00:13:30 So you see, their plan backfired.
00:13:34 Their intent was to stop God’s people,
00:13:37 but it ended up helping our brothers spread the good news.
00:13:40 This is not what they intended.
00:13:42 Now let’s go back to the book of Esther,
00:13:45 and we’re going to start again in chapter 8.
00:13:54 We know that Esther risked her life to approach the king.
00:13:58 She exposed Haman’s plot to kill the Jews.
00:14:01 Haman was killed.
00:14:03 He was hanged on a stake.
00:14:05 But since the king’s decree
00:14:10 could not be revoked,
00:14:12 he allowed a new command to be written
00:14:14 that would cancel out the documents that Haman sent,
00:14:17 the first ones that went out.
00:14:19 What did these new documents say?
00:14:23 Let’s start reading in Esther 8:11:
00:14:28 “In these documents the king granted permission
00:14:32 “to the Jews in all the different cities
00:14:34 “to gather together and defend their lives
00:14:38 “and to annihilate, kill, and destroy
00:14:41 “any forces of any people or province that might attack them,
00:14:45 “including women and children,
00:14:48 and to seize their possessions.”
00:14:51 And the scriptures tell us that “the Jews defeated
00:14:53 “[all of] those who hated them. . . .
00:14:55 Not a man could stand against them.”
00:14:58 They also killed the ten sons of Haman
00:15:02 and 75,000 others who hated them.
00:15:07 But notice who this second order was sent to.
00:15:12 Let’s go to verse 9:
00:15:14 “So the secretaries of the king were summoned
00:15:17 “at that time in the third month,
00:15:19 “that is, the month of Sivan,
00:15:22 “on the 23rd day,
00:15:24 “and they wrote all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews,
00:15:27 “as well as to the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces
00:15:31 “from India to Ethiopia,
00:15:35 “127 provinces,
00:15:37 “to each province in its own script
00:15:42 “[or as the footnote says, in their own “style of writing”]
00:15:50 “and to each people in its own language
00:15:52 and to the Jews in their own script and language.”
00:15:57 Now, what do we think of when we think of this word “script”?
00:16:00 You see the picture here.
00:16:05 We have symbols and characters that are recognizable to us
00:16:08 (our alphabet in English),
00:16:10 and it’s basically the same in Spanish, French,
00:16:12 and Western European languages.
00:16:15 Some have accents and extra dots.
00:16:17 But, basically, all of these are considered the Roman script.
00:16:21 And then, of course, there are others, such as Cyrillic
00:16:25 (that’s used by Russia and the former Soviet Republics),
00:16:29 Korean, Chinese.
00:16:31 There are main language families—Arabic.
00:16:33 So it appears that this decree in the book of Esther
00:16:36 was translated into scores of languages
00:16:39 and many different scripts,
00:16:42 because they recognized that for everyone to comprehend the message
00:16:46 and to act on it,
00:16:48 it had to be made available to them in their language.
00:16:50 You see, it meant life for the Jews
00:16:54 and the survival of the whole Jewish race.
00:16:57 Just think about what the result would have been
00:17:00 had this satanic plot been successful.
00:17:05 We know that the events in the book of Esther
00:17:07 concluded by about the year 475 B.C.E.
00:17:12 So just imagine if at that point
00:17:15 all of Jehovah’s servants had been killed.
00:17:18 That means that after that:
00:17:20 no Jewish race,
00:17:23 no walls of Jerusalem rebuilt in 455 B.C.E.,
00:17:28 no book of Malachi written,
00:17:31 no Greek Scriptures recorded,
00:17:34 no seed of Abraham,
00:17:36 no Messiah.
00:17:39 Where would we be?
00:17:43 This second message of life that went out
00:17:48 had to supersede that first message of death that went out.
00:17:53 It couldn’t get to one person less.
00:17:55 Just imagine if you were one of the condemned ones
00:17:59 and you were living in the mountains of Tajikistan.
00:18:03 How important would it be to you
00:18:06 that everyone in your town
00:18:09 actually understood the message?
00:18:13 What we want to get from this is that when it comes to saving people’s lives
00:18:17 and to ensure they are going to act on the message,
00:18:21 it needs to come to them in their own language and script.
00:18:24 And as we saw from what we read in Pentecost,
00:18:27 Jehovah is perfectly capable of delivering that.
00:18:32 Now, when it comes to this message of life,
00:18:37 Satan will do anything he can
00:18:40 to block it, to destroy it.
00:18:43 Let’s look at some examples of this.
00:18:45 Please turn your Bibles to Jeremiah 36.
00:18:52 And we know that Jehovah told Jeremiah
00:18:55 to write in a scroll
00:18:59 a message of warning to the people
00:19:01 that Jerusalem was going to be destroyed unless they changed their ways.
00:19:06 Now, this message in the scroll
00:19:08 was later read to King Jehoiakim.
00:19:11 And Jehoiakim didn’t like what he heard.
00:19:15 So he cut the scroll into pieces, and he threw them into the fire.
00:19:21 Well, was that the end of Jehovah’s word?
00:19:25 Let’s start reading
00:19:27 at Jeremiah 36:28,
00:19:31 where Jehovah told Jeremiah:
00:19:33 “Take another scroll
00:19:36 “and write on it all the same words that were on the first scroll,
00:19:40 which King Jehoiakim of Judah burned up.”
00:19:42 And then down to verse 32:
00:19:44 “Jeremiah then took another scroll
00:19:46 “and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah, the secretary,
00:19:50 “and at Jeremiah’s dictation he wrote on it all the words of the scroll
00:19:55 “that King Jehoiakim of Judah had burned in the fire.
00:19:59 And many more words like those were added.”
00:20:05 So we see that it turned out exactly as Jehovah foretold.
00:20:10 About 17 years later, Jerusalem was destroyed,
00:20:14 many of the rulers were killed, the people were taken as exiles into Babylon.
00:20:18 But the message that was in that scroll that Jehoiakim threw into the fire
00:20:23 as well as all the circumstances surrounding that event
00:20:26 were recorded here in the book of Jeremiah and are preserved till our day.
00:20:32 Now we’re going to look at another example,
00:20:34 and I’d like to invite you to turn to the back of your Bible again.
00:20:37 And we’re going to look at Appendix A3.
00:20:43 Now, we know that centuries after Jeremiah’s time,
00:20:47 Jesus came as “the light of the world.”
00:20:50 But he did say
00:20:52 that an ‘enemy would plant weeds among the wheat.’
00:20:58 And that enemy is the Devil.
00:21:01 Paul also spoke about the apostasy.
00:21:04 So we’re going to read something here.
00:21:07 Looking at Appendix A3, you’ll see in the middle of the page a subheading,
00:21:12 “Copyists Preserve God’s Word.”
00:21:15 And then count to the third paragraph,
00:21:17 the one that begins with “What about the 27 books . . . ?”
00:21:21 And then in the middle of the paragraph is Colossians 4:16;
00:21:25 we’re going to start reading right after that:
00:21:27 “Despite attempts
00:21:29 “by Roman Emperor Diocletian and others
00:21:33 “to destroy all . . . Christian literature,
00:21:36 “thousands of ancient fragments and manuscripts
00:21:40 have been preserved until our day.”
00:21:45 Well, who was this Roman Emperor Diocletian?
00:21:50 Well, he’s someone who started
00:21:53 a vicious persecution against Christians
00:21:56 in the year 303 C.E.,
00:21:59 and it lasted for about eight years.
00:22:01 It was his goal to eradicate Christians.
00:22:04 And one of the first things he did was that he decreed
00:22:07 that all the copies of their Scriptures be destroyed
00:22:10 because he took it for granted that every Christian community,
00:22:13 wherever they were, had a collection of holy books
00:22:16 that were vital for their survival.
00:22:18 So his men hunted high and low for these books,
00:22:23 and they burned them publicly in the marketplaces.
00:22:26 The persecution was intense and barbaric,
00:22:31 and many Christians were maimed and killed.
00:22:35 It was a very difficult time
00:22:37 —so difficult that this time period
00:22:40 that ended in 311 C.E.
00:22:43 is called, even by secular historians,
00:22:46 the “great persecution.”
00:22:49 Now, it’s actually what happened right after this
00:22:52 that catapulted Christianity into darkness.
00:22:55 You see, in 312 C.E., Constantine marched on Rome,
00:22:59 and he eventually became the emperor.
00:23:03 One of the first things that he did was that he officially ended the persecution,
00:23:07 and he gave back the property to the Christians,
00:23:11 and he gave them special privileges.
00:23:14 Now, you can just imagine this was a sweet victory for Christians.
00:23:17 They welcomed Constantine with open arms.
00:23:21 Constantine surrounded himself with Christians,
00:23:23 and he called them “brothers.”
00:23:27 He wanted to unify all the people in his realm
00:23:30 under one universal religion.
00:23:33 He even wrote a letter to everyone
00:23:34 saying that they should all become Christians.
00:23:38 And so we know that pagan customs and celebrations
00:23:44 were given Christian names.
00:23:47 And Christian elders were given the clothing,
00:23:52 the status, the salary,
00:23:55 and the prestige of the pagan priests.
00:23:59 Now, not all of the Christians, but very many of them,
00:24:02 welcomed Constantine.
00:24:05 They embraced his intervention, and they even praised him and said,
00:24:08 “You are an angel sent from God
00:24:11 for our protection.”
00:24:14 Now, these Christians also embraced the masses of unconverted pagans
00:24:18 who flooded into Christianity.
00:24:20 You see, they called themselves “Christians,”
00:24:23 but they were not genuine disciples of Jesus Christ.
00:24:29 These Christians considered Constantine a Christian, but he wasn’t one.
00:24:33 He was still officially
00:24:35 the high priest of Roman paganism,
00:24:39 but he took it upon himself to appoint and remove church leaders.
00:24:43 And in the year 325 C.E., when there was a big dispute
00:24:47 about whether God and Jesus are the same person,
00:24:51 they held this council at Nicaea,
00:24:54 and in came the Christians —some of them maimed and scarred
00:24:58 from all those years of persecution.
00:25:02 And it was actually Constantine
00:25:05 who proposed the wording and said,
00:25:09 “God and Jesus
00:25:11 are of the same substance.”
00:25:14 And when he said that, many of them were just gasping.
00:25:19 They said, “Inspired!”
00:25:21 They fell for it.
00:25:24 And this is what laid the foundation for the Trinity doctrine,
00:25:29 which came a few years later.
00:25:31 Now, you see, it wasn’t the force  of Diocletian and the “great persecution”
00:25:34 that was so effective.
00:25:36 He couldn’t conquer the Christians,
00:25:38 but it was the embrace of the world that made them fall.
00:25:42 One writer
00:25:44 likened it to a great judo throw.
00:25:47 He said: “You see, in judo,
00:25:49 “you don’t have to be bigger or stronger than your opponent;
00:25:52 “you just have to push,
00:25:55 “and he pushes back.
00:25:57 “And when he pushes, you pull and you flip him.
00:26:02 “And it’s his weight and his strength that sends him,
00:26:06 and it’s amazing how far he will go.”
00:26:08 Well, Diocletian pushed on the church,
00:26:11 Constantine did the pull and the throw,
00:26:14 and the church crashed to the ground
00:26:17 so that a century later, it wasn’t even recognizable
00:26:20 as the Christianity that we know,
00:26:22 because by then, Christians were characterized
00:26:25 by their violence, their bloodshed,
00:26:28 their political intrigue and envy.
00:26:30 The apostasy was truly entrenched.
00:26:34 And this darkness was so great
00:26:37 that this control by Rome and the church
00:26:40 came to be known as the Dark Ages.
00:26:45 And so we know what happened after that.
00:26:47 For centuries the Inquisition, the Crusades
00:26:51 —these Christians who were persecuted
00:26:55 became the persecutors.
00:26:58 So how bad is it when even the world
00:27:01 calls the influence of the church “darkness”?
00:27:07 Remember that Isaiah 60:2 said
00:27:09 that “darkness [would] cover the earth.”
00:27:13 Now, another way to restrict the Bible
00:27:15 would be to limit it to just one or two languages.
00:27:19 And we know that’s exactly what this church did.
00:27:22 For centuries, they forbid church services
00:27:26 in any other language besides Latin
00:27:28 and forbid Bible translation.
00:27:30 And if you had a Bible, you could be sent to prison for life
00:27:34 or burned at the stake for doing so.
00:27:37 And this routine continued for centuries,
00:27:40 because well into the 1900’s,
00:27:43 Catholic priests were still confiscating Bibles
00:27:47 and burning them.
00:27:49 But we know that all of these attacks failed.
00:27:52 And the reason why they were
00:27:55 just as successful as King Jehoiakim was
00:27:58 when he tried to destroy Jehovah’s Word
00:28:00 is because the Bible tells us at Isaiah 40:8:
00:28:04 “The word of our God endures forever.”
00:28:09 And we know that it’s only because of Jehovah’s intervention,
00:28:13 because from the very, very beginning
00:28:16 when the very first scrolls were written,
00:28:19 Jehovah commanded that copies be made.
00:28:22 And professionals —skilled scribes and copyists—
00:28:27 made these copies.
00:28:29 And these early scrolls were translated into other languages.
00:28:32 For example, in the first century, the apostles used
00:28:35 the Greek Septuagint Bible.
00:28:40 But we also know that Jehovah protected the integrity of the message itself.
00:28:45 And we know this because we can look at manuscripts
00:28:49 that are just a few hundred years old,
00:28:51 and we can compare them with oldest known manuscripts
00:28:55 —the Dead Sea Scrolls, some of which are more than 2,000 years old.
00:28:59 When we compare them, we see
00:29:00 that there is no difference in meaning between them.
00:29:05 The differences in wording are very, very minor.
00:29:11 And that gives us confidence that the contents of the Bible
00:29:15 have not changed from the very beginning.
00:29:18 What’s interesting is that these scrolls, the Dead Sea Scrolls,
00:29:22 were right there in a cave in plain sight
00:29:25 in the land of Israel
00:29:27 for hundreds and hundreds of years.
00:29:30 All the way until 1947, they weren’t discovered.
00:29:32 So why were they not discovered during all those years
00:29:35 of hunting down and destroying Jehovah’s Word?
00:29:38 Obviously, his protection is evident.
00:29:42 And it was Jehovah who would ensure
00:29:44 that the Bible would go on to become the most widely translated
00:29:49 and most widely distributed document in history,
00:29:52 because parts of the Bible exist
00:29:55 in nearly 2,700 languages.
00:29:58 We can see Jehovah has been victorious in this.
00:30:01 And we know it’s the Bible that is the key
00:30:06 to help people to learn about God
00:30:09 —to learn to love him, to serve him,
00:30:12 to learn about the blessings of living forever in his Kingdom
00:30:17 —and the Kingdom good news.
00:30:18 And this is what Jesus said would be “preached in all the inhabited earth
00:30:23 “for a witness to all the nations,
00:30:26 and then the end [would] come.”
00:30:29 But the Bible also tells us that as we get closer to the end,
00:30:33 life will be very, very difficult.
00:30:36 People would be “lovers of themselves, . . . blasphemers,
00:30:40 “disobedient . . . , without love of goodness,
00:30:43 . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”
00:30:47 So how would the King be able to raise up
00:30:51 an army of preachers during these last days
00:30:55 who would be willing to preach the good news?
00:30:58 Jehovah tells us what his plan was.
00:31:01 Let’s turn, please, to Malachi the 3rd chapter
00:31:09 —Malachi 3:1.
00:31:13 This is Jehovah speaking: “‘Look!
00:31:17 “‘I am sending my messenger
00:31:21 “‘[his anointed ones],
00:31:23 “‘and he will clear up a way before me.
00:31:26 “‘And suddenly the true Lord [Jehovah],
00:31:30 “‘whom you are seeking, will come to his temple;
00:31:33 “‘and the messenger of the covenant [Jesus Christ] will come,
00:31:38 “‘in whom you take delight.
00:31:40 “‘Look!
00:31:41 He will certainly come,’ says Jehovah of armies.”
00:31:45 So this is telling us that his messenger would be on the scene
00:31:49 well before Christ’s presence, clearing up the way.
00:31:53 And it’s history that tells us, that shows us,
00:31:56 that it was just one small group of faithful ones active at that time
00:32:01 who stood out as the one and only genuine Christians
00:32:07 who had the privilege of shaking off
00:32:11 the legacy that was handed to them,
00:32:13 the layers and layers of false teachings
00:32:16 associated with the Bible.
00:32:18 In the beginning, they were so few and things were not clear.
00:32:22 But Jehovah strengthened them organizationally,
00:32:25 he cleansed them spiritually,
00:32:27 and he equipped them to preach the good news
00:32:31 and to make genuine disciples.
00:32:36 Now, Jesus made it very clear what their role would be,
00:32:39 as recorded at Matthew 24:45.
00:32:41 Jesus said that he would have a “faithful and discreet slave”
00:32:46 and would appoint him “over his domestics,
00:32:48 to give them their food at the proper time.”
00:32:53 Now, this faithful slave knows
00:32:55 that much is at stake —people’s lives—
00:33:00 because their commission is the same
00:33:03 as what Jesus told the apostle Paul his commission was
00:33:07 when Jesus appeared to him and blinded him,
00:33:10 as recorded at Acts 26:17, 18.
00:33:13 Jesus told him: “I am sending you
00:33:16 “to open their eyes,
00:33:19 “to turn them from darkness to light
00:33:23 “and from the authority of Satan to God,
00:33:27 “so that they may receive forgiveness of sins
00:33:30 and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.”
00:33:35 So just like in the days of Esther,
00:33:39 the faithful slave understands
00:33:41 that they have a message of life
00:33:44 that must be given ‘to each people
00:33:48 in its own language and in their own script.’
00:33:52 Now, was this too difficult for Jehovah to accomplish
00:33:55 with this small group of Witnesses?
00:33:59 How could they possibly do it?
00:34:02 Well, it’s as Jesus said: “With men this is impossible,
00:34:06 but with God all things are possible.”
00:34:11 And so today, what we see is that the good news is being preached
00:34:15 in every nation under heaven.
00:34:20 And it’s being translated into more than 700 languages.
00:34:24 And in the eyes of the world,
00:34:26 what is being accomplished by Jehovah’s organization
00:34:29 is an impossibility.
00:34:32 And sometimes, maybe even we feel
00:34:35 that it’s an impossibility.
00:34:37 We may be overwhelmed by all that’s being produced
00:34:41 and the results that are being had.
00:34:44 But what is Jehovah’s view on this?
00:34:46 Let’s turn our Bibles, please,
00:34:48 to Zechariah 8,
00:34:57 Zechariah 8,
00:35:00 and we’re going to read starting with verse 6:
00:35:05 “This is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:35:09 “‘Although it may seem too difficult
00:35:12 “‘to the remaining ones of this people in those days,
00:35:16 “should it seem too difficult also to me?’
00:35:20 “declares Jehovah of armies.
00:35:23 “This is what Jehovah of armies says,
00:35:26 “‘Here I am saving my people
00:35:28 “‘from the lands of the east and the west.
00:35:32 “‘[or as the footnote says, “from the land of the sunrise
00:35:36 “‘and the land of the setting sun”]
00:35:39 “‘And I will bring them in, and they will reside in Jerusalem;
00:35:43 “‘and they will become my people,
00:35:45 and I will become their God in truth and in righteousness.’”
00:35:50 And so we can say that in this year of 2015, without hesitation,
00:35:55 that the good news is being preached around the world
00:35:59 “from the land of the sunrise
00:36:01 and the land of the setting sun.”
00:36:05 The “faithful and discreet slave”
00:36:08 has done things Jehovah’s way,
00:36:10 and they are reaping his blessings for it.
00:36:13 And it is we who have the privilege
00:36:16 of seeing the fulfillment of Jehovah’s purposes.
00:36:19 Now, as an organization we’ve been translating
00:36:22 for over 130 years.
00:36:25 And we’ve always used the resources that are available to us.
00:36:29 And I would just like to mention one briefly,
00:36:32 and this is the MEPS system
00:36:35 that was developed in the early 1980’s.
00:36:39 And back in those days, it was actually impossible;
00:36:42 there was not a way to type very many scripts around the world
00:36:46 into a computer.
00:36:48 You could just do some basic scripts
00:36:51 like Roman script and a few others.
00:36:54 But the Governing Body had the foresight to understand
00:36:59 that we needed to create a computer system, hardware and software,
00:37:04 that could bring the message of life
00:37:07 ‘to each people in their own language
00:37:10 ‘and in their own style of writing,
00:37:12 in their own script.’
00:37:15 And it’s still this computer program that’s being used to this day
00:37:19 to help publish our literature
00:37:21 and to share our information on our website.
00:37:25 Now, it’s interesting (this is kind of a coincidence)
00:37:28 that all of these languages that you are seeing here
00:37:31 are ones that are spoken today
00:37:34 in that area that you saw in that map earlier,
00:37:36 the Medo-Persian Empire.
00:37:38 This is not all of the languages.
00:37:39 It’s just a few.
00:37:41 But it shows that Jehovah’s Word is reaching into every corner of the earth.
00:37:47 Now, though the Bible is available
00:37:50 in 2,700 languages,
00:37:53 the reality is that many of those languages are dead languages.
00:37:57 They’re not spoken by people anymore.
00:38:00 And the Governing Body also understands
00:38:02 that we cannot rely on Bible societies
00:38:07 and the Bible translations
00:38:11 that are distributed by them
00:38:13 because there are several problems.
00:38:15 Their Bibles are hard to get,
00:38:18 they’re expensive,
00:38:20 and they are on a mission
00:38:22 to eradicate Jehovah’s name.
00:38:25 And so now, we have the New World Translation  available
00:38:28 in 128 languages.
00:38:32 It’s true, the faithful slave has taken on
00:38:34 a tremendous work with Bible translation.
00:38:37 But what is more important
00:38:39 than making the Bible available to people?
00:38:43 You see, it’s so easy for us to take it for granted
00:38:46 that we have a Bible in our language
00:38:48 because most of us here in the audience have been given a Bible
00:38:52 from the time we were born.
00:38:54 For many of us, it was the New World Translation.
00:38:56 But the reality is that for many of our brothers and sisters around the world,
00:38:59 they went a very long time without having Bibles.
00:39:04 And if they could get a Bible,
00:39:06 often it was something that used archaic language
00:39:10 or they were just bad translations.
00:39:13 But they still needed to read the Bible every day.
00:39:17 And they would see words like “hell” and “cross.”
00:39:21 And they knew these were wrong,
00:39:24 but then they would read other things and ask:
00:39:26 “I wonder if this is also wrong?
00:39:28 Can I really trust this?”
00:39:30 It’s as if they’re reading the Bible with their foot on the brake,
00:39:34 not quite sure if this is what the Bible actually says.
00:39:39 Well, it’s as one sister said,
00:39:42 “With the New World Translation, I understand it,
00:39:47 and I can trust it.”
00:39:50 Now, how many people does it take
00:39:52 to get this message of life out
00:39:56 ‘to each people in their own language
00:40:00 and in their own script’?
00:40:03 About eight million.
00:40:05 You see, we’re all part
00:40:08 of one large army of Jehovah’s servants,
00:40:12 and we need each other.
00:40:14 But this large army is made up of more than 31,000
00:40:19 who are working at Bethel worldwide.
00:40:22 Now, this figure includes
00:40:24 more than 6,300 commuters
00:40:28 and temporary volunteers.
00:40:30 But the point is that it’s a collective effort
00:40:32 between all of us along with Jehovah’s spirit
00:40:35 that makes this work possible.
00:40:37 And it shows that it’s his work
00:40:39 because there is no individual who can take credit for it.
00:40:44 Now, many of you Bethelites are setting a very good example
00:40:48 when it comes to reaching out to people who speak other languages.
00:40:52 For example, here in the United States branch territory,
00:40:56 about 2,400 of you
00:40:58 support congregations other than English.
00:41:03 For example, 161 of you
00:41:06 support Chinese congregations.
00:41:10 And there are 56 of you
00:41:13 who are currently enrolled in a foreign-language class.
00:41:17 You are doing a wonderful work.
00:41:20 We know that it is not as easy as if you were just born into that language
00:41:24 or if you could just pioneer in that language.
00:41:26 It’s hard work to learn a language.
00:41:29 But no doubt your efforts are encouraging to others,
00:41:32 and you contribute a lot to the stability of the congregation
00:41:35 that you are supporting.
00:41:38 It takes a lot of work.
00:41:41 And we encourage you not just to be satisfied with learning the basics of the language
00:41:45 but also to make it your aim to keep making progress,
00:41:48 to get better and better,
00:41:50 so that you can really be of support to the brothers and sisters.
00:41:53 It can be done.
00:41:56 And, really, no matter the language of the congregation that you attend,
00:42:00 we can confidently say to foreigners,
00:42:03 “We have literature in your language.”
00:42:09 Just like Acts 17:27 tells us,
00:42:13 people should “seek God,
00:42:16 if they might grope for him and . . . find him.”
00:42:19 And you can just imagine somebody groping for something.
00:42:22 They can’t see it.
00:42:23 Maybe it’s dark, but they understand that it’s something within reach,
00:42:27 and they’re just trying to feel for it, just to see if they can get it.
00:42:32 And the Bible tells us that, yes,
00:42:35 people can really find God “if they . . . grope for him.”
00:42:40 In fact, “he is not far off
00:42:44 from any one of us.”
00:42:46 And it’s amazing that we have so many gifts
00:42:51 to make this message of life accessible.
00:42:54 We have a freshly revised Bible translation.
00:42:59 We have The Watchtower
00:43:01 in a few simplified languages.
00:43:05 We have songs that touch our hearts.
00:43:08 We have Bible education material for babies,
00:43:12 for children, for teenagers.
00:43:15 We have audio recordings, videos,
00:43:18 publications in braille and in sign language,
00:43:22 Internet Web pages.
00:43:24 And most of these are available in dozens or hundreds of languages.
00:43:29 We can see that Jehovah doesn’t want to leave anybody out.
00:43:33 He wants to make this message of life available to everybody
00:43:37 no matter what their station in life.
00:43:40 As an example, this brochure has been translated
00:43:43 into over 600 languages.
00:43:47 And some could say that it’s possibly
00:43:50 the most widely translated
00:43:53 (I should say, the second most widely translated)
00:43:56 document in history
00:43:58 next to the Bible.
00:44:00 Now, we are thankful to the Governing Body
00:44:05 that all of this spiritual food
00:44:09 is made available for free,
00:44:13 without charge.
00:44:15 We’re thankful to them for their courage,
00:44:18 especially when it comes to Bible translation
00:44:22 and restoring Jehovah’s name.
00:44:24 And we thank them for not just being concerned
00:44:27 with the numbers like some religions are;
00:44:29 they just want to go around and baptize people
00:44:31 so that they can count them up and say, “We have a lot of members.”
00:44:34 But the anointed are genuinely concerned with the quality of our faith.
00:44:39 And they untiringly keep encouraging us
00:44:44 and cheering us on
00:44:46 to keep our relationship with Jehovah
00:44:49 and to not lose our faith.
00:44:53 This planet is now seeing the greatest preaching work
00:44:57 that’s ever been done in the history of mankind.
00:44:59 His word has pierced through the darkness
00:45:04 and conquered all of these obstacles that Satan has put in the way.
00:45:07 It’s as if— It’s just like Isaiah 11:9 says:
00:45:12 “The earth will certainly be filled
00:45:16 with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.”
00:45:22 We have so many good things to look forward to.
00:45:26 We know that in the Bible Jehovah showed his power
00:45:29 in some spectacular ways,
00:45:31 for example, at Babel
00:45:35 or at Pentecost
00:45:37 or in the days of Esther and Mordecai
00:45:40 when he stopped a genocide in its tracks.
00:45:45 And Jehovah has brought
00:45:47 the light of truth to a dark world.
00:45:50 He’s preserved his Word and his people.
00:45:54 And so we have every reason to believe
00:45:57 that at the end of this system of things
00:45:59 the climax is going to be even more spectacular
00:46:02 than anything Jehovah has ever done before.
00:46:07 How thankful we can be to Jehovah for allowing us the privilege
00:46:12 of seeing his hand at work
00:46:14 during these last days!
00:46:17 And how thankful we are
00:46:19 that we do not live in a world where Jehovah is unknown!
00:46:26 And how happy we can be
00:46:28 that the good news is being made known to people,
00:46:33 “to each people
00:46:35 in its own language and . . . in their own script”!

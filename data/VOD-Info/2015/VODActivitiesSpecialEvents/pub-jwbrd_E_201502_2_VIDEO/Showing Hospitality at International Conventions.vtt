WEBVTT

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:07.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have 2,500 delegates coming in.

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us,
we want to give them our absolute best.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we want them to feel
is the love of the true brotherhood.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The commission was to make it
a life-changing experience.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:20.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to do that, we thought we
had to put together more than just,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Come and have some dinner with us.’

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:26.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overwhelming
—I don’t know how to express how I feel.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to first of all come up with
and create the acts.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:33.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went in a room for two days
and cried and prayed.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is where the trust
that Jehovah is directing us

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his organization has helped us.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was so much more involved

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in showing hospitality to our delegates
than we originally thought.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have an original, authentic,
1892 chuck wagon,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real Texas cowboys, real horse trainers,

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:57.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
roping lessons, and Texas Longhorns.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re making buttermilk biscuits
just like they did on the trail

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in a Dutch oven with coals.

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have four different casts that we’re using

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:07.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(each somewhere
in the range of 80-90 per cast),

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three different locations
we’re going to be performing at,

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this spans over four days.

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:17.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The evening programs
include providing some food

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the friends that are here,

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some spiritual entertainment 
with music, some interviews, some videos.

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We haven’t had field service
as part of our conventions as in the past.

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it’s so apparent
that Jehovah is behind this

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the example set by the slave;

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:34.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s so evident that this should be done.

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:37.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re facing similar challenges
in the ministry,

00:01:37.781 --> 00:01:41.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re still working hard
while dealing with these challenges.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hearing that was very encouraging,

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it gave me the renewed motivation
to keep preaching with zeal.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also needed volunteers
to come to the Assembly Hall

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and greet the delegates
as they came in off the buses.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:56.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I wasn’t sure why
there were so many people outside

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I saw them from the bus.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I found out
that they were there to welcome us,

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it brought me to tears.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we found out that the tours
were coming to the Assembly Hall,

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we knew that we were going
to have an extra special blessing.

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:10.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had well over 3,600 volunteers

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably more like 5,000
that were willing to help.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We contacted probably a little bit
over 200 congregations

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to participate in these activities.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are from Cheyenne, Wyoming
—about 850 miles (1,367 km) away.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started about two or three weeks ago

00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:27.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting all the wagons ready,

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it took a couple of days to get here.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to do
was to ask permission at my job

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ask for a week off in order to be here.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed a lot to Jehovah.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And through him, they gave me permission,

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was able to be here.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so energized and pumped,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really just see us
walking into the new world

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:53.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeling all of this every day.

00:02:53.122 --> 00:02:56.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My job has been to come up with drawings

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and paintings for note cards

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of things that are indigenous
to Washington.

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:05.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege of designing the logo

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that went on the gift bags
for the international convention.

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to sing for the delegates.

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to sing for the delegates

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:17.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I want to make God happy
and the delegates too.

00:03:17.914 --> 00:03:19.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The singing at the airports

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was touching  
to see them waiting for us

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at night,
because we arrived around 10:00 p.m.

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that they’ll be happy
to see all of us welcoming them

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the things that we’re preparing for them

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something to take back 
with them to remember

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this opportunity that they have had.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This part, the top part—the large JW

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was actually from <i>The Messenger,</i>

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was back in 1931

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:47.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the international convention
in Columbus, Ohio.

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you see with all the brothers and sisters

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everyone wanting to contribute,
everyone wanting to have a part,

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:58.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone wanting to be called,
everyone wanting to participate

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever way they can.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to Seattle!

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:06.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just seeing it being used
and enjoyed by the delegates

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a great feeling.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a little bit tired from the flight.

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you
(kind of like) saw all the smiles

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:15.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cheers
and the big banners and all the gifts,

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:17.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was just like, “Oh, my goodness!”

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You felt loved, didn’t you?
You felt loved straightaway.

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You felt loved.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:21.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was love.

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know where they’re from.

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:24.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know their names.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they just smile and wave,
and seeing that unity

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:29.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I mean it’s genuine love, and you just—

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you just almost want to cry.

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:32.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want them to know

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:35.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have brothers here
that will support them

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:37.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who love them and are willing

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do whatever we can
to make them enjoy their stay here.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just want them to feel

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like our arms have been around them
the whole time they’ve been here.

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:48.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really shows
that Jehovah is behind the work.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:51.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also shows the loving brotherhood
because it’s so evident

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what you see with all the happy faces
—the zeal, the enthusiasm.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything that is being spent
is all so that we can praise Jehovah

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:03.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to welcome his sheep, the delegates,

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming from all the different parts
of the world.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope that 2,000-3,000 years from now

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somebody walks up to me and says:
“I remember you!

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were at the cowboy deal in Texas!”

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That, to me, would be fantastic.

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know cowboys aren’t supposed to cry,
but trust us,

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do when it comes to this.

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy!

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It moves me to tears.

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They came here

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to let us sing,
and they watched us,

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they take our song with them.

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want the delegates to be happy!

00:00:04 We have 2,500 delegates coming in.
00:00:07 For us, we want to give them our absolute best.
00:00:10 What we want them to feel is the love of the true brotherhood.
00:00:14 The commission was to make it a life-changing experience.
00:00:17 In order to do that, we thought we had to put together more than just,
00:00:20 ‘Come and have some dinner with us.’
00:00:22 Overwhelming —I don’t know how to express how I feel.
00:00:26 We had to first of all come up with and create the acts.
00:00:30 So I went in a room for two days and cried and prayed.
00:00:33 This is where the trust that Jehovah is directing us
00:00:37 through his organization has helped us.
00:00:41 There was so much more involved
00:00:43 in showing hospitality to our delegates than we originally thought.
00:00:46 We have an original, authentic,
1892 chuck wagon,
00:00:50 real Texas cowboys, real horse trainers,
00:00:53 roping lessons, and Texas Longhorns.
00:00:57 We’re making buttermilk biscuits just like they did on the trail
00:01:00 —in a Dutch oven with coals.
00:01:02 We have four different casts that we’re using
00:01:04 (each somewhere in the range of 80-90 per cast),
00:01:07 three different locations we’re going to be performing at,
00:01:10 and this spans over four days.
00:01:14 The evening programs include providing some food
00:01:17 to the friends that are here,
00:01:19 some spiritual entertainment  with music, some interviews, some videos.
00:01:22 We haven’t had field service as part of our conventions as in the past.
00:01:26 However, it’s so apparent that Jehovah is behind this
00:01:29 —the example set by the slave;
00:01:32 it’s so evident that this should be done.
00:01:34 They’re facing similar challenges in the ministry,
00:01:37 but they’re still working hard while dealing with these challenges.
00:01:41 Hearing that was very encouraging,
00:01:43 and it gave me the renewed motivation to keep preaching with zeal.
00:01:47 We also needed volunteers to come to the Assembly Hall
00:01:50 and greet the delegates as they came in off the buses.
00:01:52 At first, I wasn’t sure why there were so many people outside
00:01:56 when I saw them from the bus.
00:01:58 When I found out that they were there to welcome us,
00:02:00 it brought me to tears.
00:02:02 When we found out that the tours were coming to the Assembly Hall,
00:02:05 we knew that we were going to have an extra special blessing.
00:02:08 We had well over 3,600 volunteers
00:02:10 and probably more like 5,000 that were willing to help.
00:02:13 We contacted probably a little bit over 200 congregations
00:02:16 to participate in these activities.
00:02:20 We are from Cheyenne, Wyoming —about 850 miles (1,367 km) away.
00:02:22 We started about two or three weeks ago
00:02:25 getting all the wagons ready,
00:02:27 and it took a couple of days to get here.
00:02:30 One of the things
00:02:32 I had to do was to ask permission at my job
00:02:35 —ask for a week off in order to be here.
00:02:38 I prayed a lot to Jehovah.
00:02:40 And through him, they gave me permission,
00:02:42 and I was able to be here.
00:02:45 I’m so energized and pumped,
00:02:47 and I really just see us walking into the new world
00:02:50 and feeling all of this every day.
00:02:53 My job has been to come up with drawings
00:02:56 and paintings for note cards
00:02:58 of things that are indigenous to Washington.
00:03:03 I had the privilege of designing the logo
00:03:05 that went on the gift bags for the international convention.
00:03:09 We’re going to sing for the delegates.
00:03:11 I want to sing for the delegates
00:03:13 because I want to make God happy and the delegates too.
00:03:17 The singing at the airports
00:03:19 —it was touching   to see them waiting for us
00:03:22 at night, because we arrived around 10:00 p.m.
00:03:27 I think that they’ll be happy to see all of us welcoming them
00:03:30 and the things that we’re preparing for them
00:03:32 —something to take back  with them to remember
00:03:35 this opportunity that they have had.
00:03:36 This part, the top part—the large JW
00:03:39 was actually from The Messenger,
00:03:41 which was back in 1931
00:03:44 at the international convention in Columbus, Ohio.
00:03:49 As you see with all the brothers and sisters
00:03:51 —everyone wanting to contribute, everyone wanting to have a part,
00:03:55 everyone wanting to be called, everyone wanting to participate
00:03:58 in whatever way they can.
00:04:00 Welcome to Seattle!
00:04:02 Just seeing it being used and enjoyed by the delegates
00:04:06 was a great feeling.
00:04:07 I was a little bit tired from the flight.
00:04:09 But when you (kind of like) saw all the smiles
00:04:11 and the cheers and the big banners and all the gifts,
00:04:15 it was just like, “Oh, my goodness!”
00:04:17 You felt loved, didn’t you? You felt loved straightaway.
00:04:19 You felt loved.
00:04:20 It was love.
00:04:21 We don’t know where they’re from.
00:04:22 We don’t know their names.
00:04:24 But they just smile and wave, and seeing that unity
00:04:27 —I mean it’s genuine love, and you just—
00:04:29 you just almost want to cry.
00:04:31 We want them to know
00:04:32 that they have brothers here that will support them
00:04:35 and who love them and are willing
00:04:37 to do whatever we can to make them enjoy their stay here.
00:04:40 Yes.
00:04:41 We just want them to feel
00:04:43 like our arms have been around them the whole time they’ve been here.
00:04:46 It really shows that Jehovah is behind the work.
00:04:48 But it also shows the loving brotherhood because it’s so evident
00:04:51 by what you see with all the happy faces —the zeal, the enthusiasm.
00:04:56 Everything that is being spent is all so that we can praise Jehovah
00:05:00 but also to welcome his sheep, the delegates,
00:05:03 coming from all the different parts of the world.
00:05:05 I hope that 2,000-3,000 years from now
00:05:07 somebody walks up to me and says: “I remember you!
00:05:09 You were at the cowboy deal in Texas!”
00:05:11 That, to me, would be fantastic.
00:05:13 I know cowboys aren’t supposed to cry, but trust us,
00:05:16 we do when it comes to this.
00:05:18 I’m so happy!
00:05:19 It moves me to tears.
00:05:21 They came here
00:05:23 to let us sing, and they watched us,
00:05:25 so they take our song with them.
00:05:27 We want the delegates to be happy!

Our ministry is another kind

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of search-and-rescue operation,

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:10.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we search wherever people can be found.

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:13.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the following report,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the efforts our brothers made

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach people living
in the remotest areas of Africa.

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus made the bold statement at Acts 1:8:

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will be witnesses of me . . .

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.253 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This resonates deeply
in the country of Namibia.

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These warm and beautiful people are spread

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across great expanses
of dramatic and thirsty land.

00:00:48.098 --> 00:00:49.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not only separated
by physical distances

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re also separated

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by cultures,

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ancient traditions,

00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and historic injustices.

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since the South Africa branch office

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.349 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
oversees the work in this territory,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:10.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we are pleased to assist a group of brothers

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the capital city, Windhoek,

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a special witnessing trip.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, our journey will start

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Windhoek,

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:21.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to travel to Gam first.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:23.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From there, we are going to go to Tsumkwe.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to camp in those two places,
Gam and Tsumkwe,

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we may travel a distance
of about 1,500 km (900 mi).

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk safety now.

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to keep

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:37.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three creatures out of your tent

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—animals such as hyenas, scorpions,

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:41.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and snakes.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always zip your tent.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Toilet facilities

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a method that Moses
prescribed for the Israelites.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we enter the Herero home,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enter through the side gate.

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is to show respect

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have areas in their homesteads

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are restricted for ancestor worship.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, they don’t like
being asked direct questions.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:06.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be better to show them pictures

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let them comment.

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme scripture, 1 Corinthians 9:22,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said: “I have become

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all things to people of all sorts,

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:17.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all possible means save some.”

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s really the purpose of our trip

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving them a hope for the future.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
let’s enjoy our trip

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the Kalahari.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve been, as a family,

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:49.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involved with unassigned territory
for about 30 years.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:51.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it’s just a privilege

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring the truth
to these different cultures.

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is probably the only chance

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will have
in this distant part of the world

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find the truth.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you talk to them about the truth,

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see how people enjoy listening;

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:09.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is something that changes in their eyes.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.810 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The joy that we get as a family

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.113 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from teaching people about Jehovah

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is just incomparable;

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really rejuvenates our ministry.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the meeting for field service.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will see two demonstrations

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:32.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presenting the good news to a Herero

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a San householder.

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You put that piece of literature

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the person’s hand;
you feel a sort of peace.

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:46.276 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My grandmother came into contact

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Witnesses
through unassigned territory.

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She moved to the city to attend meetings,
and I went with her.

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:56.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned the truth from her,

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:58.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later we were baptized.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the translation office in Windhoek,

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I have a part in the translation

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the literature for people
who live in remote areas like these.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We live very far in the bush,

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:17.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I was happy
when they came for the first time.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even asked them: “Who sent you

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to my place?

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is the right place
that you are visiting.”

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These books help me understand my Bible.

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:32.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really helps us also,

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a family,

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is seeing Jehovah’s creation.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been camping here
at the big baobab tree.

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:42.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure it’s thousands of years old.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really does show you
exactly how Jehovah feels

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about every person in his organization.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, if he is willing
to send six vehicles and over 30 brothers

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to find one person

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one territory about 600 kilometers
(370 mi) from any congregation,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
then he must have great love for each person

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation.

00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:13.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah looks at people

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:16.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or at countries, he doesn’t see

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.867 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
groups or nationalities,

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he sees individuals.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really his will

00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that each individual human being

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get to know him, learn to love him,

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have a close relationship with him.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I’m the only

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
San-speaking Witness, I will be thrilled

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:36.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to speak to the San people about God’s Word

00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I have seen how much joy

00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:40.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth has brought me.

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:44.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The old lady we witnessed to yesterday

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I explained to her

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she will also be young,

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fresh skin.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she was very happy
that she could be young again,

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:55.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is going to make a paradise soon.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really nice

00:06:57.767 --> 00:06:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t overlook the children.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could really see

00:07:01.804 --> 00:07:04.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even the ones
that were sitting far came closer

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were seriously watching the Caleb videos.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it can really touch their little hearts.

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am confident in Jehovah’s Word,

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
that all the nations will hear the truth

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even the San people.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they are the last ones
to hear the truth, they will hear it.

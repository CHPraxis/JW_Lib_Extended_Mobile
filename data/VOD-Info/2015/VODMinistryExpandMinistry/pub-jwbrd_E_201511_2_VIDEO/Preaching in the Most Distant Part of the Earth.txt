00:00:01 Our ministry is another kind
00:00:03 of search-and-rescue operation,
00:00:06 and we search wherever people can be found.
00:00:10 For example, in the following report,
00:00:13 notice the efforts our brothers made
00:00:15 to reach people living in the remotest areas of Africa.
00:00:24 Jesus made the bold statement at Acts 1:8:
00:00:27 “You will be witnesses of me . . .
00:00:30 to the most distant part of the earth.”
00:00:33 This resonates deeply in the country of Namibia.
00:00:38 These warm and beautiful people are spread
00:00:42 across great expanses of dramatic and thirsty land.
00:00:48 The people
00:00:49 are not only separated by physical distances
00:00:51 but they’re also separated
00:00:53 by cultures,
00:00:56 ancient traditions,
00:00:58 and historic injustices.
00:01:02 Since the South Africa branch office
00:01:04 oversees the work in this territory,
00:01:06 we are pleased to assist a group of brothers
00:01:10 from the capital city, Windhoek,
00:01:12 with a special witnessing trip.
00:01:14 So, brothers, our journey will start
00:01:16 in Windhoek,
00:01:19 and we’re going to travel to Gam first.
00:01:21 From there, we are going to go to Tsumkwe.
00:01:23 We’re going to camp in those two places, Gam and Tsumkwe,
00:01:28 and we may travel a distance of about 1,500 km (900 mi).
00:01:31 Let’s talk safety now.
00:01:33 You want to keep
00:01:35 three creatures out of your tent
00:01:37 —animals such as hyenas, scorpions,
00:01:39 and snakes.
00:01:41 Always zip your tent.
00:01:44 Toilet facilities
00:01:45 —a method that Moses prescribed for the Israelites.
00:01:50 When we enter the Herero home,
00:01:53 enter through the side gate.
00:01:54 This is to show respect
00:01:56 because they have areas in their homesteads
00:01:58 that are restricted for ancestor worship.
00:02:00 Also, they don’t like being asked direct questions.
00:02:03 It would be better to show them pictures
00:02:06 and let them comment.
00:02:07 The theme scripture, 1 Corinthians 9:22,
00:02:11 said: “I have become
00:02:13 “all things to people of all sorts,
00:02:15 “so that I might
00:02:17 by all possible means save some.”
00:02:20 And that’s really the purpose of our trip
00:02:22 —giving them a hope for the future.
00:02:25 Brothers and sisters, let’s enjoy our trip
00:02:28 into the Kalahari.
00:02:44 So we’ve been, as a family,
00:02:46 involved with unassigned territory for about 30 years.
00:02:49 You know, it’s just a privilege
00:02:51 to bring the truth to these different cultures.
00:02:54 This is probably the only chance
00:02:57 that they will have in this distant part of the world
00:03:00 to find the truth.
00:03:03 When you talk to them about the truth,
00:03:05 you see how people enjoy listening;
00:03:07 this is something that changes in their eyes.
00:03:11 The joy that we get as a family
00:03:13 from teaching people about Jehovah
00:03:17 is just incomparable;
00:03:19 it really rejuvenates our ministry.
00:03:23 Welcome to the meeting for field service.
00:03:27 We will see two demonstrations
00:03:29 presenting the good news to a Herero
00:03:32 and a San householder.
00:03:35 You put that piece of literature
00:03:37 in the person’s hand; you feel a sort of peace.
00:03:43 My grandmother came into contact
00:03:46 with the Witnesses through unassigned territory.
00:03:49 She moved to the city to attend meetings, and I went with her.
00:03:54 I learned the truth from her,
00:03:56 and later we were baptized.
00:03:58 I work
00:04:00 in the translation office in Windhoek,
00:04:02 and now I have a part in the translation
00:04:04 of the literature for people who live in remote areas like these.
00:04:12 We live very far in the bush,
00:04:14 so I was happy when they came for the first time.
00:04:17 I even asked them: “Who sent you
00:04:20 “to my place?
00:04:22 Because this is the right place that you are visiting.”
00:04:24 These books help me understand my Bible.
00:04:30 What really helps us also,
00:04:32 as a family,
00:04:35 is seeing Jehovah’s creation.
00:04:37 We’ve been camping here at the big baobab tree.
00:04:39 I’m sure it’s thousands of years old.
00:04:50 It really does show you exactly how Jehovah feels
00:04:53 about every person in his organization.
00:04:55 I mean, if he is willing to send six vehicles and over 30 brothers
00:04:59 just to find one person
00:05:01 in one territory about 600 kilometers (370 mi) from any congregation,
00:05:04 then he must have great love for each person
00:05:08 in the congregation.
00:05:11 When Jehovah looks at people
00:05:13 or at countries, he doesn’t see
00:05:16 groups or nationalities,
00:05:17 but he sees individuals.
00:05:19 And it’s really his will
00:05:21 that each individual human being
00:05:24 get to know him, learn to love him,
00:05:27 and have a close relationship with him.
00:06:29 Since I’m the only
00:06:31 San-speaking Witness, I will be thrilled
00:06:33 to speak to the San people about God’s Word
00:06:36 because I have seen how much joy
00:06:38 the truth has brought me.
00:06:41 The old lady we witnessed to yesterday
00:06:44 —I explained to her
00:06:45 that she will also be young,
00:06:48 with fresh skin.
00:06:51 And then she was very happy that she could be young again,
00:06:53 and Jehovah is going to make a paradise soon.
00:06:55 It’s really nice
00:06:57 that we don’t overlook the children.
00:06:59 You could really see
00:07:01 that even the ones that were sitting far came closer
00:07:04 and were seriously watching the Caleb videos.
00:07:07 So it can really touch their little hearts.
00:07:11 I am confident in Jehovah’s Word,
00:07:14 where it says that all the nations will hear the truth
00:07:18 —even the San people.
00:07:19 Even if they are the last ones to hear the truth, they will hear it.

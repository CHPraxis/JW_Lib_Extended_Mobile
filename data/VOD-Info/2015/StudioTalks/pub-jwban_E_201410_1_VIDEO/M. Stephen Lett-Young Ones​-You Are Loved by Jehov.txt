00:01 I want to address the theme
00:04 “Young Ones—You Are Loved by Jehovah”
00:08 and his organization.
00:10 “Young Ones—You Are Loved by Jehovah”
00:14 and his organization.
00:16 But now,  when we say young ones,
00:20 to whom are we referring?
00:22 As evidence of Jehovah’s love,
00:26 some may immediately think  of the animated series
00:29 of videos entitled  Become Jehovah’s Friend,
00:32 featuring Caleb and Sophia,
00:36 and that has indeed been evidence
00:38 of Jehovah’s  and the Governing Body’s love
00:42 for little children.
00:45 We have gotten hundreds of letters  of appreciation for this series
00:49 from small children  and their parents,
00:52 and even from grandparents.
00:55 But what about you teenagers?
00:58 You too are still young  when compared to adulthood,
01:02 and you are appreciated very much
01:05 when you show your respect  and love for Jehovah.
01:09 Does the Bible indicate anything
01:11 about Jesus’ disposition  as a teenager?
01:15 There are comments  about him as an infant.
01:20 Also in the book of Luke,  it describes Jesus
01:23 as a child of 12 years old.
01:25 Let’s look at that account  and determine
01:29 if it also includes  any comments
01:32 about Jesus’ attitude  as a teenager.
01:37 In Luke 2:42
01:41 it describes Jesus as a preteen
01:45 in saying this,
01:49 Luke 2:42:
01:51 “And when he was 12 years old,
01:55 “they went up  according to the custom of the festival.
01:58 “When the days  of the festival were over
02:01 “and they were returning,
02:03 “the boy Jesus  remained behind in Jerusalem,
02:08 and his parents did not notice it.”
02:12 So his parents  went looking for him
02:15 and finally found him  three days later.
02:19 What was Jesus  focused on as a 12-year-old?
02:24 He was sitting in the temple  talking with the teachers about Jehovah.
02:28 Notice verse 47:
02:31 “But all those listening to him
02:34 “were in constant amazement  at his understanding
02:39 and his answers.”
02:41 What a good example  for you children
02:44 12 years of age and younger
02:47 to talk about Jehovah  with confidence!
02:51 But what was Jesus’ attitude  like as a teenager?
02:57 Please follow along  in verses 51 and 52:
03:02 “Then he [Jesus]  went down with them
03:06 “and returned to Nazareth,
03:09 and he continued subject to them,”
03:13 that is to his parents.
03:16 How old was he?  Twelve.
03:20 But what comes after 12?  Thirteen.
03:23 Notice verse 52:
03:26 “And Jesus went on progressing.”
03:30 You see, after 12,  he “went on progressing
03:34 “in wisdom and in physical growth
03:38 and in favor with God and men.”
03:43 Evidently, then,  Jesus was an intelligent,
03:46 well-balanced teenager.
03:50 But who took note  of his progress as a teen?
03:54 It said: “God and men.”
03:57 Yes, godly children and teenagers
04:00 are appreciated by Jehovah  and by spiritual men.
04:05 Jehovah and his organization  love all you young ones
04:09 who are striving  to do what is right.
04:12 But how do we know  that Jehovah loves all of you?
04:17 Well, if you have your Bible,  turn to Matthew chapter 19,
04:22 and here we see  that Jesus showed
04:26 his high regard  for young ones.
04:30 So Matthew chapter 19,  notice verses 13 and 14:
04:36 “Then young children  were brought to him
04:39 “for him to place his hands  on them and offer prayer,
04:44 but the disciples  reprimanded them.”
04:48 They did not want  the young ones to bother Jesus.
04:52 But notice verse 14:
04:55 “Jesus, however, said:
04:57 “‘Let the young children alone,
05:01 “‘and do not try to stop them  from coming to me,
05:05 for the Kingdom of the heavens  belongs to such ones.’”
05:11 Yes, Jesus welcomed young ones,
05:14 and the Bible tells us that Jesus
05:16 is the perfect reflection of Jehovah.
05:19 So Jesus was imitating  Jehovah’s love for young ones.
05:24 After many wise sayings  and performing miracles,
05:28 Matthew chapter 21 describes Jesus
05:31 riding into Jerusalem  as Jehovah’s anointed one.
05:36 Please notice the difference  between some of the adult’s reactions
05:40 and that of appreciative young ones.
05:42 Matthew 21:15
05:46 tells us this:
05:48 “When the chief priests  and the scribes
05:52 “saw the marvelous things he did
05:55 “and the boys  who were shouting in the temple,
05:58 “‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’
06:01 they became indignant.”
06:05 Who was boldly praising Jesus?
06:08 The scripture said that “the boys”
06:11 were shouting out praise.
06:13 What a contrast those young ones were
06:16 to the religious leaders  who were irritated by all of this.
06:21 Young people, when you speak up  about Jehovah and Jesus,
06:25 they both take notice of you.
06:28 They are proud  of your stand for the truth!
06:33 But how do you know  that the Governing Body
06:35 and the organization loves you?
06:38 Well, they have published  many books
06:40 and magazine articles  specifically for young ones.
06:45 In addition to all  of the printed material, there are
06:49 the Become Jehovah’s Friend videos for children.
06:54 But, you teenagers,  have you been keeping up
06:57 with all of the information  specifically for you
07:00 on jw.org?
07:03 There are dozens of printed articles
07:06 on an array of subjects
07:09 that interest those of your age.
07:12 In so many ways, Jehovah  and his organization show their love
07:17 and appreciation  for all you dear young ones.
07:24 What can you young ones  do in return?
07:27 You may say, ‘I go to all the meetings  and out in service.’
07:32 Well, that is wonderful.
07:34 Some of you may have even joined
07:37 the Theocratic Ministry School already,
07:40 and you help clean  and maintain the Kingdom Hall.
07:43 We warmly commend you  for your good works.
07:48 But if you think about it,  even more important
07:52 is having a good personal relationship  with Jehovah.
07:56 In Luke 10:27 it says:
08:01 “You must love Jehovah your God
08:04 “with your whole heart  and with your whole soul
08:09 and with your whole strength  and with your whole mind.”
08:14 To love Jehovah  with your whole heart
08:17 means that you have  a good personal relationship with him.
08:22 That involves  more than just doing good things.
08:25 It involves praying to him
08:27 about what is in your heart.
08:31 Tell him everything you love  and whatever you fear.
08:37 You can tell Jehovah  very personal things;
08:41 he is not going  to tell anyone else.
08:44 But he can give you  the strength and wisdom
08:47 to handle matters  for the best possible outcome.
08:52 Set up your own  personal Bible study program
08:55 in addition  to Family Worship evening.
08:58 This is how Jehovah  communicates back to you,
09:01 and your relationship with him  will be strengthened.
09:06 You are the next generation  of adults in Jehovah’s organization.
09:12 We continue to need  spiritually qualified ones
09:16 to get Jehovah’s work done.
09:19 A good relationship with Jehovah  as a youth sets you up
09:24 for the best way of life  as a responsible adult.
09:29 Along the way, though,  you will face pressure
09:33 from Satan’s system  that can test your faith.
09:37 But by loving Jehovah  with your whole heart,
09:41 you can get through  any test you may encounter,
09:45 and I mean any test  that you may encounter!

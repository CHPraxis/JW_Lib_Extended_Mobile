00:01 If you have seen our broadcast  of the annual meeting
00:04 that was held last October,
00:06 you are aware of the fact  that our songbook is being revised.
00:10 Well, perhaps  some of you missed that broadcast.
00:13 So you may be wondering,
00:15 ‘Why is it necessary  to make changes to the songbook?’
00:19 Well, as we explained  at the annual meeting,
00:22 some of the expressions used  in our current songbook
00:25 were drawn from the earlier edition  of the New World Translation.
00:29 That translation has been revised,  as you know.
00:33 Instead of  ‘the desirable things of the nations,’
00:37 we now say,  ‘the precious things of the nations.’
00:41 Instead of “loving-kindness,”  we use “loyal love”;
00:45 “long-suffering”   is rendered “patience”;
00:48 and so forth.
00:50 Since some of the terminology used  in the songbook had to be adjusted,
00:54 the Governing Body decided  to add a few songs as well,
00:58 and we are very happy for that.
01:01 Now those in attendance  at the annual meeting this year
01:04 were invited to sing three new songs,
01:07 and one of them  was composed specially
01:10 to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Kingdom.
01:16 If you weren’t present  at the annual meeting this year,
01:19 don’t worry, you’ll get your chance  to learn the new songs—and soon!
01:24 And you won’t have to wait  until the new songbook is released either.
01:28 From time to time,  new songs will be released
01:31 on our website for you to download.
01:34 Not only that, but at times,
01:36 we will even conclude  the service meeting
01:39 by singing one of the new songs.
01:42 Case in point:  During the week of January 5th,
01:46 an entire service meeting  has been set aside
01:50 to help us appreciate  our Kingdom songs.
01:53 One of the new songs  will be sung on that occasion.
01:56 It’s entitled  “The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!”
02:01 You guessed it.
02:03 That’s the song that was composed
02:06 to mark  the Kingdom’s 100th anniversary.
02:08 Would you like to hear it?
02:10 Please listen and watch.
02:27 Jehovah, you always have been, And always you will be.
02:36 You’ve given the throne to your Son; He rules by your decree.
02:45 The Kingdom has been brought to birth; His rulership will fill the earth.
02:54 For now have come to pass Salvation and kingdom and might.
03:03 The Kingdom is in place. We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”
03:14 The time for the Devil is short; We know what this will mean.
03:24 Though living in times of distress, We see the things unseen.
03:33 The Kingdom has been brought to birth; His rulership will fill the earth.
03:42 For now have come to pass Salvation and kingdom and might.
03:51 The Kingdom is in place. We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”
04:04 What a majestic song of praise  to Jehovah!
04:07 Isn’t that beautiful?
04:09 But how can we prepare to sing that song
04:13 as well as the others that will follow?
04:15 We take you now to our studios  in Patterson, New York,
04:19 where our music choral arrangements  are produced.
04:23 We’d like to introduce you  to Brothers Ted Adams and Danny Baker
04:27 who have worked  with our orchestra for years.
04:30 We also have with us  Chris and Susan Mavor,
04:33 who both have a background in music.
04:36 Ted, we’re counting on you and your guests
04:39 to help us prepare to sing the new songs.
04:43 Thank you, Brother Splane.
04:45 Singing is an important,  prominent feature of our worship.
04:49 So we want to be able  to face the challenges
04:51 of singing in a congregation setting.
04:53 There is a special challenge  when we are learning a new song.
04:55 What is that?
04:57 Well, I think learning a new song  is like breaking in a new pair of shoes.
05:01 At first, the new songs aren’t as comfortable as the ones that we’re used to singing,
05:06 but after singing them for a while,
05:09 exerting a little effort,
05:11 well, these could become  our most favorite songs to sing.
05:15 Now, some of us have  a hard time learning new songs.
05:19 But we have to remember  that these new songs
05:21 were composed for a good reason.
05:23 It’s actually a Scriptural reason, isn’t it?
05:24 That’s right.
05:25 You know throughout the Scriptures,  we often see an expression like this:
05:29 “Sing to Jehovah a new song.”
05:33 And the Bible tells us why  new songs were composed and sung
05:38 and why we should learn  new songs today and sing them.
05:41 The 98th Psalm and verse 1  gives us a good reason.
05:45 It says: “Sing to Jehovah a new song,
05:48 for he has done wonderful things.”
05:53 Now, we think about what Jehovah  is doing today with his organization
05:57 —truly wonderful things he’s accomplishing  to glorify his name
06:01 and to help his servants here on earth.
06:04 And each of us, in our personal lives,
06:06 have experienced Jehovah’s wonderful things in our lives personally.
06:11 Not only that, the new songs also reflect
06:13 a clearer understanding of the Bible
06:16 as well as expressing the love  that we have for Jehovah
06:19 and our appreciation for his tender care.
06:22 So when we get these new songs,
06:24 we can think about what Jehovah has done for us personally, that’s true,
06:29 but also, especially what he’s doing  with the organization now.
06:32 This should put us  in the right frame of mind and heart
06:35 to really learn the songs.
06:37 But what if we feel
06:40 that we’re just not as good  as the singers on the recordings?
06:45 Well, actually  the singers on the recordings,
06:47 some might be interested to know,  very few of those used for vocal renditions
06:52 have had any professional training  or professional experience.
06:55 So all of them  have had to learn to sing better,
06:58 mainly through practice.
07:00 And that’s comforting for the rest of us.
07:02 We feel like we may not sing so well,  but we all can improve.
07:06 We all can learn to sing better.
07:08 And, of course, the more you sing,  the easier it will become.
07:11 Now some of us hesitate to sing
07:13 because we feel the notes  are a bit too high for us.
07:16 Would you give us some ideas
07:19 how we can change the range of our voice
07:21 and be able to sing these higher notes?
07:23 Well, you know, for young people,   the range is not a problem,
07:27 but as we age, unfortunately,  like the rest of our bodies,
07:30 our voices can lose range  like we lose range of motion.
07:35 So we can regain some of our range
07:38 by doing a type of stretching with our voice,
07:41 just as an athlete would stretch  before a game or before going for a run.
07:45 We can do that very simply  by using like a humming sound
07:49 maybe in the shower, the kitchen, the car,  somewhere you feel comfortable
07:53 and just using a humming sound
07:55 to gently go through your full range  of your voice,
07:59 and then gently pushing the limits of it.
08:02 In that way, we can regain  and maintain the range of our voice.
08:06 So that helps us with the range,  but now what about those high notes?
08:09 Well, those high notes can be  a bit of a challenge, but you know,
08:13 there are a couple of things we can do that will really make them easier to produce.
08:17 One is: We need to make sure  we take a really good breath
08:20 before we sing the phrase  with the high note in it,
08:22 because more breath energy  makes it much easier
08:25 to produce a higher note.
08:27 Also, physiologically,  we need more space in the mouth
08:32 and throat area to make it easier  to produce a high note.
08:35 So we would even see that on the outside,
08:38 when the mouth gets larger,  going from a lower note to a higher note.
08:42 [Vocal exercise]
08:48 Then it won’t feel so tight,  and it is easier to produce a higher note.
08:52 Good.  So those two things are:
08:53 take a deeper, bigger breath  for the high notes
08:56 and then more space  created by the mouth.
08:59 Good.
09:00 Well, now how does  the composing team
09:02 help us with some  of these high note issues?
09:05 Well, the composers  do take the musical range
09:08 of the human voice into account,
09:10 including the range of unskilled singers.
09:12 And in a musical composition,
09:15 in dealing with high notes in particular,
09:17 there are basically two ways  to get up there as a composer.
09:20 One is to walk your way up there,  going up the scale.
09:24 That’s the easier method vocally.
09:27 That’s easier to get up there.
09:29 At times, in a composition,
09:31 there are jumps  from low notes to high notes,
09:34 but there are jumps  which are more logical,
09:37 musically,  which also makes them
09:39 more instinctively comfortable  for us to sing,
09:41 even if we are not trained singers.
09:43 So the compositions have taken  these factors into account,
09:47 and I think, two keys here:
09:49 Number one, what Susan  has been talking about
09:51 is to try and develop  our voices a little more;
09:55 couple that with learning the song.
09:57 And if you have  those two things in place,
10:00 high notes are not the issue  that maybe you thought they would be.
10:05 You know, it sounds  like the fundamentals for good singing
10:09 are basically the same as  for good public speaking.
10:11 Like the instructions we get  in the Ministry School textbook.
10:15 Exactly!
10:16 Maintaining good posture,  standing up nice and straight,
10:19 and being sure to take  good, deep breaths before speaking.
10:23 It’s very true that poor posture  and shallow breathing
10:26 are definitely the enemies  of good singing.
10:29 It’s just the way that Jehovah created us.
10:32 Physiologically, we have  these tiny little vocal chords,
10:36 but when we take a good breath  and send the air through them,
10:39 then it resonates  through our bones and tissues,
10:41 and we can produce sound easily.
10:43 Good.  Thanks, Susan.
10:45 Good ideas on technique.
10:46 Now here’s a problem  that comes up during our meetings.
10:49 Sometimes the piano can’t be heard.
10:52 The volume of the piano  is not high enough.
10:54 And when you  fill the auditorium with voices,
10:58 it just drowns the piano out.
11:00 Now, how can we handle that?
11:02 Well, the key to solving  that problem is
11:04 for the brother at the sound console  to be listening.
11:08 Listening not just to the piano volume
11:12 but listening also to what you referred to —how the singing is going.
11:16 For example, if the singers  can’t stay together
11:20 or if they can’t stay  with the piano recording,
11:22 they’re either ahead of it or behind it,
11:25 then that’s the cue for the sound operator  to turn the piano up.
11:30 So the operator, then,  has to be free to focus on the sound.
11:35 Just as when you are driving a car,
11:38 you have to keep your hand on the wheel  and make adjustments to stay on the road.
11:41 Yes, I think “free”  for that task is the key word there.
11:46 The reality is that at the beginning  of many of our meeting programs,
11:50 the brother or brothers  in our sound department
11:53 are trying to multitask  with various little things
11:56 that happen  right at the beginning of the program.
11:58 And this issue of the piano volume  sometimes just gets overlooked.
12:02 So at least one person back there
12:05 has to be dedicated  exclusively at that moment
12:08 to listening to  and adjusting the piano volume.
12:11 And this would be especially true
12:13 whenever a new song  is scheduled for a program.
12:18 Definitely,  we need to be listening to
12:21 the cues  or the music when it’s being played.
12:24 But you know this doesn’t relieve us  of the personal responsibility
12:27 that each of us has  to become familiar with the music,
12:31 even ahead of time,  before going to the meeting,
12:34 and that way we can be prepared  to sing the songs when we arrive.
12:37 The same way we prepare  for other parts in the meeting.
12:40 That’s right.
12:42 Well, doesn’t that just put us  right in mind of family worship then?
12:44 Because family worship is where
12:46 so much meeting preparation  is done typically.
12:49 So include the music  during family worship.
12:53 Get the songbook out.
12:55 Turn on the piano recording.  Sing along.
12:57 Even better,  if you can play the piano
13:00 or if you play the guitar,  do it live, and sing to it live.
13:04 Simplified chords are up there  on jw.org that we can download,
13:08 but even for social occasions,
13:12 social gatherings, we can sing the songs.
13:15 The idea is:  Prepare for this part of our worship
13:18 with the congregation or even  for our assemblies and conventions.
13:21 Yeah, you know, the faithful slave  has really given us the tools
13:25 to be well prepared not only  at our congregation meetings
13:27 but also at these events:  the assemblies and conventions.
13:31 Months ahead of time the programs are posted on the website.
13:36 And in those programs are the songs that will be sung at these events,
13:40 and so we can be well-prepared  by downloading, as you mentioned,
13:44 the piano music  or the sheet music from jw.org
13:48 and include that  in our preparation for these assemblies.
13:52 And you mentioned downloading  a number of things, but is that hard to do?
13:57 Well, they’ve tried  to make it as simple as possible.
13:59 On the home page  is the Publications tab.
14:02 You click on that; it brings up a tab  on the left side that says Music.
14:07 You click on that,  and all the music products are right there:
14:10 the MP3s for the vocal renditions,
14:14 the piano accompaniment,  orchestral arrangements.
14:17 There’s also a tab  for the songbook Sing to Jehovah.
14:21 If you click on that,  there’s a PDF tab,
14:24 and it gives you all the sheet music  that you need,
14:27 including the simplified guitar chords.
14:30 Well, you know, Ted,  as simple as that sounds, we do understand
14:33 that many still find navigating websites  to be a challenging thing,
14:38 and at the same time we know  that some of our brothers and sisters
14:41 still don’t own the equipment,
14:43 the computer equipment  to do their own downloads.
14:45 This is where the congregation,
14:47 and in particular  the elders and ministerial servants,
14:50 can take the lead in helping  everyone to have these materials.
14:55 Because as we help each other that way,
14:57 especially the brothers taking the lead,
14:59 then this really engenders  a spirit of enthusiasm,
15:03 interest in this feature of our worship.
15:07 It seems like we have  all the tools that we need, then,
15:09 to learn the new songs and be well-prepared  to sing them at our congregation meetings
15:14 with the help of the elders,  even as brought out here.
15:17 And it really is important to do that  because some of the songs,
15:20 besides not knowing  the melodies or the words,
15:23 also could be written in a particular style
15:26 that maybe we’re not used to singing in.
15:28 And so when we listen  to the music ahead of time,
15:31 then we can become better familiar  not just with the tune and the words
15:35 but also the style  in which they are written.
15:39 Well, Chris,  because you mention musical style,
15:42 this brings up another personal matter,  I think, for many of us,
15:45 and that’s how we view music itself.
15:48 The point here is  that it’s all too common in this world
15:53 to just be the product  of the entertainment industry
15:56 with respect to our musical tastes.
15:58 They’re in the business of selling  what you might call “ear candy.”
16:01 What that means is that anything  that just quickly catches the ear
16:05 and catches on  and becomes popular, well,
16:06 that’s a very marketable product,  and they make a lot of money selling it.
16:10 Well, it’s kind of like candy  that we like to eat when we are children.
16:15 And we still like it when we grow up too,
16:17 but the point is that when we are children,  that’s kind of all we want.
16:21 Later on, we have to learn
16:23 to appreciate and enjoy the foods
16:26 that are really better for us  and the ones that we really need.
16:30 Well, the music that we use in our worship
16:33 is kind of like that healthy food.
16:35 We might not yet have the taste for it,
16:37 but we need to develop it
16:39 because it’s there to nourish us spiritually.
16:43 The Governing Body wants us all  to sing praises to Jehovah.
16:47 Just like back in King Jehoshaphat’s time
16:50 when the army was going out into battle,
16:52 there was singing, and the scripture says
16:55 they were  “joyfully singing praises” to Jehovah.
16:58 So we want to use  all the tools that we have
17:01 to learn the new songs  and just start singing.
17:04 You know, Ted, I couldn’t help but think  about that Scriptural reference;
17:07 it really indicates that those men  were not at all timid
17:11 about singing praises to Jehovah God.
17:14 And really that sets a pattern for us today.
17:17 We should not feel shy or timid  about singing at the Kingdom Hall
17:21 or at any of our meetings —praises to Jehovah God.
17:25 And certainly we have the tools now  to learn these new songs
17:29 and to be  just like those ancient Israelites,
17:32 singing praises to Jehovah  with full heart and joy.
17:35 What you just said, Chris,  really helps to make the point
17:38 that we should view  our singing in worship
17:41 as we view our prayers.
17:43 That matter of being timid,
17:46 well, prayer is not always easy,
17:48 even private prayer is not always easy.
17:51 Sometimes we are praying  about something painful
17:54 or difficult or something that’s  kind of confusing at the time.
17:58 So we’re struggling  for the clear thought.
18:01 We’re struggling even  for the words to use in the prayer,
18:03 even though it’s a private prayer.
18:05 But we still manage  to give that prayer to Jehovah
18:09 because we love him
18:11 and because we want  to continue worshipping him.
18:14 That’s why, even people  with limited vocabularies
18:17 can still pray very successfully,  very effectively to Jehovah.
18:22 And maybe that’s the way  some of us are as singers.
18:24 We’re limited.  But that’s OK.
18:28 We still do it,  and we’re not timid about it.
18:31 We do it for the same important reasons  that we love Jehovah
18:35 and that we  want to worship him in this way.
18:38 When we get the new songs,  we want to be excited about learning them.
18:42 These new songs express our devotion,  our feeling for Jehovah.
18:47 They also keep us in harmony  with the greater understanding of scriptures
18:52 and, of course,  how Jehovah deals with us personally.
18:55 Now we’ll go back to our studio in Brooklyn.
18:59 Thank you so much, panel.
19:01 Your insights have been most helpful.

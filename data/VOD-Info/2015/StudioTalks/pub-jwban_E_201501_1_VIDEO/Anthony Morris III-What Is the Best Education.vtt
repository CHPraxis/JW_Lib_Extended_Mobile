00:01.450 --> 00:03.753
Back in 2005, 


00:03.753 --> 00:06.890
the faithful slave provided counsel 


00:06.890 --> 00:09.225
regarding higher education 


00:09.225 --> 00:12.028
in the October 1, 2005, issue 


00:12.028 --> 00:15.765
of The Watchtower, pages 26-31. 


00:15.765 --> 00:18.368
The article was entitled 


00:18.368 --> 00:22.971
“Parents—What Future Do You 
Want for Your Children?” 


00:22.972 --> 00:27.477
The cover of the very next issue, 
October 15, 2005, 


00:27.477 --> 00:32.000
asked the question: 
“What Is the Best Education?” 


00:33.115 --> 00:35.718
You may have noticed 
that we’ve not published 


00:35.718 --> 00:39.921
that thorough of a discussion 
on the subject since that time. 


00:39.922 --> 00:42.325
Why is that? 


00:42.325 --> 00:45.528
Has the Governing Body 
changed its position 


00:45.528 --> 00:49.798
regarding the pursuit 
of higher secular education? 


00:49.798 --> 00:51.801
No. 


00:51.802 --> 00:55.605
We feel that all of the cautions 
that we have addressed 


00:55.605 --> 00:58.908
in the past are still valid. 


00:58.908 --> 01:03.480
However, 
our goal now is to focus on 


01:03.480 --> 01:06.215
and intensify our promotion 


01:06.215 --> 01:09.885
of the pursuit of divine education. 


01:09.885 --> 01:12.822
If parents and young ones 
are motivated 


01:12.822 --> 01:16.794
to avidly pursue divine education, 


01:16.793 --> 01:20.230
the quest for higher secular education 


01:20.230 --> 01:23.232
becomes less and less of an issue. 


01:23.232 --> 01:27.204
As most of you know, 
I am a father. 


01:27.203 --> 01:31.073
My wife and I 
raised two boys in the truth


01:31.073 --> 01:34.810
—once a father, always a father. 


01:34.810 --> 01:38.448
So even though my sons 
are grown and married, 


01:38.448 --> 01:41.316
I still think like a father, 


01:41.317 --> 01:44.420
and that is why I wanted 
to address this subject 


01:44.420 --> 01:47.000
on JW Broadcasting.


01:48.057 --> 01:50.059
Higher education: 


01:50.058 --> 01:53.830
What do we mean 
when we use that expression? 


01:53.830 --> 01:57.167
The October 1, 2005, issue 
of The Watchtower, 


01:57.167 --> 02:01.170
that I referred to earlier, 
provided a definition. 


02:01.170 --> 02:04.507
It used the example 
of the educational system 


02:04.507 --> 02:07.710
in the United States, 
acknowledging that it involves


02:07.710 --> 02:12.082
12 years of basic education 
in public schools. 


02:12.082 --> 02:16.887
Then it stated: 
“Thereafter, students may choose 


02:16.887 --> 02:21.090
“to attend university . . . 
for four or more years, 


02:21.090 --> 02:24.627
“leading to a bachelor’s degree 
or to postgraduate studies 


02:24.627 --> 02:29.432
“for careers in medicine, law, 
engineering, and so forth. 


02:29.432 --> 02:33.302
“Such university education 
is what is meant 


02:33.302 --> 02:36.874
when the term 
‘higher education’ is used.” 


02:36.873 --> 02:41.076
It further stated:
“On the other hand, 


02:41.077 --> 02:45.014
“there are technical 
and vocational schools, 


02:45.013 --> 02:48.350
“offering short-term courses 
that result 


02:48.350 --> 02:53.000
in a certificate or diploma 
in some trade or service.” 


02:54.257 --> 02:57.894
We realize educational systems 
vary from place to place. 


02:57.893 --> 02:59.895
In some countries, 


02:59.895 --> 03:03.667
higher education is provided 
by the government free of charge.


03:03.667 --> 03:08.470
However, the cost 
of obtaining university training 


03:08.470 --> 03:11.073
is not our primary concern. 


03:11.073 --> 03:15.278
It is the potential for spiritual harm 
that has moved us 


03:15.278 --> 03:19.148
to provide the cautions 
we have shared in the past. 


03:19.148 --> 03:23.753
Ultimately, it is 
the decision of the parents 


03:23.753 --> 03:27.823
as to the amount of secular education 
they feel is necessary 


03:27.823 --> 03:32.000
for a child to later care 
for a family of his own. 


03:33.028 --> 03:37.400
As parents, we would be remiss
if we did not encourage our child 


03:37.400 --> 03:40.770
to pursue a skill or trade
that would enable him 


03:40.770 --> 03:43.000
to start off a marriage successfully. 


03:44.307 --> 03:48.444
Having said that, 
it does not change the fact 


03:48.443 --> 03:51.246
that all too often our young people


03:51.247 --> 03:53.449
have met with spiritual disaster, 


03:53.448 --> 03:56.518
especially after leaving home 


03:56.518 --> 03:59.000
and living on a university campus. 


04:00.323 --> 04:04.626
So, parents and children,
you need to have a goal, 


04:04.627 --> 04:07.297
and you need to have a plan. 


04:07.297 --> 04:10.334
If you’re missing either one, 


04:10.333 --> 04:13.000
Satan will provide it for you. 


04:14.037 --> 04:17.207
Young people, ask yourself: 


04:17.207 --> 04:21.310
‘Why am I considering 
additional education? 


04:21.310 --> 04:25.748
‘Is it because I’m pursuing 
a specific skill or trade


04:25.748 --> 04:28.785
‘to support 
my service to Jehovah? 


04:28.785 --> 04:33.322
‘Or have I been pressured 
by the system into believing 


04:33.322 --> 04:36.092
‘that higher education 
will somehow make me 


04:36.092 --> 04:41.999
a more respected person 
or lead me to a better life?’


04:41.998 --> 04:44.133
Let me review the Scriptural basis 


04:44.133 --> 04:46.735
for our previous published concerns 


04:46.735 --> 04:48.938
about higher education. 


04:48.938 --> 04:53.943
As an example, 
1 Corinthians 15:33 says: 


04:53.943 --> 04:58.000
“Bad associations 
spoil useful habits.” 


04:59.682 --> 05:02.419
While it is true 
that the ancient city of Corinth


05:02.418 --> 05:04.953
was known 
for its immoral lifestyle, 


05:04.953 --> 05:08.556
what was the apostle Paul 
primarily concerned about 


05:08.557 --> 05:11.827
when he penned those words? 


05:11.827 --> 05:14.030
In verse 12 of the same chapter, 


05:14.030 --> 05:18.100
he made clear that his comment 
about “bad associations” 


05:18.100 --> 05:21.970
had to do with what
the other persons believed, 


05:21.970 --> 05:24.000
it was a doctrinal issue. 


05:26.042 --> 05:28.644
If we are in continued association 


05:28.643 --> 05:30.946
with those who
do not believe the same, 


05:30.947 --> 05:34.000
it can erode 
our thinking and convictions. 


05:35.818 --> 05:38.553
Some have felt that
spending time with nonbelievers


05:38.553 --> 05:42.725
in a university setting is no different
than working secularly


05:42.725 --> 05:45.628
with those who
do not share our beliefs. 


05:45.628 --> 05:50.000
And, in fact, bad associations 
in the workplace can be a real danger. 


05:51.100 --> 05:56.005
However, it is one thing 
to work on a job with others 


05:56.005 --> 05:59.542
and quite another matter 
to immerse oneself 


05:59.542 --> 06:02.000
in an institution of learning. 


06:03.747 --> 06:05.949
At Romans 12:2,


06:05.948 --> 06:10.953
Paul said to “stop being molded 
by this system of things, 


06:10.953 --> 06:15.000
but be transformed 
by making your mind over.” 


06:16.725 --> 06:19.328
We are to be careful 
that this system 


06:19.328 --> 06:22.000
does not mold, 
or shape, our thinking. 


06:23.332 --> 06:26.635
The verse said 
to ‘make over your minds,’ 


06:26.635 --> 06:29.672
not hand over your minds. 


06:29.672 --> 06:33.675
Higher learning 
can easily influence thinking 


06:33.675 --> 06:36.000
and attitudes.


06:38.147 --> 06:42.285
Elders in congregations 
that are in close proximity 


06:42.285 --> 06:47.223
to universities are well aware 
of the repeated scenario 


06:47.223 --> 06:50.091
of parents coming 
to the Kingdom Hall 


06:50.092 --> 06:55.097
with the child that they’re dropping off 
to attend the nearby university. 


06:55.097 --> 06:59.902
Sadly, often in a few weeks or months, 


06:59.902 --> 07:02.505
the child begins missing meetings. 


07:02.505 --> 07:06.000
Not too long into the school year, 
he totally disappears. 


07:07.610 --> 07:10.613
Then the parents are upset 
with the local body of elders 


07:10.613 --> 07:13.000
for not shepherding their child. 


07:14.550 --> 07:16.552
My question is, 


07:16.552 --> 07:20.022
Who dropped them 
off at the university? 


07:20.022 --> 07:24.894
So where does 
the responsibility really lie? 


07:24.893 --> 07:26.895
When we make a decision, 


07:26.895 --> 07:30.000
we must realistically 
also accept the consequences. 


07:31.567 --> 07:36.572
Turn with me 
to 2 Timothy 2:20. 


07:36.572 --> 07:39.642
This was written by Paul 


07:39.642 --> 07:42.845
as an illustration 
for Timothy to consider. 


07:42.845 --> 07:45.582
Now it makes sense 
that the large house 


07:45.582 --> 07:48.550
commented on refers to 
the congregation, 


07:48.550 --> 07:50.687
and the utensils of varying value 


07:50.687 --> 07:54.557
would be like individual members 
of the congregation. 


07:54.557 --> 08:00.000
2 Timothy 2:20-22: 


08:01.363 --> 08:05.768
“Now in a large house there are utensils 
not only of gold and silver 


08:05.768 --> 08:07.970
“but also of wood and earthenware, 


08:07.970 --> 08:11.873
“and some for an honorable use 
but others for a use lacking honor. 


08:11.873 --> 08:14.143
So if anyone keeps clear of,”


08:14.143 --> 08:18.713
or doesn’t associate 
with these, 


08:18.713 --> 08:22.016
“[the latter] ones, 
he will be an instrument


08:22.017 --> 08:25.087
“for an honorable use, sanctified, 


08:25.087 --> 08:27.590
useful to his owner,” 
Jehovah God,


08:27.590 --> 08:30.125
“prepared for every good work. 


08:30.125 --> 08:34.397
“So flee from youthful desires, 
but pursue righteousness, 


08:34.397 --> 08:37.200
“faith, love, peace, 


08:37.200 --> 08:42.000
along with those who call 
on the Lord out of a clean heart.” 


08:43.405 --> 08:45.675
If we should be that careful 


08:45.675 --> 08:49.745
about our association 
inside the congregation, 


08:49.745 --> 08:52.215
the application 
is even more appropriate 


08:52.215 --> 08:55.000
when it comes 
to institutions of secular learning. 


08:56.252 --> 08:58.287
I have long said, 


08:58.287 --> 09:03.092
“The better the university, 
the greater the danger.” 


09:03.092 --> 09:07.162
The most intelligent 
and eloquent professors 


09:07.162 --> 09:10.365
will be trying to reshape 
the thinking of your child, 


09:10.365 --> 09:14.837
and their influence 
can be tremendous. 


09:14.837 --> 09:18.707
One mom, I recall, 
asked me to try and help her son 


09:18.707 --> 09:23.000
who was attending 
a prestigious university in Rhode Island. 


09:24.547 --> 09:27.950
After visiting him, 
I later had to inform her 


09:27.950 --> 09:31.000
that her son 
now believed in evolution. 


09:32.655 --> 09:37.393
She refused to believe it 
until he finally told her himself. 


09:37.393 --> 09:40.000
How sad!


09:42.698 --> 09:47.101
In Romans chapter 14, 
it counsels us 


09:47.102 --> 09:51.774
not to judge, 
or become overly critical of, 


09:51.773 --> 09:53.775
the decisions of others. 


09:53.775 --> 09:57.913
As we mentioned earlier, 
ultimately the parents must decide 


09:57.913 --> 10:02.050
how much education 
a child needs to succeed in life. 


10:02.050 --> 10:05.387
But does that mean 
that any decision a parent makes 


10:05.387 --> 10:10.059
regarding a child’s education 
is fine with Jehovah? 


10:10.058 --> 10:14.863
Follow along with the reasoning 
in Romans chapter 14,


10:14.863 --> 10:17.000
verses 10-12. 


10:19.168 --> 10:21.636
“But why do you judge your brother? 


10:21.637 --> 10:24.640
Or why do you also 
look down on your brother?” 


10:24.640 --> 10:26.275
Here’s a valid point:


10:26.275 --> 10:30.647
‘For he will stand 
before the judgment seat of God. 


10:30.647 --> 10:32.247
‘For it is written: 


10:32.247 --> 10:34.784
‘“As surely as I live,”
says Jehovah, 


10:34.783 --> 10:38.520
‘“to me every knee will bend, 
and every tongue 


10:38.520 --> 10:42.000
will make 
open acknowledgment to God.”’


10:43.492 --> 10:46.495
Here Jehovah guarantees 
that one day 


10:46.495 --> 10:51.367
every person on earth 
will be a true worshipper of him. 


10:51.367 --> 10:54.170
Will you be there? 


10:54.170 --> 10:59.975
Will your son or daughter 
be among those alive at that time? 


10:59.975 --> 11:02.378
Do your personal decisions matter? 


11:02.378 --> 11:04.380
Yes. 


11:04.380 --> 11:06.315
Look at verse 12: 


11:06.315 --> 11:11.153
“So, then, 
each of us will render an account 


11:11.153 --> 11:13.000
for himself to God.” 


11:14.390 --> 11:19.128
Yes, we all 
will have to answer to Jehovah 


11:19.128 --> 11:21.696
for the decisions we make today. 


11:21.697 --> 11:25.969
May we all decide 
to play it safe before our God. 


11:25.968 --> 11:27.903
Think of all the opportunities 


11:27.903 --> 11:30.671
there are now
to enjoy divine education: 


11:30.672 --> 11:32.140
congregation meetings,


11:32.140 --> 11:35.277
family worship, 
assemblies and conventions, 


11:35.277 --> 11:37.345
the jw.org website, 


11:37.345 --> 11:39.815
and the station
you’re watching right now. 


11:39.815 --> 11:42.217
But in addition to all of that, 


11:42.217 --> 11:44.487
the curriculum
for the Pioneer Service School


11:44.487 --> 11:49.125
has been revised and is getting
superb reviews by those attending. 


11:49.125 --> 11:53.328
Then there’s the new curriculum 
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers 


11:53.328 --> 11:56.531
that bolsters and trains 
students for a career 


11:56.532 --> 11:59.302
in a variety of theocratic privileges. 


11:59.302 --> 12:02.439
In addition to promoting divine education, 


12:02.438 --> 12:05.975
what secular skills will we be promoting? 


12:05.975 --> 12:09.512
Skills that’ll be useful 
to God’s organization now 


12:09.512 --> 12:11.547
and after Armageddon. 


12:11.547 --> 12:15.284
For example, 
we need construction skills 


12:15.283 --> 12:17.886
around the world right now! 


12:17.887 --> 12:19.889
And think about this: 


12:19.888 --> 12:22.691
We will not need doctors or lawyers 


12:22.692 --> 12:26.495
after Armageddon, 
but we will need carpenters 


12:26.495 --> 12:30.000
and plumbers 
and similar construction trades. 


12:31.167 --> 12:35.404
It requires faith 
to decline higher education 


12:35.403 --> 12:39.341
and have the confidence 
that our material needs will be cared for 


12:39.342 --> 12:43.000
by training 
in other fields of employment.


12:45.815 --> 12:49.017
Speaking of lawyers, 
we have an interesting perspective 


12:49.017 --> 12:52.755
from Brother Philip Brumley 
of the Legal Department. 


12:52.755 --> 12:55.157
Let’s go to our Patterson studio


12:55.157 --> 12:57.092
and listen to an interview of him 


12:57.092 --> 12:59.595
conducted by Brother David Schafer, 


12:59.595 --> 13:02.097
a helper to the Teaching Committee.


13:02.097 --> 13:04.934
Thank you very much, Brother Morris. 


13:04.933 --> 13:06.335
And we’re delighted to have with us 


13:06.335 --> 13:07.737
Brother Philip Brumley, 


13:07.737 --> 13:09.139
overseer of the Legal Department. 


13:09.138 --> 13:10.505
He’s been a full-time servant 


13:10.505 --> 13:12.575
for the past 41 years 


13:12.575 --> 13:14.410
and for the last 28 years


13:14.410 --> 13:16.845
has been overseer
of the Legal Department. 


13:16.845 --> 13:18.447
Brother Brumley,
thank you very much 


13:18.447 --> 13:20.349
for taking the time to be with us today. 


13:20.348 --> 13:22.350
I know you have a very busy schedule.


13:22.350 --> 13:23.952
My pleasure.


13:23.952 --> 13:25.955
How did it come about that you came


13:25.955 --> 13:27.000
to work in the Legal Department?


13:28.523 --> 13:31.993
So I was working 
in the carpenter shop one day, 


13:31.993 --> 13:35.196
and I got a telephone call 
from Brother Charles Steele. 


13:35.197 --> 13:38.600
The Governing Body asked Brother Steele 


13:38.600 --> 13:40.435
who could go through law school 


13:40.435 --> 13:42.270
to become an attorney. 


13:42.270 --> 13:44.640
The organization 
needed a few attorneys 


13:44.640 --> 13:46.842
to help defend the rights 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


13:46.842 --> 13:49.110
So Brother Steele asked me or, 


13:49.110 --> 13:50.645
basically, gave me the assignment, 


13:50.645 --> 13:52.000
“We want you to become a lawyer.”


13:53.015 --> 13:57.000
So the organization made a decision 
to send you through law school. 


13:58.353 --> 14:00.821
What effect did that have on you?


14:00.822 --> 14:04.025
Something happened 
that I was not prepared for. 


14:04.025 --> 14:08.230
When a person goes to law school, 
the instructors, 


14:08.230 --> 14:12.000
law professors, 
essentially tell the class: 


14:12.000 --> 14:14.337
“You’re the hope of humanity. 


14:14.337 --> 14:17.940
“You happen to have been born 
in the best country on this planet, 


14:17.940 --> 14:20.342
“and you happen to be 
among the few in this country 


14:20.342 --> 14:23.679
“who have the circumstances 
to be able to attend law school. 


14:23.678 --> 14:26.215
“You are the future presidents, 


14:26.215 --> 14:29.218
“governors, senators, judges. 


14:29.218 --> 14:32.821
“But not only that, 
you’re also the future social activists


14:32.822 --> 14:35.524
“—the ones who are going 
to protect the disenfranchised, 


14:35.523 --> 14:39.561
“the poor, the one who needs 
their rights protected. 


14:39.562 --> 14:43.899
“If you do well, 
civilization will do well. 


14:43.898 --> 14:47.570
If you do poorly, 
humanity may not survive.” 


14:47.570 --> 14:49.905
Now that may sound 
like a grandiose statement, 


14:49.905 --> 14:53.342
but when you hear that repeated 
over a four-year period, 


14:53.342 --> 14:56.312
it can start creeping into your mind. 


14:56.312 --> 14:58.814
Another thing that happened, 
related to that,


14:58.813 --> 15:03.251
was there’s a fierce spirit
of competition in law school, 


15:03.252 --> 15:07.624
and I brought with me the notion 
of ‘This is a Bethel assignment, 


15:07.623 --> 15:10.791
so I want to do well
—not just well, but very well.’ 


15:10.792 --> 15:14.497
And David, in the first year, 
I scored rather poorly, 


15:14.497 --> 15:16.632
and that shocked me. 


15:16.632 --> 15:19.302
I thought, 
‘I have to do better than this!’ 


15:19.302 --> 15:23.772
A deep spirit of competition 
came into my being 


15:23.772 --> 15:27.242
where I would devote 
whatever time was required to do well. 


15:27.242 --> 15:30.245
And, in one sense, it worked 
because when I graduated, 


15:30.245 --> 15:34.783
I graduated cum laude, which means 
in the top ten percent of the class. 


15:34.783 --> 15:39.555
But both the spirit of competition 


15:39.555 --> 15:44.427
and the thought 
that somehow you were special 


15:44.427 --> 15:48.497
because you had this training 
had marked my personality.


15:48.497 --> 15:52.567
So how did you come to discern 


15:52.567 --> 15:57.172
that this kind of thinking 
was rubbing off on you?


15:57.172 --> 16:00.575
In all candor, David, 
I didn’t discern. 


16:00.575 --> 16:03.245
It wasn’t until after I had gotten 
out of law school 


16:03.245 --> 16:06.182
that my wife, Elizabeth, 
sat me down one day 


16:06.182 --> 16:10.052
and in so many words told me, 
“You’re not the man I married.” 


16:10.052 --> 16:12.587
And I was taken aback. 
“What do you mean?” 


16:12.587 --> 16:15.457
She pointed out the character flaws 


16:15.457 --> 16:17.559
that had developed in me: 


16:17.558 --> 16:20.461
ambition, egotism, 


16:20.462 --> 16:24.232
selfishness, combativeness, 
being argumentative. 


16:24.232 --> 16:26.235
And the more I listened to her, 


16:26.235 --> 16:28.570
the more I realized, 
‘She’s absolutely right!’


16:28.570 --> 16:33.508
I had allowed these defects 
to creep into my personality. 


16:33.508 --> 16:36.645
The next thing 
was what to do about it. 


16:36.645 --> 16:40.515
And it’s not like going into a dark room 
and flipping on the light. 


16:40.515 --> 16:44.587
It’s not like recognizing that you have 
character flaws that need work 


16:44.587 --> 16:47.000
and next week 
you’ve got it cared for. 


16:48.357 --> 16:51.427
In all candor, David, 
it was a lengthy process 


16:51.427 --> 16:54.229
to get these elements 
out of my system.


16:54.228 --> 16:56.231
What did you do?


16:56.232 --> 16:58.334
We had to get back into or— 


16:58.333 --> 17:02.805
I had to get back 
into a genuine spiritual routine 


17:02.805 --> 17:07.175
and to reassess the motives 
behind what I was doing. 


17:07.175 --> 17:10.745
Rather than being self-motivated,
as in, 


17:10.745 --> 17:14.483
‘I want to do a good job 
so that it looks good for me, 


17:14.483 --> 17:19.153
or it reflects well on me,’ 
the real point is to serve Jehovah, 


17:19.153 --> 17:21.123
to seek Kingdom interest, 


17:21.123 --> 17:23.125
to do what Jehovah
wants to have done. 


17:23.125 --> 17:27.195
So the actual routine


17:27.195 --> 17:29.998
—real earnest prayer, 


17:29.998 --> 17:32.868
reading the Bible daily, 


17:32.868 --> 17:36.471
going to the meetings 
and really participating in them, 


17:36.472 --> 17:38.474
and having a meaningful ministry


17:38.473 --> 17:40.875
—getting those spiritual priorities 


17:40.875 --> 17:43.578
first in my life again, 


17:43.578 --> 17:45.980
as they had been before, 


17:45.980 --> 17:48.150
put me back on the right track.


17:48.150 --> 17:50.852
So this was a number
of years ago now. 


17:50.852 --> 17:53.022
You’re all better? 


17:53.022 --> 17:56.392
You perceive no residual effects, 


17:56.392 --> 17:58.060
then, from the training?


17:58.060 --> 18:00.328
We have to keep working 
on these things. 


18:00.328 --> 18:02.330
You always have to assess motivation. 


18:02.330 --> 18:05.000
A sister who’s serving here 
in the Bethel family, 


18:05.000 --> 18:08.603
who also has 
several degrees to her name, 


18:08.603 --> 18:10.538
said it well when she said, 


18:10.538 --> 18:14.643
“I’m still working to get the venom 
of self-importance out of my mind.” 


18:14.643 --> 18:18.080
So I work very hard, David, 


18:18.080 --> 18:22.350
to make sure that humility 
is not a front but it’s from my bones


18:22.350 --> 18:24.820
—it’s really what I am on the inside. 


18:24.820 --> 18:25.887
When the scripture says: 


18:25.887 --> 18:28.157
‘Doing nothing
out of contentiousness, 


18:28.157 --> 18:31.294
but looking at others 
as being superior to you,’


18:31.293 --> 18:33.295
that’s the attitude to have. 


18:33.295 --> 18:37.232
And then, candidly, 
you give Jehovah something to bless. 


18:37.232 --> 18:41.404
When we obtain a legal victory 
or a development happens 


18:41.403 --> 18:43.405
that’s favorable
to Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


18:43.405 --> 18:45.407
all thanks go to Jehovah 


18:45.407 --> 18:47.409
because in the years
that I’ve been serving


18:47.408 --> 18:48.743
in the Legal Department, 


18:48.743 --> 18:52.480
I can assure you that
it is not because of the expertise 


18:52.480 --> 18:55.050
of those of us who happen to have 
this privilege of service. 


18:55.050 --> 18:58.953
Rather, it’s because there’s 
a spiritual motivation to our work 


18:58.953 --> 19:01.623
to where we work hard
and then see 


19:01.623 --> 19:03.958
what Jehovah wants
to do with the matter.


19:03.958 --> 19:05.326
And time and again, David, 


19:05.327 --> 19:07.762
we’ve seen Jehovah’s hand 
in our work. 


19:07.762 --> 19:10.432
And when something 
favorable happens, 


19:10.432 --> 19:12.534
rather than in any way thinking, 


19:12.533 --> 19:14.870
‘Well that was because I 
did such a good job,’


19:14.870 --> 19:19.040
the genuine reality of it 
is that Jehovah did a good job. 


19:19.040 --> 19:21.008
This is what Jehovah
wanted to have happen,


19:21.008 --> 19:23.811
and that’s why we were successful.


19:23.812 --> 19:26.549
So Philip, you’re an attorney; 
you serve at Bethel. 


19:26.548 --> 19:30.551
Undoubtedly, young people have come 
to you asking your opinion on this. 


19:30.552 --> 19:32.820
What do you tell a young person 
who’s considering 


19:32.820 --> 19:34.890
pursuing higher education?


19:34.890 --> 19:37.725
Well, the first thing 
that anyone should do 


19:37.725 --> 19:39.160
is to ask themselves 


19:39.160 --> 19:42.163
to closely examine themselves 
as to the motive. 


19:42.163 --> 19:45.066
Is the motive really 
to seek first the Kingdom, 


19:45.067 --> 19:48.270
to use some additional schooling 


19:48.270 --> 19:51.172
to facilitate pioneering
or serving at Bethel 


19:51.172 --> 19:53.275
or serving where there’s
a greater need? 


19:53.275 --> 19:55.510
Or, actually, is the motive


19:55.510 --> 19:58.147
one of obtaining 
a certain standard of living 


19:58.147 --> 20:00.149
or a certain degree of prominence? 


20:00.148 --> 20:02.283
So the real core issue is, 


20:02.283 --> 20:06.821
Why is an individual 
obtaining this additional training? 


20:06.822 --> 20:10.825
The second thing 
for someone to keep in mind is 


20:10.825 --> 20:13.562
to be focused on what they 
really are going to learn. 


20:13.562 --> 20:17.832
To attend a university, 
learning things that have little to do 


20:17.832 --> 20:20.269
with what one can do to earn a living, 


20:20.268 --> 20:22.703
really serves no purpose. 


20:22.703 --> 20:25.240
On the other hand,
if a person happens to have


20:25.240 --> 20:28.043
an inclination towards medicine, 


20:28.043 --> 20:32.046
well, becoming a nurse 
rather than becoming a doctor 


20:32.047 --> 20:34.049
could be an appropriate step. 


20:34.048 --> 20:37.118
If a person has an inclination 
towards the law, 


20:37.118 --> 20:40.088
becoming a paralegal
rather than an attorney


20:40.088 --> 20:41.856
could be an appropriate step. 


20:41.857 --> 20:45.727
You see, a person 
could be a nurse or paralegal 


20:45.727 --> 20:49.932
and easily work part-time 
and support himself as a pioneer. 


20:49.932 --> 20:53.335
But if a person 
becomes a doctor or an attorney, 


20:53.335 --> 20:56.772
what you will find is that you 
will invariably have to work full-time. 


20:56.772 --> 21:00.675
You will invariably have to be paying off 
significant student debt, 


21:00.675 --> 21:03.312
and it’s going to take quite a lot of time 


21:03.312 --> 21:04.814
to get this kind of degree. 


21:04.813 --> 21:07.348
So rather than devoting


21:07.348 --> 21:09.918
—or allowing this world to consume—


21:09.918 --> 21:13.388
four, six, eight, or ten years of studies, 


21:13.388 --> 21:17.058
why not focus on two years of study 


21:17.058 --> 21:20.528
to get some technical training 
that would facilitate, or help, 


21:20.528 --> 21:23.000
someone to become 
a good regular pioneer?


21:24.332 --> 21:25.334
Well said. 


21:25.333 --> 21:27.468
Thank you very much 
for taking the time with us today. 


21:27.468 --> 21:30.005
It’s been a real delight 
to be with you. 


21:30.005 --> 21:31.072
And now we go back 


21:31.072 --> 21:33.009
to Brother Morris in Brooklyn.


21:33.008 --> 21:35.076
Thank you, brothers, for sharing 


21:35.077 --> 21:37.612
that very interesting perspective 


21:37.612 --> 21:41.417
about the subtle mental conditioning 
that can transpire 


21:41.417 --> 21:44.119
when exposed to higher education. 


21:44.118 --> 21:48.923
Brother Brumley’s experience 
in law school was nearly 30 years ago. 


21:48.923 --> 21:51.860
Given the spiritual dangers 
involved, though,


21:51.860 --> 21:53.528
the Governing Body has decided


21:53.528 --> 21:56.331
that if we need additional
attorneys in the future, 


21:56.332 --> 21:59.200
we will not expose 
a member of the Bethel family 


21:59.200 --> 22:02.103
to the environment 
of higher education. 


22:02.103 --> 22:05.640
One brother likened his experience 
in a university setting 


22:05.640 --> 22:08.910
to being in a house that is on fire. 


22:08.910 --> 22:11.580
Spiritually speaking, he said: 


22:11.580 --> 22:14.315
“Even if you escape alive, 


22:14.315 --> 22:17.118
“your clothes still smell like smoke. 


22:17.118 --> 22:19.386
It has an effect on you.” 


22:19.387 --> 22:22.590
Higher education often instills 


22:22.590 --> 22:26.595
a sense of superiority 
and self-reliance 


22:26.595 --> 22:30.398
that is in direct opposition 
to the Christian personality. 


22:30.398 --> 22:32.633
Like the smell of smoke on clothes, 


22:32.633 --> 22:35.270
these traits can be absorbed very quickly 


22:35.270 --> 22:38.340
and can be very difficult to get rid of 


22:38.340 --> 22:42.010
once they’re part 
of the fabric of your personality.


22:42.010 --> 22:44.645
A circuit overseer sent me a letter 


22:44.645 --> 22:46.615
in which he described what he called 


22:46.615 --> 22:49.650
“a picture-perfect Witness family” 


22:49.650 --> 22:52.320
until the oldest son received 


22:52.320 --> 22:55.657
a full scholarship
to attend a university. 


22:55.657 --> 22:59.694
The university was
an hour and 45-minute drive from home.


22:59.693 --> 23:04.000
The family wrestled with the decision 
to send him off for his extra schooling. 


23:05.500 --> 23:08.370
Finally, the opportunity 
to get this education, 


23:08.370 --> 23:11.973
basically free of charge, won out. 


23:11.973 --> 23:16.376
The scholarship included housing 
in a coed dorm at the university. 


23:16.377 --> 23:19.580
Within just a few weeks, 
the son called his parents to say 


23:19.580 --> 23:23.585
that he could not remain faithful 
to Jehovah in this environment. 


23:23.585 --> 23:26.788
He begged his parents 
to let him come back home. 


23:26.788 --> 23:29.656
The parents told him, “No, 


23:29.657 --> 23:33.195
“this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 


23:33.195 --> 23:35.197
Figure it out.” 


23:35.197 --> 23:37.199
The short story is: 


23:37.198 --> 23:39.233
The son left the truth, 


23:39.233 --> 23:41.970
the parents divorced, 


23:41.970 --> 23:46.307
his siblings 
are not doing anything for Jehovah


23:46.307 --> 23:48.477
—so sad. 


23:48.477 --> 23:50.879
The opportunity of a lifetime 


23:50.878 --> 23:54.415
turned out to be not much
of a life at all. 


23:54.415 --> 23:57.752
In contrast, one mother 
who was a single parent 


23:57.752 --> 23:59.754
related this experience. 


23:59.753 --> 24:01.956
When her son was
a senior in high school, 


24:01.957 --> 24:04.559
he was offered
a university scholarship. 


24:04.558 --> 24:06.895
The mom was concerned
when her son 


24:06.895 --> 24:10.165
seemed to be considering 
accepting the scholarship. 


24:10.165 --> 24:14.368
She did not initially 
come right out and say no. 


24:14.368 --> 24:18.706
Instead, she expressed her view 
by reminding him of the principle 


24:18.707 --> 24:23.712
of giving our firstfruits, 
our best, to Jehovah. 


24:23.712 --> 24:27.649
She said: “The years 
after high school are your best years 


24:27.648 --> 24:31.118
“because you are young 
and strong and healthy 


24:31.118 --> 24:34.923
“and you don’t have a lot of obligations 
to complicate your life. 


24:34.923 --> 24:39.793
“Why not give your firstfruits 
to Jehovah and pioneer for a year, 


24:39.793 --> 24:43.798
and then consider how much 
additional education is required?”


24:43.798 --> 24:46.466
Her son decided to pioneer 


24:46.467 --> 24:49.905
and work part-time 
instead of accepting his scholarship. 


24:49.905 --> 24:52.240
He later served at Bethel. 


24:52.240 --> 24:56.043
Looking back, 
he is absolutely convinced 


24:56.043 --> 24:59.000
that this was the best decision 
he could have made.


25:00.315 --> 25:04.185
As a father, 
my heart goes out to you parents. 


25:04.185 --> 25:06.722
And please understand 
that we want 


25:06.722 --> 25:09.590
the same thing 
for your children that you do. 


25:09.590 --> 25:11.593
We want them to be able to care 


25:11.593 --> 25:14.595
for their future 
physical needs responsibly. 


25:14.595 --> 25:16.665
But at the same time, 


25:16.665 --> 25:20.868
an extended application 
of 3 John 4 applies. 


25:20.868 --> 25:22.670
There it says: 


25:22.670 --> 25:25.873
“No greater joy do I have than this: 


25:25.873 --> 25:30.745
that I should hear that my children 
go on walking in the truth.” 


25:30.745 --> 25:33.882
Remember, divine education 


25:33.882 --> 25:49.882
truly is the opportunity 
of an everlasting lifetime.

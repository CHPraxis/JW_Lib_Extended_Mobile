00:01 Back in 2005,
00:03 the faithful slave provided counsel
00:06 regarding higher education
00:09 in the October 1, 2005, issue
00:12 of The Watchtower, pages 26-31.
00:15 The article was entitled
00:18 “Parents—What Future Do You  Want for Your Children?”
00:22 The cover of the very next issue,  October 15, 2005,
00:27 asked the question:  “What Is the Best Education?”
00:33 You may have noticed  that we’ve not published
00:35 that thorough of a discussion  on the subject since that time.
00:39 Why is that?
00:42 Has the Governing Body  changed its position
00:45 regarding the pursuit  of higher secular education?
00:49 No.
00:51 We feel that all of the cautions  that we have addressed
00:55 in the past are still valid.
00:58 However,  our goal now is to focus on
01:03 and intensify our promotion
01:06 of the pursuit of divine education.
01:09 If parents and young ones  are motivated
01:12 to avidly pursue divine education,
01:16 the quest for higher secular education
01:20 becomes less and less of an issue.
01:23 As most of you know,  I am a father.
01:27 My wife and I  raised two boys in the truth
01:31 —once a father, always a father.
01:34 So even though my sons  are grown and married,
01:38 I still think like a father,
01:41 and that is why I wanted  to address this subject
01:44 on JW Broadcasting.
01:48 Higher education:
01:50 What do we mean  when we use that expression?
01:53 The October 1, 2005, issue  of The Watchtower,
01:57 that I referred to earlier,  provided a definition.
02:01 It used the example  of the educational system
02:04 in the United States,  acknowledging that it involves
02:07 12 years of basic education  in public schools.
02:12 Then it stated:  “Thereafter, students may choose
02:16 “to attend university . . .  for four or more years,
02:21 “leading to a bachelor’s degree  or to postgraduate studies
02:24 “for careers in medicine, law,  engineering, and so forth.
02:29 “Such university education  is what is meant
02:33 when the term  ‘higher education’ is used.”
02:36 It further stated: “On the other hand,
02:41 “there are technical  and vocational schools,
02:45 “offering short-term courses  that result
02:48 in a certificate or diploma  in some trade or service.”
02:54 We realize educational systems  vary from place to place.
02:57 In some countries,
02:59 higher education is provided  by the government free of charge.
03:03 However, the cost  of obtaining university training
03:08 is not our primary concern.
03:11 It is the potential for spiritual harm  that has moved us
03:15 to provide the cautions  we have shared in the past.
03:19 Ultimately, it is  the decision of the parents
03:23 as to the amount of secular education  they feel is necessary
03:27 for a child to later care  for a family of his own.
03:33 As parents, we would be remiss if we did not encourage our child
03:37 to pursue a skill or trade that would enable him
03:40 to start off a marriage successfully.
03:44 Having said that,  it does not change the fact
03:48 that all too often our young people
03:51 have met with spiritual disaster,
03:53 especially after leaving home
03:56 and living on a university campus.
04:00 So, parents and children, you need to have a goal,
04:04 and you need to have a plan.
04:07 If you’re missing either one,
04:10 Satan will provide it for you.
04:14 Young people, ask yourself:
04:17 ‘Why am I considering  additional education?
04:21 ‘Is it because I’m pursuing  a specific skill or trade
04:25 ‘to support  my service to Jehovah?
04:28 ‘Or have I been pressured  by the system into believing
04:33 ‘that higher education  will somehow make me
04:36 a more respected person  or lead me to a better life?’
04:41 Let me review the Scriptural basis
04:44 for our previous published concerns
04:46 about higher education.
04:48 As an example,
1 Corinthians 15:33 says:
04:53 “Bad associations  spoil useful habits.”
04:59 While it is true  that the ancient city of Corinth
05:02 was known  for its immoral lifestyle,
05:04 what was the apostle Paul  primarily concerned about
05:08 when he penned those words?
05:11 In verse 12 of the same chapter,
05:14 he made clear that his comment  about “bad associations”
05:18 had to do with what the other persons believed,
05:21 it was a doctrinal issue.
05:26 If we are in continued association
05:28 with those who do not believe the same,
05:30 it can erode  our thinking and convictions.
05:35 Some have felt that spending time with nonbelievers
05:38 in a university setting is no different than working secularly
05:42 with those who do not share our beliefs.
05:45 And, in fact, bad associations  in the workplace can be a real danger.
05:51 However, it is one thing  to work on a job with others
05:56 and quite another matter  to immerse oneself
05:59 in an institution of learning.
06:03 At Romans 12:2,
06:05 Paul said to “stop being molded  by this system of things,
06:10 but be transformed  by making your mind over.”
06:16 We are to be careful  that this system
06:19 does not mold,  or shape, our thinking.
06:23 The verse said  to ‘make over your minds,’
06:26 not hand over your minds.
06:29 Higher learning  can easily influence thinking
06:33 and attitudes.
06:38 Elders in congregations  that are in close proximity
06:42 to universities are well aware  of the repeated scenario
06:47 of parents coming  to the Kingdom Hall
06:50 with the child that they’re dropping off  to attend the nearby university.
06:55 Sadly, often in a few weeks or months,
06:59 the child begins missing meetings.
07:02 Not too long into the school year,  he totally disappears.
07:07 Then the parents are upset  with the local body of elders
07:10 for not shepherding their child.
07:14 My question is,
07:16 Who dropped them  off at the university?
07:20 So where does  the responsibility really lie?
07:24 When we make a decision,
07:26 we must realistically  also accept the consequences.
07:31 Turn with me  to 2 Timothy 2:20.
07:36 This was written by Paul
07:39 as an illustration  for Timothy to consider.
07:42 Now it makes sense  that the large house
07:45 commented on refers to  the congregation,
07:48 and the utensils of varying value
07:50 would be like individual members  of the congregation.
07:54 2 Timothy 2:20-22:
08:01 “Now in a large house there are utensils  not only of gold and silver
08:05 “but also of wood and earthenware,
08:07 “and some for an honorable use  but others for a use lacking honor.
08:11 So if anyone keeps clear of,”
08:14 or doesn’t associate  with these,
08:18 “[the latter] ones,  he will be an instrument
08:22 “for an honorable use, sanctified,
08:25 useful to his owner,”  Jehovah God,
08:27 “prepared for every good work.
08:30 “So flee from youthful desires,  but pursue righteousness,
08:34 “faith, love, peace,
08:37 along with those who call  on the Lord out of a clean heart.”
08:43 If we should be that careful
08:45 about our association  inside the congregation,
08:49 the application  is even more appropriate
08:52 when it comes  to institutions of secular learning.
08:56 I have long said,
08:58 “The better the university,  the greater the danger.”
09:03 The most intelligent  and eloquent professors
09:07 will be trying to reshape  the thinking of your child,
09:10 and their influence  can be tremendous.
09:14 One mom, I recall,  asked me to try and help her son
09:18 who was attending  a prestigious university in Rhode Island.
09:24 After visiting him,  I later had to inform her
09:27 that her son  now believed in evolution.
09:32 She refused to believe it  until he finally told her himself.
09:37 How sad!
09:42 In Romans chapter 14,  it counsels us
09:47 not to judge,  or become overly critical of,
09:51 the decisions of others.
09:53 As we mentioned earlier,  ultimately the parents must decide
09:57 how much education  a child needs to succeed in life.
10:02 But does that mean  that any decision a parent makes
10:05 regarding a child’s education  is fine with Jehovah?
10:10 Follow along with the reasoning  in Romans chapter 14,
10:14 verses 10-12.
10:19 “But why do you judge your brother?
10:21 Or why do you also  look down on your brother?”
10:24 Here’s a valid point:
10:26 ‘For he will stand  before the judgment seat of God.
10:30 ‘For it is written:
10:32 ‘“As surely as I live,” says Jehovah,
10:34 ‘“to me every knee will bend,  and every tongue
10:38 will make  open acknowledgment to God.”’
10:43 Here Jehovah guarantees  that one day
10:46 every person on earth  will be a true worshipper of him.
10:51 Will you be there?
10:54 Will your son or daughter  be among those alive at that time?
10:59 Do your personal decisions matter?
11:02 Yes.
11:04 Look at verse 12:
11:06 “So, then,  each of us will render an account
11:11 for himself to God.”
11:14 Yes, we all  will have to answer to Jehovah
11:19 for the decisions we make today.
11:21 May we all decide  to play it safe before our God.
11:25 Think of all the opportunities
11:27 there are now to enjoy divine education:
11:30 congregation meetings,
11:32 family worship,  assemblies and conventions,
11:35 the jw.org website,
11:37 and the station you’re watching right now.
11:39 But in addition to all of that,
11:42 the curriculum for the Pioneer Service School
11:44 has been revised and is getting superb reviews by those attending.
11:49 Then there’s the new curriculum  for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
11:53 that bolsters and trains  students for a career
11:56 in a variety of theocratic privileges.
11:59 In addition to promoting divine education,
12:02 what secular skills will we be promoting?
12:05 Skills that’ll be useful  to God’s organization now
12:09 and after Armageddon.
12:11 For example,  we need construction skills
12:15 around the world right now!
12:17 And think about this:
12:19 We will not need doctors or lawyers
12:22 after Armageddon,  but we will need carpenters
12:26 and plumbers  and similar construction trades.
12:31 It requires faith  to decline higher education
12:35 and have the confidence  that our material needs will be cared for
12:39 by training  in other fields of employment.
12:45 Speaking of lawyers,  we have an interesting perspective
12:49 from Brother Philip Brumley  of the Legal Department.
12:52 Let’s go to our Patterson studio
12:55 and listen to an interview of him
12:57 conducted by Brother David Schafer,
12:59 a helper to the Teaching Committee.
13:02 Thank you very much, Brother Morris.
13:04 And we’re delighted to have with us
13:06 Brother Philip Brumley,
13:07 overseer of the Legal Department.
13:09 He’s been a full-time servant
13:10 for the past 41 years
13:12 and for the last 28 years
13:14 has been overseer of the Legal Department.
13:16 Brother Brumley, thank you very much
13:18 for taking the time to be with us today.
13:20 I know you have a very busy schedule.
13:22 My pleasure.
13:23 How did it come about that you came
13:25 to work in the Legal Department?
13:28 So I was working  in the carpenter shop one day,
13:31 and I got a telephone call  from Brother Charles Steele.
13:35 The Governing Body asked Brother Steele
13:38 who could go through law school
13:40 to become an attorney.
13:42 The organization  needed a few attorneys
13:44 to help defend the rights  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
13:46 So Brother Steele asked me or,
13:49 basically, gave me the assignment,
13:50 “We want you to become a lawyer.”
13:53 So the organization made a decision  to send you through law school.
13:58 What effect did that have on you?
14:00 Something happened  that I was not prepared for.
14:04 When a person goes to law school,  the instructors,
14:08 law professors,  essentially tell the class:
14:12 “You’re the hope of humanity.
14:14 “You happen to have been born  in the best country on this planet,
14:17 “and you happen to be  among the few in this country
14:20 “who have the circumstances  to be able to attend law school.
14:23 “You are the future presidents,
14:26 “governors, senators, judges.
14:29 “But not only that,  you’re also the future social activists
14:32 “—the ones who are going  to protect the disenfranchised,
14:35 “the poor, the one who needs  their rights protected.
14:39 “If you do well,  civilization will do well.
14:43 If you do poorly,  humanity may not survive.”
14:47 Now that may sound  like a grandiose statement,
14:49 but when you hear that repeated  over a four-year period,
14:53 it can start creeping into your mind.
14:56 Another thing that happened,  related to that,
14:58 was there’s a fierce spirit of competition in law school,
15:03 and I brought with me the notion  of ‘This is a Bethel assignment,
15:07 so I want to do well —not just well, but very well.’
15:10 And David, in the first year,  I scored rather poorly,
15:14 and that shocked me.
15:16 I thought,  ‘I have to do better than this!’
15:19 A deep spirit of competition  came into my being
15:23 where I would devote  whatever time was required to do well.
15:27 And, in one sense, it worked  because when I graduated,
15:30 I graduated cum laude, which means  in the top ten percent of the class.
15:34 But both the spirit of competition
15:39 and the thought  that somehow you were special
15:44 because you had this training  had marked my personality.
15:48 So how did you come to discern
15:52 that this kind of thinking  was rubbing off on you?
15:57 In all candor, David,  I didn’t discern.
16:00 It wasn’t until after I had gotten  out of law school
16:03 that my wife, Elizabeth,  sat me down one day
16:06 and in so many words told me,  “You’re not the man I married.”
16:10 And I was taken aback.  “What do you mean?”
16:12 She pointed out the character flaws
16:15 that had developed in me:
16:17 ambition, egotism,
16:20 selfishness, combativeness,  being argumentative.
16:24 And the more I listened to her,
16:26 the more I realized,  ‘She’s absolutely right!’
16:28 I had allowed these defects  to creep into my personality.
16:33 The next thing  was what to do about it.
16:36 And it’s not like going into a dark room  and flipping on the light.
16:40 It’s not like recognizing that you have  character flaws that need work
16:44 and next week  you’ve got it cared for.
16:48 In all candor, David,  it was a lengthy process
16:51 to get these elements  out of my system.
16:54 What did you do?
16:56 We had to get back into or—
16:58 I had to get back  into a genuine spiritual routine
17:02 and to reassess the motives  behind what I was doing.
17:07 Rather than being self-motivated, as in,
17:10 ‘I want to do a good job  so that it looks good for me,
17:14 or it reflects well on me,’  the real point is to serve Jehovah,
17:19 to seek Kingdom interest,
17:21 to do what Jehovah wants to have done.
17:23 So the actual routine
17:27 —real earnest prayer,
17:29 reading the Bible daily,
17:32 going to the meetings  and really participating in them,
17:36 and having a meaningful ministry
17:38 —getting those spiritual priorities
17:40 first in my life again,
17:43 as they had been before,
17:45 put me back on the right track.
17:48 So this was a number of years ago now.
17:50 You’re all better?
17:53 You perceive no residual effects,
17:56 then, from the training?
17:58 We have to keep working  on these things.
18:00 You always have to assess motivation.
18:02 A sister who’s serving here  in the Bethel family,
18:05 who also has  several degrees to her name,
18:08 said it well when she said,
18:10 “I’m still working to get the venom  of self-importance out of my mind.”
18:14 So I work very hard, David,
18:18 to make sure that humility  is not a front but it’s from my bones
18:22 —it’s really what I am on the inside.
18:24 When the scripture says:
18:25 ‘Doing nothing out of contentiousness,
18:28 but looking at others  as being superior to you,’
18:31 that’s the attitude to have.
18:33 And then, candidly,  you give Jehovah something to bless.
18:37 When we obtain a legal victory  or a development happens
18:41 that’s favorable to Jehovah’s Witnesses,
18:43 all thanks go to Jehovah
18:45 because in the years that I’ve been serving
18:47 in the Legal Department,
18:48 I can assure you that it is not because of the expertise
18:52 of those of us who happen to have  this privilege of service.
18:55 Rather, it’s because there’s  a spiritual motivation to our work
18:58 to where we work hard and then see
19:01 what Jehovah wants to do with the matter.
19:03 And time and again, David,
19:05 we’ve seen Jehovah’s hand  in our work.
19:07 And when something  favorable happens,
19:10 rather than in any way thinking,
19:12 ‘Well that was because I  did such a good job,’
19:14 the genuine reality of it  is that Jehovah did a good job.
19:19 This is what Jehovah wanted to have happen,
19:21 and that’s why we were successful.
19:23 So Philip, you’re an attorney;  you serve at Bethel.
19:26 Undoubtedly, young people have come  to you asking your opinion on this.
19:30 What do you tell a young person  who’s considering
19:32 pursuing higher education?
19:34 Well, the first thing  that anyone should do
19:37 is to ask themselves
19:39 to closely examine themselves  as to the motive.
19:42 Is the motive really  to seek first the Kingdom,
19:45 to use some additional schooling
19:48 to facilitate pioneering or serving at Bethel
19:51 or serving where there’s a greater need?
19:53 Or, actually, is the motive
19:55 one of obtaining  a certain standard of living
19:58 or a certain degree of prominence?
20:00 So the real core issue is,
20:02 Why is an individual  obtaining this additional training?
20:06 The second thing  for someone to keep in mind is
20:10 to be focused on what they  really are going to learn.
20:13 To attend a university,  learning things that have little to do
20:17 with what one can do to earn a living,
20:20 really serves no purpose.
20:22 On the other hand, if a person happens to have
20:25 an inclination towards medicine,
20:28 well, becoming a nurse  rather than becoming a doctor
20:32 could be an appropriate step.
20:34 If a person has an inclination  towards the law,
20:37 becoming a paralegal rather than an attorney
20:40 could be an appropriate step.
20:41 You see, a person  could be a nurse or paralegal
20:45 and easily work part-time  and support himself as a pioneer.
20:49 But if a person  becomes a doctor or an attorney,
20:53 what you will find is that you  will invariably have to work full-time.
20:56 You will invariably have to be paying off  significant student debt,
21:00 and it’s going to take quite a lot of time
21:03 to get this kind of degree.
21:04 So rather than devoting
21:07 —or allowing this world to consume—
21:09 four, six, eight, or ten years of studies,
21:13 why not focus on two years of study
21:17 to get some technical training  that would facilitate, or help,
21:20 someone to become  a good regular pioneer?
21:24 Well said.
21:25 Thank you very much  for taking the time with us today.
21:27 It’s been a real delight  to be with you.
21:30 And now we go back
21:31 to Brother Morris in Brooklyn.
21:33 Thank you, brothers, for sharing
21:35 that very interesting perspective
21:37 about the subtle mental conditioning  that can transpire
21:41 when exposed to higher education.
21:44 Brother Brumley’s experience  in law school was nearly 30 years ago.
21:48 Given the spiritual dangers  involved, though,
21:51 the Governing Body has decided
21:53 that if we need additional attorneys in the future,
21:56 we will not expose  a member of the Bethel family
21:59 to the environment  of higher education.
22:02 One brother likened his experience  in a university setting
22:05 to being in a house that is on fire.
22:08 Spiritually speaking, he said:
22:11 “Even if you escape alive,
22:14 “your clothes still smell like smoke.
22:17 It has an effect on you.”
22:19 Higher education often instills
22:22 a sense of superiority  and self-reliance
22:26 that is in direct opposition  to the Christian personality.
22:30 Like the smell of smoke on clothes,
22:32 these traits can be absorbed very quickly
22:35 and can be very difficult to get rid of
22:38 once they’re part  of the fabric of your personality.
22:42 A circuit overseer sent me a letter
22:44 in which he described what he called
22:46 “a picture-perfect Witness family”
22:49 until the oldest son received
22:52 a full scholarship to attend a university.
22:55 The university was an hour and 45-minute drive from home.
22:59 The family wrestled with the decision  to send him off for his extra schooling.
23:05 Finally, the opportunity  to get this education,
23:08 basically free of charge, won out.
23:11 The scholarship included housing  in a coed dorm at the university.
23:16 Within just a few weeks,  the son called his parents to say
23:19 that he could not remain faithful  to Jehovah in this environment.
23:23 He begged his parents  to let him come back home.
23:26 The parents told him, “No,
23:29 “this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
23:33 Figure it out.”
23:35 The short story is:
23:37 The son left the truth,
23:39 the parents divorced,
23:41 his siblings  are not doing anything for Jehovah
23:46 —so sad.
23:48 The opportunity of a lifetime
23:50 turned out to be not much of a life at all.
23:54 In contrast, one mother  who was a single parent
23:57 related this experience.
23:59 When her son was a senior in high school,
24:01 he was offered a university scholarship.
24:04 The mom was concerned when her son
24:06 seemed to be considering  accepting the scholarship.
24:10 She did not initially  come right out and say no.
24:14 Instead, she expressed her view  by reminding him of the principle
24:18 of giving our firstfruits,  our best, to Jehovah.
24:23 She said: “The years  after high school are your best years
24:27 “because you are young  and strong and healthy
24:31 “and you don’t have a lot of obligations  to complicate your life.
24:34 “Why not give your firstfruits  to Jehovah and pioneer for a year,
24:39 and then consider how much  additional education is required?”
24:43 Her son decided to pioneer
24:46 and work part-time  instead of accepting his scholarship.
24:49 He later served at Bethel.
24:52 Looking back,  he is absolutely convinced
24:56 that this was the best decision  he could have made.
25:00 As a father,  my heart goes out to you parents.
25:04 And please understand  that we want
25:06 the same thing  for your children that you do.
25:09 We want them to be able to care
25:11 for their future  physical needs responsibly.
25:14 But at the same time,

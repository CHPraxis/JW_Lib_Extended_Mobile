00:00:06 When I was 14, things that happened in the past
00:00:10 started to catch up with me emotionally.
00:00:15 And I felt like everything that happened in my life was my fault.
00:00:21 I did then try to take my life.
00:00:24 When I was little, a family friend sexually abused me,
00:00:29 and he continued to do so for many years.
00:00:37 I didn’t tell anyone what was going on.
00:00:40 I didn’t even tell my dad.
00:00:42 I just tried to act normal —to block it all out.
00:00:48 I remember that Dad looked into lots
00:00:50 of different religions while I was growing up.
00:00:53 Then one day Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on our door.
00:00:57 Their sincerity was very evident.
00:00:59 They were clearly interested
00:01:01 in us as people and were sincerely offering
00:01:05 for us to get to know Jehovah and the Bible.
00:01:10 Learning from the Bible that God says
00:01:12 that he will take my right hand,
00:01:15 that he will fortify me, that he will really help me
00:01:20 —it blew me away!
00:01:24 When I went to a Kingdom Hall,
00:01:26 I could feel the love and sincerity and warmth
00:01:30 of everyone in there right away, and it put me at ease.
00:01:39 Jehovah has done so much for me personally.
00:01:43 I want to help as many people benefit from that same relationship with our God.
00:01:49 For the last 12 years,
00:01:51 I’ve been doing full-time Bible education work.
00:01:59 Of course, my life is not perfect.
00:02:02 I still struggle from time to time,
00:02:06 especially with negative thinking and emotions.
00:02:13 Sometimes I need to get up and do something,
00:02:16 do some physical activity.
00:02:19 Sometimes when I have the memories coming back,
00:02:24 it’s like I’m watching a bad movie,
00:02:27 and somehow I need to change the channel.
00:02:31 I like to pray down at the beach.
00:02:34 It makes me feel very close to Jehovah.
00:02:41 Coming to know Jehovah has given my life
00:02:45 meaning and purpose.
00:02:50 I remember learning the promise from God.
00:02:52 He says that ‘I’m making all things new’
00:02:56 and that ‘these things will not come up into the heart
00:02:58 nor will they come up into the mind.’
00:03:02 I can’t wait for that time, and I’m so grateful for that promise.

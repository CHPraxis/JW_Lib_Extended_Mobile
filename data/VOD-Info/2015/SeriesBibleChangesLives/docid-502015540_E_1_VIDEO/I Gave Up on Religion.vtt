When I gave up on religion,

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was such an emptiness

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I really wanted
to believe in God my whole life.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to believe.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where were you?
You knew I was looking for you, God.”

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt abandoned.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My love for photography
goes way back to about age six,

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I got my first little Kodak Instamatic.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just thought it was a wonderful way
to document the world.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad was very much
a give-back-to-the-community kind of guy.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom,
her biggest quality is empathy.

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So growing up with that,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I saw the best way to be helpful to people

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was to become a priest,

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I thought
that those were the best people

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the best position
to be the most help.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 18,
I went to the college seminary,

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was the road to the priesthood.

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left there angry

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we were all going
through the motions

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ritual.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no authenticity.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few years,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:32.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I entered a monastery in the United States
as a counselor-in-training,

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working with alcoholic priests.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But again,
it reinforced my disappointment

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the church

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here was the big secret.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here was where all the troubled priests went.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that everything I had believed in

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been a lie.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried Zen Buddhism;
I tried Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went through all of the churches,
and there was nothing there.

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “We’re done.”

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By this point, I had a real edge.

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a very, very angry person.

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that the world had done me over.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that was reflected
in my photography.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were less and less people
in the pictures

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more and more buildings and objects.

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a psychology professor,
as a counseling professor,

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mission was accomplished

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if my students could leave that class

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had learned
how to think for themselves

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just to take in
what they were being sold.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a thing about organizations
lying to people.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d been a student of all sorts of learning,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was always something missing.

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Tom asked me to study with him,

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I did feel intimidated

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here you had a man
who was a professional in the secular world;

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a teacher at college
and a psychologist.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, to me, that was a challenge.

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a big old notebook of questions,
and he sat beside me.

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:31.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said,
“So you have some questions.”

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said,
“Yep. Here we go.”

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How does your organization
handle child sexual abuse?

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How does the money work?

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s the check and balance?

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where’s the transparency?”

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:46.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I noticed, what he always did,
he answered them from Scripture.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was revolutionary in my mind

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because these were

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just some institution’s views
or some individual’s views.

00:03:54.338 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the very authority of God.

00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:01.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, studying the Bible

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changed my life for the better

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—completely.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the diversity of the congregation.

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m learning so much

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:18.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how we’re all the same.

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot more pictures of people.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:34.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people lose hope,
they’ve lost everything.

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:38.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by studying the Bible,

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:42.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you learn why there is suffering

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:44.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why people die.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You learn that this whole world
is not spiraling out of control.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming to have a real, personal relationship

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Supreme Sovereign of the universe

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives you hope.

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love what I’m still learning.
I learn every day.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the difference:
I have confidence in what I’m learning,

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidence that it’s the truth.

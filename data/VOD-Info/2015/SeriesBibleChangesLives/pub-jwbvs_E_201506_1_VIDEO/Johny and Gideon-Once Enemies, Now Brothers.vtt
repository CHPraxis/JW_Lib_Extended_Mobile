00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a leader in a far-right organization

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
that actively supported apartheid
in the 1980’s.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were on holiday at the sea,

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there were only black lifeguards.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said to my friends with me that,
“I would rather drown

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
before I would allow a black man
to rescue me in the sea.”

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second day we were there,
the current pulled me out to sea,

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the harder I tried to come out,

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
the deeper the sea pulled me in.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:37.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next moment
I see this black man coming toward me,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I grab him around the neck,
and I almost wanted to kiss him.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:44.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how glad I was to see him
—because I was drowning!

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:46.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was totally exhausted.
I could not go on.

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:50.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though a black man saved my life,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
it did not change my attitude toward them.

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:28.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Times started to change in the late eighties,

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they started to dismantle apartheid.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we aggressively tried
to stop this from happening.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
We even drove an armored vehicle,

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
smashing through the doors,
into the parliament buildings.

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were trying to see
if we could resist these changes

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
with apartheid,
but this did not change things.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I belonged to a church,

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still drank heavily
and had extramarital affairs.

00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:55.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
This led to me and my wife getting divorced.

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was an empty life.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was never really happy.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
A friend of mine
introduced me to the Witnesses.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the brothers I met asked me,

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I prove from the Bible
that something you believe is incorrect,

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will you do?”

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Then I will become a Witness.”

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went on to show me in the Bible 

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:34.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the Bethlehem star
was actually from the Devil

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead the wise men to kill Jesus.

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
This changed my whole life.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Now I can become a Witness.”

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being in the Kingdom Hall,
I noticed that there were many black people.

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was strange for me.

00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:58.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the more I attended,
the more I began to learn that with Jehovah

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:00.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is no partiality.

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
All people are equal.

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began to accept
that this is the way it should be.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Johny and I were brought together

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we were
from completely different political parties.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before,
we would have wanted to kill each other,

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now we have love for one another.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have forgiven one another.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization
changes a person completely.

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:29.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I think back to the kind of person I was,

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what I am now,

00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never want to be what I was then.

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:34.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never!

00:05:38.688 --> 00:05:41.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is such a privilege to be a Witness.

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
People call me a softy, but I do not mind.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have become a softy, but for Jehovah.

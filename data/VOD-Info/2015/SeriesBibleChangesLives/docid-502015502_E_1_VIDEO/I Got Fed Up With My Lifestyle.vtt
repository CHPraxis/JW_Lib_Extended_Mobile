My name is Dmitry Korshunov.

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live in the same city where I was born,

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Kovrov.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a rural town in central Russia.

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I met Dima,
I really enjoyed his company,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:31.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was a kind
and approachable person,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was very sincere with me.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met, dated for two years,
and then were married.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:42.813 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The same year, our daughter was born.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I worked as an electrician.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.159 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since people were poor,

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.745 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
frequently they offered to pay with alcohol.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you live with an alcoholic

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like you live

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on an active volcano.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.474 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sober, he was a good,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.809 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
kind, attentive husband.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he was drunk,

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he was a completely different person.

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.155 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He was angry.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.200 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He wouldn’t listen to anything.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There was a knock at the door.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:51.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They asked me to look at the Bible.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They showed me the reason why

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:01.100 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there is so much suffering,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.686 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and why people are afraid to live today.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My wife read the whole thing.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:15.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I saw that she liked it.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The next time the women came,

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really liked what they told me,

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.541 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
especially about God’s promise

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:27.584 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the paradise on earth,

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:31.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of people living in happiness on the earth.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:35.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So I agreed to a Bible study.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many times they said,

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:42.474 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to join us?”

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:46.103 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d say, “No, I’m not ready for that yet.”

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I reached

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a real breaking point in my life.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked Lubov, “What should I do?”

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:03.495 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So then I suggested that he read the Bible.

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:06.957 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He asked me, “What should I start with?”

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suggested beginning
with the book of Matthew.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I read all night.

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.135 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was like I lived through the events

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:20.137 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was reading about,

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.306 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and they touched my heart deeply.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:25.601 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was then that I decided that,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.770 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until I’ve read the whole Bible,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.230 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t drink another drop.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.111 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, it touched his heart so much

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he wanted to change

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.240 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—change his way of life,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.242 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
change his behavior.

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was a big change,

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:51.126 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because meanwhile, it was quiet at home.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I read the whole Bible,

00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:01.470 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and didn’t drink for seven months.

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:10.562 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I got so fed up with my lifestyle.

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:12.815 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I could not live like that anymore.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.443 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I saw from the Bible that there are 

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:17.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
only two paths,

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I am on the wrong one.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.952 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I pleaded with God

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:26.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and asked him to help me.

00:04:29.123 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had times when he broke off the study

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would drink again.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, it was difficult to pick up
where he left off,

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:45.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to recover, and again study the Bible.

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:50.936 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I realized that without God’s help

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.897 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t crawl out of this hole

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:55.941 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—not on my own.

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible affected Dima very deeply.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before, I felt that he didn’t
think about me at all,

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he only remembered
that I existed when he needed something.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:16.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he’s a completely different person.

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:21.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The atmosphere during
our family worship is warm, 

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:25.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affectionate, and joyful.

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can talk with each other
about spiritual things,

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hear each other’s thoughts,

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:35.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understand what each other has inside,

00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:38.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how each of us loves Jehovah.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joy that I feel every day
cannot be surpassed

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the temporary enjoyment

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:53.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from drinking alcohol
or taking drugs.

00:05:58.378 --> 00:06:01.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life has changed drastically,

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:04.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was Jehovah
who influenced me that way.

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:11.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word made me into who I am now.

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:18.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why I can say
that I am happy.

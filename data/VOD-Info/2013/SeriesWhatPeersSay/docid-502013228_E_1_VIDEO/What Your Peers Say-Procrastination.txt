00:00:04 I wait until the last minute
00:00:05 to do everything.
00:00:06 I know what has to be done,
00:00:08 but I say, “Oh, oh,
00:00:09 I’ll just do it after I finish this,”
00:00:11 or “I’ll just do it after I finish watching this program on TV.”
00:00:17 Sometimes if I try to start early on an assignment,
00:00:20 I don’t have the motivation to get it done.
00:00:23 I think, mainly, the big one for me is TV.
00:00:26 Before you watch it—
00:00:27 You can be watching a pointless reality TV thing,
00:00:30 and it takes up so much of your time.
00:00:32 And then you think after it, you think,
00:00:34 ‘That wasn’t even very good.’
00:00:36 Many people don’t like to rely on a person who is a procrastinator
00:00:39 because they know that they are going to wait until the last second to do something,
00:00:43 and they may not even do it right.
00:00:45 I find that procrastinating does affect my stress levels.
00:00:48 I’ve actually gotten a bit of eczema from it
00:00:52 because it brings it out in my skin because I get so stressed.
00:01:00 In the past, I’ve worked on assignments
00:01:03 and I’ve started early on them
00:01:05 and I’ve started late on other assignments.
00:01:07 The assignments I’ve spent more time on
00:01:09 —taking the time to start on them early— I’ve done so much better on them.
00:01:13 It’s definitely— It’s much better to be organized, I think,
00:01:16 because in the long run, you get so many more things done.
00:01:19 And then at the end of the year or the end of the week, or something,
00:01:22 you can look back and think, ‘I’ve accomplished so much.’

What’s a real friend?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone who brings out the best in you.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:16.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Someone who’s always there for you,

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:18.873 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
even when times are tough.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:21.959 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 18:24 says

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:23.502 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that they can even stick closer

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:24.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
than a brother.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a real friend.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends like that are hard to find.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you worry too much
about being liked by everyone,

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you just may settle for less.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what should you look for?

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t judge a book by its cover.

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for what’s on the inside.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for a friend you can trust,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend who forgives,

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone who doesn’t hold
your mistakes against you.

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to friends, one good friend

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is better than a hundred fake ones.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find a real friend,

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may have to look
outside your comfort zone.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may be where you least expect.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be open-minded.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch out.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t just settle for a clone of yourself.

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Potential friends could have
hobbies or talents that you don’t have.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could be older, or younger.

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could be of a different background
or culture.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t limit yourself.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember,

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:41.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real friends need to have good standards.

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had a friend
who took advantage of you,

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or talked behind your back,

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or spread lies about you?

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You deserve better than that!

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So watch out for toxic friends.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Toxic friends care only
about what they can get out of you.

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tear you down
because of the way you talk,

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way you look,

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even for your beliefs.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Real friends aren’t like that.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They let you be yourself.

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you need to choose smart friends.

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not just book-smart, but smart in life.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the kind that stand for something,

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they show it.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 27:17 says

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that true friends learn from each other,

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as iron sharpens iron.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even make you a better person.

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you get a friend like that?

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t always expect people
to reach out to <i>you.</i>

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:44.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>You </i> need to take the initiative.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take the first step,
and start a conversation.

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do need to talk

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not just about yourself.

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask <i>them</i>  questions.

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then listen.

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really listen.

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, listening is one of the best gifts

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can give a friend.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s time to put in some work.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s right—work.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:13.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have to work

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.966 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to make this friendship grow.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be the kind of friend that’s loyal,

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t hold a grudge.

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be there for <i>them,</i>

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when times get tough.

00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:27.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you do this,

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:29.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your friendship will really grow.

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2:4 says

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:34.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep an eye not just on yourself

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to take an interest in others.

00:03:37.112 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taking an interest in others

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what friendship is all about.

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to meet a lot of people in life.

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:50.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be up to you to choose your friends.

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So choose wisely.

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choose <i>real </i> friends!

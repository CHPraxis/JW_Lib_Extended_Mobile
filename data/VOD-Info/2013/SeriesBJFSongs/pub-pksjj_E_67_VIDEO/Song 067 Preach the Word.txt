00:00:10 God has commanded us this day;
00:00:14 He has given us a charge to obey.
00:00:18 At all times, be ready to impart
00:00:23 The reason for the hope within your heart.
00:00:27 So preach the Word, Oh, how vital that all hear!
00:00:32 Preach the Word, As this system’s end draws near.
00:00:37 Preach the Word, Help the meek to understand.
00:00:41 Preach the Word, Throughout the land!
00:00:49 Seasons of trouble we will face;
00:00:53 Opposition may bring shame and disgrace.
00:00:58 Though preaching may out of season seem,
00:01:03 Our trust is in our God, who is supreme.
00:01:06 So preach the Word, Oh, how vital that all hear!
00:01:11 Preach the Word, As this system’s end draws near.
00:01:16 Preach the Word, Help the meek to understand.
00:01:20 Preach the Word, Throughout the land!
00:01:33 Seasons of favor we will see,
00:01:37 And the need for us to teach, there will be.
00:01:41 The way to salvation we proclaim
00:01:46 And help to sanctify Jehovah’s name.
00:01:50 So preach the Word, Oh, how vital that all hear!
00:01:55 Preach the Word, As this system’s end draws near.
00:02:00 Preach the Word, Help the meek to understand.
00:02:04 Preach the Word, Throughout the land!

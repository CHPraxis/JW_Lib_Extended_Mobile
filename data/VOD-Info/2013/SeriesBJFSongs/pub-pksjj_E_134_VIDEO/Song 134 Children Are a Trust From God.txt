00:00:17 When a man becomes a father
00:00:22 And a woman has a child of her own,
00:00:27 They share a trust, they must remember,
00:00:33 That is not theirs, not theirs alone.
00:00:38 The gift they share is from Jehovah;
00:00:44 Of life and love he is the one true Source.
00:00:49 To parents he gives sure direction
00:00:55 That they may follow the wisest course.
00:01:00 A sacred trust you have been given;
00:01:06 A precious life is in your hands.
00:01:11 You can bestow the greatest favor;
00:01:17 Instruct your child in God’s commands.
00:01:31 All the words God has commanded—
00:01:37 They must always prove to be on your heart.
00:01:42 These words you’ll speak to sons and daughters;
00:01:48 This is your trust, this is your part.
00:01:53 To them you’ll speak along your roadway,
00:01:59 When you rise up and when you are at rest.
00:02:04 In years to come, may they remember,
00:02:10 May they be faithful, may they be blessed.
00:02:15 A sacred trust you have been given;
00:02:21 A precious life is in your hands.
00:02:26 You can bestow the greatest favor;
00:02:32 Instruct your child in God’s commands.

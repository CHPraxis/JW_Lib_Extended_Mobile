Caleb!
Hi. How was school today?

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Sparlock’s magic cape!

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, what toy is that?

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Sparlock, the Warrior Wizard!

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!
A warrior wizard!

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!!!
My friend gave it to me!

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the kids are going to see the movie!

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I see it too?

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, your friend gave this to you.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmmmm, you look pretty excited about this.

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come over here
and get your snack, OK?

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this toy magical?

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb,

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who likes magic, Jehovah or Satan?

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.
Magic is bad.

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Jehovah hates it.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really want to play
with something that Jehovah hates?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember
who we learned about at family worship?

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this?

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam and Eve.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right!

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they obey Jehovah?

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they disobeyed Jehovah

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he got very sad.

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what if you disobey Jehovah
and play with toys he doesn’t like?

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Jehovah will be happy or sad?

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sad.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want Jehovah to be sad?

00:01:57.721 --> 00:01:59.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want Jehovah to be sad with me!

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I don’t want Jehovah
to be sad with you either!

00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think
you should do with this toy?

00:02:16.824 --> 00:02:17.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so proud of you!

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made Mommy very happy.

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know who else is happy?

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah!

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves you very much
for obeying him, Caleb!

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey!
You know what I want to do?

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to go ride bikes!

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yea!

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go!

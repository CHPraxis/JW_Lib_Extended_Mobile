00:00:04 Some of the greatest joys we experience in life
00:00:08 are a result of a happy family life.
00:00:11 But living in these hectic last days,
00:00:14 achieving such happiness is very difficult.
00:00:18 The Governing Body deeply appreciates you hardworking parents
00:00:21 and all that you’re doing to try to help your children find a rich, satisfying life.
00:00:27 As a parent, I remember the challenge we faced
00:00:31 trying to develop love for Jehovah in the hearts of our two little boys.
00:00:35 We used the tools available, the Bible, Watchtower articles.
00:00:40 Then in 1978, how thrilled we were to receive
00:00:44 My Book of Bible Stories.
00:00:46 What a godsend this proved to be!
00:00:50 Over the years,  the Governing Body has provided
00:00:52 many additional teaching aids to help our young ones,
00:00:55 and we have no intention of stopping there.
00:00:59 It is a fact that animated videos
00:01:02 capture the interest of little ones
00:01:04 and can be a powerful teaching tool.
00:01:07 Hence, it’s my privilege, on behalf of the Governing Body,
00:01:11 to introduce to you a new animated video series
00:01:14 entitled Become Jehovah’s Friend.
00:01:18 This is just a preview of what we have in store for you in the future.
00:01:24 Children can learn so much during their formative years.
00:01:28 Lessons they learn at a very young age
00:01:30 can make an impression that lasts a lifetime.
00:01:34 It is our prayer that this new series
00:01:36 will help your children to learn to make God’s heart rejoice.
00:01:41 We love you very much.
00:01:43 But our love for you is just a reflection
00:01:47 of Jehovah’s great love for you and your little ones.
00:01:50 May they learn, develop, and grow
00:01:54 to Become Jehovah’s Friend!

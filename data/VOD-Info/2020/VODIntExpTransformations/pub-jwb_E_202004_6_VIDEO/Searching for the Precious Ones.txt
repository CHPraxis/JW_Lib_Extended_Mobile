00:00:07 I came to Greece as an immigrant when I was just 16 years old.
00:00:11 Because of that, I never felt safe
00:00:13 with people around me.
00:00:16 At that time, I was renting
00:00:18 an apartment from a man who was studying the Bible
00:00:20 with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:24 One day I joined the study,
00:00:26 and the brother invited me to the convention.
00:00:30 I was very cautious at the beginning, but the brother seemed trustworthy.
00:00:37 I always had questions about the true God,
00:00:39 and I wanted to learn more about Him, so I decided to go.
00:00:44 In 2016,
00:00:46 I received an invitation
00:00:48 from my son to attend
00:00:49 the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:51 He was getting baptized at that convention,
00:00:54 and it was important to him for me to be there,
00:00:57 and so he asked me to go.
00:00:59 Even though I was very active in another religion for 30 years,
00:01:03 I went in order to please him.
00:01:07 I learned the truth after I supplicated God with all my strength
00:01:12 because I was really lost.
00:01:14 I asked for answers to questions
00:01:16 that were yet unanswered.
00:01:18 And God answered me.
00:01:20 Jehovah gave me the answer to my prayers when I found this.
00:01:24 This invitation, “Deliverance at Hand!,” was the answer to my prayers.
00:01:31 Arriving there, at that convention, I observed the crowd—many people.
00:01:36 Starting right at the parking lot,
00:01:39 everything was organized; people were entering in an orderly manner.
00:01:43 Inside the Assembly Hall, everyone was very organized,
00:01:46 well-dressed, very loving.
00:01:48 And when the convention began,
00:01:51 I saw such spiritual food that I had never seen in my religion.
00:01:56 Thirty years in a religion —I thought I knew a lot,
00:01:59 but I didn’t know anything.
00:02:02 So I decided to study.
00:02:05 When I arrived at the convention, I started watching the people.
00:02:09 Their faces were smiling.
00:02:11 They seemed to be happy.
00:02:14 There were men, women, and children from different races and nationalities.
00:02:19 When they sang, I could sense their true joy and unity.
00:02:26 For the first time in my life, I felt very safe.
00:02:30 I was not in fear of being taken advantage of.
00:02:35 Also, what I learned at that convention
00:02:38 drew me to the true God.
00:02:42 I thought, ‘If all these people
00:02:44 ‘are truly happy and feel really safe being part of this organization
00:02:48 ‘—Jehovah’s organization—
00:02:51 then, indeed, this is what I was looking for.’
00:02:57 I went to the convention on Sunday.
00:03:00 I was really warmly welcomed by all the brothers and sisters there.
00:03:06 I listened to all of the morning program,
00:03:09 and at noon, I recognized the sound of the truth.
00:03:13 I was sure it was the truth.
00:03:17 I decided to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:19 and I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:21 I got baptized in 2017, and now I serve as a pioneer.
00:03:27 My first study was the following Wednesday.
00:03:30 I was happy to get to know Jehovah.
00:03:33 Now I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:36 and as much as I can, I participate in the invitation campaigns.
00:03:41 I really hope that it helps many people to be delivered.
00:03:45 I started attending meetings right after the convention.
00:03:49 I started a Bible study, and eventually I got baptized
00:03:52 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:56 My mother, one of my brothers,
00:03:58 and my two sisters are now serving Jehovah as well.
00:04:02 Later on, I got married to a faithful sister,
00:04:05 a very good wife, and we serve Jehovah together.
00:04:09 People need to feel safe,
00:04:12 and I know for sure that Jehovah’s organization is the safest place you can be.

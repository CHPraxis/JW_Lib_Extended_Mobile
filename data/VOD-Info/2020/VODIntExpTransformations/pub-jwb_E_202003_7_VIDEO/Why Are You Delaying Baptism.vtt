When I started studying the Bible,

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were various factors
that hindered my study.

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a truck driver,
and I was on the road a lot.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the worst kind
of friendships,

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I smoked.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked, on average, 60 cigarettes a day.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that if I
was going to make the needed adjustments,

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to change my profession.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I changed my job.

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I wanted to get baptized,
I had to stop smoking.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I bought a single cigarette.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lit it, and I prayed to Jehovah.

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did help me

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so much so that I never smoked again.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to this day,
I don’t even have the urge to smoke.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:58.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten years after my first Bible study,
I was baptized.

00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been serving Jehovah for 20 years now,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my wife and all my children.

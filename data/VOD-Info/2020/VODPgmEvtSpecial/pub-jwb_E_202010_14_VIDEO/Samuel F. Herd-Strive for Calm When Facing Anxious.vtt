00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in very stressful times.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:8
indicates that Satan the Devil

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is bitterly angry

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “walks about like a roaring lion.”

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the Bible,

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that God-fearing
worshippers of Jehovah in the past

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced circumstances that produced anxiety.

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Psalm 13:2,
King David asked:

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long will I have anxious concern,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with grief in my heart each day?”

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me Luke 22:42-44.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jesus, a perfect man,
experienced the agony

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense anxiety
on the night of his betrayal.

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is what he prayed at Luke 22:42:

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>Father, if you want to,

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“remove this cup from me.

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, let, not my will,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but yours take place.”

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew what he was in for.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 43:

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>Then an angel from heaven

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appeared to him and strengthened him.”

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An angel was dispatched to encourage Jesus.

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that instantly erase
his anxious concerns?

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 44:

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he was in such agony

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he kept praying more earnestly;

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his sweat became as drops of blood

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
falling to the ground.”

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been
that anxious about anything,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your sweat becoming drops of blood?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably not.

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you did not have the salvation

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the world of mankind on your shoulders!

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is that all
of Jehovah’s servants in these last days

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have bouts of anxiety.

00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many around the world,
it might be the high cost of food,

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clothing, and shelter.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the wake of the pandemic,

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this anxiety is likely being
experienced by more

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers than would
normally be the case.

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you live in neighborhoods
with a high crime rate

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and violence all around.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others face temptation
from workmates or schoolmates

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:59.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be dishonest or immoral.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there are family issues, health issues,

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotional issues, the death of loved ones.

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these can be causes of anxiety.

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others of our brothers and sisters

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face mistreatment and abuse
from family members,

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
governmental oppression,

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from false religious elements
that foment hate and prejudice.

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title of this talk is

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Strive for Calm When Facing Anxious Times.”

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is “calm” even possible?

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah came to the assistance
of his servants in the past.

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, he makes it possible
for us to gain a measure of calm

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:50.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when facing distress or anxiety.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Locate 1 Peter 5:6, 7, please.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 7 describes an action
we can take with our anxiety.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 6 and 7:

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:10.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>Humble yourselves, therefore,

00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:14.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“under the mighty hand of God,

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that he may exalt you in due time,

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while you throw all your anxiety on him,

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he cares for you.”

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the time element in verse 6?

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that Jehovah
will “exalt you in due time.”

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not necessarily immediately.

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are facing anxious moments,

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you do in the meantime?

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the action that’s described in verse 7:

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Throw all your anxiety on [Jehovah].”

00:04:55.232 --> 00:04:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we throw something,

00:04:57.568 --> 00:04:59.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are we left holding in our hand?

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing.

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t keep the anxiety
bottled up inside ourselves.

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:09.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We throw all of it on our God.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be thinking,

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘My anxiety is so heavy and burdensome
that I can’t even pick it up,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let alone throw it anywhere!’

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at a related scripture

00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:30.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Psalms—Psalm 37:5.

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:35.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of “throw,”
it uses the word “commit.”

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5:

00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:42.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:46.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.”

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Commit your way.”

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote says this could be translated:

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:58.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Roll your way upon” Jehovah.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:01.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if your anxiety seems too heavy

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:05.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to throw on Jehovah, give it a push.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:08.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try rolling it on him.

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we “throw,” “commit,”

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:16.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “roll” our anxious thoughts on Jehovah?

00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Philippians 4:6, 7:

00:06:23.237 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer and supplication

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with thanksgiving,

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let your petitions be made known to God;

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:40.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the peace of God

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that surpasses all understanding

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will guard your hearts

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:47.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your mental powers

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We throw

00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or roll our anxiety on Jehovah

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:02.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of fervent prayer.

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:05.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pour your heart out to God.

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:08.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can tell Jehovah anything,

00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:11.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it is embarrassing to you.

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not going to tell anyone about it.

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:21.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throw or roll it on him.

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did verse 7 say
would be the result of such prayers?

00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:30.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that “the peace of God,”

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, a calm tranquility comes over us

00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:39.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we fully trust
Jehovah’s power to sustain us.

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:44.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How else can our heart calm down?

00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:48.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share your anxiety
with trusted friends in the congregation,

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:52.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including an elder you feel comfortable with.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:55.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:25 says

00:07:55.537 --> 00:08:00.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we meet together,
we receive encouragement.

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, in these uncertain times,

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:07.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of meeting together,
it might be that letters,

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:10.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
e-mails, or texts

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your concerned brothers and sisters

00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:15.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have a similar effect.

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:20.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else can have a calming effect on us?

00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading applicable portions of God’s Word

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on them.

00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:32.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in Isaiah chapter 41,

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:42.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is this describing
walking hand in hand with God?

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:45.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is this describing
Jehovah reaching into your life

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:49.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saving you from calamity and anxiety?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s compare two verses in Isaiah 41.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:57.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his promise in verse 10:

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:01.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:06.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:10.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:13.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:09:19.413 --> 00:09:21.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Jehovah tells you

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:24.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be afraid or anxious?

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:26.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he will hold on to you
with his right hand.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 11 and 12,

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it describes some tragic circumstances
we might face in life.

00:09:41.435 --> 00:09:43.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 13:

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:46.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I, Jehovah your God,

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:49.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:54.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid.

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will help you.’”

00:09:58.827 --> 00:10:00.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the point?

00:10:00.954 --> 00:10:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not describing a stroll with God.

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:09.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not describing
walking hand in hand with God.

00:10:09.504 --> 00:10:13.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a rescue mission by God!

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:17.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it was a casual stroll with God,

00:10:17.345 --> 00:10:21.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your left hand would be in his right hand.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:23.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the two verses say

00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:26.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah grasps your right hand

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his right hand.

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is as if Jehovah is facing you.

00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees your dire plight.

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reaches out with his right hand
and grasps your right hand

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pulls you up and out to safety.

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:51.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Specific Bible verses
calm us down and reassure us.

00:10:53.548 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The three aspects we’ve considered:

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:58.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) prayer,

00:10:58.303 --> 00:11:00.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) encouragement from our brothers,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) meditating on the Scriptures

00:11:04.017 --> 00:11:07.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were mentioned by four brothers in Russia

00:11:07.312 --> 00:11:10.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been convicted to prison sentences.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

00:11:17.072 --> 00:11:20.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was detained at the airport
at four in the morning.

00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:24.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right at the check-in desk,
an FSB officer came up to us

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:27.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that investigative measures
were being taken against us.

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:31.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a knock at the door,

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:35.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I understood that they had come for me.

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all happened very quickly.

00:11:38.134 --> 00:11:39.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, they detained us,

00:11:39.594 --> 00:11:42.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they handcuffed us,
then they searched us.

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:46.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A jeep with tinted windows blocked the road.

00:11:46.518 --> 00:11:49.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then with shouts of “Stay where you are!”

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:52.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they twisted my arms and threw me
onto the hood of my automobile.

00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:57.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day, a court imposed
preventive measures on me, and I was taken 

00:11:57.362 --> 00:11:59.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the pretrial detention facility
in Khabarovsk.

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:04.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken to a dark room
in the prison and shut in.

00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then I got on my knees

00:12:06.288 --> 00:12:07.539 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and prayed to Jehovah

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:09.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
telling him that I wanted to stand firm

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:12.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the face of the trials
and remain faithful to him.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in the detention cell, 
every evening 

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:21.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for my friends, my wife,

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:24.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my children
—everyone I know—

00:12:24.222 --> 00:12:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tried to think about their circumstances
and pray specifically.

00:12:29.936 --> 00:12:33.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once, I started praying
to Jehovah for help with tears 

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:36.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because things
were getting very difficult for me.

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:39.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But then things started changing,

00:12:39.738 --> 00:12:41.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which (as I understood)

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:44.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had already arranged
at the start of that day.

00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:48.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for boldness
and to be courageous, calm, and kind.

00:12:48.705 --> 00:12:50.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gave me the strength for that.

00:12:50.915 --> 00:12:53.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt calm when I talked with them,

00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:55.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t feel afraid
of consequences or anything.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah and asked him to show me 

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:01.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was close by,
that he was doing something,

00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:04.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the whole situation
was under his control.

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:08.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first letter I received
that morning was about the sun.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, I had read a lot of articles
about the sun and understood

00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s immense strength
and power are manifested in it.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that day I especially felt it.

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first letters that I received
were about God’s qualities 

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about the qualities that I needed
to display in that specific situation.

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:36.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t just encouraging to me.

00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:40.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were also a fine witness
to the administration.

00:13:40.006 --> 00:13:41.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The guards were amazed.

00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked:
“Vanya, who is writing to you from Krasnodar?

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:45.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got friends there.”

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:49.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then about other places— 
They wrote to me from France, from America.

00:13:49.474 --> 00:13:54.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The letters enabled them to see
that the situation is under control.

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:56.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A huge number of people

00:13:56.815 --> 00:13:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know about me, about my circumstances.

00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:03.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their actions are being carefully observed
by many people.

00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:05.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talks, topics for talks,

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:08.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
items for meetings—these are things I took

00:14:08.702 --> 00:14:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the letters that I received each day.

00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:14.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From one letter, I would take, for example,

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:17.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
material for a ten-minute talk,
and from another,

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:19.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could make a public talk.

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:22.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was able
to collect quotes from various letters,

00:14:22.632 --> 00:14:25.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I eventually had an entire library.

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to compare and collect information

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:31.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then conduct high-quality,
excellent personal study 

00:14:31.683 --> 00:14:35.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me keep in step
with the organization at that time.

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A boy drew a picture and sent it to me.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote,

00:14:38.773 --> 00:14:42.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you remain faithful,

00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:44.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be in the new world.”

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:46.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An elderly sister

00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:48.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began her letter

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:52.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these warm words: “Greetings, my son!”

00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:54.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She shared her feelings with me.

00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:58.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her letter came

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:01.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at one of the most difficult times for me.

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:06.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that Jehovah

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:10.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comforts us in a special way through letters.

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:17.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made the following schedule:

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got up early in the morning at 5:30 a.m.

00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:24.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While everyone else in the cell was snoozing

00:15:24.319 --> 00:15:26.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all was quiet,

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:29.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to read the Bible.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would think a great deal
about a particular verse.

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I reflected on it,
the more I saw how beautiful it was.

00:15:38.124 --> 00:15:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the day, the verse became

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stunningly beautiful and unique to me.

00:15:42.754 --> 00:15:46.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I understood that a good heart is formed

00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:48.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by the amount that you take in

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:51.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by the amount
you can retain in your heart.

00:15:51.262 --> 00:15:53.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you read the Bible
in a pretrial detention cell,

00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:55.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes on new meaning.

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read the book of Acts,
the things that happened

00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Paul became especially understandable.

00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:03.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It strengthened me

00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:07.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed me that I could
get through these times just as he did.

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:14.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mordecai’s experience
from the Bible went to my heart.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Haman had made
an agreement with the king

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy the Israelites,
he went out and met Mordecai.

00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:23.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says that Mordecai

00:16:23.336 --> 00:16:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘did not rise and did not tremble.’

00:16:26.756 --> 00:16:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The main point is that now

00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as then as with Mordecai,
we don’t tremble.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When applying the three elements

00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:38.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of prayer, encouragement from our brothers,

00:16:38.059 --> 00:16:40.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on God’s Word,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did that produce?

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped the brothers
to be calm and trust in Jehovah.

00:16:47.944 --> 00:16:50.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at the final scripture
for this talk.

00:16:55.994 --> 00:17:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Isaiah 30:15.

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:02.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful verse for us to keep in mind

00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when facing these anxious times!

00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:09.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately,
the Israelites were not willing

00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to this
profound directive from Jehovah.

00:17:13.177 --> 00:17:17.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read it with me, Isaiah 30:15:

00:17:19.225 --> 00:17:22.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:17:22.687 --> 00:17:25.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Holy One of Israel, says:

00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:28.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘By returning to me and resting,

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will be saved;

00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘your strength will be in keeping calm

00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and showing trust.’

00:17:37.493 --> 00:17:40.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you were unwilling.”

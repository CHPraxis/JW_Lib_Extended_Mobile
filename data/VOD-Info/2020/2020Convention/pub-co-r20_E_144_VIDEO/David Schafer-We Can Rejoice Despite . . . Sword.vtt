During his first imprisonment in Rome
from about 59 to 61 C.E.,

00:00:07.487 --> 00:00:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul was permitted
to stay in his own hired house,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though he was constantly
guarded by a soldier.

00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:16.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those two years,

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he preached to everyone who came to him

00:00:18.748 --> 00:00:22.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wrote inspired letters
to the Ephesians,

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:27.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians, Colossians, Philemon,
and evidently Hebrews too.

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:30.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Paul was apparently released.

00:00:30.678 --> 00:00:33.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he could renew his missionary activity.

00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:35.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could write to Timothy,
who was serving in Ephesus,

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Titus, who was serving on Crete.

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:42.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, though, Roman Emperor Nero
reportedly blamed Christians

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:45.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fire that destroyed much of Rome,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and once again Paul found himself in chains.

00:00:50.407 --> 00:00:54.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After decades of faithful Christian service

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:57.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the year was 65 C.E.),

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did Paul feel?

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get our answer by reading
from his second letter to Timothy,

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which he wrote from prison.

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:10.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to 2 Timothy chapter 4.

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the men
who apprehended Paul carry swords?

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:16.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt.

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:19.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did seeing those swords remind Paul

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how King Herod Agrippa I had executed James,

00:01:22.107 --> 00:01:24.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brother of John, by sword?

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:26.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine.

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:29.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But from this excerpt from 2 Timothy,

00:01:29.782 --> 00:01:34.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Paul sensed
that his own execution was imminent.

00:01:34.495 --> 00:01:37.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also see something else.

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:42.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see the three things
that strengthened Paul

00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:44.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he faced execution.

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:49.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me 2 Timothy 4:6-8:

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:55.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am already being
poured out like a drink offering,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the time for my releasing is imminent,”

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:01.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is to say, his death,

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would allow
for his eventual resurrection

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Christ’s heavenly Kingdom.

00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:10.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 7 continues:
“I have fought the fine fight,

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have run the race to the finish.”

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The finish”—yes, Paul sensed
that he was approaching

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:22.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a triumphant end to his personal race.

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues:
“I have observed the faith.

00:02:27.593 --> 00:02:30.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From this time on, there is reserved for me

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the crown of righteousness.”

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:36.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we see Paul’s strong hope.

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:41.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he continues:
“Which the Lord, the righteous judge,

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will give me as a reward in that day.”

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see Paul’s strong relationship

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah in this expression?

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his unflagging confidence that God’s Son
would bestow the promised reward?

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he says:
“Yet not to me only,

00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:05.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to all those
who have loved his manifestation.”

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:11.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul loved his Christian brothers,
and he didn’t forget them.

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:16.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Paul was able to rejoice
despite the threat of death

00:03:16.686 --> 00:03:20.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his brothers, his relationship
with Jehovah, and his hope.

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that Paul wanted to die.

00:03:21.858 --> 00:03:24.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course he would have preferred
to live on and keep serving Jehovah

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with his 
Christian brothers and sisters.

00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:29.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he faced death with courage,

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:34.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he rejoiced in the reward
that he knew was reserved for him.

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Paul, we too
can rejoice despite the threat of death.

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back
to our theme text at Romans 8:35.

00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:50.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the answer
to the two questions Paul poses here,

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
namely: “Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

00:03:53.642 --> 00:03:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will tribulation or distress or persecution 

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:57.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?”

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is found in verses 38 and 39:

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am convinced that neither death

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:09.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor life nor angels nor governments

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things now here nor things to come
nor powers nor height nor depth

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:16.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor any other creation will be able

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:21.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[yes, death is not able] to separate us

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s love
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:29.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A temporary pause in the grave

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:32.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot extinguish Jehovah’s love
for his servants.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah still love
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:39.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about Sarah, Rebekah,
Job, Moses, Daniel?

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:41.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about all those
who have died in prisons,

00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in concentration camps
on account of their strong faith?

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah still love them?

00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course he does.

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:52.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he still loves the hundreds
of brothers and sisters

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:56.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have died in recent months
as a result of COVID-19.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He still loves your grandma,
your dad, your sister.

00:04:59.712 --> 00:05:01.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He keeps them in his memory.

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:03.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll call them back to life.

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:07.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this fact helps us,
dear friends, when we face

00:05:07.053 --> 00:05:12.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the threat of death by sword as Paul did.

00:05:12.058 --> 00:05:14.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:17.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which specific provisions

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah helped
our Brother Baite Michael Dugbe

00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:24.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite
facing the threat of death.

00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:39.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When everything falls apart

00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:42.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when everything
around you is chaotic,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:50.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Baite Michael Dugbe.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1980.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in Monrovia

00:05:56.438 --> 00:05:59.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the war was an amazing time.

00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:02.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had wonderful parents.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:06.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up in a nice house,
and we went to a great school.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:12.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
everything changed overnight.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were reports of rebels

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to take over the government.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those reports alone

00:06:21.423 --> 00:06:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made people panic.

00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:27.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Businesses started to close down.

00:06:27.263 --> 00:06:30.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Services were shut down

00:06:30.224 --> 00:06:33.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lights, the power, the water—
everything stopped.

00:06:34.604 --> 00:06:39.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next few years were really unstable.

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:42.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was all-out war.

00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the rebels were in the city.

00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:50.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of looting going on.

00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:53.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of shooting.

00:06:53.874 --> 00:06:56.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rebels—they were known for torture

00:06:56.877 --> 00:07:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if people would not agree to fight with them.

00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:07.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a situation like that,

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a lot of fear;
there’s a lot of panic.

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:14.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when your fear level rises,

00:07:14.771 --> 00:07:19.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to deal with it is prayer
—prayer to Jehovah,

00:07:19.026 --> 00:07:22.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him specifically for direction

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what to do next.

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:26.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the fighting escalated

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:29.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it got closer to where we lived,
it was no longer safe.

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:34.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to flee,
and we ended up at the branch office.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were very loving;
they took really good care of us.

00:07:39.672 --> 00:07:41.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual activities

00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:44.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they made sure we kept up with that.

00:07:46.888 --> 00:07:51.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back,
I’m very grateful to have survived.

00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:53.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things helped us get through.

00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:00.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the only thing that keeps you stable.

00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:03.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, also, we were able to survive

00:08:03.072 --> 00:08:06.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the help
from the brothers and sisters.

00:08:06.492 --> 00:08:10.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those moments of trial
—that’s when you really realize

00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:13.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much you need the brotherhood.

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:18.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot of joy
in my assignment at Bethel

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Audio/Video Services.

00:08:20.173 --> 00:08:22.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the brothers and sisters
that I work with.

00:08:23.635 --> 00:08:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all thanks to Jehovah

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I am alive and that I get
to serve him every day.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:36.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video reminds us that life
in this system of things is fragile.

00:08:36.733 --> 00:08:39.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice what helped Brother Dugbe

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:42.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite the threat of death?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:49.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was his Christian brothers
who helped him to keep his hope alive

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:52.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through regular study,
meetings, and preaching.

00:08:54.084 --> 00:08:58.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible that some of us
will have to die for our faith

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:00.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many early Christians did

00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:03.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as some
modern-day Witnesses have done?

00:09:03.261 --> 00:09:05.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:09:05.263 --> 00:09:08.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not guaranteed
a trouble-free existence

00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:10.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this system of things.

00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:14.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s the very real possibility
that we may die by illness, 

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accident, or the other ravages
of these last days.

00:09:18.694 --> 00:09:22.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might die before the new world comes,

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as many of our dear friends already have.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we may be spared alive
through the great tribulation.

00:09:28.662 --> 00:09:31.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, we need to be determined

00:09:31.666 --> 00:09:36.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain faithful to Jehovah
right down to the end.

00:09:36.003 --> 00:09:40.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who has endured
to the end will be saved.”

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we assume that the new world
will arrive before we die,

00:09:45.764 --> 00:09:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be unprepared
to remain loyal to the death if necessary.

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, if we assume 
that the great tribulation will not come

00:09:54.648 --> 00:09:58.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our lifetime,
we will be unprepared for its hardships.

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:02.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only way to be prepared
for either eventuality

00:10:02.615 --> 00:10:06.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to stay spiritually strong and alert.

00:10:06.119 --> 00:10:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on the watch, therefore,” Jesus said,

00:10:09.038 --> 00:10:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you do not know

00:10:11.374 --> 00:10:14.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what day your Lord is coming.”

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:19.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been good
for us to consider more closely

00:10:19.049 --> 00:10:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul’s strong conviction

00:10:21.844 --> 00:10:25.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as expressed at Romans 8:35.

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:28.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have we learned from this symposium?

00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:33.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen how Romans 8:35-39

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:36.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assure us that no trial of any sort

00:10:36.526 --> 00:10:39.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will cause Jehovah to stop loving us.

00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:44.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that we have Jehovah’s approval
and love even while under trial

00:10:44.075 --> 00:10:47.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a key to rejoicing despite tribulation,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distress, persecution, hunger,

00:10:50.332 --> 00:10:54.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nakedness, danger, sword, or anything else.

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:56.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, continue to draw closer

00:10:56.547 --> 00:11:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the One who loves you so very much.

00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:04.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthen your trust in Jehovah
through personal study and prayer.

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep assuring your heart of his love.

00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:12.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treasure our precious brotherhood,
and draw closer to one another.

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:17.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cherish your God-given hope,
and meditate on “the real life” yet ahead.

00:11:17.944 --> 00:11:21.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, remember the inspired prayer

00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Colossians 1:11.

00:11:24.743 --> 00:11:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we continue doing these things,
dear friends, then, like Paul,

00:11:28.372 --> 00:11:33.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to rejoice
despite trials of any sort.

00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:35.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice these encouraging words

00:11:35.213 --> 00:11:39.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found at Colossians 1:11:

00:11:40.718 --> 00:11:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And may you be strengthened

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:46.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with all power

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his glorious might.”

00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just how much power is there
“according to [God’s] glorious might”?

00:11:54.274 --> 00:11:57.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have to imagine
because his Word reveals what Jehovah

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has accomplished and will yet accomplish
by means of his holy spirit

00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:03.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most powerful force there is.

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:06.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for what purpose will he grant you this?

00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:10.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not simply so that you may endure,

00:12:10.041 --> 00:12:13.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not merely so that you may endure fully,

00:12:13.545 --> 00:12:17.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only so that you may
endure fully with patience,

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as it says:

00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:22.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So that you may endure fully

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:25.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with patience and joy.”

00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:27.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that assurance,

00:12:27.476 --> 00:12:31.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can endure despite any trial
no matter how difficult it is,

00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:35.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how long it lasts
because our Father’s unfailing love

00:12:35.735 --> 00:12:37.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enable us to rejoice

00:12:37.904 --> 00:12:41.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both for all eternity and always.

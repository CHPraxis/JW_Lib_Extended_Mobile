WEBVTT

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:05.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our previous parts have reminded us
that Jehovah’s creation

00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:09.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flowers and food
and colors all demonstrate

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:13.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us to be happy
—to be joyful.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this part, we’re going to see
that Jehovah designed our bodies

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that shows that he wants
us to be happy as well.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah designed us

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the amazing capacity
for motion.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans can walk.
We can run.

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can swim.
We can dance.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
if you turn in your Bibles

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Acts 17:28,

00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will see that this
is a God-given ability.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:28:

00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:44.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For by him

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have life
and move and exist.”

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:51.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This word here “move”

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refers to the ability
from Jehovah for us to be active.

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:58.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with that in mind,
we have two questions:

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Are there lessons
that we can learn

00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from how Jehovah designed us
that can help us to rejoice?

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:10.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And (2) are there lessons
that we can learn that can help us

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our worship of Jehovah?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider
those two points.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:17.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s watch
the following video

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:20.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us appreciate
the marvelous way

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:23.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we were designed.

00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way we move can be complex

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or precise.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could require strength

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:52.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stamina.

00:01:57.855 --> 00:02:01.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Walking involves the coordination
of dozens of muscles.

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:07.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Muscles are controlled
by our brain and nervous system.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support and move our bones

00:02:11.703 --> 00:02:15.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are powered by the food we eat
and the oxygen we breathe.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every body part is a marvel of engineering.

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The knee is designed
to withstand repeated impact.

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:40.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:44.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Findings suggest that regular movement

00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:46.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps prevent joint damage.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:52.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a machine
that strengthens as we use it.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Movement helps us
to stay healthy and feel good.

00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:06.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a credit to its Creator.

00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For by him we have life

00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:14.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move and exist.”

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The makeup of the human body

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:25.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that Jehovah wants us
not just to exist but to be happy.

00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:27.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you remember
our first question:

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn?

00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are two of them.

00:03:31.413 --> 00:03:36.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, as the video highlighted,
Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:38.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the comment,
“Movement helps us

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:41.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay healthy
and feel good”?

00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:45.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Research has established
that leading a physically active life

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us to think clearly,
feel happier,

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have more energy,
be more productive.

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:54.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an incredible gift
from Jehovah!

00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created us to move.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:01.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also he created us in a way
that the more we move

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the more we exercise,
we work, we do things for others—

00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:07.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier we are.

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second point
is that Jehovah designed our bodies

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:14.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many different parts,
but it works as one unit.

00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:17.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the coordination
needed just to walk?

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something
we take for granted.

00:04:19.756 --> 00:04:21.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about our knee?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine if our knee did not work
in harmony with the rest of the body?

00:04:25.554 --> 00:04:29.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if every time we stood up,
we weren’t sure which way it would bend.

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:31.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How complicated
that would be!

00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:36.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, Jehovah created our bodies
to work as one complete unit.

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:39.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice also
that the video stated

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our body
is like a machine

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:46.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many different moving parts
and that it all works together?

00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:50.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a unique difference
between a machine and our body

00:04:50.998 --> 00:04:53.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that our body
strengthens as we use it.

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you think about that.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go out and you
buy a car or you buy a bicycle,

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:03.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may think that’s a successful purchase
if it operates as intended.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you would never expect
that car or bicycle

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve and grow stronger
every time you use it.

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s what happens
to our body.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:15.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that allows us to exercise,

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:18.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
walk, run, swim,
dance, even more.

00:05:18.694 --> 00:05:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more we move,
the happier we are.

00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:24.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an incredible design!

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:28.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we appreciate our bodies
—this wonderful gift from Jehovah!

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:31.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember
our second question:

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there lessons
that we can learn from the body

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:38.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to be happy
in our worship of Jehovah?

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:41.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider
those same two points again.

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we said that Jehovah
designed our bodies to move.

00:05:45.723 --> 00:05:47.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what should we do?

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:52.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look together
to 1 Corinthians 15:58

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:56.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 15:58.

00:05:56.944 --> 00:06:01.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Therefore, my beloved brothers,
be steadfast, immovable,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“always having plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:09.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that your labor is not in vain
in connection with the Lord.”

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:11.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?

00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:16.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move, stay busy, have “plenty
to do in the work of the Lord.”

00:06:16.673 --> 00:06:19.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gave us
further reason for rejoicing

00:06:19.593 --> 00:06:22.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving us
meaningful work to do.

00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:25.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of you dear brothers
and sisters have said

00:06:25.557 --> 00:06:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never felt
busier than you do now.

00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think
that’s a coincidence?

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:33.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think it’s a coincidence
that the darker

00:06:33.941 --> 00:06:36.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more depressing
these last days have become

00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:38.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are busier
than ever in Jehovah’s work?

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:40.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:40.323 --> 00:06:43.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that is one of the ways
that Jehovah uses

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to be happy and healthy
in these last days.

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know
that our primary work

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:06:53.003 --> 00:06:55.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do that
through the house-to-house preaching work.

00:06:55.673 --> 00:06:59.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do that through public witnessing
and through Bible studies.

00:06:59.552 --> 00:07:03.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even when this work
is restricted because of world events,

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we still find ways to preach.

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we
have “plenty to do

00:07:09.938 --> 00:07:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the work of the Lord”
(in the preaching work),

00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:17.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re happy and we’re better able
to put our troubles into perspective.

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:22.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, others of you support
the Kingdom work by serving at Bethel

00:07:22.034 --> 00:07:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by constructing and renovating
theocratic facilities.

00:07:25.747 --> 00:07:29.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you share in relief work
or whatever you do;

00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:33.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it brings joy,
and it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:07:33.797 --> 00:07:35.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s a question:

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:39.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you staying
as busy as you can

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:43.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your circumstances allow
in Jehovah’s work?

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:46.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to have “plenty
to do in the work of the Lord.”

00:07:46.644 --> 00:07:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be happy,
and you’ll never regret it.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, our second point,

00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:55.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also established
that Jehovah designed our body

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many parts
but to work as one unit.

00:07:59.116 --> 00:08:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what lessons
do we learn from that?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look over
to Ephesians 4:16

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ephesians 4:16,

00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:16.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says: “From him all the body
is harmoniously joined together

00:08:16.593 --> 00:08:21.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and made to cooperate through every joint
that gives what is needed.

00:08:21.473 --> 00:08:24.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When each respective member
functions properly,

00:08:24.768 --> 00:08:27.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“this contributes
to the growth of the body

00:08:27.563 --> 00:08:30.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it builds itself up in love.”

00:08:30.274 --> 00:08:32.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we
learn from this?

00:08:32.443 --> 00:08:35.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay united,
cooperate together,

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
function properly.

00:08:37.574 --> 00:08:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn that every part
of the human body

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is necessary and that it
must work together.

00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:44.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, similarly,
the congregation

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:47.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up
of many different members.

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:52.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each member, each of you
(whether young or old, strong or frail

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:57.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you) contributes to the whole
and the beauty of the congregation.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each one of you is needed.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are special to Jehovah
and your brothers and sisters.

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you see
when the congregation

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “harmoniously joined together”
what happens?

00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation
is built up.

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, again,
many of you have said

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never felt
closer to each other

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Jehovah’s organization
than you do now.

00:09:19.035 --> 00:09:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s no coincidence.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:25.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the end draws near,
Jehovah is gathering us closer

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:29.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and closer together in unity,
and those bonds among us

00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to grow even stronger.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, how much we appreciate
and how much we can learn

00:09:36.428 --> 00:09:39.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wonderful way
in which we are made!

00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us
remember those two points:

00:09:42.518 --> 00:09:45.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Be determined to be
as active as possible

00:09:45.104 --> 00:09:47.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—move in Jehovah’s service,

00:09:47.357 --> 00:09:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (2) may each of us do

00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:52.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that we can
to promote unity.

00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:56.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do,
you will be happy

00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:58.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not only will you
bring joy to yourself

00:09:58.994 --> 00:10:02.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll bring joy
to others as well.

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:07.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:10:07.044 --> 00:10:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:10:10.006 --> 00:10:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah
Wants Us to Rejoice

00:10:13.676 --> 00:10:15.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Delightful Sounds.”

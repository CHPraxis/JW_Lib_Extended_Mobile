Welcome to the “Always Rejoice”!

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:11.991 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:13.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you were able to arrange

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:15.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attend all three days

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:18.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of this convention.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were the apostle Paul’s words

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:4 chosen

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, over the past four years,

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
has used conventions

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to highlight qualities

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that endear us to Jehovah

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to be victorious

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our struggle
against Satan and his world.

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had convention themes
that focused on the need

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for loyalty,

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endurance,

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
courage,

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year,

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the convention theme highlights the need

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for joy.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Nehemiah 8:10,

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told:

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future,

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith will be tested
as never before.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we acquire true joy
with the help of God’s holy spirit,

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to stand firm

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weather all the storms
that come our way.

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is a deep-seated quality
of the heart.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a state of happiness that remains

00:01:47.544 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the conditions
around us are pleasant or not.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, a person
can be disturbed about something

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still have joy in his heart.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the apostles were flogged

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for speaking about the Christ.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, “they went out
from before the Sanhedrin,

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rejoicing because they
had been counted worthy

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be dishonored in behalf of his name.”

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, they weren’t rejoicing
over the flogging they had received.

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as servants of God,

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found true joy

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping their integrity to him.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, is it possible for a Christian

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always to be rejoicing?

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because true joy is an aspect

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an inward quality,

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joy is not dependent on external things,

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even on our brothers.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does depend on God’s spirit.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as already noted,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy comes
from that deep inner satisfaction

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of knowing that we have the truth,

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:16.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re doing what pleases Jehovah,

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:20.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that our Kingdom hope is sure.

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So godly joy is not the transient joy

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people experience 
because they’ve secured a well-paying job,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gone on an exotic vacation,

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attained fame and prestige,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or acquired some coveted material item

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or large sum of money.

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, true joy has to be cultivated

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of holy spirit.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To obtain Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to draw close to him
and give him exclusive devotion.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 5:32,

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told that God gives holy spirit

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those obeying him as ruler.”

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:12.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these three days,
the convention program

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to deepen
our appreciation

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for godly joy.

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn what true joy is,

00:04:22.658 --> 00:04:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to cultivate it,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to maintain it during difficult times,

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:30.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to display it

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it wells up in our hearts.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such joy will clearly identify us

00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as disciples of Jesus,

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will enable us to serve

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as beacons of light in this dark world

00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw others to our “happy God.”

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll note
that nearly the entire second day

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:59.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been devoted
to the joy of disciple-making.

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy will help us

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face challenges to our integrity.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that it was
“the joy that was set before him”

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Jesus to face

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:16.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an excruciating death on a torture stake.

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please pay rapt attention
to the talks and videos.

00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look up the scriptures,
and read them along with the speakers,

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus allowing God’s Word

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to exert its powerful force
on your heart.

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this convention
become a milestone

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your development

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are
that he made us “in his image,”

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving us the capacity

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:57.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel and express godly joy!

00:05:57.044 --> 00:06:02.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we are
that he also gives us his holy spirit

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:06.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cultivate that kind of joy!

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much,

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:12.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray that each one of you

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:15.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will forever respond to the words

00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the psalmist at Psalm 100:2:

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:28.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come into his presence
with joyful shouting.”

Are you convinced
that Jehovah wants you to rejoice?

00:00:07.028 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many reasons to believe that.

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creation is one such proof.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning, the Bible teaches
that Jehovah worked very hard

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our home a delightful place
to live here on planet Earth.

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This included his creating millions

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:28.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different species of plants and animals.

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he finished
with all this amazing activity,

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:34.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know what our Creator did next?

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:37.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the sixth creative day,

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us at Genesis 1:31:

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God saw everything he had made,

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look! it was very good.”

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:50.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about that.

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After working hard over perhaps
the course of thousands of years,

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Father paused, he inspected everything,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:03.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he rejoiced in all that he had made.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:08.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
the beauty and wisdom in creation

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that our heavenly Father
wants us to enjoy life on planet Earth.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he wants us to join him in rejoicing

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over all that he has made.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we do that?

00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:27.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible gives us a clue at Psalm 111:2.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you, please, to open your Bible

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:35.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read along with all of us—Psalm 111:2.

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The works of Jehovah are great;

00:01:40.503 --> 00:01:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are studied by all those
finding pleasure in them.”

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:49.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see clearly in the Bible
that Jehovah invites us 

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:54.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look closely at the things
he has made so that we can learn from them.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doing so is a delightful experience.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:01.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that together.

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:07.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will examine six of Jehovah’s many works

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our God-given ability to enjoy them all.

00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:15.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll focus our attention
on exquisite flowers.

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:19.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, our next speaker
will talk about one of our favorite things

00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:21.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—delicious food.

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we will discuss beautiful colors,

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our well-designed bodies,

00:02:26.552 --> 00:02:31.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delightful sounds and,
lastly, fascinating animals.

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:33.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk in this series

00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also teach us
Scriptural lessons from creation

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us rejoice in life

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even now in these difficult last days.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, are you as ready as I am?

00:02:45.155 --> 00:02:48.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by looking closely
at exquisite flowers.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:54.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to look
for the answers to these three questions:

00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:59.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how many species
of flowering plants are there?

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:03.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, what practical needs
do flowers serve?

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, how can flowers help us

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we get anxious?

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the video.

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:18.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth has more than 350,000 species

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:21.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flowering plants.

00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:29.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:34.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce

00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:37.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:03:39.797 --> 00:03:42.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pollination produces nutritious seeds,

00:03:42.883 --> 00:03:45.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fruits, and vegetables.

00:03:47.555 --> 00:03:52.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beautiful flower we see
may look like this to a bee.

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:55.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:58.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that create a hard-to-miss target.

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:04.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy more than
the flower’s beauty and aroma.

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, some plants do not need
beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:13.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers, pollen,

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:15.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nectar, and aromas

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are costly for plants to produce.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those resources could be used
for other purposes.

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:28.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, plants make flowers
in breathtaking abundance.

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:45.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously created flowers

00:04:45.742 --> 00:04:47.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that brings us joy

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:51.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reminds us
to trust him when we are anxious.

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:55.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Take a lesson

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“from the lilies of the field,

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“how they grow;

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.716 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“they do not toil,

00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:02.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“nor do they spin;

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“but . . . not even Solomon

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“in all his glory

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was arrayed as one of these.”

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:17.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that video stir within you a desire

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to know Jehovah’s creative works
even better?

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:26.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah designed us
to enjoy the beauty of flowers

00:05:26.327 --> 00:05:28.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lovely fragrances.

00:05:28.788 --> 00:05:30.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine trying to study

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all 350,000 species of flowering plants

00:05:35.712 --> 00:05:38.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—admiring their beauty, smelling them,

00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:43.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even making a drawing
or taking a photo of each one?

00:05:43.554 --> 00:05:48.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, if you started today
and spent a little time every day

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting to know a different flower,

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:56.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your study project
would take a little over 958 years.

00:05:56.067 --> 00:06:00.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good thing
we’re going to live forever, isn’t it?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in addition
to seeing the beauty in flowers,

00:06:04.034 --> 00:06:06.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we’ve learned in the video,

00:06:06.036 --> 00:06:09.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flowers play
an important role in our ecosystem.

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:13.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce

00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nectar for creatures like the bees
that spread pollen.

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:20.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn,
pollination produces nutritious seeds,

00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fruits, and vegetables.

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:26.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the flowers, we have food to eat.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we marvel at the ingenious design

00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:34.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s evident in all things in creation!

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:38.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people today enjoy looking at creation,

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but few realize that when they do so,

00:06:41.324 --> 00:06:44.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re actually getting
a glimpse into the mind and heart

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:48.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our loving Creator, Jehovah.

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not true of us, though
—is it?—

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know who Jehovah is.

00:06:53.337 --> 00:06:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we carefully observe
all of the things he has made,

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:58.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we naturally think of him

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are drawn closer to him
and to his beautiful qualities.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:06.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point in life, the faithful man Job

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:08.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was reminded by his friend Elihu

00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:13.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “stop and consider carefully
the wonderful works of God.”

00:07:14.651 --> 00:07:17.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how that advice helped Job?

00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:19.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Job learned,

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:22.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy increases
when we’re focused on Jehovah

00:07:22.743 --> 00:07:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on his works instead of on ourselves.

00:07:27.123 --> 00:07:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents and young ones,
this is a good lesson for all of us.

00:07:31.627 --> 00:07:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following the advice given to Job
can also draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better that is than spending time

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:43.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with much of the world’s entertainment
that is debased!

00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:46.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such prepackaged entertainment
is often designed

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:50.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to turn us away from Jehovah,
not draw us closer to him.

00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:55.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about spending time
observing Jehovah’s works?

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a wholesome pastime
with a future.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Observing flowers
may also bring to our mind another lesson,

00:08:05.372 --> 00:08:07.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that Jesus taught.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible again
to Matthew chapter 6,

00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:14.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read together verses 28-30.

00:08:14.506 --> 00:08:18.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the reading, look for the answer
to the following question:

00:08:18.344 --> 00:08:22.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Matthew 6:28-30.

00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:28.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:32.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,
how they grow;

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:39.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they do not toil, nor do they spin;

00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:43.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I tell you
that not even Solomon in all his glory

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:45.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was arrayed as one of these.

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:49.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if this is how God clothes
the vegetation of the field

00:08:49.043 --> 00:08:52.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is here today and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven,

00:08:52.172 --> 00:08:57.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will he not much rather clothe you,
you with little faith?”

00:08:57.177 --> 00:08:59.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How heartwarming!

00:08:59.263 --> 00:09:03.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been anxious
about food and clothing?

If so, you’re not alone.

Among those listening
to Jesus on this occasion

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:11.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were many poor people
who had the same natural concerns.

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus encouraged them.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:15.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By reminding them
to take a lesson from the flowers.

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew what we know:

00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:25.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way

00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings us joy and reminds us

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trust Him when we are anxious.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:35.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see how well
Jehovah takes care of all the flowers,

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:38.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re reminded of how generous he is

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:41.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of his loving care of humans.

00:09:41.266 --> 00:09:45.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Jehovah,
when we give generously to others

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help care for their needs when it’s
“within the power of [our] hand” to do so,

00:09:49.942 --> 00:09:53.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too will experience
the joy that comes from giving.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear ones, may we never forget

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was Jehovah who gave us the ability

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate exquisite flowers.

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May doing just that bring you joy

00:10:08.587 --> 00:10:12.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and add to your praise of Jehovah forever.

00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:15.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,

00:10:15.636 --> 00:10:18.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

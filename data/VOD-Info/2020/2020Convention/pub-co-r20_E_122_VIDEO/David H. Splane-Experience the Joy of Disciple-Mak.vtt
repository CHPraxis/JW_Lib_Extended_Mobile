00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you find it easy to think up
effective illustrations for the ministry?

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure don’t.

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:13.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some have a real gift for it.

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:15.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a friend like that.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:20.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can look at almost any situation
and think of an illustration.

00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:24.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, we were traveling
along a mountain road.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was driving.

00:00:26.048 --> 00:00:28.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My car wasn’t very good.

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:30.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the best
I could afford at the time.

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And suddenly,
a red warning light came on.

00:00:34.057 --> 00:00:38.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quick as a flash, my friend said:
“I just thought of a great illustration.

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conscience
is like a warning light.”

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His first thought is an illustration;

00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:49.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his second thought,
‘Uh-oh, we’re in trouble.’

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Illustrations come naturally to him;
it’s just like breathing to him.

00:00:53.995 --> 00:00:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have the gift,
and the rest of us have to work at it.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why should we work at it?

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:04.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we learn
to use illustrations?

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:09.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, because Jesus used them,
and he was the greatest Teacher of them all.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:12.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus used illustrations a lot,

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:14.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we find when we read

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:34.

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:22.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together.

00:01:22.317 --> 00:01:26.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:34:

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:32.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All of these things Jesus
spoke to the crowds by illustrations.

00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:35.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, without an illustration

00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:39.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not speak to them.”

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:44.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that an illustration
is often the most effective way

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to touch the heart,
and that’s especially true

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if people are featured
in the illustration.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:53.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, suppose I say,
‘If you’re going along the road

00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:56.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and you see someone in trouble,
stop and help him

00:01:56.938 --> 00:01:59.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if he’s of a different race.’

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:02.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s clear.
It makes the point.

00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:05.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ illustration
about the neighborly Samaritan

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:08.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes the same point,
but it’s so much more effective.

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stirs the emotions.

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:13.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It engages the mind.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:16.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel pity for the poor Jew
who fell among thieves.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel love for the Samaritan
who stopped to help him

00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:25.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and disgust for the priest
and Levite who didn’t stop.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re determined
not to be like them.

00:02:28.763 --> 00:02:33.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration can put
a human face on a problem

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reinforce our determination
to apply the lesson.

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:40.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good illustration
can help a Bible student

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grasp the point
he’s been struggling with.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how that works
in a conversation Neeta

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is having with Jade
in a coffee shop.

00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:08.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do this.

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:13.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a bit of a neat freak.

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:15.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t say.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last time we discussed
how God created us to live forever,

00:03:19.943 --> 00:03:22.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which raises the question,
Why do we die?

00:03:22.488 --> 00:03:23.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally!

00:03:23.822 --> 00:03:25.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Totally, what?

00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:28.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like, I mean, I totally agree
that’s what we talked about.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, right.

00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open to Romans 5:12.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, uh, why don’t I read it
out loud so we can both enjoy it?

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:47.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why, just as through one man

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sin entered into the world

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and death through sin,

00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:54.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and so death spread to all to men

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had all sinned.”

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, hold it.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Adam the one man?

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This doesn’t make sense.

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:06.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said Adam was perfect
and wouldn’t die.

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:11.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he sins and loses that.

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s that got to do with me?

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I die because he’s stupid?

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe it’s not
how I would’ve put it.

00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:23.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:27.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When parents
with a severe genetic defect

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have children, what happens?

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:32.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually the kids inherit it.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Precisely.

00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Adam sinned,
that sin became like a genetic defect

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that caused sickness, aging, and death;

00:04:41.322 --> 00:04:44.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and since we’re all his children . . .

00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, brilliant!

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get it!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we watch a little video
that helps put it all together?

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:11.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Neeta’s illustration effective?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade was struggling to understand
how she could inherit imperfection from Adam,

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man who lived long ago,
and she wasn’t going to get past it.

00:05:20.948 --> 00:05:24.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was the point
Neeta chose to illustrate.

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you’re studying with someone,
choose carefully what you’ll illustrate.

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:32.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let it be a main point in the lesson

00:05:32.252 --> 00:05:35.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an idea that your student
is having trouble with.

00:05:35.047 --> 00:05:40.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There has to be a good reason
for using an illustration.

00:05:41.512 --> 00:05:44.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our illustrations
should be appealing.

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:46.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we mean by that?

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:51.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An illustration will appeal to the student
if it’s about something familiar.

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:56.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now again, Jesus’ parable
of the Samaritan comes to mind.

00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:59.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The setting
of the illustration was nearby

00:05:59.114 --> 00:06:02.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a familiar road
between Jerusalem and Jericho,

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the hanging gardens of Babylon
or the pyramids of Egypt.

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was realistic.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:11.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many robberies along that road,

00:06:11.586 --> 00:06:14.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the attitude of the priests and Levite

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward that poor,
injured Jew was totally believable.

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta also chose wisely.

00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her illustration
was about inheriting a birth defect

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something she knew
Jade would understand.

00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:33.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may have
a couple of go-to illustrations

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:38.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve used for years
and years—and years.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not look for fresh ones
that make the same points?

00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:45.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put a little sparkle
back in your ministry.

00:06:45.205 --> 00:06:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider
two ways of doing that.

00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:51.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, be observant.

00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:54.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 6:26, Jesus said:

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:58.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Observe intently
the birds of heaven.”

00:06:58.803 --> 00:07:03.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was aware of his surroundings,
and he thought about what he saw.

00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:07.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He observed the housewife,
children playing in the village square,

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the farmer,
the rich man with his treasures.

00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So learn from Jesus.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:16.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slow down, and smell the flowers.

00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:20.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then think
of an illustration about flowers.

00:07:21.786 --> 00:07:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you feel you
don’t have a creative bone in your body,

00:07:25.165 --> 00:07:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet you still need fresh illustrations?

00:07:28.168 --> 00:07:31.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second resource
is our publications.

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:35.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to the <i>Watch Tower Publications Index</i>
under “Illustrations,”

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll find an abundance

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:41.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of beautiful illustrations
that have been used in our publications.

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you are studying
our later publications,

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:47.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note
of the illustrations that are used.

00:07:47.981 --> 00:07:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Choose simple illustrations.

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:55.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use little things to explain big things

00:07:55.072 --> 00:07:59.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and simple things
to explain complicated things.

00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:03.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister at a congregation meeting
used a very simple

00:08:03.164 --> 00:08:07.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but effective illustration
regarding Jehovah and the ransom.

00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:10.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “When you’re shopping,

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:14.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you never pay full price
for damaged goods.”

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her point?

00:08:16.553 --> 00:08:19.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all damaged goods,
yet Jehovah

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:23.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paid full price for us
with the life of his Son.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:25.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The illustration was simple.

00:08:25.146 --> 00:08:30.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was appealing because it was
about something familiar—shopping.

00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was also appropriate
to the audience.

00:08:32.988 --> 00:08:35.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were a lot
of Bethelites in the audience,

00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:39.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know that Bethelites
never pay full price for anything.

00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re illustrating a point,

00:08:41.747 --> 00:08:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoid distracting the student
with minor details.

00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Minor details—if they don’t fit,
they can get you into a lot of trouble.

00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:52.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they don’t work
with the main point of the illustration,

00:08:52.342 --> 00:08:55.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student may focus
on the inconsistencies

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and miss the point altogether.

00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:01.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in summary, what do we say?

00:09:01.602 --> 00:09:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes time to develop good illustrations,
but it’s worth the effort.

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have the gift,
use it and share it with others.

00:09:10.653 --> 00:09:14.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if, like me,
you don’t have the gift, work at it.

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:16.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be glad you did

00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:19.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will your Bible students.

00:09:20.706 --> 00:09:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:27.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present
the next part of the symposium,

00:09:27.171 --> 00:09:32.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making
—Improve Your Skills—

00:09:32.093 --> 00:09:35.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teaching With Enthusiasm.”

It brings us great joy
to help our Bible students

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feed themselves spiritually
so that they can continue

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make spiritual progress

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move ever closer to serving Jehovah.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual food that they digest
at their weekly Bible study

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or their own personal research
is very beneficial.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It fills that spiritual need,
that void, in them.

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:29.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also very appetizing,
much like eating an appetizer.

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:34.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An appetizer is something that is served
before serving the main course.

00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:39.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s meant to whet the appetite
before eating the main course.

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:41.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you invited your Bible student

00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy the main course
of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall?

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:48.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have, and they have seen their students 

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
advance and really become happier.

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:53.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some have held back.

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:57.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that they don’t want
to rush their student into anything,

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put too much pressure on them.

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is exactly what your student needs.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Invite them as soon as possible.

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:09.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never hold back because you could
possibly be holding them back

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:11.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from making progress.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:15.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about how the meetings have
helped you personally and your family.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:19.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about how the meetings
will help your student.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David knew that finding joy
and true happiness

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only comes from drawing close to Jehovah

00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:29.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worshipping Him at his house.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says at Psalm 65:4.

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Happy is the one whom you choose

00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:41.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bring near to reside in your courtyards.

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We will be satisfied
 with the goodness of your house,

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:47.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your holy temple.”

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt your Bible student
is happy with their Bible study

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they’re learning about Jehovah.

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:56.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have deep gratitude.

00:01:56.104 --> 00:01:58.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is gratitude?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gratitude means “appreciating
what kindness is shown to you.”

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:08.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also means “showing appreciation
and returning kindness.”

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worshipping Jehovah
is how we return kindness,

00:02:12.747 --> 00:02:16.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show our appreciation and our gratitude.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do this, Jehovah is happy,

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:21.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which makes us happy as well.

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:26.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in the following dramatization
how Neeta

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invites her Bible study,
Jade, to attend meetings.

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:33.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah,

00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:37.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister died in that attack;
it was really sad.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s “time and unexpected events”?

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s one of those cases where . . .

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about when someone survives
because they’re at the meeting?

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s, um—

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t get it.

00:02:50.997 --> 00:02:54.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Straight answer
—Does Jehovah protect Witnesses or not?

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s funny.

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:01.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:03.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really pushing those meetings,
aren’t you?

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:09.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What time?

00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:10.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe I missed her part,

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:14.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t a total loss.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta had said, “At the Hall,
everyone loves one another.”

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:31.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until I’d felt it, I had no idea.

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told her I’d be back.

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:42.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jade feel when she
attended her first meeting?

00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:46.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she really enjoyed it, and she
remembered what Neeta told her

00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:49.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that everyone at the Kingdom Hall
loves one another,’

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jade had to admit,

00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But until I’d felt it, I had no idea.”

00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could’ve read it.

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could’ve heard about it.

00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:02.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until she was there and feeling the love—

00:05:02.222 --> 00:05:04.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to come back.

00:05:04.474 --> 00:05:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, attending meetings goes hand-in-hand

00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:09.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with making spiritual progress.

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:13.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as they love their
home Bible study, it’s like an appetizer.

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one part
of the spiritual feeding program

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:20.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah provides at the Kingdom Hall

00:05:20.158 --> 00:05:24.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that main course provided
through the faithful slave.

00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:28.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during each Bible study, it would be
good to explain to your student

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what has affected you, what impacted you,

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:34.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help make wise decisions,
what encouraged you.

00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:37.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share it with them, and share a point
that would help them.

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:39.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, whet their appetite.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pique their interest.

00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they come to the meeting,
they will see true Christian love,

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unfailing love in action.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will see others
trying to put into action,

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying, what they’re
learning at the meetings.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will make true friends
that will help support them

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:01.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help them to progress spiritually.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attending meetings can be a bit intimidating

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some and cause some anxiety,

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:11.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’d be good to explain to them what
they might expect when they attend.

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:15.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the best ways
to do this is showing them a video

00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:18.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled <i>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</i>

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will really put them at ease

00:06:21.057 --> 00:06:23.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really help them have less anxiety

00:06:23.518 --> 00:06:26.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they do finally come.

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:28.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be good to also invite others

00:06:28.314 --> 00:06:30.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Bible study so that when your student

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:32.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does finally make it to the meeting,

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will see many familiar faces
and feel much more comfortable.

00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:39.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let the friends in the congregation know

00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your student is coming to the meeting

00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when they walk through the door,
they can come over,

00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:47.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give them a warm welcome,
make them feel comfortable.

00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Neeta did for Jade,
and it worked so well.

00:06:51.464 --> 00:06:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped her to progress.

00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:57.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student is a guest in Jehovah’s house.

00:06:57.513 --> 00:07:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make them feel special,
and make them feel comfortable

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by offering practical help before the meeting

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as during the meeting.

00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:08.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, well in advance,

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whet their appetite on what they
will learn once they come to the meeting.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like showing them a menu

00:07:14.197 --> 00:07:18.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they will enjoy
with the main course at the meeting.

00:07:18.327 --> 00:07:22.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offer to provide a ride to your students

00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:25.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have them sit with you at the meetings.

00:07:25.168 --> 00:07:28.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would also be good to make sure
that they have the publications

00:07:28.296 --> 00:07:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be discussed at the meeting,

00:07:30.298 --> 00:07:34.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either hardcopy or have it downloaded
on their device.

00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:38.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we have discussed, attending meetings

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoying the main course
of spiritual food at the Kingdom Hall

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:44.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help your student in so many ways.

00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:48.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will make them feel happier,
help them to continue progressing,

00:07:48.568 --> 00:07:51.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can draw close to Jehovah.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul
gives us some more indications

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:56.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what your student can enjoy.

00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please notice with me

00:07:58.495 --> 00:08:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he says at Colossians 2:7.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in verse 6 that they
should ‘keep on walking.’

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in verse 7,

00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:11.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they should be “rooted
and built up in him [Jesus]

00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:15.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and being stabilized in the faith,
just as you were taught,

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:18.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overflowing with thanksgiving.”

00:08:18.517 --> 00:08:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So their appreciation, their gratitude

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:24.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they will want to go
to the meetings and worship Jehovah.

00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:29.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue to find joy in helping
your student feed themselves spiritually,

00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:34.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also help them to appreciate
attending meetings on a weekly basis.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:39.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it a way of life for them
so that they can enjoy everlasting life.

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now consider
the next part of this symposium

00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Help Your Bible Students to . . .
Avoid Bad Associations.”

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help!”

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, you have sometime in your life
heard somebody call out “Help!”

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:13.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you yourself
have called out “Help!” to Jehovah.

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:17.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 30:10, David once sang:

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:20.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, become my helper.”

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah becomes our Helper
not only when we are in danger.

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:29.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provides help in many positive ways

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in everyday life.

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:35.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What help does Jehovah provide for us?

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:38.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, find with me

00:00:38.144 --> 00:00:42.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 14:6.

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, Jehovah provides

00:00:44.776 --> 00:00:49.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his holy angels to support
the worldwide preaching work.

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:54.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Revelation 14:6, John recorded:

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I saw another angel
flying in midheaven,

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:01.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:07.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:13.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not just one angel that is active

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in support of the preaching work.

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many angels are involved in it.

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:23.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it were not for the help
and direction of the angels,

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would sometimes overlook
somebody with a good heart

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we go out and preach.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:34.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Jehovah has also given
us his holy spirit,

00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:37.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fruitage of which makes us
more effective teachers

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:41.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us to draw
sheeplike ones to the truth.

00:01:43.422 --> 00:01:47.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, Jehovah has given us
as a help the privilege of prayer.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:51.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gets personally involved
in our activities.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:56.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible teachers and students alike
need Jehovah’s help.

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:59.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 127:1 says:

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:01.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in vain that its builders
work hard on it.”

00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:10.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fourth, Jehovah gives us
also the needed wisdom.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is wisdom to pray
for “the wisdom from above”

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:18.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned at James 3:17.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:23.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last, Jehovah also gives us
the needed strength,

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:26.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helps us a lot when we are tired

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:30.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or discouraged or have a lot of work.

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:32.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 4:11 refers

00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:36.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “the strength that God supplies.”

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we can pray for Jehovah’s help,

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:44.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for wisdom, and for the necessary strength.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:46.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:51.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the power of praying
in behalf of a Bible student.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:56.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long would Jesus need to wait

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:58.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah would make him King?”

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:01.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, so “how do we know that Jesus

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:03.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not become King
when he was on earth

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:07.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or immediately after he was resurrected?”

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, because he didn’t.

00:03:16.187 --> 00:03:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus
teach his disciples to pray?

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:25.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, yep—well, I know the obvious.

00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:29.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your Kingdom come,”
implied future tense.

00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:33.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we know for sure
what’s going on in heaven?

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:40.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it would help
if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:47.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you leave, a suggestion:

00:03:47.178 --> 00:03:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe if you were to study ahead of time?

00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:51.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really . . .

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about no.

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really swamped.

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:56.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re busy; we all are.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do next.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:12.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought she
was making our study a priority,

00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:15.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe she wasn’t.

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exams next week—it’s do or die time.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:54.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I remembered 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that ‘God keeps making it grow.’

00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:11.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade
and then left it with him.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I need to apologize.

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:41.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forget it, you were stressed.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but there’s more.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside I knew you were right;

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just the last thing I wanted to hear.

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:51.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, really.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:05:58.567 --> 00:05:59.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah?

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:08.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:22.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can prayer help us
in making disciples?

00:06:22.968 --> 00:06:25.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate with me

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:29.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:9, 10.

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:36.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this is what I continue praying,
that your love may abound

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:39.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“still more and more with accurate knowledge

00:06:39.986 --> 00:06:42.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and full discernment;

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you may make sure
of the more important things,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be flawless
and not stumbling others

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:51.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to the day of Christ.”

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Paul prayed

00:06:55.127 --> 00:06:58.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the love
of the Philippians “may abound

00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . with accurate knowledge
and full discernment,” we can pray 

00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:05.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same in behalf
of our Bible students.

00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:09.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray also for the holy spirit
to guide your thoughts and actions

00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:12.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ones of your students.

00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:16.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray from your heart,
confident that Jehovah will hear you.

00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:21.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 65:2 says: “O Hearer of prayer,

00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:25.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to you people of all sorts will come.”

00:07:25.326 --> 00:07:28.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teach your Bible students how to pray,

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only encourage them to do so.

00:07:30.623 --> 00:07:33.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Urge them to do so!

00:07:33.126 --> 00:07:36.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning to pray will help
your students to form

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:43.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray with your Bible students and for them,

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:46.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using or spelling out their name.

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:51.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be confident that Jehovah
will answer your prayers and theirs.

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:56.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Acts 10:9.

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:59.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter was a fine example

00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:03.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who prayed.

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:07.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 10:9 says:

00:08:09.248 --> 00:08:12.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The next day as they
were continuing on their journey

00:08:12.376 --> 00:08:16.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were approaching the city,
Peter went up to the housetop

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:19.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the sixth hour to pray.”

00:08:21.427 --> 00:08:25.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same chapter,
Cornelius was also a fine example.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 10:30, 31,

00:08:29.394 --> 00:08:32.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reported to Peter:

00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:35.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Four days ago counting from this hour,

00:08:35.984 --> 00:08:39.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was praying in my house at the ninth hour;

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:43.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just then a man in bright clothing
stood in front of me

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and said: ‘Cornelius, your prayer
has been favorably heard,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your gifts of mercy
have been remembered before God.’”

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered
Peter’s prayer and Cornelius’ prayer.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us what we need

00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:05.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase our joy in making disciples.

00:09:05.224 --> 00:09:10.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a report came to John that Jesus
was making many disciples,

00:09:10.062 --> 00:09:12.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John did not become jealous.

00:09:12.523 --> 00:09:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John chapter 3, he replied:

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:18.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This joy of mine has been made full.

00:09:18.446 --> 00:09:23.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That one must go on increasing,
but I must go on decreasing.”

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do not make disciples personally,

00:09:27.789 --> 00:09:31.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still rejoice
with those who do make them.

00:09:31.418 --> 00:09:36.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angels rejoice although they
do not personally make disciples.

00:09:36.424 --> 00:09:39.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 15:7, Jesus said:

00:09:39.927 --> 00:09:44.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There will be more joy in heaven
over one sinner who repents

00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:49.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than over 99 righteous ones
who have no need of repentance.”

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:55.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also rejoice because we have
the Bible and powerful research tools

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in print and electronically

00:09:58.113 --> 00:10:00.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in audio format.

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice because we have
our brotherhood to support and assist us.

00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:10.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask them for suggestions,
and we can invite them to accompany us

00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:14.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry, even if it is
only by computer tie-in

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or telephone witnessing.

00:10:16.549 --> 00:10:21.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we cannot meet together physically
for a congregation meeting,

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can arrange for tie-ins with others
and hear and see them.

00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It warms our heart.

00:10:28.354 --> 00:10:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t forget the provisions
from Jehovah,

00:10:31.023 --> 00:10:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we mentioned
at the beginning of this talk.

00:10:34.068 --> 00:10:37.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we have the privilege of prayer;

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:41.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, the help of God’s angels;

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:45.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, the support of the holy spirit;

00:10:45.664 --> 00:10:49.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fourth, “the wisdom
from above”; and fifth,

00:10:49.626 --> 00:10:54.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritual and emotional strength
that God supplies.

00:10:54.214 --> 00:10:57.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us all of this

00:10:57.218 --> 00:11:01.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he cares about us
and about those we teach.

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will have great joy in the ministry

00:11:03.766 --> 00:11:07.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we take full advantage
of Jehovah’s help.

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:10.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly, we want to mention
something very precious

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:15.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings us deep inner joy,
Psalm 25:14:

00:11:15.821 --> 00:11:19.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:23.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
belongs to those
who fear him” and pray to him.

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:27.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May your joyous friendship with Jehovah

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:30.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the joyous friendship
that disciples

00:11:30.378 --> 00:11:35.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have with Jehovah
—last for an eternity!

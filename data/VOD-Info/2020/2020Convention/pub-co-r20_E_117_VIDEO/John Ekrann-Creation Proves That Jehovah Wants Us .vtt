What’s your favorite animal?

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My favorite animal is a dolphin.

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I was snorkeling in the ocean,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a pod of dolphins came by.

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, with the mask on,
I could see underwater.

00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was beautiful to watch
how they could swim

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how sleek they were in the water.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I watched as one of them
used his powerful tail

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shoot up to the surface of the water.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:29.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lifted my head up
and watched him jump out of the water

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gracefully go right back in.

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:34.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a sight I won’t forget.

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that if we talked
to each of you watching this,

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could tell some really good story
about your favorite animal.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:46.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our beautiful planet Earth
is full of animals.

00:00:46.988 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, though,
for many of us in modern-day life,

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:54.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t get a chance
to interact with animals that much.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of our interaction with animals
is second hand

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through books or videos.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:03.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Internet is full of videos,
especially of cats.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:05.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People share these videos.
Why?

00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:09.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it makes them smile.
They enjoy watching them.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, many of you are probably thinking

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:16.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some video you just watched about animals.

00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:20.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah created animals

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with qualities to bring us joy,
to make us happy.

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:29.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watching them in person or in video
can cultivate our interest.

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:34.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can entertain us
and make us feel good.

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:36.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Jehovah’s sense of humor

00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how the animals interact
and play with one another.

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:43.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can also learn lessons
from the animals.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:47.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 6:6 is an example of that.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 6:6:

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go to the ant, you lazy one;

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:56.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe its ways and become wise.”

00:01:56.688 --> 00:02:00.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can remember as a young boy,
I was fascinated with ants

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:04.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so many of them,
and yet they all knew what to do.

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:09.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they could carry these really big leaves
and other things for their size.

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:13.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to see what they could do
—even the building of their tunnels.

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:15.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As children, many of us

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:19.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were interested in animals
—fascinated with them.

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as we got older,
we became more fascinated with technology

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:26.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or things that man has made.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really the things that man has made

00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:32.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot compare to the things
Jehovah has made,

00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:34.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the animals.

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design and wonder you feel

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:40.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you watch your favorite animal

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:43.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in a category all by itself.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in the following video,
we’re going to see

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:49.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some really beautiful animals.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you will see your favorite animal.

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:59.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals fascinate us.

00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:03.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We marvel at their speed,

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:06.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their agility,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their strength.

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:17.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their beauty and behavior
are a pleasure to watch.

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like us, they play.

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even dance!

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are industrious.

00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A beaver dam can extend hundreds of meters.

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:47.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some can even be seen from space!

00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:52.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we observe animals,
we learn more about the Creator.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:06.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is caring and generous.

00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:10.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he is a happy God.

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:17.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals fascinate us
because we are made in God’s image.

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:23.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy what He enjoys,

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially our earth and its amazing animals.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are his gift to us.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:34.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us make man in our image,

00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:36.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to our likeness,

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let them have in subjection

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:40.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the fish of the sea

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:42.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the flying creatures of the heavens

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:45.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the domestic animals

00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:48.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the earth.”

00:04:55.923 --> 00:04:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you and the others with you
watching that video smiling

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:01.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even laughing a little bit

00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:05.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you saw the little dog
jumping back and forth?

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:08.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the design of animals
to bring us joy

00:05:08.394 --> 00:05:11.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not an evolutionary accident.

00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus, his “master worker,”

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found joy in creating and designing
animal life

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:20.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to delight us.

00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:23.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine Jehovah and Jesus

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:27.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussing designing an elephant?

00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elephant trunk is a nose,

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s an arm,

00:05:31.753 --> 00:05:33.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a showerhead,

00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:35.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a straw,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can even be a snorkel.

00:05:38.302 --> 00:05:41.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that their feet
are so well-padded

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:43.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can hardly hear them coming?

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:48.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Jehovah and Jesus
making this huge elephant and saying,

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re going to make it really quiet.”

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:54.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or can you imagine what the angels thought

00:05:54.694 --> 00:05:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they first saw a lemur dancing

00:05:58.532 --> 00:06:01.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a hummingbird hovering in the air

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:05.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a little puppy chasing its tail?

00:06:06.123 --> 00:06:08.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or can you imagine being Adam,

00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:13.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first human being,
amongst all of these animals?

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:18.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Adam must have thrilled
to watch the animals and name them!

00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you have called an animal
with a funny hump on its back

00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a bird that could mimic
the sounds you made

00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:33.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a lizard that could change colors,

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:37.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even looking at it as it moved,
changing colors, wondering,

00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:39.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How did it do that?’

00:06:41.203 --> 00:06:43.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assigned Adam

00:06:43.455 --> 00:06:46.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not only name the animals
but to care for them.

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:49.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the scripture
that was highlighted in our video

00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:54.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Genesis 1:26.

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:26:

00:06:58.054 --> 00:07:02.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then God said:
‘Let us make man in our image,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘according to our likeness,

00:07:04.102 --> 00:07:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and let them have in subjection
the fish of the sea

00:07:07.356 --> 00:07:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the flying creatures of the heavens

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:12.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the domestic animals
and all the earth

00:07:12.612 --> 00:07:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every creeping animal
that is moving on the earth.’”

00:07:16.532 --> 00:07:18.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah God wanted Adam

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his descendants
—that’s us—

00:07:20.996 --> 00:07:25.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of the animals
and to take delight in them.

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:29.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we take time to enjoy animal life,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can make
some very fascinating discoveries.

00:07:33.134 --> 00:07:38.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see in the video
the lemurs of Madagascar?

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know
how many varieties of lemurs there are?

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:45.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what lemurs eat?

00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:47.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen lemurs play?

00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:49.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I guarantee you,
you will enjoy it and smile when you do.

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:57.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made one discovery about dolphins.

00:07:57.994 --> 00:08:00.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dolphins can blow under water

00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a perfect circle of air,

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:07.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they like to play with it afterward.

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I saw that video,
I could hardly believe my eyes.

00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends, today we can only imagine

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it will be like in the future Paradise

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we can really enjoy animal life
the way Jehovah truly intended.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, this symposium 

00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:30.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been about Jehovah’s creative works

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:33.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—exquisite flowers,

00:08:34.199 --> 00:08:36.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delicious food,

00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:38.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beautiful colors,

00:08:38.245 --> 00:08:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our well-designed bodies,

00:08:40.623 --> 00:08:44.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delightful sounds,
and fascinating animals

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of which convince us

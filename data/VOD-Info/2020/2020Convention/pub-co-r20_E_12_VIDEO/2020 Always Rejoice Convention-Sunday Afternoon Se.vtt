Our convention program
contains over 90 audio and video productions,

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:09.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the one we just enjoyed.

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these videos are made
at various locations around the world.

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites willingly
gave material contributions

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in support of true worship,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have the same privilege today.

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For your convenience,
donations can be made online

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at donate.jw.org.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention has clearly shown
that Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:46.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is our greatest source of joy,
both now and in the future?

00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you will appreciate

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heartwarming final talk
of this convention.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother David Splane of the Governing Body
will discuss the theme

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Find Exquisite Delight in Jehovah’!”

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:12.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an old man,
a very successful one.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d made a lot of money in his time.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s not envy him,

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because for much of his life
he was under a lot of pressure.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His first marriage was a troubled one;

00:01:26.858 --> 00:01:30.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wife was cold and critical.

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:33.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He raised a large family in the truth,

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of his sons
didn’t turn out so well.

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few of his friends weren’t there
for him when he needed them most.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lost a child in death.

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:53.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have guessed
that we’re talking about David,

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:57.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the writer of the 37th Psalm.

00:01:57.556 --> 00:02:02.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was once young,”
he said, but “now I am old.”

00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:07.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is an old man
taking stock of his life

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sharing a secret with us.

00:02:10.652 --> 00:02:13.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that helped him to cope

00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:15.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when everything around him was going wrong?

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out.

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:21.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Psalm 37:4.

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:25.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the theme text for our discussion,
so I’ll give you a moment to find that

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:29.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 37:4.

00:02:29.713 --> 00:02:33.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And David writes:

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:38.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:42.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:46.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to focus on the first part
of the verse at this point:

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah.”

00:02:51.527 --> 00:02:55.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Exquisite delight,”
or maybe you say exquisite.

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:59.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether you say exquisite or exquisite,

00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:01.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t use that expression very much,
do we?

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But look down at the footnote;

00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:07.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Find your greatest joy.”

00:03:07.168 --> 00:03:09.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So David is saying,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Find your greatest joy in Jehovah,

00:03:13.174 --> 00:03:17.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will give you
the desire of your heart.’

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was David’s secret.

00:03:20.973 --> 00:03:24.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t always count on his family life.

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:28.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he never knew
when a trusted friend would turn against him.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did know his God.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that Jehovah
would never disappoint him.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:39.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a good reminder for us,
isn’t it?

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans may disappoint,

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:45.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, never.

00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:47.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is our North Star.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when we get lost
or when we get confused,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we feel we’ve lost our way,
we really need to look heavenward.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look to Jehovah,
and let Jehovah

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be our “greatest joy.”

00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:04.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To know Jehovah is to love him.

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do you do when you
want to get close to someone,

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you want to develop
a friendship with someone?

00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you find ways
to spend time with that person.

00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want that person as a friend.

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:21.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so you go about finding ways
to spend time with that person.

00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same with Jehovah God.

00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:27.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want him as our Friend.

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:29.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we do?

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look for ways to spend time with him—

00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:35.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reading his Word, meditating on his Word,

00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:38.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
letting it sink deeply into our heart.

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the more we get to know Jehovah,

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:43.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we love him

00:04:43.014 --> 00:04:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the more at ease
we’ll be in his presence.

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:48.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where prayer comes in.

00:04:48.728 --> 00:04:51.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can develop a friendship with Jehovah

00:04:51.022 --> 00:04:54.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is so close, so intimate,

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:57.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can confide in Jehovah
things that we would never,

00:04:57.404 --> 00:05:01.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever tell another human on earth.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good news?

00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:05.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good news is that Jehovah wants

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:09.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
us to get just that close to him.

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:14.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we had big plans
for this summer, didn’t we?

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Special conventions,

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:19.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regional conventions
in all parts of the earth,

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:22.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy times, warm fellowship

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:25.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then the coronavirus.

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:28.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, at the end of March,

00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:30.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body realized
that we were going to have to make

00:05:30.771 --> 00:05:34.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some important adjustments
as far as the conventions were concerned.

00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:36.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what to do?

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the outlines had been prepared
—48 of them.

00:05:40.322 --> 00:05:43.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Teaching Committee
came up with an idea.

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:47.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have the Governing Body
and many of the helpers

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:50.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deliver all of the convention talks
on the program.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll record them,
and then the brothers

00:05:53.961 --> 00:05:56.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all parts of the earth

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:59.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be able to enjoy
the program in safety.

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this was going to be
a tremendous job

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:05.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a number of Bethel departments.

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:09.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sixty members of the Broadcasting Department
here at headquarters

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:12.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked tirelessly over a three-week period

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to schedule and record the program.

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:17.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the branches,

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:21.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of energetic volunteers
in our translation departments

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produced the program in 400 languages

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—probably more than 400 languages
when it’s all done.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, 44 broadcasting departments

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branches also had a share.

00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:40.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to all of those who had a share
in making this program possible,

00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all those who were involved in scheduling
and recording and translating,

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to say: “Thank you.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so very much
for all you’ve done for us.”

00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:55.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of broadcasting,

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think Jehovah has been preparing us

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for something like this pandemic?

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:05.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years ago, the decision was made

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set up something called JW Broadcasting®.

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the time, who knew
how practical an arrangement

00:07:13.082 --> 00:07:15.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going to turn out to be?

00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:20.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who knows what uses JWB
will be put to in the future?

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:22.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah looks ahead.

00:07:23.718 --> 00:07:26.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we don’t know ourselves
why certain decisions are made

00:07:26.763 --> 00:07:30.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or why we are making certain decisions,
but Jehovah knows.

00:07:30.892 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is our “greatest joy.”

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:37.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s another thing:

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:40.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the theme
for this convention was being chosen,

00:07:40.568 --> 00:07:43.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no coronavirus on the horizon.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, can you think of a better theme
for a convention than this one?

00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy—what an appropriate theme
for a convention!

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you have lost your jobs,

00:07:56.042 --> 00:08:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have been very sick
during the past few months,

00:08:00.255 --> 00:08:05.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few of you
have lost loved ones in death.

00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no way you can be happy
about those circumstances.

00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:12.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can rejoice
in your knowledge of Jehovah.

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can rejoice in your knowledge

00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:18.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Jehovah God
has in store for us in the future.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People outside don’t have that.

00:08:20.734 --> 00:08:22.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do.

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:25.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in Jehovah.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice
how well our convention program

00:08:28.116 --> 00:08:33.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
matched up with the theme
for this year’s yeartext?

00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:35.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:40.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had so much information
on how to improve on our teaching skills.

00:08:40.837 --> 00:08:43.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think that is?

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:47.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that there’s
a lot more work to do in that respect?

00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:50.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know
when the great tribulation is going to come,

00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:55.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are determined
to keep busy until the end does come.

00:08:55.477 --> 00:08:59.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wasn’t it a good idea
to have us follow the progress

00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:02.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a Bible student, Jade, as Neeta

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:06.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcame one challenge after another?

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was realistic, wasn’t it?

00:09:08.574 --> 00:09:10.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a transformation!

00:09:10.826 --> 00:09:14.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade isn’t “jaded” anymore.

00:09:14.413 --> 00:09:18.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was
a subtle message in those videos:

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:22.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should never,
ever trust first impressions.

00:09:22.463 --> 00:09:26.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First impressions can be wrong.

00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whether you’re conducting
a study right now or not,

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:32.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you can hardly wait
to get back to the field

00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:35.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to apply some of those suggestions.

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful part
of the program that was!

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:41.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about
other parts of the program?

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember
some of these highlights?

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:45.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:09:49.156 --> 00:09:52.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses
around the world,

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:57.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each finding a way

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be joyful.

00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:03.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the trials we face,

00:10:03.754 --> 00:10:06.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can find joy

00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:08.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the choices we’re making, 

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the families we’re raising, 

00:10:16.976 --> 00:10:19.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the creation we’re observing, 

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the peace we’re promoting.

00:10:30.698 --> 00:10:32.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is found

00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:34.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the message we’re preaching.

00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises us joy despite 

00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:44.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the trials we’re enduring

00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:46.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and persecution we’re facing.

00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:48.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promises us joy

00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:51.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the stand we’re taking.

00:10:52.595 --> 00:10:54.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through anything in life,

00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:57.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can find joy in Jehovah.

00:10:58.018 --> 00:11:00.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants you to be happy.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His joy can be yours

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and forever!

00:11:07.277 --> 00:11:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will you accept it?

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:16.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has the right to expect
that we’ll love him

00:11:16.953 --> 00:11:20.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more than we love
our husband, our wife,

00:11:20.832 --> 00:11:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our son or daughter, or our parents.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:26.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also has the right to expect

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:28.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll love him
more than we love our job,

00:11:28.256 --> 00:11:30.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a favorite hobby,

00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe a sport
that we’re passionate about.

00:11:33.637 --> 00:11:38.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has to come first.

00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has your desire to put Jehovah first

00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:44.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
been tested during this pandemic?

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:47.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You lost your job,

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:50.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you searched desperately
for another one.

00:11:50.904 --> 00:11:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, after a long search,
you found one,

00:11:55.284 --> 00:11:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was a job that would require you

00:11:57.536 --> 00:12:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to miss all your meetings
and opportunities for field service.

00:12:01.415 --> 00:12:04.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a temptation to take that job!

00:12:04.877 --> 00:12:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been out of work for months.

00:12:07.212 --> 00:12:09.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You felt helpless, because a family member

00:12:09.965 --> 00:12:12.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is supposed to provide for his family.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take a lot of faith
for you to refuse that job,

00:12:17.765 --> 00:12:21.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray to Jehovah, and then wait,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold on a little longer

00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:27.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what Jehovah
would work out for you,

00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:31.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing that Jehovah has to come first,

00:12:31.237 --> 00:12:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when it comes
to providing for our family.

00:12:33.989 --> 00:12:36.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the example of the Jews

00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:40.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were returning from Babylon to Jerusalem.

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, captivity in Babylon
wasn’t as harsh as slavery in Egypt.

00:12:45.626 --> 00:12:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jews in Babylon could build a house,

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
run a business, plant a vineyard,
get comfortable in life.

00:12:54.844 --> 00:12:57.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them even got rich.

00:12:57.263 --> 00:13:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scholars believe that it was in Babylon

00:13:00.516 --> 00:13:02.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Jews learned about the art

00:13:02.602 --> 00:13:05.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of buying and selling, trade, and commerce.

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would take real faith on their part

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:14.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave their house, their business,

00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:19.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close friends and relatives
who wanted to remain in Babylon

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go to Jerusalem
—a city with none of the glitz of Babylon,

00:13:24.165 --> 00:13:28.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city that most of them had never seen.

00:13:28.252 --> 00:13:32.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would take real faith.

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the returning Jews
got off to a great start.

00:13:36.052 --> 00:13:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They constructed
the foundation of the temple,

00:13:40.223 --> 00:13:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then they ran into problems.

00:13:43.017 --> 00:13:45.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was danger.

00:13:45.353 --> 00:13:47.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how would they show that Jehovah

00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:50.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes first in the face of danger?

00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:54.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they keep on building the temple
in spite of the danger.

00:13:54.362 --> 00:13:56.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do they do?

00:13:56.948 --> 00:14:01.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they got scared,
and they talked themselves

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into believing that it mustn’t be
Jehovah’s will

00:14:04.414 --> 00:14:06.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for them to build the temple.

00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:10.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it was hard.

00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:14.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they started
looking after themselves,

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:16.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking after their own interests.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now remember, Jerusalem was in ruins.

00:14:20.388 --> 00:14:23.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t going to be easy
to start a business,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant crops, and build a house
in a ruined city.

00:14:28.313 --> 00:14:31.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they didn’t say,
“Oh, this is hard;

00:14:31.483 --> 00:14:33.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so it mustn’t be Jehovah’s will

00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:35.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to feed my family.”

00:14:35.654 --> 00:14:38.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found a way to feed their family.

00:14:38.323 --> 00:14:41.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they should’ve had
the same determination

00:14:41.243 --> 00:14:43.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it came to Jehovah’s worship

00:14:43.287 --> 00:14:47.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah has to come first.

00:14:47.082 --> 00:14:50.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were good people.

00:14:50.085 --> 00:14:52.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had had enough faith to leave Babylon

00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:55.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and return to Jerusalem in the first place.

00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that first love had cooled off.

00:14:58.427 --> 00:15:01.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s see how Jehovah felt about that.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Haggai chapter 1,

00:15:04.391 --> 00:15:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read
a few verses at Haggai,

00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:08.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so keep your Bibles open there, please.

00:15:08.937 --> 00:15:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to turn to Haggai chapter 1.

00:15:11.607 --> 00:15:15.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And first of all,
we’re going to read verses 2 through 6

00:15:15.194 --> 00:15:17.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah felt

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:20.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this choice
that the Jews had made,

00:15:20.658 --> 00:15:25.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting themselves ahead
of his worship in spite of danger.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:34.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“These people say,
‘The time has not yet come

00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:37.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the house of Jehovah to be built.’”’

00:15:37.174 --> 00:15:40.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the word of Jehovah again
came through Haggai the prophet,

00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:43.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying: ‘Is it the time

“while this house lies in ruins?’

00:15:49.437 --> 00:15:52.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:15:52.898 --> 00:15:55.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set your heart on your ways.

00:15:55.526 --> 00:15:59.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You have sown much seed,
but you harvest little.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:05.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:16:09.832 --> 00:16:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The one who hires himself out

00:16:13.002 --> 00:16:17.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
puts his wages in a bag full of holes.’”

00:16:17.215 --> 00:16:20.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you think Jehovah
didn’t want them

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:23.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build a house or feed their family?

00:16:23.638 --> 00:16:25.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s worship has to come first.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what exclusive devotion
is all about.

00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:35.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
do we learn from these verses?

00:16:35.984 --> 00:16:37.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s Jehovah telling the people?

00:16:37.986 --> 00:16:39.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s saying: ‘Look at you.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You work and work and work.

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:43.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’re not getting anywhere.

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:48.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re aren’t getting rich,
and you aren’t even making ends meet.’

00:16:48.872 --> 00:16:50.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:54.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have the blessing of Jehovah.

00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:58.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah
 that makes one rich.”

00:16:59.424 --> 00:17:02.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one of the scenes
from our dramatic Bible reading

00:17:02.844 --> 00:17:04.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrates this point very well.

00:17:04.888 --> 00:17:06.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s remind ourselves.

00:17:06.723 --> 00:17:08.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look.

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:12.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah compares the results
of the Jews’ self-centered efforts

00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:14.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of a hired worker who puts

00:17:14.648 --> 00:17:16.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wages into a moth-eaten sack.

00:17:18.235 --> 00:17:21.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Jews
are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:17:21.613 --> 00:17:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he holds back his blessing.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the Jews’ labor are limited,

00:17:26.785 --> 00:17:29.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lives lack joy.

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:32.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, some try to fill that void

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:36.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by beautifying their own homes.

00:17:36.086 --> 00:17:40.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>material</i> things
cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not wrong to enjoy nice things.

00:17:46.555 --> 00:17:48.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But material things

00:17:48.432 --> 00:17:51.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot bring us true and lasting joy,

00:17:51.977 --> 00:17:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if we neglect
Jehovah’s work to obtain them.

00:17:58.734 --> 00:18:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s nothing wrong
with buying new things.

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:05.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think many of us
still have a black-and-white TV.

00:18:05.073 --> 00:18:09.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is, Jehovah must come first.

00:18:09.244 --> 00:18:13.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Jews
were facing stiff opposition.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was danger.

00:18:15.042 --> 00:18:19.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I want you to notice a little detail
as we read Haggai 1:7, 8.

00:18:19.338 --> 00:18:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told you to keep your Bibles open.

00:18:21.715 --> 00:18:26.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t, but I’ve got it again
—Haggai 1:7, 8.

00:18:26.428 --> 00:18:30.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice, the Jews are in danger.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are opposers,
but we’re looking for a little detail

00:18:35.145 --> 00:18:39.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should have reassured
the Jews in verses 7 and 8:

00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:45.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:18:45.948 --> 00:18:48.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set your heart on your ways.

00:18:48.617 --> 00:18:51.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And build the house,
so that I may take pleasure in it

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:59.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I may be a glorified,’ Jehovah says.”

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see it—“Jehovah of armies”?

00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:07.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that expression
is repeated over and over again

00:19:07.511 --> 00:19:11.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Haggai,
and it should have reassured the Jews

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their enemies were nothing

00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:17.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in comparison with Jehovah
and his armies.

00:19:17.855 --> 00:19:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah telling the Jews:
‘Go ahead.

00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:25.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build the temple. I have your back.’

00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:32.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find your “greatest joy” in Jehovah.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really the theme
that we’re talking about today.

00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:37.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about it.

00:19:37.875 --> 00:19:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s talk about some aspects
of this very important theme.

00:19:42.338 --> 00:19:45.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, we’ll talk
about our relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:45.258 --> 00:19:47.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s so important.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction to this talk,
we mentioned David.

00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a lot of problems,
maybe more than most of us.

00:19:54.517 --> 00:19:57.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he never lost his joy.

00:19:57.645 --> 00:20:01.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He found joy
in his relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:01.941 --> 00:20:06.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, his physical living conditions
weren’t always the best.

00:20:06.821 --> 00:20:11.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When King Saul was alive,
David was on the run most of the time.

00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:13.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he sleep?

00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:17.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a cave,
in a place “difficult to approach,”

00:20:17.332 --> 00:20:19.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just anywhere that was safe.

00:20:19.334 --> 00:20:23.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then at times David
and his men ran low on food.

00:20:23.505 --> 00:20:25.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they ran out of food.

00:20:25.799 --> 00:20:27.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know the feeling?

00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:31.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been low on food
during this pandemic?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David couldn’t even enjoy
a normal married life

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:37.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’d married the daughter of Saul,

00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:40.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then Saul had given her to another man.

00:20:40.897 --> 00:20:43.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what got him through all that?

00:20:43.483 --> 00:20:46.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His relationship with Jehovah.

00:20:46.194 --> 00:20:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was the constant in his life.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:52.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you could just feel
the unbreakable bond

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:57.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah and David
when you read the 16th Psalm.

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s something
very interesting about this Psalm.

00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:01.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And first of all, we’re just going
to look at verse 1 briefly.

00:21:08.926 --> 00:21:10.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 16,

00:21:10.928 --> 00:21:15.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice in verse 1
the situation that David is in.

00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:20.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is in need of protection.

00:21:20.938 --> 00:21:25.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some unstated way,
David is in danger.

00:21:25.943 --> 00:21:28.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what’s interesting
about this Psalm?

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:31.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the rest of it,
he doesn’t dwell on his problems.

00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He dwells on the way
Jehovah is helping him with his problems.

00:21:36.412 --> 00:21:40.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 8, David says:

00:21:40.749 --> 00:21:45.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I keep Jehovah before me constantly.

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:50.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he is at my right hand,
I will never be shaken.”

00:21:51.469 --> 00:21:53.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with his eyes of faith,

00:21:53.554 --> 00:21:58.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David could see
Jehovah beside him, protecting him.

00:21:58.309 --> 00:22:01.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we can have that vision,
we’re not going to be afraid

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of anything or anyone, are we?

00:22:04.148 --> 00:22:07.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, find your “greatest joy” in Jehovah?

00:22:07.735 --> 00:22:09.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a man who is in need of protection.

00:22:09.862 --> 00:22:11.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a man who feels he’s in danger.

00:22:11.864 --> 00:22:13.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 9:

00:22:13.866 --> 00:22:18.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So my heart rejoices,
my whole being is joyful.

00:22:18.871 --> 00:22:21.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I reside in security.”

00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s in danger in some way,
and yet he feels safe.

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:27.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He feels secure.

00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:29.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then notice verse 10.

00:22:29.006 --> 00:22:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually we apply verse 10
to the resurrection of Jesus.

00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of it from David’s perspective:

00:22:35.638 --> 00:22:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you will not leave me in the Grave.”

00:22:39.475 --> 00:22:43.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David knew that even if somehow
he were to die,

00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:46.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not leave him in the Grave.

00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:48.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would resurrect him.

00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:51.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of verse 11,
a beautiful expression:

00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:56.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In your presence is abundant joy.”

00:22:58.578 --> 00:23:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you notice the expressions

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:04.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my heart rejoices,”
“my whole being is joyful,”

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your presence is abundant joy”?

00:23:08.505 --> 00:23:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s life wasn’t always easy,

00:23:11.674 --> 00:23:15.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but feeling that he was
in the presence of Jehovah

00:23:15.387 --> 00:23:17.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feeling the support of Jehovah—

00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:22.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to get through it
and to get through it with joy.

00:23:22.727 --> 00:23:25.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your life isn’t always easy.

00:23:25.897 --> 00:23:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ve had many

00:23:28.024 --> 00:23:30.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anxious moments during this pandemic.

00:23:30.777 --> 00:23:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, you turned away from your problems,

00:23:35.407 --> 00:23:39.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you focused on Jehovah God, and you reset.

00:23:39.953 --> 00:23:43.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your joy returned.

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many reasons for joy can you think of?

00:23:47.461 --> 00:23:49.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song says they’re “abundant.”

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think of a few.

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:54.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one: Jesus said:

00:23:54.843 --> 00:23:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man [no man] can come to me

00:23:59.848 --> 00:24:02.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless the Father . . . draws him.”

00:24:02.976 --> 00:24:04.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think what that means.

00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw something in you that he loves.

00:24:09.316 --> 00:24:11.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked down, and he said:

00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:15.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want that person in the new world.”

00:24:15.697 --> 00:24:19.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t try to argue with Jehovah.

00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t say: “You made a mistake.

00:24:21.495 --> 00:24:22.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t mean me.

00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:24.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must mean the fellow next to me.

00:24:24.414 --> 00:24:27.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But me?
I’m not worth it.”

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah drew <i>you</i> to the truth.

00:24:32.005 --> 00:24:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept it.
Accept it.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God loves you.

00:24:39.763 --> 00:24:43.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that is a reason for joy.

00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:47.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another reason for joy
is that Jehovah answers our prayers.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:51.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always available,
always ready to listen.

00:24:51.483 --> 00:24:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can pray
in any language at any time.

00:24:54.778 --> 00:24:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah won’t always do
what we ask him to do,

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:01.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will always listen.

00:25:01.368 --> 00:25:05.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in Jehovah’s service
because he’s reasonable

00:25:05.372 --> 00:25:07.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what he expects of us.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You come home after a long day’s work;

00:25:10.252 --> 00:25:14.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re exhausted, worn out, stressed out.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:19.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You come home from field service
or from the meeting; you’re refreshed.

00:25:19.345 --> 00:25:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is reasonable.

00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:24.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re also confident that Jehovah

00:25:24.684 --> 00:25:26.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will provide our food and clothing

00:25:26.936 --> 00:25:29.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how dire the situation gets.

00:25:29.397 --> 00:25:32.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what he provides
might not always be fancy,

00:25:32.817 --> 00:25:34.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’ll always be enough.

00:25:34.986 --> 00:25:38.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll always be adequate to get us through.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:41.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we should always be grateful
for anything Jehovah provides,

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:44.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how simple it might be.

00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A researcher once drew a distinction

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah’s Witnesses
and some others

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were in concentration camps
in Nazi Germany.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A non-Witness might say:
“Where are the gods?

00:25:58.635 --> 00:26:02.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I have to eat
is this miserable piece of bread.”

00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Witness in the same camp

00:26:05.934 --> 00:26:09.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might say: “Oh, Jehovah, thank you.

00:26:09.854 --> 00:26:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have a piece of bread to eat.

00:26:12.482 --> 00:26:15.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can eat and regain my strength

00:26:15.777 --> 00:26:18.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and live just a little longer to serve you.

00:26:18.238 --> 00:26:23.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe I’ll be able to share
some of my bread with someone else.”

00:26:23.243 --> 00:26:28.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conclusion of the researcher:
Both received the piece of bread.

00:26:28.248 --> 00:26:31.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was all in the point of view.

00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:34.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Witness had a spiritual point of view,

00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:36.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Witness was grateful

00:26:36.756 --> 00:26:41.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for even a simple provision
that Jehovah had made.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, during this pandemic,

00:26:43.722 --> 00:26:46.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be that your menu
has been greatly simplified.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you haven’t been able to eat
the way you would normally eat.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had just pasta or rice to eat,

00:26:54.274 --> 00:26:56.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you didn’t say: “Look at this.

00:26:56.651 --> 00:27:00.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I have to eat is pasta.
All I have to eat is rice.”

00:27:00.781 --> 00:27:05.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You thanked Jehovah
for the rice or for the pasta.

00:27:05.285 --> 00:27:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were grateful for the provisions.

00:27:07.537 --> 00:27:10.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you realized
that no matter how simple,

00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:14.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these provisions came from Jehovah.

00:27:14.628 --> 00:27:19.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has also given us
a loving spiritual family.

00:27:19.091 --> 00:27:22.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think many of us
have come to the conclusion

00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we never really understood

00:27:25.097 --> 00:27:30.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a loving spiritual family we have
until this pandemic.

00:27:30.102 --> 00:27:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young married couple were both afflicted

00:27:33.522 --> 00:27:36.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the coronavirus—both of them.

00:27:36.608 --> 00:27:37.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how would they eat?

00:27:37.985 --> 00:27:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t go out shopping,
and they couldn’t see anyone.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother said,

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:46.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We had groceries at the door constantly.”

00:27:46.952 --> 00:27:51.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wife says,
“I felt I had Jehovah’s

00:27:51.165 --> 00:27:56.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone else’s arms
wrapped around me.”

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:01.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Social distancing
doesn’t apply to Jehovah.

00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can wrap his arms around anyone.

00:28:05.054 --> 00:28:07.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers have been reconnecting

00:28:07.723 --> 00:28:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with long-lost return visits
and unbelieving family members

00:28:11.393 --> 00:28:13.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting Bible studies with them.

00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:17.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you probably know,
meeting attendance has increased,

00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:20.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inactive and disfellowshipped persons

00:28:20.152 --> 00:28:23.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also trying to draw close to Jehovah.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One disfellowshipped person said,

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:27.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I view this

00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:31.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one last warning from Jehovah.”

00:28:31.497 --> 00:28:36.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just a word to any
who may be listening

00:28:36.085 --> 00:28:39.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are no longer serving Jehovah.

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:42.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you waiting for?

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:44.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God loves you.

00:28:44.302 --> 00:28:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God wants you to return.

00:28:46.596 --> 00:28:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to put his arms
around you once more.

00:28:50.183 --> 00:28:55.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please, take advantage
of the invitation, and come back.

00:28:55.146 --> 00:28:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please, don’t give in to the idea,

00:28:58.066 --> 00:29:01.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I’ve done nothing up to now,
and now there’s been a pandemic,

00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:03.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and if I come back to the truth,

00:29:03.363 --> 00:29:05.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, Jehovah is not going to accept me.’

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read your Bible.

00:29:07.825 --> 00:29:09.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll find that in many cases,

00:29:09.953 --> 00:29:13.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a disaster of some sort
that caused people

00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:16.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to their senses
and return to Jehovah,

00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:19.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah lovingly accepted them.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Manasseh as an example.

00:29:23.007 --> 00:29:27.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have commented
that they’ve actually drawn closer

00:29:27.011 --> 00:29:29.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their brothers and sisters
during this pandemic.

00:29:29.848 --> 00:29:32.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many, many say,

00:29:32.183 --> 00:29:36.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I feel more cared for than ever.”

00:29:36.438 --> 00:29:40.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in our relationship

00:29:40.025 --> 00:29:43.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah
and with our brothers.

00:29:43.445 --> 00:29:46.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we were talking about David.

00:29:46.281 --> 00:29:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in Psalm 16

00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there “is abundant joy” in Jehovah.

00:29:52.287 --> 00:29:54.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was his joy based on?

00:29:54.414 --> 00:29:56.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t based on his privileges

00:29:56.917 --> 00:30:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—David didn’t become king for years—

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:03.548 --> 00:30:06.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a good example for us.

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:08.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that there is a privilege

00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:11.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve been expecting
that seems a long time coming.

00:30:11.098 --> 00:30:13.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do in the meantime?

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep working
on your relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:16.228 --> 00:30:18.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep strengthening that relationship.

00:30:18.647 --> 00:30:22.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be the best investment
you’ve ever made.

00:30:22.693 --> 00:30:27.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t forget
the greatest privilege any of us can have

00:30:27.239 --> 00:30:29.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to bear the name of Jehovah,

00:30:29.992 --> 00:30:33.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be called one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:30:33.453 --> 00:30:37.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re part of a family
of brothers and sisters

00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love us and who would
even risk their lives for us.

00:30:42.045 --> 00:30:45.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve discussed finding joy

00:30:45.299 --> 00:30:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:50.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second aspect,

00:30:50.304 --> 00:30:54.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is finding joy in the Bible,

00:30:54.433 --> 00:30:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finding joy in God’s written Word.

00:30:58.812 --> 00:31:01.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get to know Jehovah best

00:31:01.649 --> 00:31:05.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading his Word and meditating on it.

00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:08.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in recent times,
the congregation Bible reading

00:31:08.322 --> 00:31:11.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been shortened,
and there’s a good reason for that.

00:31:11.617 --> 00:31:14.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not so we can get
our Bible reading over with

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on to other things.

00:31:16.622 --> 00:31:20.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so that we will take our time,
slow down,

00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:22.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditate on what we’re reading.

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chew it up; digest it thoroughly.

00:31:25.047 --> 00:31:30.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jehovah talking to you and to me,
sharing his thoughts with us.

00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:33.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is amazing,
and we need to appreciate it.

00:31:33.764 --> 00:31:38.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one way
that we can enjoy our Bible reading

00:31:38.019 --> 00:31:41.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to make the connection
between what we’re reading now

00:31:41.314 --> 00:31:45.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we’ve read in the past
and see how they match up.

00:31:45.276 --> 00:31:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example—just a short one.

00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:53.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Numbers chapter 12

00:31:53.034 --> 00:31:58.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Numbers 12:1, 2.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:02.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the setting
is pretty self-explanatory.

00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:07.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Numbers 12:1, 2:

00:32:07.256 --> 00:32:12.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Miriam and Aaron
began to speak against Moses

00:32:12.262 --> 00:32:15.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the Cushite wife he had married,

00:32:15.431 --> 00:32:18.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:32:18.184 --> 00:32:23.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were saying: ‘Is it only by Moses
that Jehovah has spoken?

00:32:23.064 --> 00:32:26.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he not also spoken through us?’”

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:29.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was their argument?

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basically, in plain English,
their argument was that Moses

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was hogging the limelight,
that he wanted to be the center of attention.

00:32:38.955 --> 00:32:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is that true?

00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:45.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous chapter
—chapter 11—

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we read?

00:32:47.172 --> 00:32:51.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses willingly shares his authority

00:32:51.593 --> 00:32:55.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 70 of the men of the elders of Israel.

00:32:55.764 --> 00:32:58.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there was no serious question

00:32:58.266 --> 00:33:01.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Moses wanting to have the limelight.

00:33:01.561 --> 00:33:04.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was a humble man.

00:33:04.773 --> 00:33:09.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, this is Numbers chapter 12.

00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:11.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Aaron

00:33:11.071 --> 00:33:14.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
questioning Moses’ authority.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can learn a little bit more about this

00:33:18.245 --> 00:33:20.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from something that is tucked far away

00:33:20.414 --> 00:33:22.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of Deuteronomy.

00:33:22.624 --> 00:33:25.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Deuteronomy chapter 9,

00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:28.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to see
if we can learn something

00:33:28.171 --> 00:33:31.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Aaron and why Aaron’s attitude

00:33:31.717 --> 00:33:33.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so shocking

00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:38.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Deuteronomy 9:20.

00:33:38.891 --> 00:33:42.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a revelation.

00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:46.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Moses
in the very last month of his life,

00:33:46.732 --> 00:33:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking to the Israelites,
and he says:

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:53.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was so angry with Aaron

00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:56.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he was ready to annihilate him,

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I made supplication for Aaron.”

00:34:00.996 --> 00:34:05.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron owed his life to Moses.

00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:09.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he dares
to question Moses’ leadership

00:34:09.755 --> 00:34:12.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the nation of Israel.

00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:14.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is really shocking.

00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:17.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what does this teach you about Moses?

00:34:17.721 --> 00:34:20.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is a very humble man,

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:23.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s not quick to take credit for things.

00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do we say that?

00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Moses wrote the book of Exodus
and the story of the golden calf,

00:34:30.693 --> 00:34:34.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never mentioned that Jehovah
wanted to annihilate Aaron

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:38.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his part in the golden-calf incident.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron was still alive,

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Moses spared Aaron that indignity.

00:34:44.707 --> 00:34:49.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only after Aaron’s death

00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:53.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the very last month
of Moses’ life that we learn about it.

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:58.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that tell you something
about how kind and humble Moses was?

00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:02.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is just to illustrate the fact

00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:06.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we try to take one point
that we’ve learned in the past

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:09.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and connect it up
with what we’re reading now,

00:35:09.023 --> 00:35:12.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will often help
the Bible reading to come alive.

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider some of the things

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Word has done for us.

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:21.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what it was like
before you came into the truth?

00:35:21.369 --> 00:35:25.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A favorite relative of yours
who was happily married

00:35:25.582 --> 00:35:28.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lost her husband in death.

00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:31.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the funeral, a priest told her

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:34.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that her husband was in purgatory.

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:36.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And unless the widow paid up,

00:35:36.217 --> 00:35:39.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was going to stay there for a long time.

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:41.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d just lost her husband.

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting was that?

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then you started studying the Bible.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You came to Romans 6:7:

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:57.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who has died
has been acquitted from his sin.”

00:35:57.489 --> 00:36:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Acquitted from his sin”

00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:03.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and your Bible teacher
explained what that means.

00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:07.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that when you die,
the debt is paid.

00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:10.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t go on paying after death.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suffer in hell,
and you don’t suffer in purgatory.

00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:19.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That one Bible verse
could completely change your view

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what happens at death.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
maybe you grew up in a family

00:36:25.308 --> 00:36:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where evolution was the order of the day

00:36:28.854 --> 00:36:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so no hope, no hope for the future.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This life is all there is.

00:36:36.445 --> 00:36:38.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you came to learn

00:36:38.989 --> 00:36:42.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have a heavenly Father
who loves you very much

00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:45.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who wants to give you
a future and a hope.

00:36:45.245 --> 00:36:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it was to discover Jehovah!

00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us grew up in a family

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the parents didn’t get along so well.

00:36:53.796 --> 00:36:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t point to them and say,

00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:59.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now that is how
a man should treat his wife,”

00:36:59.093 --> 00:37:02.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “That is how a woman
should treat her husband.”

00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just didn’t get along.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed Jehovah; we needed the Bible;

00:37:07.393 --> 00:37:09.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we needed Jehovah’s organization

00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:13.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us how to have a happy family life.

00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s more.

00:37:15.734 --> 00:37:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently a clergyman
was asked by a journalist

00:37:18.821 --> 00:37:22.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why pandemics like the coronavirus occur.

00:37:22.783 --> 00:37:24.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the clergyman answered,

00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, suffering is part of life.”

00:37:28.372 --> 00:37:31.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That didn’t answer the question.

00:37:31.208 --> 00:37:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist wasn’t asking, ‘Do we suffer?’

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist knew that we suffer.

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journalist wanted to know why we suffer.

00:37:40.384 --> 00:37:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t get an answer.

00:37:42.678 --> 00:37:45.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A professor of New Testament theology

00:37:45.056 --> 00:37:48.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was asked the same question,
Why do we suffer?

00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what he said?

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everybody suffers.

00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God suffers.”

00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:57.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of an answer is that?

00:37:57.944 --> 00:38:00.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy we are to have the answers

00:38:00.947 --> 00:38:03.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those questions from the Bible.

00:38:03.741 --> 00:38:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking about God’s written Word,

00:38:07.537 --> 00:38:12.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since 1966, Jehovah’s organization
has made the Bible come alive

00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:16.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most outstanding way
through the Bible dramas.

00:38:16.796 --> 00:38:19.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really has made the Bible come alive,
hasn’t it?

00:38:19.924 --> 00:38:23.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s helped us to visualize
what life was like in Bible times,

00:38:23.094 --> 00:38:26.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve come to realize
that people living in Bible times

00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weren’t really so very different
from people who are living today.

00:38:30.226 --> 00:38:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s review a few scenes
and see what lessons we can glean.

00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a look.

00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:45.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:38:46.993 --> 00:38:48.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a visitor last night.

00:38:50.955 --> 00:38:52.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was your wife,

00:38:55.877 --> 00:38:57.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or should I say your former wife.

00:38:59.214 --> 00:39:00.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:39:00.382 --> 00:39:03.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you care how you’ve hurt your innocent mate?

00:39:03.468 --> 00:39:05.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look! Moses said if you find something

00:39:07.806 --> 00:39:10.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indecent with your wife, a man must write

00:39:10.058 --> 00:39:12.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certificate of divorce, hand it to her,

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dismiss her.

00:39:13.478 --> 00:39:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If giving me no children isn’t indecent, then what is?

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:19.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m tired of living with her.

00:39:19.568 --> 00:39:21.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:39:21.194 --> 00:39:22.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gizla?

00:39:22.821 --> 00:39:24.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:39:26.199 --> 00:39:28.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse

00:39:28.702 --> 00:39:30.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to take a wife from the nations!

00:39:30.537 --> 00:39:33.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says: “They will turn your sons away

00:39:33.165 --> 00:39:35.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from following me to serve other gods;

00:39:35.542 --> 00:39:38.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you”!

00:39:38.295 --> 00:39:40.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are you to counsel me?

00:39:40.464 --> 00:39:42.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find his own joy,

00:39:42.591 --> 00:39:44.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I intend to find mine.

00:39:44.968 --> 00:39:49.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:39:49.473 --> 00:39:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really think you can give

00:39:50.933 --> 00:39:52.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yourself more joy than he can?

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:07.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our “greatest joy” comes
when we obey Jehovah.

00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:10.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look again.

00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:15.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come along.

00:40:15.124 --> 00:40:17.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Ana la mitbayen.</i>

00:40:17.751 --> 00:40:19.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here!

00:40:19.795 --> 00:40:21.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to listen to me. I’m your father!

00:40:21.547 --> 00:40:23.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with your children?

00:40:24.633 --> 00:40:26.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t like coming to the temple.

00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:30.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sweetie, why don’t you like it?

00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:32.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Shvok Y-ati!</i>

00:40:33.559 --> 00:40:34.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here now!

00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:40.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, my lord.

00:40:40.858 --> 00:40:42.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:48.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:40:48.574 --> 00:40:50.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not?

00:40:52.995 --> 00:40:54.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:40:54.163 --> 00:40:55.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:40:55.957 --> 00:40:58.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:40:58.167 --> 00:40:59.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go!

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder your children don’t love Jehovah.

00:41:01.879 --> 00:41:03.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aah!

00:41:03.005 --> 00:41:04.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you imagine that you could succeed

00:41:04.715 --> 00:41:06.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without Jehovah’s blessing?

00:41:06.592 --> 00:41:08.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for Jehovah’s blessing!

00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you?

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:10.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you didn’t obey him.

00:41:10.972 --> 00:41:14.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, how can Jehovah bless something

00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:16.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is against his will?

00:41:20.857 --> 00:41:22.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the lesson here?

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t answer prayers

00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:27.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are not in harmony with his will.

00:41:27.655 --> 00:41:29.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again—

00:41:36.623 --> 00:41:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that all about?

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham refuses to move into Jerusalem,

00:41:45.548 --> 00:41:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to support him.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you say?

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him Nehemiah is doing Jehovah’s will.

00:41:55.683 --> 00:41:57.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham doesn’t understand how happy

00:41:57.686 --> 00:42:01.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be if-if he would just follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:42:04.234 --> 00:42:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we will move if we are selected?

00:42:09.072 --> 00:42:10.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d rather be like Nehemiah than like Raham.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You agree?

00:42:18.373 --> 00:42:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:21.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:42:24.504 --> 00:42:26.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson?

00:42:26.506 --> 00:42:30.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy families follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:35.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are a lot more lessons
to be learned from this drama.

00:42:35.974 --> 00:42:39.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can discover them
as you review it at home.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:44.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You guessed it,
we’re releasing the drama today.

00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:47.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can access it following this talk.

00:42:47.945 --> 00:42:51.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman will show you how.

00:42:51.782 --> 00:42:56.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may applaud.

00:42:56.787 --> 00:43:01.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we find joy
in our relationship with Jehovah.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find joy in studying his Word

00:43:04.169 --> 00:43:07.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discovering beautiful things in his Word.

00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:09.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about Jehovah’s name?

00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:14.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we find joy in Jehovah’s name as well?

00:43:14.596 --> 00:43:17.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly in the last few years,

00:43:17.558 --> 00:43:20.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of emphasis has been placed
on Jehovah’s name.

00:43:20.894 --> 00:43:23.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Warwick, in the museum,

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we even have an exhibit
about the divine name.

00:43:27.568 --> 00:43:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do you suppose that is?

00:43:29.612 --> 00:43:33.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think there’s
so much emphasis on God’s name?

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah loves his name,

00:43:36.702 --> 00:43:40.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he loves those who love his name.

00:43:40.498 --> 00:43:44.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something we discover
when we read Malachi chapter 3

00:43:47.338 --> 00:43:50.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Malachi chapter 3,

00:43:50.758 --> 00:43:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

00:43:56.305 --> 00:43:58.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi 3:16:

00:44:05.606 --> 00:44:10.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time those who fear Jehovah
spoke with one another,

00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:12.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one with his companion,

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:16.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Jehovah
kept paying attention and listening.

00:44:16.784 --> 00:44:19.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And a book of remembrance was written

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before him for those fearing Jehovah

00:44:22.415 --> 00:44:26.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and notice this] and for those

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meditating on his name.”

00:44:29.297 --> 00:44:32.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, in chapter 4 and verse 2,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah praises those “who honor [His] name.”

00:44:36.888 --> 00:44:39.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go back to this expression

00:44:39.223 --> 00:44:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those meditating on his name.”

00:44:42.185 --> 00:44:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think that means?

00:44:44.354 --> 00:44:48.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely it means more than
just accepting that God has a name.

00:44:48.441 --> 00:44:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that.

00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:53.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Jews in Malachi’s day,

00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:56.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the unfaithful ones, knew that.

00:44:56.074 --> 00:45:01.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But surely it means meditating
on the meaning of God’s name

00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:03.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on the role

00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:07.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can have in vindicating his name.

00:45:07.544 --> 00:45:11.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know, many scholars
believe that Jehovah’s name

00:45:11.798 --> 00:45:15.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “He Causes to Become.”

00:45:15.302 --> 00:45:19.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can become
whatever he needs to become,

00:45:19.389 --> 00:45:24.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can make you become
whatever he needs you to be.

00:45:24.144 --> 00:45:27.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days of Israel,
what did Jehovah need?

00:45:27.856 --> 00:45:30.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often he needed prophets.

00:45:30.192 --> 00:45:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he get them?

00:45:32.319 --> 00:45:34.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From ordinary people.

00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took a very shy young man named Jeremiah

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turned him
into a bold and courageous prophet.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did the same with a farmer named Amos.

00:45:44.706 --> 00:45:49.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t tell Jehovah what you can and can’t do.

00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:54.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might be surprised
about what you can do

00:45:54.007 --> 00:45:57.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you just put yourself in Jehovah’s hands.

00:45:57.177 --> 00:46:01.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many in this audience once said:

00:46:01.265 --> 00:46:04.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never preach from door to door,”

00:46:04.768 --> 00:46:09.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never pioneer,”
“I could never be a missionary,”

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:13.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never serve
where the need is great”?

00:46:13.902 --> 00:46:17.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah knew better.

00:46:17.656 --> 00:46:21.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can trust Jehovah
and what he promises to do.

00:46:21.994 --> 00:46:24.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always keep his promises.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you
go through the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:46:26.332 --> 00:46:29.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you find certain expressions
over and over again.

00:46:29.668 --> 00:46:31.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Jews rebel against Jehovah.

00:46:31.837 --> 00:46:35.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do terrible things,
sometimes disgusting things.

00:46:35.132 --> 00:46:38.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you, the reader, are saying:

00:46:38.093 --> 00:46:41.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah, you really
ought to annihilate these people.

00:46:41.222 --> 00:46:43.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s terrible what they’re doing.’

00:46:43.432 --> 00:46:46.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then Jehovah reconsiders.

00:46:46.977 --> 00:46:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:46:49.105 --> 00:46:53.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For the sake of my promise
that I made to Abraham,’

00:46:53.025 --> 00:46:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for the sake of the covenant
that [I] made with [my servant] David,’

00:46:56.737 --> 00:47:00.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for the sake of my name’”

00:47:00.449 --> 00:47:05.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to Jehovah, a promise is a promise.

00:47:05.246 --> 00:47:08.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promised Abraham and David

00:47:08.165 --> 00:47:11.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he wouldn’t forsake their offspring.

00:47:11.502 --> 00:47:13.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he meant what he said.

00:47:13.504 --> 00:47:15.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think what that means.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing will make
Jehovah go back on his word.

00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah promises
that he’s going to take this earth

00:47:22.638 --> 00:47:26.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn it into a paradise,
you can take that to the bank.

00:47:26.225 --> 00:47:30.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will keep his promise.

00:47:30.271 --> 00:47:33.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how has Jehovah shown
that a promise is a promise

00:47:33.858 --> 00:47:35.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this convention?

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he promise?

00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:41.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My servants will eat.”

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:45.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Governing Body
had to find a way to serve the food.

00:47:45.245 --> 00:47:47.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided the food.

00:47:47.538 --> 00:47:49.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provided it in abundance.

00:47:49.707 --> 00:47:51.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank him for it.

00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All praise goes to Jehovah
for this convention program.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we first discovered
that God has a name,

00:48:00.426 --> 00:48:03.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a turning point for many of us.

00:48:03.096 --> 00:48:06.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A circuit overseer was going
from door to door one morning,

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:09.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at one door,
a teenage boy answered.

00:48:09.644 --> 00:48:12.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He announced
that his parents were not at home,

00:48:12.814 --> 00:48:15.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the circuit overseer said,

00:48:15.066 --> 00:48:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, just before I leave
I’d like to show you something.”

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:21.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he showed the boy Jehovah’s name

00:48:21.823 --> 00:48:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible—Psalm 83:18.

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boy took the Bible to have a closer look,

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:32.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turned around, went into the house,

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:37.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shut the door
—with the circuit overseer’s Bible.

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:41.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer waited and waited,

00:48:41.927 --> 00:48:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he thought he’d lost his Bible.

00:48:44.596 --> 00:48:48.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the boy’s mother
came to the door,

00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:50.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she apologized for pretending
that she wasn’t home.

00:48:50.852 --> 00:48:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she said she had been astonished

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn that God has a name.

00:48:56.775 --> 00:48:59.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led to a good witness.

00:48:59.945 --> 00:49:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
do we know about God’s name?

00:49:03.615 --> 00:49:08.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that “the name
of Jehovah is a strong tower.”

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to be able
to count on Jehovah

00:49:12.457 --> 00:49:15.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the attack of Gog of Magog.

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Gog attacks,
Jehovah is going to vindicate himself

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—He is going to protect His people
for the sake of His name.

00:49:25.888 --> 00:49:29.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s another reason
for us to love Jehovah’s name

00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:32.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to rejoice in his name.

00:49:32.019 --> 00:49:37.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because his name is involved,
Jehovah is going to protect his people.

00:49:37.024 --> 00:49:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we talk
about the attack of Gog and Magog,

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it make you kind of nervous?

00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:45.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a couple of things to think about.

00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:47.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:49:47.326 --> 00:49:51.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose idea is it
for Gog to attack when he does?

00:49:51.622 --> 00:49:53.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out.

00:49:53.624 --> 00:49:56.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 38

00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:04.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we’re going to start with verse 4),

00:50:04.593 --> 00:50:07.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38 beginning with verse 4.

00:50:07.888 --> 00:50:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is Jehovah talking

00:50:10.433 --> 00:50:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to that coalition of nations

00:50:13.102 --> 00:50:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known collectively as Gog.

00:50:16.272 --> 00:50:18.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want you to pay particular attention

00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first part of the verse,
that’s verse 4.

00:50:22.445 --> 00:50:25.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says to Gog:

00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:29.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will turn you around

00:50:29.577 --> 00:50:33.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put hooks in your jaws

00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring you out with all your army.”

00:50:38.628 --> 00:50:41.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about that.

00:50:41.047 --> 00:50:44.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will turn you around.”

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like Gog
was headed in the opposite direction,

00:50:48.179 --> 00:50:50.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then Jehovah turns him around,

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He draws him out to attack.

00:50:53.434 --> 00:50:55.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does that tell you?

00:50:55.562 --> 00:50:59.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The timing of the attack is Jehovah’s.

00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:02.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that doesn’t mean that Gog of Magog

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had no intention of attacking God’s people.

00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:07.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was planning to attack at some point.

00:51:07.782 --> 00:51:11.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s the timing
of the attack that’s Jehovah’s.

00:51:11.578 --> 00:51:14.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Pure Worship</i> book
explains it this way—it says:

00:51:14.748 --> 00:51:19.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As if putting hooks
in Gog’s jaws and leading him along . . .

00:51:19.711 --> 00:51:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At some point following the destruction
of Babylon the Great,

00:51:23.506 --> 00:51:27.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah may in some way lure the nations

00:51:27.052 --> 00:51:30.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into carrying out
what is already in their hearts.

00:51:30.722 --> 00:51:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will thus set the stage

00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:37.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the attack that leads to Armageddon.”

00:51:37.771 --> 00:51:40.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we worried about?

00:51:40.816 --> 00:51:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is happening
according to Jehovah’s purpose.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we read verses 10-12,

00:51:49.199 --> 00:51:52.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see what Gog has in mind.

00:51:52.703 --> 00:51:57.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38:10-12,

00:51:57.124 --> 00:52:01.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then leave your Bibles open,
because we’ll read one more verse.

00:52:01.503 --> 00:52:04.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 10 to 12, it says:

00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:52:07.217 --> 00:52:11.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“In that day thoughts
will come into your heart

00:52:11.722 --> 00:52:14.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“[I wonder who put them there?],

00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:17.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“and you will devise an evil plan.

00:52:17.561 --> 00:52:22.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You I will say: ‘I will invade the land
of unprotected settlements.

00:52:22.065 --> 00:52:24.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“‘I will come against
those living in security,

00:52:24.902 --> 00:52:28.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“‘without disturbance,
all of them living in settlements

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.’

00:52:31.825 --> 00:52:36.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be to take much spoil and plunder.”’”

00:52:36.246 --> 00:52:39.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will it all work out?

00:52:39.333 --> 00:52:41.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 23:

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I [that is, Jehovah, I]

00:52:44.922 --> 00:52:49.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will certainly magnify myself
and sanctify myself

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:53.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and make myself known
before the eyes of many nations

00:52:53.347 --> 00:52:58.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will have to know
that I am Jehovah.”

00:52:58.227 --> 00:53:00.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we learn?

00:53:00.271 --> 00:53:03.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is under control.

00:53:03.899 --> 00:53:05.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no need to panic.

00:53:05.943 --> 00:53:09.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is going according to schedule

00:53:09.655 --> 00:53:12.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s schedule.

00:53:12.575 --> 00:53:15.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first thing.

00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is another thing.

00:53:17.246 --> 00:53:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What precedes the attack of Gog and Magog?

00:53:20.499 --> 00:53:23.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we read in the <i>Pure Worship</i> book?

00:53:23.336 --> 00:53:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The destruction of Babylon the Great.

00:53:26.797 --> 00:53:28.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, have you ever considered

00:53:28.883 --> 00:53:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how that destruction
is going to fortify your faith

00:53:32.386 --> 00:53:34.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is going to strengthen you—

00:53:34.472 --> 00:53:38.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you’re able
to endure the attack of Gog of Magog?

00:53:38.059 --> 00:53:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it this way:

00:53:40.269 --> 00:53:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What other religious organization

00:53:43.731 --> 00:53:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foretells the destruction
of a world empire of false religion?

00:53:48.736 --> 00:53:50.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re the only ones,

00:53:50.947 --> 00:53:53.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the others
are all part of Babylon the Great.

00:53:53.199 --> 00:53:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not going to foretell
their destruction in the future.

00:53:56.786 --> 00:53:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the destruction is going to be a surprise

00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everyone but Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:54:02.625 --> 00:54:06.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when it occurs,
there’ll be no doubt in your mind

00:54:06.421 --> 00:54:10.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re on the winning side
—that you’re on Jehovah’s side.

00:54:10.216 --> 00:54:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some brothers get all upset
over some detail

00:54:14.846 --> 00:54:17.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t think the organization
has the right take on.

00:54:17.974 --> 00:54:20.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be the pronunciation of God’s name

00:54:20.894 --> 00:54:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the meaning of that name

00:54:23.104 --> 00:54:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the meaning
of a single verse in the Scriptures.

00:54:25.648 --> 00:54:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get all upset.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:29.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get obsessed over one detail,

00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:33.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it interferes with their worship.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Babylon the Great goes down,

00:54:36.409 --> 00:54:40.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will there be any doubt as to which channel

00:54:40.038 --> 00:54:43.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God has been using
all this time to do his will?

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:48.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be so glad
that you’re on the winning side.

00:54:48.672 --> 00:54:52.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it is sobering to think

00:54:52.217 --> 00:54:56.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the final attack
of Gog of Magog on God’s people.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it shouldn’t take away our joy.

00:54:59.224 --> 00:55:03.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah 8:10, it says:

00:55:03.311 --> 00:55:07.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:55:07.858 --> 00:55:12.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is actually a protection for us.

00:55:12.237 --> 00:55:15.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Nehemiah need a stronghold?

00:55:15.657 --> 00:55:17.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the answer to that.

00:55:17.826 --> 00:55:20.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His life was being threatened.

00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:24.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pagan inhabitants of the land
wanted to kill him,

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there were problems
in the congregation.

00:55:27.669 --> 00:55:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the elders weren’t respecting
Jehovah’s law on marriage,

00:55:31.381 --> 00:55:33.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Sabbath wasn’t being observed.

00:55:33.634 --> 00:55:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was one of the reasons

00:55:35.636 --> 00:55:38.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why the Jews went into captivity
in the first place.

00:55:38.097 --> 00:55:39.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were problems.

00:55:39.807 --> 00:55:44.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Nehemiah didn’t allow
those problems to rob him of his joy.

00:55:44.812 --> 00:55:47.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can be joyful

00:55:47.523 --> 00:55:50.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we’re under a lot of pressure.

00:55:50.442 --> 00:55:55.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our joy doesn’t depend on our circumstances.

00:55:55.447 --> 00:56:00.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy helped Jesus to endure a torture stake.

00:56:00.327 --> 00:56:04.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy motivated the apostles to keep preaching

00:56:04.081 --> 00:56:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even after they’d been beaten.

00:56:06.542 --> 00:56:09.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “joy of Jehovah” can help you

00:56:09.295 --> 00:56:12.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep preaching in spite of indifference,

00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:15.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution, or any other obstacle.

00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe you feel:
‘Well, that’s what I need.

00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:22.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need more joy.’

00:56:22.475 --> 00:56:26.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, joy is an aspect
of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:56:26.145 --> 00:56:28.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you need more joy,
what do you do?

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:32.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you get more of Jehovah’s spirit?

00:56:32.193 --> 00:56:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You ask for it: “Father, give me more joy.

00:56:36.739 --> 00:56:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to be joyful in my service.

00:56:39.367 --> 00:56:41.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to rejoice in you.”

00:56:44.122 --> 00:56:48.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning of this talk,
we read Psalm 37:4,

00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:53.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we focused particularly
on the first part of the verse,

00:56:53.715 --> 00:56:57.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rejoicing in Jehovah.

00:56:57.218 --> 00:56:59.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to the second part
of the verse now,

00:56:59.887 --> 00:57:02.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:4,

00:57:02.849 --> 00:57:07.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on that part for just a moment.

00:57:07.854 --> 00:57:11.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Psalm 37:4, the first part says:

00:57:11.316 --> 00:57:14.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:57:14.485 --> 00:57:18.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then] and he will grant you

00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:22.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the desires of your heart.”

00:57:22.494 --> 00:57:25.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does your heart desire?

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:29.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you
looking forward to in the new world?

00:57:29.709 --> 00:57:32.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it owning your own home?

00:57:32.671 --> 00:57:36.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some countries,
it may be just having enough food to eat.

00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:40.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you looking forward to doing work
that you really enjoy?

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or learning how to do something really well?

00:57:43.598 --> 00:57:45.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re older now,

00:57:45.934 --> 00:57:49.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re looking forward
to waking up every morning without pain

00:57:49.896 --> 00:57:53.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and without wondering,
‘I wonder what this pain means;

00:57:53.942 --> 00:57:56.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder if I have something serious’

00:57:56.528 --> 00:58:01.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never, ever having to think
about death again.

00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:04.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you looking forward
to conducting a Bible study

00:58:04.703 --> 00:58:07.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an unbelieving relative who returns

00:58:07.414 --> 00:58:11.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe with some historical figure?

00:58:11.418 --> 00:58:15.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This weekend we learned
that even faithful men of old

00:58:15.297 --> 00:58:18.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to have to adapt
to a different way of life

00:58:18.216 --> 00:58:20.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn how to worship Jehovah in a way

00:58:20.928 --> 00:58:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be acceptable to him then.

00:58:25.015 --> 00:58:27.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, Abraham,

00:58:27.518 --> 00:58:32.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that child does not need to be circumcised.”

00:58:32.356 --> 00:58:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“David, you’re not a king anymore.

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:41.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want a glass of water,
you’ll have to get up and get it yourself.”

00:58:41.115 --> 00:58:46.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Samuel, I know you’re grateful
to be resurrected,

00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:49.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we don’t
offer animal sacrifices anymore.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So please, put that knife down

00:58:52.501 --> 00:58:55.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leave that bull alone.”

00:58:55.921 --> 00:59:00.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are going to be adjustments
that have to be made.

00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:02.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about living conditions?

00:59:02.595 --> 00:59:05.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would you prefer
to live in the new world?

00:59:05.389 --> 00:59:07.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you love the country,

00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:10.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you’re assigned
to live in the country, you’d be very happy.

00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:14.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But suppose you love the country,
but you’re assigned to live in a city?

00:59:14.315 --> 00:59:16.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can learn to love the city.

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:19.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can help you to become

00:59:19.361 --> 00:59:22.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever you need to become.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you’re given to do
in the new world is going to be a blessing.

00:59:26.702 --> 00:59:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives ‘good gifts

00:59:29.705 --> 00:59:32.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perfect presents’ to his servants.

00:59:32.959 --> 00:59:35.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jehovah is going to make arrangements

00:59:35.836 --> 00:59:39.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are going to be
for the ultimate good of all mankind.

00:59:39.924 --> 00:59:41.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know
what arrangements will be made

00:59:41.926 --> 00:59:44.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to clean up the earth
just after the great tribulation,

00:59:44.804 --> 00:59:47.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we do know there’ll be work to do.

00:59:47.098 --> 00:59:52.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may have the privilege
of sharing in that.

00:59:52.103 --> 00:59:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think how you’ll feel

00:59:54.731 --> 00:59:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you begin to move closer to perfection

00:59:58.067 --> 01:00:00.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in mind and in body.

01:00:00.695 --> 01:00:05.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, David’s words
recorded at Psalm 139:14

01:00:05.491 --> 01:00:07.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to take on greater meaning.

01:00:07.493 --> 01:00:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the last verse
we’re going to read during this convention.

01:00:10.246 --> 01:00:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to follow along

01:00:12.248 --> 01:00:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 139,

01:00:15.418 --> 01:00:18.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 14.

01:00:18.671 --> 01:00:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this is imperfect David writing.

01:00:23.551 --> 01:00:26.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 139:14:

01:00:26.262 --> 01:00:31.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way

01:00:31.267 --> 01:00:33.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am wonderfully made.

01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your works are wonderful,

01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know this very well.”

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:42.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was impressed

01:00:42.529 --> 01:00:45.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the way his imperfect body functioned.

01:00:45.907 --> 01:00:48.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how he’ll feel
when he’s perfect?

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:52.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll probably write another song.

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:57.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we
sum up this heart-stirring convention?

01:00:57.794 --> 01:01:01.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way I can think of is for you

01:01:01.256 --> 01:01:04.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy one final video

01:01:04.217 --> 01:01:08.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlighting the reasons
for joy now and for the future.

01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:10.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, enjoy the video,

01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:14.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but pay attention to the music
because we’re going to be singing

01:01:14.102 --> 01:01:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that original song
at the end of this program.

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:19.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want everyone to sing.

01:01:19.232 --> 01:01:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone must sing

01:01:21.985 --> 01:01:25.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no just moving the lips, no faking.

01:01:25.739 --> 01:01:29.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing, but enjoy the video as well.

01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars that fill the summer night
Look down from above.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:57.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beauty of the day and night
You fashioned with love.

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:04.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your hands prepared the land and sea,
And ev’rything that came to be

01:02:04.695 --> 01:02:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brought joy to your heart.

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:18.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:08.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, we have all we need
To bring us delight—

01:03:08.593 --> 01:03:15.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things we hear and touch and see
And feel deep inside.

01:03:15.016 --> 01:03:22.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You gave us such a perfect start,
Eternity in ev’ry heart,

01:03:22.148 --> 01:03:26.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And joy in our lives.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:42.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:03:42.627 --> 01:03:49.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:03:49.801 --> 01:04:01.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:04:11.823 --> 01:04:18.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This joy could not be ours
Without the gift of your Son.

01:04:18.413 --> 01:04:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His sacrifice has paid the price
So joy could be ours for all time.

01:04:29.049 --> 01:04:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:49.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:04:49.486 --> 01:05:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is joy in your creation,
In the message of salvation,

01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Paradise to come.

01:05:16.388 --> 01:05:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have your love forever
Is a real and lasting treasure.

01:05:23.479 --> 01:05:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You alone will prove to be
Our joy eternally.

01:05:43.332 --> 01:05:47.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that touching video,
what more is there to say?

01:05:47.795 --> 01:05:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find your greatest joy” in Jehovah.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rejoice!

01:05:53.342 --> 01:05:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our deliverance is near.

01:05:56.888 --> 01:05:58.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:02.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your talk and this entire convention

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have given us sound Scriptural reasons
to “always rejoice.”

01:06:08.524 --> 01:06:11.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All in attendance will be pleased to know

01:06:11.027 --> 01:06:14.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

01:06:25.792 --> 01:06:28.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re certainly grateful to Jehovah God

and to Jesus Christ,
the head of the Christian congregation,

who have made this convention possible.

And on behalf of the Governing Body

01:06:38.721 --> 01:06:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the hardworking members
of our Bethel families around the world,

we wish to extend
our gratitude to each of you

of the 2020 regional convention program.

01:06:53.278 --> 01:06:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much,

and we look forward to the time

01:06:57.574 --> 01:07:00.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we can be together again in person

01:07:00.493 --> 01:07:03.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encourage one another face-to-face.

01:07:04.372 --> 01:07:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

this is JW Broadcasting®.

01:07:11.046 --> 01:07:13.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us conclude now by expressing our joy

01:07:13.798 --> 01:07:17.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our close friendship with Jehovah God.

01:07:17.177 --> 01:07:20.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please stand,
and let’s sing together the original song

01:07:20.972 --> 01:07:23.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our Joy Eternally,”

01:07:23.016 --> 01:07:26.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we heard sung
during the last video of the concluding talk.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song,

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may have your concluding prayer
at your individual locations.

01:07:32.192 --> 01:07:34.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we invite all to stand

01:07:34.569 --> 01:07:37.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sing out along with the Watchtower chorus

01:07:37.614 --> 01:07:39.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our Joy Eternally.”

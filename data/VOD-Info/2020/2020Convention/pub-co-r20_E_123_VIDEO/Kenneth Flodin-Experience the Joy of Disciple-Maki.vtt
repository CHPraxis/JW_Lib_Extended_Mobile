00:00:02.273 --> 00:00:06.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, if you will, to imagine a virus

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that becomes a global pandemic.

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:12.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The daily news is ominous.

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:15.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear and panic hold full sway.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not
too difficult to imagine, is it?

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:23.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if they found a cure?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now instantly
the newscaster’s tone would change;

00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:28.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be enthusiastic.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why is that?

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he has good news
to share to the world’s population.

00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:36.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about us?

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:41.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Isaiah 52:7

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:43.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 52:7.

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should we be enthusiastic
when we teach those

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:52.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been exposed
to the evil viruses of Satan’s old world?

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because we have the best news ever

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:58.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with the world’s population.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:03.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how this
is brought out at Isaiah 52:7.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “How beautiful on the mountains

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are the feet of the one bringing good news,

00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one proclaiming peace,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one bringing good news
of something better,

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:18.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one proclaiming salvation,

00:01:18.854 --> 00:01:23.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one saying to Zion:
‘Your God has become King!’”

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:26.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have good news that’s better

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than conquering one perturbing virus.

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:33.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the videos of this symposium,

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:38.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you probably noticed
that initially Neeta was enthused

00:01:38.124 --> 00:01:42.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a regular Bible study
had been established with Jade.

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s our continued enthusiasm

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help keep a student interested

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:51.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivate them to act.

00:01:51.722 --> 00:01:54.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:58.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will note that Neeta
learns the importance

00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:00.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of maintaining enthusiasm.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:23.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta, your phone buzzed.

00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jade again.

00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:33.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve only studied once this month.

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:35.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so unscheduled.

00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought you said she was doing well?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was.

00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:42.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s just, “See you later.”

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was your last study?

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very interesting question,

00:02:49.408 --> 00:02:53.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s not really what we are talking
about in this paragraph, is it?

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:57.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just read the scripture, shall we?

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never even attempts
to explain why she cancels.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:15.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, I do.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if she’s still open to studying,

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:23.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can’t let these little things
drain your enthusiasm.

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:26.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:30.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just— I wish she was more structured.

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like she doesn’t take
anything seriously.

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:35.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No study is perfect.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:38.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making some effort; focus on that.

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:42.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone’s enthusiasm
is contagious, it’s yours.

00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:57.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I haven’t mentioned it already,

00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love our chats,

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I appreciate all your questions.

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:04.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:06.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know sometimes they’re crazy.

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:09.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you’re a deep thinker.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good for both of us.

00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:19.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, um, yeah.

00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:20.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, cool.

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when Neeta first met Jade?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jade said, “Like I’m jaded.”

00:04:38.524 --> 00:04:40.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English word “jaded”

00:04:40.943 --> 00:04:44.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “made dull, apathetic, or cynical.”

00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:49.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we just noticed
that Neeta was annoyed with Jade.

00:04:49.744 --> 00:04:53.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She became dull, apathetic, unenthusiastic

00:04:53.498 --> 00:04:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of Jade’s attitude.

00:04:55.918 --> 00:04:59.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that affected Neeta’s enthusiasm,

00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it had a circular effect,

00:05:01.632 --> 00:05:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely contributing
to Jade’s seeming lack of interest.

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:09.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we develop enthusiasm?

00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You likely noticed that Neeta and Jade

00:05:16.272 --> 00:05:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak the same language (well,  almost),

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:21.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re
two totally different personalities.

00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:26.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be teaching someone
of a totally different cultural background,

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the good news is
that enthusiasm crosses all boundaries.

00:05:31.455 --> 00:05:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me Romans 12:11

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans chapter 12.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:42.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s good to remember
that enthusiasm is not just some giddy,

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outward show of excitement;

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:47.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it actually happens from within us.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:11:

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be industrious, not lazy.

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be aglow with the spirit.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slave for Jehovah.”

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to highlight that matter
of being “aglow with the spirit.”

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:07.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word translated “aglow”
literally means “boiling.”

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:10.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to maintain enthusiasm,

00:06:10.997 --> 00:06:14.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need a constant flow of God’s holy spirit.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:19.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like the heat source
that keeps us boiling.

00:06:19.047 --> 00:06:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we prepare
to teach a Bible student?

00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:23.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we might think,

00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:27.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, I like to go over
the lesson in advance,

00:06:27.973 --> 00:06:31.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I remind myself
of what the cited scriptures say.’

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s good.
That’s necessary.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that all is just happening in our head.

00:06:37.358 --> 00:06:41.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we get the water boiling inside?

00:06:41.071 --> 00:06:45.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember
the suggestion at Ezra 7:10?

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra there said
that he ‘prepared his heart to teach.’

00:06:50.873 --> 00:06:55.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with that thought in mind,
please find Psalm 45:1.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to click the download button.

00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:01.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to download
from our head to our heart.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the heart is involved here.

00:07:03.511 --> 00:07:07.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 45:1 says:
“My heart

00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[it does not say my head;
my heart] is stirred by something good.

00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:16.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say: ‘My song is about a king.’

00:07:16.358 --> 00:07:21.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May my tongue be
the stylus of a skilled copyist.”

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:24.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “My heart is stirred.”

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:27.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, interestingly,
the word translated “stirred”

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also means “to boil or bubble up.”

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s the result if we get
that action going inside of us?

00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The end of the verse said that ‘my tongue

00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:42.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[in other words, my speech] will be skilled.’

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:45.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we improve
our skills as a disciple-maker

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:48.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we maintain enthusiasm.

00:07:48.726 --> 00:07:52.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we get our enthusiasm bubbling, boiling,

00:07:52.772 --> 00:07:56.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stirred up when we meditate on the importance

00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the lesson we’re about to teach.

00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:03.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife likes to watch
cooking shows on television,

00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:08.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve noticed that invariably
there’s always an electric blender.

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I do realize
that in some of your cultures,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might prefer mortar and pestle

00:08:14.545 --> 00:08:17.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a sharp knife
to cut things up and mix them together.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have all those ingredients
laid out on the counter before us

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe vegetables, herbs,
spices, always salt and pepper.

00:08:25.223 --> 00:08:27.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that like?

00:08:27.684 --> 00:08:30.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s like having
the ingredients in our mind.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve gone over the lesson in advance.
We have the Scriptures.

00:08:34.566 --> 00:08:38.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what they say,
but we really don’t get enthused

00:08:38.112 --> 00:08:41.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about that tasty dish until what happens?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mix all those ingredients in the blender.

00:08:45.244 --> 00:08:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We bring it up to a temperature,
maybe even to a boil.

00:08:47.997 --> 00:08:52.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after the dish
is done and we taste it,

00:08:52.043 --> 00:08:54.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mm, mm, mm.

00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:56.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tastes so good.
We get enthusiastic.

00:08:56.756 --> 00:08:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tell others about this great recipe.

00:08:58.967 --> 00:09:01.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they’re interested,

00:09:01.011 --> 00:09:04.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to taste
this culinary sensation as well.

So how do we become enthusiastic?

00:09:07.768 --> 00:09:11.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate—meditation is the blender.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:14.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take all the ingredients in our mind;

00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we mix them together into a message

00:09:16.402 --> 00:09:20.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re now enthused to share with others.

00:09:20.073 --> 00:09:23.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And meditation includes
asking ourselves questions

00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:25.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare the heart.

00:09:25.453 --> 00:09:27.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
before your study, you might ask,

00:09:27.956 --> 00:09:32.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How has this information
benefited me personally?’

00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:35.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Neeta needed to ask herself,

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:37.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why does Jade need to hear this?’

00:09:37.883 --> 00:09:41.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s the perfect point
at the right time for our student,

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:44.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we should ask,
‘How will what I’m going to study

00:09:44.932 --> 00:09:47.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefit my student?’

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:51.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation stirs the heart.

Please find with me
1 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:00.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enthusiasm, or zeal, should not be confused

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:03.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with being overly emotional.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be like throwing
too much hot pepper

00:10:05.746 --> 00:10:08.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the blender—overemotional.

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our heartfelt conviction
should not cross the line

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become dogmatic
as to what our student must believe.

00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you get the sense
of this recipe at 1 Thessalonians 1:5.

00:10:24.266 --> 00:10:26.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Because the good news we preach

00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:29.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not come to you with speech alone.”

00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:32.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words it’s not just words
out of the head, but notice the ingredients.

00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Also with power
and with holy spirit

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:39.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with strong conviction.”

00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’ve meditated on the material
and we deliver it from the heart,

00:10:43.953 --> 00:10:47.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s reflected in our gestures
and our facial expressions.

00:10:47.874 --> 00:10:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We come across as natural and sincere,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:55.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, you see, animated
with proper enthusiasm.

00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:58.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re enthusiastic about Bible truths,

00:10:58.469 --> 00:11:02.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is contagious, but in a very good way.

00:11:02.848 --> 00:11:07.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Bible student
will not become jaded, dull, apathetic.

00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:11.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, your student will be enthusiastic

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:14.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you—his teacher.

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, we have the privilege
of having Brother Seth Hyatt

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(he’s a helper to the Service Committee)

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:23.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present the next part of our symposium:

00:11:23.996 --> 00:11:26.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making—

00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:30.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Improve Your Skills—Showing Empathy.”

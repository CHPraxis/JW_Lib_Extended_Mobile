What do you look forward to?

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look forward to perfection.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look forward to eternal life

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a beautiful paradise earth.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, with all of this
wonderful future before us,

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about in the meantime?

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suffer from crime.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suffer from natural disasters,

00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:36.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this pandemic we suffer from,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:41.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sickness, poverty, war,
and other calamities.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, as the Scriptures
mention in Romans:

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:48.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All creation
keeps on groaning together.”

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up,

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:54.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is something
we want you to reflect on.

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a thought-provoking question:

00:00:56.953 --> 00:01:01.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should the rest of our days
in this wicked system of things

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be defined by grief?

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:07.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:10.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want
the remainder of our time

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:18.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be controlled
by all the problems and the grief

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mankind is suffering.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us,
even during these times,

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:29.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy our lives while we wait

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fulfillment

00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:35.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his prophecies
and his promises to us

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(now, we’re going to establish
that for you Scripturally),

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though hardship befalls us

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation
and during the great tribulation.

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this Scriptural counsel found

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible book of Habakkuk.

00:01:53.928 --> 00:01:57.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk chapter 3,

00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:00.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read

00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:04.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 17 and 18:

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:09.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although the fig tree may not blossom,

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:12.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there may be no fruit on the vines;

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:15.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although the olive crop may fail,

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the fields may produce no food;

00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although the flock
may disappear from the pen,

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:25.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there may be no cattle in the stalls;

00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:31.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[dire circumstances
—don’t you agree?—but notice verse 18]

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yet, as for me,

00:02:35.304 --> 00:02:38.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will exalt in Jehovah;

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be joyful
in the God of my salvation.”

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:47.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even during these dire circumstances,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was able to say

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:54.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(with all of this going on):
“As for me, I <i>will</i> exalt in Jehovah.”

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And not, “I hope I can,”

00:02:57.034 --> 00:03:00.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “I <i>will</i> exult in Jehovah;

00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:05.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I <i>will</i> be joyful
in the God of my salvation.”

00:03:05.626 --> 00:03:09.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s, really, his close friendship

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God that enables him

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to still have joy.

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:17.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the theme of this talk,

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:22.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close Friendship With Jehovah
Brings the Greatest Joy!”

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we’re waiting patiently,

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:29.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:32.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world can’t understand that reasoning,

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:36.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s what Jehovah wants for his people

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:41.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just a wonderful promise for us to focus on.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the psalmist helps us to appreciate

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:47.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this isn’t just some dream

00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have a close friendship

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:53.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Sovereign of the universe,
the Almighty God.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:57.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, notice here in Psalm 25.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll read that together,

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 25,

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is a Scriptural assurance.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 14:

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah
belongs to those who fear him,

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:19.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he makes his covenant
 known to them.”

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah”

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:27.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s possible.

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a reality.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us.

00:04:30.838 --> 00:04:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not just dreaming when we speak
about having this close friendship

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God.

00:04:37.887 --> 00:04:41.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful,
wonderful reality that we enjoy.

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:43.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it brings such joy

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:47.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have this closeness with Jehovah God.

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what helps with this

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:54.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(being able to make sure
we have this close friendship)

00:04:54.654 --> 00:04:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes down to acquiring

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “mental disposition” of Jesus.

00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:04.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has ever been closer
to Jehovah than Jesus

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:08.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—prehuman existence,
during his earthly ministry,

00:05:08.335 --> 00:05:12.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and upon his resurrection
—so close to Jehovah.

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:15.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for us to really capture
how we can have

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:19.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a close friendship with Jehovah,
we need to learn to think

00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:24.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel like Jesus did and still does.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we imitate his example,

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it increases our joy.

00:05:30.774 --> 00:05:35.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this talk, we’re going to discuss

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two aspects of Jesus’ mental disposition.

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:42.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first aspect

00:05:42.536 --> 00:05:45.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how Jesus
showed unselfish love

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that drew him close to his Father.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He found absolute joy
in showing neighborly love

00:05:51.712 --> 00:05:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing good to others.

00:05:54.423 --> 00:05:57.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this artwork here, please.

00:05:59.845 --> 00:06:04.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave from his heart unselfishly.

00:06:09.313 --> 00:06:14.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Jesus’ feelings
when he met someone who needed help.

00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:02.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Jesus and the joy of helping others.

00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just very evident.

00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:07.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the closeness with his Father
—they could see it.

00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:09.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disciples rejoiced.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:14.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a perfect example
of being close to Jehovah!

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result?
Joy.

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:21.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we want to keep in mind.

00:07:21.053 --> 00:07:24.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus set that example for us.

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:31.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being generous, Jesus taught us

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to practice what he did,
practice what he preached and taught.

00:07:36.235 --> 00:07:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice here in Luke chapter 6,

00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:42.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we learn because he lived this.

00:07:42.784 --> 00:07:47.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had such freeness of speech
to make these things

00:07:49.332 --> 00:07:52.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clear to those who listened to him.

00:07:52.252 --> 00:07:54.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke chapter 6

00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:57.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and talk about being generous!

00:07:57.757 --> 00:07:59.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus obviously was.

00:07:59.551 --> 00:08:04.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verse 38 of Luke chapter 6:

00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:09.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Practice giving,
and people will give to you.

00:08:09.186 --> 00:08:13.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will pour into your laps
a fine measure, pressed down,

00:08:13.774 --> 00:08:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“shaken together, and overflowing.

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For with the measure
that you are measuring out,

00:08:19.988 --> 00:08:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will measure out to you in return.”

00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:28.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, a beautiful lesson here:

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:30.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be generous.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:33.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was so generous with his time

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the things he did with his disciples.

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the lesson being:

00:08:39.008 --> 00:08:42.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The measure you show
in the way of being generous

00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:44.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it comes in return.

00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:47.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sometimes people in the world

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they have stated things.

00:08:50.936 --> 00:08:55.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I heard these things when I
first became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses:

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:58.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You people—you don’t celebrate holidays.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re stingy.”

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could be further from the truth.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:07.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t celebrate holidays
that offend our God,

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one we love and worship.

00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:13.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just because we
don’t celebrate these holidays

00:09:13.918 --> 00:09:17.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there’s gift-giving
doesn’t mean we’re not generous.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to give gifts.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:23.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy giving

00:09:23.053 --> 00:09:26.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s what Jehovah
wants us to do.

00:09:26.306 --> 00:09:30.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look for opportunities to be generous.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:35.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep your Bibles here at Luke chapter 6.

00:09:35.315 --> 00:09:38.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient with each other.

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are some things
we’re going to discuss here.

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:46.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to apply the counsel,
and we’re passing this on for your benefit

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:50.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(some things to think about),
and if you see an area where you’d need

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make improvement,
well, by all means, do so.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll keep you close to Jehovah,
and you’ll have abundant,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great joy as a result
of applying his counsel.

00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:07.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 37
(right before verse 38)

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice: “Moreover,

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:16.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stop judging, and you
will by no means be judged;

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:20.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and stop condemning,
and you will by no means be condemned.

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:25.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep on forgiving,
and you will be forgiven.”

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:30.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very priceless counsel
on the need to be forgiving

00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah and Jesus certainly are.

00:10:32.582 --> 00:10:35.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also (you’ll notice in verse 37)

00:10:35.752 --> 00:10:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stated: “Stop judging.”

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:42.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just stop it!

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t say: “Don’t judge.”

00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:47.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Stop judging.”

00:10:47.097 --> 00:10:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:10:48.765 --> 00:10:53.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that’s imperfect human inclination

00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:56.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to judge, to judge others.

00:10:56.398 --> 00:10:59.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes even in the congregation,

00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:02.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some can become overly critical.

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:07.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can become resentful, envious.

00:11:07.034 --> 00:11:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And envy is so destructive.

00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:13.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody might have materialistic prosperity;

00:11:13.874 --> 00:11:18.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they might enjoy privileges
that you don’t have in the congregation;

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:21.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others might find them very endearing,

00:11:21.673 --> 00:11:24.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so envy can creep in.

00:11:24.802 --> 00:11:28.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, frankly, it’s unhealthy physically

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritually.

00:11:30.933 --> 00:11:34.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what I
mean by that with this proverb.

00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Proverbs, if you would, please.

00:11:37.773 --> 00:11:41.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the inspired counsel

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very, very clear.

00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 14 and the 30th verse:

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:52.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A calm heart gives life
to the body, [now notice]

00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:55.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but jealousy
[or envy, these other things]

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is rottenness to the bones.”

00:11:58.628 --> 00:12:02.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If your bones are rotten
and the bone is so important

00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(all the bones in our body)
toward good physical health,

00:12:06.302 --> 00:12:08.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the same thing spiritually.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re jealous,

00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s rottenness to us
in a spiritual way as well.

00:12:16.312 --> 00:12:19.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing is that Jehovah doesn’t feel

00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:24.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be wanting
this close friendship with somebody

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:27.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has this issue and doesn’t work on it,

00:12:27.616 --> 00:12:30.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t work to correct it.

00:12:30.327 --> 00:12:35.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we work on thinking
about some of these things,

00:12:35.248 --> 00:12:38.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can actually personally increase

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:40.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy in our congregation.

00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:44.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that takes us
to another Scriptural thought

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to address here in this talk

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about having a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:12:50.014 --> 00:12:53.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice 1 Peter chapter 4,

00:12:53.851 --> 00:12:57.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll remember this verse
(most of you listening),

00:12:57.938 --> 00:13:00.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter chapter 4,

00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:03.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 15,

00:13:04.904 --> 00:13:07.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter 4:15:

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, let none of you
suffer as a murderer

00:13:11.827 --> 00:13:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or a thief or a wrongdoer
[now notice]

00:13:15.665 --> 00:13:20.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a busybody
in other people’s matters.”

00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:23.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously,
murder and being a thief

00:13:23.923 --> 00:13:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these are terrible sins
against Jehovah God.

00:13:27.343 --> 00:13:31.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right after that,
he mentions “a busybody.”

00:13:31.723 --> 00:13:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, literally in the original language

00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:39.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and this has always helped me
with this inspired thought),

00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:43.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a busybody” is literally “overseer

00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:46.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is another’s.”

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:48.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that tell you?

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if it’s
not your responsibility to oversee

00:13:53.495 --> 00:13:55.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this particular issue,

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:59.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you can keep in mind the need

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:03.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mind your own business.

00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:07.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are against busybodies.

00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:10.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They disturb the peace of congregations;

00:14:10.888 --> 00:14:15.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they interfere with the congregations
enjoying the joy.

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we refrain from imposing

00:14:18.187 --> 00:14:21.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our uninspired opinions on others

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:26.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or debating about matters of personal choice.

00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:29.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have some concerns?
Talk to Jehovah God about it.

00:14:29.448 --> 00:14:34.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if it’s a personal concern,
don’t be a busybody.

00:14:34.453 --> 00:14:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are very clear.

00:14:36.706 --> 00:14:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay away from that
—developing this negative spirit

00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:45.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could disrupt the peace
of the congregation.

00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:48.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:53.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our sister
worked at becoming more positive

00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:58.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that by doing so,
she increased her joy.

00:15:00.063 --> 00:15:04.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had a lifelong struggle
with a negative attitude.

00:15:04.484 --> 00:15:07.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

00:15:07.237 --> 00:15:09.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient,

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:12.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sarcastic, and demanding person.

00:15:12.117 --> 00:15:16.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, out in field service,
I had insulted a partner of mine,

00:15:16.872 --> 00:15:20.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the entire day was ruined.

00:15:20.041 --> 00:15:23.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother was in the car.

00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:26.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very upset with the situation.

00:15:26.298 --> 00:15:29.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She told me that I had a negative attitude

00:15:29.551 --> 00:15:33.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was not allowed inside the house
until that sister forgave me.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:37.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked the sister to lunch.

00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:42.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one of the most difficult
and uncomfortable situations I have been in.

00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to make a self-examination.

00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:50.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was I negative?
Why was I so unhappy?

00:15:50.948 --> 00:15:52.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because I stopped pioneering

00:15:52.992 --> 00:15:56.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my friends continued
in their full-time service to Jehovah.

00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:59.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that made me very frustrated,

00:15:59.081 --> 00:16:02.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them continue this while I was stuck.

00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:05.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I acknowledged
that I had this negative attitude,

00:16:05.671 --> 00:16:09.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prompted me to beg Jehovah
to help me to make changes.

00:16:09.884 --> 00:16:14.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends in the congregation who I spent
a lot of time with were not bad people.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their imperfection
fueled my negative attitude,

00:16:19.227 --> 00:16:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really had to put that fire out.

00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personal study was a major help,
along with my prayers to Jehovah,

00:16:27.277 --> 00:16:29.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make these changes.

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:34.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that I meditated on
was how Jesus acted with his disciples.

00:16:34.325 --> 00:16:37.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was hungry and he was tired,

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still very loving and kind.

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I saw for myself
that when I was spiritually hungry,

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affected my words and my actions
toward the brothers and sisters.

00:16:47.422 --> 00:16:52.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The keys to maintaining
Jesus’ mental disposition are prayer,

00:16:52.302 --> 00:16:54.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gratitude, and contentment.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My goal is to show

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a grateful attitude
for the blessings that I receive

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:02.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day and also to look

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:05.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the good in people
—to show them that I care and I love them.

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve learned that the more that I
give to the friends

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:12.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to my family,
the happier that makes Jehovah,

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Acts 20:35
and Hebrews 13:16 mention.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:19.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jehovah is happy,
that really makes me happy.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:26.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very thought-provoking video,
don’t you agree?

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:30.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice
what lessons she learned

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we all benefit from it):
prayer,

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:36.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gratitude, contentment

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful that she could see that.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:44.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you have prayer
coupled with gratitude,

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:49.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you show and display contentment,
you stay close to Jehovah.

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:52.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that brings great joy

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:55.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we applied the counsel.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:18:00.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second point
that we’re going to discuss in this talk is:

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using practical wisdom

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:06.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
increases our joy.

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:10.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we made it clear that we want
to show unselfish love as Jesus did.

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re talking about practical wisdom

00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:16.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that increases our joy.

00:18:16.304 --> 00:18:19.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew
how important this counsel was.

00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He taught his disciples
that when it comes to treasures,

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘store up treasures in heaven,

00:18:26.607 --> 00:18:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because where your treasure is,
that’s where your heart is going to be.’

00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he made that very clear,
trying to help them to appreciate

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living a practical, simple life.

00:18:36.992 --> 00:18:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice here in this artwork how Jesus

00:18:40.996 --> 00:18:44.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is showing his disciples this
and how much joy they have

00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:48.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying that counsel
about keeping it simple.

00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:56.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that storing up
“treasures in heaven” brings joy.

00:18:58.806 --> 00:19:01.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy Jesus found

00:19:01.434 --> 00:19:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sharing life’s simple pleasures 
with others.

00:19:49.942 --> 00:19:53.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they enjoyed their surroundings.

00:19:53.153 --> 00:19:55.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are rejoicing.

00:19:55.155 --> 00:19:59.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is comparing
(who has a certain amount of gold).

00:19:59.827 --> 00:20:02.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, this is just enjoying life

00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:06.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their close relationship
with Jehovah God.

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:10.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by keeping our life simple,

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:15.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we trust that Jehovah
will provide for our needs.

00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:18.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something I’ve said for years:

00:20:18.471 --> 00:20:23.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, Jehovah provides
for our needs, not our greeds.”

00:20:23.517 --> 00:20:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’re content
with the needs Jehovah provides for us,

00:20:28.564 --> 00:20:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience great joy.

00:20:34.445 --> 00:20:37.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to avoid distractions
that could take us away

00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:41.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wholeheartedly serving
our heavenly Father

00:20:41.828 --> 00:20:45.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or could even start to distance us from him.

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:50.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is filled with practical wisdom
about physical health,

00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:52.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finances, family life.

00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:54.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when this counsel is applied,

00:20:54.507 --> 00:20:57.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can in many cases prevent problems

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at least minimize them,

00:20:59.804 --> 00:21:03.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in these difficult last days.

00:21:03.725 --> 00:21:06.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Scriptures are very clear

00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:10.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we really peer
into Jehovah’s Word

00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:14.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and it’s been referred to
in the Bible book of James as “a mirror”),

00:21:14.194 --> 00:21:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s the benefit.

00:21:15.904 --> 00:21:20.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you will remember this
in James chapter 1.

00:21:20.075 --> 00:21:25.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how much we appreciate the wisdom

00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:28.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is found here at James chapter 1,

00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:32.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 25!

00:21:32.838 --> 00:21:37.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:25: “But the one
who peers into the perfect law

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:41.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that belongs to freedom
and continues in it

00:21:41.347 --> 00:21:45.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has become, not a forgetful hearer,

00:21:45.226 --> 00:21:50.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a doer of the work;
and he will be happy in what he does.”

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:55.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we take the time
to look into Jehovah’s Word

00:21:55.027 --> 00:21:57.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“peer” in—
it’s not just a glance.

00:21:57.822 --> 00:22:02.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re peering “into the perfect law,”
but then we ‘continue in it.’

00:22:02.744 --> 00:22:06.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t read it and say,
“Oh, that was interesting”

00:22:06.205 --> 00:22:09.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then go off and forget it.

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:13.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, a ‘doer of the word’

00:22:13.213 --> 00:22:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that means there’s application
of what we just read.

00:22:16.925 --> 00:22:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result?

00:22:18.968 --> 00:22:22.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We “will be happy”—guaranteed!

00:22:22.889 --> 00:22:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jehovah promises.

00:22:24.975 --> 00:22:30.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it has to be applied
to have this benefit.

00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:33.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s a beautiful proverb.

00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:36.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is personal for all of us too.

00:22:36.737 --> 00:22:39.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to apply it,
just like all of you listening.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:44.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do likewise
—Proverbs chapter 15.

00:22:45.662 --> 00:22:49.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this can happen
especially in these critical last days

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are coming and continuing
to get worse and worse.

00:22:52.795 --> 00:22:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ve always loved this proverb,
and it’s helped me for decades,

00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:02.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I think many of you
would agree that it’s helped you.

00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:04.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if not, then benefit

00:23:04.723 --> 00:23:08.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wisdom here at Proverbs 15,

00:23:08.018 --> 00:23:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 15:

00:23:10.938 --> 00:23:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the days of the afflicted one are bad,

00:23:15.067 --> 00:23:18.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the one with a cheerful heart

00:23:18.613 --> 00:23:21.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a continual feast.”

00:23:21.449 --> 00:23:24.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we need to let that sink in.

00:23:24.702 --> 00:23:29.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the days”—so this means
day after day with this negative attitude

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:34.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(“poor me, poor me,
one affliction after the other”)

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:37.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the sister
in the video we saw earlier,

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just absorbed with negative things.

00:23:41.344 --> 00:23:43.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then it’s contrasted

00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with having “a cheerful heart,”

00:23:47.016 --> 00:23:49.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s like having a feast.

00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:51.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So mentally and emotionally,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to benefit
from not needlessly focusing

00:23:56.484 --> 00:24:00.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the afflictions
and the things that we deal with.

00:24:00.655 --> 00:24:04.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That connects with what we
earlier talked about: prayer, gratitude,

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contentment.

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:11.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, agonizing over problems
that are beyond our control

00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:16.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not please God.

00:24:17.256 --> 00:24:20.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do the best we can
with our circumstances.

00:24:20.843 --> 00:24:25.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to be daily afflicted
and agonizing over these things

00:24:25.347 --> 00:24:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we really have no control over

00:24:29.018 --> 00:24:32.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we do the best we can
to resolve our problems.

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:36.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to focus on the more productive things.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What <i>can</i> we do?
What are the positive things?

00:24:39.028 --> 00:24:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this isn’t just
some psychological endeavor.

00:24:42.698 --> 00:24:45.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Scriptural direction

00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:50.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Scriptural advice—
and when applied, it really works.

00:24:50.414 --> 00:24:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses our efforts.

00:24:53.209 --> 00:24:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about it

00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:59.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and especially as I’m older now,
I can relate to it),

00:24:59.257 --> 00:25:01.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you older ones,
just keep in mind

00:25:01.592 --> 00:25:06.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just because you’re tired
doesn’t mean

00:25:06.431 --> 00:25:09.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t love Jehovah,
that you’re not close to him.

00:25:09.684 --> 00:25:11.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things have changed.

00:25:11.728 --> 00:25:13.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep your close friendship with him,

00:25:13.938 --> 00:25:17.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t dwell on the afflictions

00:25:17.609 --> 00:25:19.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being elderly.

00:25:19.778 --> 00:25:23.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not healthy spiritually or physically.

00:25:23.532 --> 00:25:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will help us
to get through these times.

00:25:27.744 --> 00:25:31.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what will help too

00:25:31.623 --> 00:25:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to take the thinking down another path,

00:25:35.585 --> 00:25:39.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a psalm here
that I want to share with you

00:25:39.172 --> 00:25:41.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 77.

00:25:41.425 --> 00:25:46.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’ll find Psalm 77,

00:25:47.598 --> 00:25:52.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is some more beautiful,

00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:55.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired advice

00:25:55.648 --> 00:26:00.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 77—
here in the 12th verse:

00:26:02.363 --> 00:26:06.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will meditate on all your activity

00:26:06.575 --> 00:26:09.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ponder over your dealings.”

00:26:09.704 --> 00:26:13.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, it’s another one of those verses
where we need to pause

00:26:13.708 --> 00:26:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and think about it,
talking about the times we’re living in.

00:26:18.754 --> 00:26:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must ‘meditate on Jehovah’s activity’;

00:26:22.592 --> 00:26:24.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll come back to that in a moment.

00:26:24.635 --> 00:26:28.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But “ponder over your dealings”
—what would that maybe mean?

00:26:28.681 --> 00:26:30.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah—how does he deal

00:26:30.683 --> 00:26:34.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his servants?

00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:37.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does he deal with us?
He’s kind.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:40.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t you love being around somebody

00:26:40.235 --> 00:26:43.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s reasonable and kind?

00:26:43.989 --> 00:26:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way they deal
with others—they’re kind.

00:26:48.952 --> 00:26:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when they’re that way,
they’re really imitating

00:26:52.622 --> 00:26:56.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how close they are to Jehovah,
because he’s kind

00:26:56.126 --> 00:26:59.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he deals with us
—and we’re so grateful for that!

00:26:59.546 --> 00:27:04.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And talking about ‘meditating
on the activity,’

00:27:04.301 --> 00:27:06.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, think about creation

00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what Jehovah has done with creation.

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who accept evolution
—they couldn’t do such.

00:27:16.105 --> 00:27:20.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t find any benefit from creation
because they don’t believe in creation.

00:27:20.818 --> 00:27:22.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘All of this just happened.’

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so for us when we

00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at creation
—something as simple as

00:27:29.118 --> 00:27:32.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this does make Jehovah
 happy when we do it)

00:27:32.079 --> 00:27:35.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful flower or a bouquet of flowers.

00:27:35.624 --> 00:27:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, sometimes the world—
They start these businesses,

00:27:38.794 --> 00:27:42.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have these fake flowers,
and some of them look pretty good.

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:47.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But compare it to a real flower.

00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen some make these roses

00:27:50.223 --> 00:27:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that look pretty good,

00:27:53.142 --> 00:27:57.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I don’t smell
what I smell with a real rose.

00:27:57.313 --> 00:28:00.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole thing with a beautiful rose

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it just makes you reflect on the Creator.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something that has always
been a treasure for me

00:28:08.742 --> 00:28:12.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that when you can capture
a beautiful sunset

00:28:12.203 --> 00:28:15.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—might be a sunrise
or might be a sunset—

00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:18.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just causes people

00:28:18.376 --> 00:28:21.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go “Wow!”

00:28:21.171 --> 00:28:25.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of them stop
and think about God.

00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:29.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether they believe in him
or not, it just stuns them.

00:28:29.054 --> 00:28:31.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shortly after we had moved here

00:28:31.974 --> 00:28:36.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to headquarters in Warwick, I remember

00:28:36.478 --> 00:28:41.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a few days after being here,
we had some rain and such.

00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:45.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then when I took a picture of it,
it had a beautiful rainbow.

00:28:45.863 --> 00:28:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took a picture of it with my tablet.

00:28:49.658 --> 00:28:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you not feel good and refreshed

00:28:54.497 --> 00:28:58.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by looking at such activity of Jehovah God?

00:28:58.042 --> 00:29:01.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A beautiful, beautiful rainbow.

00:29:01.379 --> 00:29:04.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there are the antics of animals.

00:29:04.715 --> 00:29:06.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love dogs.

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:11.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love puppies and kittens
and the things they do.

00:29:11.264 --> 00:29:14.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes they’re able
to capture them on video.

00:29:14.058 --> 00:29:18.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just causes joy in the heart.

00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:23.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So find joy more in all of the creation
of the animals.

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:26.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all, find joy

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your relationship with Jehovah God.

00:29:29.157 --> 00:29:32.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that in mind,
notice how our brother

00:29:32.285 --> 00:29:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses practical wisdom
in the following video.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a stable job at a local resort,

00:29:41.461 --> 00:29:43.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I later lost this job.

00:29:44.506 --> 00:29:48.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:50.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My savings ran out.

00:29:51.054 --> 00:29:54.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had run out of money
to buy gas for cooking.

00:29:54.725 --> 00:29:59.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like my world had ended.

00:30:00.689 --> 00:30:03.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did some research in the publications.

00:30:03.817 --> 00:30:06.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that I was able to follow the example

00:30:06.487 --> 00:30:11.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some brothers who had found
that they were able to start businesses

00:30:11.116 --> 00:30:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using the skills and abilities that they had.

00:30:14.203 --> 00:30:17.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to use a fishing net that I owned,

00:30:17.748 --> 00:30:20.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go down to the sea (to the river),

00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:22.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put the net out in the evening.

00:30:22.628 --> 00:30:24.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in the morning,
I would go down

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be able to find fish
and crabs in the net.

00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:29.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not always get

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good catch, but by doing this,

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:36.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eventually I was able

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:39.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support my family during that time.

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:42.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to cook outside on a fire.

00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:47.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how I could help
my family to stay positive.

00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:49.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would sit together, and we

00:30:49.864 --> 00:30:53.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would sing Kingdom songs
and play games together.

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I feel that Jehovah
blessed the efforts that I made.

00:31:01.876 --> 00:31:03.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:5

00:31:03.878 --> 00:31:06.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that scripture reassured me 

00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:09.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as long as I didn’t compromise

00:31:09.217 --> 00:31:11.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the important aspects of Jehovah’s worship,

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family’s needs would be cared for.

00:31:16.016 --> 00:31:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired the beauty
and power of the sea.

00:31:20.937 --> 00:31:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

00:31:24.024 --> 00:31:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care
for just one small human like me.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What nice application of the counsel

00:31:41.125 --> 00:31:44.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have practical wisdom and of the benefits!

00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:49.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I encourage you to keep in mind
what we’ve discussed here:

00:31:49.216 --> 00:31:52.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing the neighborly love
that Jesus showed

00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:54.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the joy he experienced from that

00:31:54.805 --> 00:31:59.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then using the practical wisdom
that Jesus taught us about

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we stay close to Jehovah

00:32:02.438 --> 00:32:07.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not get distracted with things
that the world is absorbed with.

00:32:07.235 --> 00:32:12.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to help us completely capture

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this mental inclination of Jesus
especially in the days ahead,

00:32:17.245 --> 00:32:22.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want you to find Hebrews chapter 12.

00:32:26.296 --> 00:32:29.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many know this verse

00:32:29.132 --> 00:32:33.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have benefited,
but it certainly applies to our discussion

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:39.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a close friendship
with Jehovah bringing great joy.

00:32:40.018 --> 00:32:44.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 12,
and you’ll notice here,

00:32:44.523 --> 00:32:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 2:
“. . . as we look intently

00:32:49.111 --> 00:32:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent and Perfecter
of our faith, Jesus.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him

00:32:57.244 --> 00:33:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he endured a torture stake,
despising shame,

00:33:01.999 --> 00:33:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has sat down
at the right hand of the throne of God.”

00:33:08.088 --> 00:33:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful counsel

00:33:10.507 --> 00:33:14.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this is what we need to do:

00:33:14.094 --> 00:33:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look intently at the Chief Agent,”
Christ Jesus.

00:33:19.058 --> 00:33:21.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re looking
at something intently,

00:33:21.978 --> 00:33:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that means you’re looking away
from everything else.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re focused.

00:33:26.774 --> 00:33:30.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look intently” in these last days

00:33:30.903 --> 00:33:34.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent,” Jesus.

00:33:34.115 --> 00:33:36.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what we learn!

00:33:36.242 --> 00:33:39.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when you think
about what he went through

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the torture stake,
as mentioned here;

00:33:41.623 --> 00:33:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that three-and-a-half-year ministry
with those hypocrites

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(those religious hypocrites,
attacking him with their lies and slander);

00:33:50.715 --> 00:33:54.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then those final days
of his earthly life

00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially those final hours
and then those hours on the torture stake

00:34:00.725 --> 00:34:05.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he knew what was coming, the details.

00:34:05.147 --> 00:34:09.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does a man deal with that

00:34:09.317 --> 00:34:12.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without collapsing?

00:34:12.779 --> 00:34:17.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re not left to wonder.

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:20.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:22.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he endured” all that.

00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:26.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus had the prehuman existence,

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:29.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the joy of sitting with his Father
again in the heavens

00:34:29.588 --> 00:34:34.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oh, my!—
that got him through it.

00:34:34.134 --> 00:34:38.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Same for us, brothers—the joy

00:34:39.974 --> 00:34:44.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will get us through it,
the joy of staying close with our God.

00:34:44.395 --> 00:34:47.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, this last verse

00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:49.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this closing talk is here

00:34:49.608 --> 00:34:53.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans chapter 12,

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two sentences from this 12th verse here

00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:06.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 12:12—
and take this to heart:

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:09.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in the hope.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Endure under tribulation.”

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:18.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while waiting for the fulfillment
of all of Jehovah’s promises

00:35:18.555 --> 00:35:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the things that we have to deal with,
remember how Jesus dealt with it.

00:35:22.892 --> 00:35:25.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just cling to Jehovah.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have that close relationship with him,

00:35:28.106 --> 00:35:33.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will experience the greatest joy!

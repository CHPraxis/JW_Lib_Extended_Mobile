00:00:02 As disciple-makers, we are somewhat like a carpenter
00:00:06 who has a toolbox, and inside,
00:00:08 he has hand tools and he has power tools.
00:00:11 He likes the power tools because they save him a lot of time and energy.
00:00:16 He has a power drill that can penetrate hardwood.
00:00:20 He has a power sander
00:00:22 that can strip away layers of built-up grime.
00:00:25 He has a power nailer
00:00:28 that can nail together pieces very quickly.
00:00:31 Well, likewise, we have a Teaching Toolbox,
00:00:35 and inside, we have many useful tools.
00:00:39 But there’s no question,
00:00:41 the most powerful tool we have is God’s Word.
00:00:45 Notice how the apostle Paul described God’s Word
00:00:48 at Hebrews 4:12:
00:00:53 “For the word of God is alive and exerts power
00:00:57 “and is sharper than any two-edged sword
00:01:01 “and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit,
00:01:06 “and of joints from the marrow,
00:01:08 and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.”
00:01:12 So Paul says it’s like a sword that can pierce right to the heart.
00:01:17 Now, is that important in our disciple-making work?
00:01:22 Yes, because we cannot read hearts.
00:01:25 But when we use God’s powerful Word,
00:01:28 we begin to discern whether the person
00:01:31 is “rightly disposed for everlasting life”
00:01:34 and we can perhaps help that person
00:01:36 —like using the carpenter’s power tools.
00:01:40 Why, it can penetrate right to the heart of a person.
00:01:45 It can strip away what’s on the surface
00:01:48 and help the person realize what he really is.
00:01:52 It can really nail down the points.
00:01:55 The apostle Paul realized God’s Word was dynamic.
00:02:00 That’s why it is described that way.
00:02:02 It’s dynamic because it comes
00:02:04 from the living God, Jehovah.
00:02:07 You see, these words are not just words on a page.
00:02:12 Jesus said that these are words from the mouth of Jehovah.
00:02:17 A brother asked this question,
00:02:20 “If you were preaching from house to house with Jehovah himself,
00:02:25 would you do all the speaking or would you allow him to talk?”
00:02:29 Yes, when we open the Bible,
00:02:32 we are allowing Jehovah to speak, and that is powerful.
00:02:38 The apostle Paul went to the city of Thessalonica,
00:02:42 and he found Gentiles worshipping lifeless idols.
00:02:46 But what happened?
00:02:48 At 1 Thessalonians 1:9, Paul wrote that these Gentiles
00:02:52 had ‘turned away from their lifeless idols
00:02:55 to serve the true and living God.’
00:02:57 How did that happen?
00:03:00 In chapter 2, verse 13, Paul noted
00:03:02 that they had ‘received the word of God’
00:03:05 and that word was ‘at work in those believers.’
00:03:09 Paul rejoiced with those results.
00:03:13 And for us too, one of our greatest joys
00:03:16 is to see how a new disciple
00:03:18 allows God’s Word to work in him,
00:03:21 and he makes big changes.
00:03:24 In the following dramatization, notice how Neeta
00:03:27 unleashes the power of God’s Word.
00:03:51 Yo, so tell me.
00:03:54 Hi again.
00:03:56 You’re really quite stealthy.
00:03:59 Brilliant, right?
00:04:01 It’s perfect when I’m late for class,
00:04:03 which is always.
00:04:05 Right.
00:04:07 So last week you spoke about promises,
00:04:11 and I’m not about church,
00:04:14 but I am about promises.
00:04:17 So?
00:04:18 OK, well, if these are God’s promises,
00:04:21 wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word to find out how to enjoy them?
00:04:24 Seems right.
00:04:25 OK.
00:04:26 This is John 17:3.
00:04:30 Would you like to read it?
00:04:35 Um, out loud?
00:04:38 Really? Don’t you know what it says?
00:04:42 I do, but it’s nice to hear it again.
00:04:46 “This means everlasting life,
00:04:50 “their coming to know you, the only true God,
00:04:54 and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”
00:04:58 So, based on this, what means everlasting life?
00:05:01 Getting to know God.
00:05:06 But how can you get to know something you’re not even sure exists?
00:05:10 Would you like to explore that answer next time you come by?
00:05:14 Who said anything about next time?
00:05:16 Oh, um.
00:05:18 Ah, I’m just winding you up.
00:05:19 See you later.
00:05:27 Did you see how Neeta unleashed the power of God’s Word?
00:05:32 She asked a simple question that led to reading John 17:3.
00:05:37 And this is a simple but powerful scripture.
00:05:40 Jesus was the most skillful Disciple-Maker.
00:05:45 He based his teaching completely on God’s Word.
00:05:49 And when it was possible, he actually read from the Scriptures.
00:05:53 For example, you may remember the account in Luke chapter 4,
00:05:58 when Jesus went back to his hometown of Nazareth,
00:06:02 he entered the synagogue and he read from the scroll of Isaiah.
00:06:07 This is the prophecy about the Anointed One
00:06:10 who would preach good news in God’s acceptable year.
00:06:14 But Jesus didn’t stop at just reading the scripture;
00:06:19 he explained its meaning.
00:06:21 He said: “Today this scripture
00:06:24 that you just heard is fulfilled.”
00:06:27 And those townspeople could have understood that
00:06:30 because he had left the town,
00:06:32 left his carpentry work months earlier,
00:06:35 and had begun his ministry.
00:06:38 Likewise, it’s not enough for us just to read a scripture;
00:06:42 we must explain its meaning.
00:06:45 And Neeta did that.
00:06:47 You remember after John 17:3 was read, she asked this question,
00:06:52 “So based on this, what means everlasting life?”
00:06:57 And the girl got it.
00:06:59 It means getting to know God.
00:07:02 What can we do, though, if our listener doesn’t get it?
00:07:07 Well, we can just reread the key words in that verse.
00:07:13 Also, friends, we must be careful
00:07:16 not to assume that people understand the terms we commonly use.
00:07:20 For example, we often talk about the Kingdom.
00:07:24 Well, to our listener, they may be thinking of heaven.
00:07:28 They may be thinking it’s a condition of one’s heart, not a government.
00:07:32 So we have to explain.
00:07:35 Also, be patient as we use God’s Word.
00:07:40 Faith in God and appreciation
00:07:43 for the Scriptures take time to grow.
00:07:46 And Jesus illustrated this
00:07:49 at Mark 4:26.
00:07:52 Let’s just read that:
00:07:54 “So he went on to say:
00:07:57 “‘In this way the Kingdom of God is just
00:07:59 as when a man casts seeds on the ground.’”
00:08:02 Yes, like a farmer,
00:08:05 when we spread the Kingdom message, we’re casting seeds,
00:08:09 but do we expect those seeds to sprout overnight?
00:08:13 Jesus explains the growth process in verse 28:
00:08:18 “On its own the ground bears fruit gradually,
00:08:23 “first the stalk, then the head,
00:08:26 finally the full grain in the head.”
00:08:29 So it’s a gradual process.
00:08:33 The farmer waters and nurtures the seed, but he must wait.
00:08:37 Likewise, we need to be patient disciple-makers.
00:08:41 It may take many return visits
00:08:44 before we actually start a Bible study.
00:08:47 But on each return visit, let’s try to help the person
00:08:51 to progressively build faith in God’s Word.
00:08:56 Here’s an example of how we could help a person
00:09:00 come to appreciate that the Bible has practical up-to-date advice.
00:09:05 One sister does this:
00:09:07 She asks: “What would you say is the key to getting along with people?
00:09:12 May I read a proverb from the Bible?”
00:09:17 And she reads Proverbs 17:14, which says:
00:09:21 “Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate;
00:09:25 before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.”
00:09:27 And then she asks,
00:09:29 “Do you think that this advice could help us to get along with others?”
00:09:33 A reasonable person would say yes.
00:09:37 How can we help a person build faith
00:09:39 that the Bible is a book of reliable prophecy?
00:09:43 Well, on one return visit, we could briefly discuss
00:09:47 the prophecy at Isaiah 13:20.
00:09:50 This says that the city of Babylon
00:09:54 would ‘never again be inhabited.’
00:09:57 Well, 50 miles south of Baghdad, Iraq,
00:10:01 are the ruins of Babylon.
00:10:04 No one lives there, and no one has for centuries.
00:10:08 How can we help someone build faith
00:10:11 that there exists a Creator?
00:10:13 Simply read Hebrews 3:4:
00:10:17 “Every house is constructed by someone,
00:10:20 but the one who constructed all things is God.”
00:10:24 And then we could ask:
00:10:26 “If someone told you that the house you live in
00:10:29 constructed itself, would you believe them?”
00:10:33 Obviously not.
00:10:35 Neither could we really believe that this whole universe constructed itself.
00:10:40 So brothers and sisters,
00:10:42 this is a powerful tool.
00:10:45 Let’s unleash its power in our ministry.
00:10:49 We will become more effective disciple-makers,
00:10:52 and we will overflow with joy as we see
00:10:56 that Word of God at work in a new believer.
00:11:00 Brother David Splane, a member of the Governing Body,
00:11:04 will now present the next part of this symposium:
00:11:07 “Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making
00:11:10 —Improve Your Skills —Illustrating Key Points.”

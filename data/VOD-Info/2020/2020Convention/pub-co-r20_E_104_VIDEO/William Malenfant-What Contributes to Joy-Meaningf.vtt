00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is a gift from God.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:07.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his inspired Word tells us

00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:09.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced in our view of work.

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:13.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the world
teaches extreme views of work

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:16.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are contrary to God’s view.

00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have the view that work
should be avoided at all costs,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they work hard at not working.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others have the view
that the more you work,

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier you will be.

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:35.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our brother’s emphasis

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on secular work actually robs him of joy.

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:49.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The company took on new clients this year,
and I knew that Victor

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really depending on me
to keep things on schedule.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to let him down,

00:00:56.998 --> 00:00:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I stepped up

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took on the overtime hours.

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:08.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I figured it was temporary,

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:11.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I even got to take home
a bigger paycheck.

00:01:14.183 --> 00:01:18.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is
that that’s not all I took home.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of each week, I was burned-out.

00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the weekends

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well,

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they weren’t really any better.

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:51.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I spent a lot
of Saturdays back at the office.

00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:04.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project took a lot longer than I thought.

00:02:04.028 --> 00:02:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That pretty much took out field service
and the meetings.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew that management

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:11.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be impressed.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That machine is essential
so that I can get the parts out.

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got the reports in right on time.

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!
This is costing a lot of money.

00:02:18.418 --> 00:02:19.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a first quarter that I have to meet,

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and without this,

00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:22.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to—it’s going to kill me.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know we had a contract
that you’re supposed to—

00:02:28.053 --> 00:02:30.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like I said,
I don’t care about your third-party vendors.

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:31.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is unacceptable.

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working harder than ever,

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:40.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the end,
I’m not sure anyone even cared.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that being industrious
and working hard is good.

00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:54.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did our brother
in the video experience

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:57.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he adopted
the world’s extreme view of work?

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it make him happier?

00:03:00.087 --> 00:03:03.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we put secular work
above everything else,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could lose out
on needed rest and spiritual pursuits.

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother in the video
sacrificed precious time with his family

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and activity with the congregation

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he did not have
a balanced view of secular work.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:23.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me
what Ecclesiastes 4:6

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicates about being balanced

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ecclesiastes 4:6:

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Better is a handful of rest

00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:36.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than two handfuls of hard work

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:41.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and notice what it adds]
and chasing after the wind.”

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:47.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Chasing after the wind”
is an exercise in futility.

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t catch the wind
and hold on to it.

00:03:50.933 --> 00:03:53.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person who is a workaholic

00:03:53.936 --> 00:03:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may never enjoy the fruitage of his labor

00:03:56.898 --> 00:04:00.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if his work consumes
all his time and energy.

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:05.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His work can become as pointless
as “chasing after the wind.”

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:09.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We accept with joy our obligation

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide for ourselves
and those who depend on us.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:15.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also need to remember

00:04:15.334 --> 00:04:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is more to life than work.

00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:22.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us
the instructions we need

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:26.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a balanced life
and have a proper view of work.

00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:31.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Bible encourages us

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work hard at what we do
to make a living,

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:36.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meaningful secular work

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:39.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can bring us joy
and a feeling of accomplishment.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we do, we want to do it well.

00:04:43.698 --> 00:04:46.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, as Ephesians 4:28 says,

00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“doing good work” allows us
to “have something to share

00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:52.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone in need.”

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:55.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are advised in Scripture

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make sure
of the more important things.”

00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:02.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the most important work we can do

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:07.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stated clearly at 1 Corinthians 15:58.

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:11.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me
1 Corinthians 15:58:

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, my beloved brothers,

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be steadfast, immovable,

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“always having plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that your labor is not in vain

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with the Lord.”

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:34.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Having plenty to do in the work
of the Lord”

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is good for us,

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:39.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is pleasing to Jehovah.

00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how our brother benefits
from working hard

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his secular job
and in spiritual pursuits.

00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:07.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had been a busy week,

00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:11.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the weekend was going to be even busier

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and better!

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, I needed to make
an important stop.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s Ben.

00:06:28.643 --> 00:06:29.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come in!

00:06:29.978 --> 00:06:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s so good to see you.

00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:33.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too.

00:06:33.314 --> 00:06:34.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, John,

00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:36.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are you feeling?

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:38.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, how are you doing?

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:39.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
Good.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m so glad . . .

00:06:40.906 --> 00:06:43.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This illness had been so hard
on John and Sandy.

00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even imagine
what they were going through.

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so encouraging
to see John’s positive attitude.

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:08.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:07:08.018 --> 00:07:11.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a fantastic conversation
in the ministry.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Tom and I
finally figured out that glitch

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:23.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the A/V system.

00:07:23.326 --> 00:07:24.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Tom, go ahead and hit play.

00:07:24.786 --> 00:07:25.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s playing.

00:07:25.745 --> 00:07:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:07:28.248 --> 00:07:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right!

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:30.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whew!

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything looked and sounded great!

00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:44.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We definitely were busy

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the best way possible,

00:07:48.895 --> 00:07:51.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing things that really mattered

00:07:51.314 --> 00:07:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for people who love Jehovah.

00:07:58.822 --> 00:08:03.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw a balanced
and joyful man in that video.

00:08:03.702 --> 00:08:06.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother worked hard
at his secular job

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:11.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it allowed him to provide
for his family’s physical needs.

00:08:11.002 --> 00:08:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in the video
that the brother had a picture

00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his family at his workplace?

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:20.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a nice reminder
of one of the reasons

00:08:20.846 --> 00:08:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was working hard.

00:08:23.182 --> 00:08:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, it may be that you work at a job

00:08:26.977 --> 00:08:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t particularly enjoy doing.

00:08:29.688 --> 00:08:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, you
work hard and give it your best

00:08:34.277 --> 00:08:38.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’re doing it
for your family and for Jehovah.

00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:41.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you do your job well,

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth is that
you can find pleasure in it

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:48.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at least in what it provides.

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:51.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing “the work of the Lord”

00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:55.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes work that we do
on behalf of the congregation.

00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:57.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We experience the greater happiness

00:08:57.468 --> 00:09:01.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from giving,
as stated at Acts 20:35.

00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:06.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did our brother in the video
that we just observed

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:09.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give of himself to the congregation?

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:11.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:14.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took the time
to visit a brother in the hospital,

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:17.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know
that such visits are truly appreciated.

00:09:17.948 --> 00:09:20.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He participated in the ministry

00:09:20.117 --> 00:09:22.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

as stated at Ecclesiastes 3:13:

“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

and you will enjoy
all of the work you do even more.

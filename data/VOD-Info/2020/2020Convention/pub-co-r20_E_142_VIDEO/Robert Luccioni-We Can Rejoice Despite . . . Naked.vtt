00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:08.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to rejoice
despite experiencing difficult trials?

00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus far, we’ve seen how the apostle Paul

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintained his joy despite tribulation,

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distress, persecution, or even hunger.

00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:21.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt this has been
an encouragement to you because many of you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have or are
going through those very things.

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about situations
where we lose everything

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:33.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of disasters or civil unrest?

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:36.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can Paul’s experience help us in that?

00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme scripture at Romans 8:35

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quotes Paul,
stating that not even “nakedness”

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can “separate us
from the love of the Christ.”

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul had firsthand experience
with that as well.

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to 2 Corinthians 11:27.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:57.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice how he describes his trials

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 11:27

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:05.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being “in labor and toil,
in sleepless nights often,

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:08.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in hunger and thirst,
frequently without food,

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in cold and lacking clothing,”

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “nakedness,” as the footnote says.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:19.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Paul’s lack of clothing
was not due to laziness on his part.

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:23.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know from the Scriptures that Paul
worked hard to care for his needs.

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:27.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, rather, being cold and lacking clothing

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was due to things
he experienced in his ministry.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, remember the occasion
when Paul was on board the ship

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was driven and shipwrecked

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by that most violent wind
on the Mediterranean.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the ship broke to pieces,
Paul and the others

00:01:43.672 --> 00:01:48.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hung on to pieces of wood
and the pieces of the ship,

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:51.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may have reached land
with little or no clothing on.

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:54.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, remember the people of Malta
had to build a fire

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to warm the cold survivors.

00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On other occasions, Paul escaped for his life
with just the clothes on his back.

00:02:02.024 --> 00:02:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At other times, he was beaten or stoned,

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:07.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which surely ripped his clothes to shreds.

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Acts 16:22,

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:12.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read of the account
where “the civil magistrates,”

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:16.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says, “after tearing
the garments off [of Paul],

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:21.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave the command to beat [him] with rods,”
and then “threw [him] into prison.”

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these accounts help us
to better understand Paul’s words

00:02:25.508 --> 00:02:29.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 4:11

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:32.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 4:11.

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:35.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Down to this very hour

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:40.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we continue to hunger and thirst
and to be poorly clothed

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:43.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be beaten
and to be homeless.”

00:02:43.318 --> 00:02:47.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite these circumstances,
what did Paul encourage

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his fellow Christians to do?

00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 16.

00:02:51.493 --> 00:02:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I urge you, therefore,
become imitators of me.”

00:02:55.998 --> 00:03:01.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, he encouraged them to imitate
his example—rejoice despite trials.

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:04.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 12:12,
we read where he tells us to:

00:03:04.716 --> 00:03:06.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in the hope. . . .

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share with the holy ones
according to their needs.”

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:12.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Paul was able to rejoice and help others

00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when experiencing great loss himself.

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:21.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of our dear brothers and sisters
have been affected by terrible disasters.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just consider a few over the past year:

00:03:24.528 --> 00:03:28.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
earthquakes in Albania,
the Philippines,

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Puerto Rico, and elsewhere;

00:03:30.618 --> 00:03:35.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
severe flooding in Congo,
Spain, the United States;

00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:40.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hurricanes and typhoons
in the Bahamas and the Philippines;

00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
terrible fires in Australia
and the United States.

00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:46.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the list goes on and on.

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:49.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, see, the result of these
and many other disasters

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that our brothers and sisters,
some of you,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had to flee their homes
in the middle of the night

00:03:55.436 --> 00:03:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just the clothes on their backs.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or in other situations, the disaster
destroyed all of their belongings.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:06.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It pains us when we hear those reports.

00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:09.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you dear brothers and sisters
who are going through these things,

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:13.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please know that we
keep you in our prayers.

00:04:13.497 --> 00:04:18.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even in those circumstances,
our brothers continue to rejoice.

00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:21.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that possible?

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you watch the following video,

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:26.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions
helped our brother and sister

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:31.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice despite a period
of inadequate clothing.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one thing you have to understand
about living in New York City

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:47.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it’s a very fast-paced life.

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got to keep up with that lifestyle.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were doing pretty fine,

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:58.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were
happy pioneering, working

00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just trying to survive in New York.

00:05:00.755 --> 00:05:03.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that you
usually have to worry about

00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:07.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your safety
—being careful of your surroundings.

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:11.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But hurricanes are just something
we never considered;

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:13.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s something we
never had to worry about.

00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day when we first heard the warning,

00:05:21.777 --> 00:05:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was raining outside and kind of windy.

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:29.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw the water coming into the parking lot
where our apartment was, and that’s when

00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:31.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized something was about to happen.

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:40.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got out with the clothes on our back.

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just total devastation.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You lose everything

00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one single night.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had any thought that water

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:55.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would come into our place and destroy
everything from our material possessions

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our clothes.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:00.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I truly felt
what it was like to be destitute.

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just broke my heart.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all I could do

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:06.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was wonder, ‘Where do my wife
and I go from here?’

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:11.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assembly was scheduled for that weekend.

00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:13.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a suit jacket or a tie.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:20.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I probably took for granted
something as simple as clothing.

00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:21.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had it.

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers and sisters stepped in
to assist in so many different ways.

00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:32.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard a knock on the door that Friday

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—three suits

00:06:35.188 --> 00:06:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shoes!

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:40.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They purchased clothing for us.

00:06:40.652 --> 00:06:42.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a most unbelievable experience.

00:06:43.572 --> 00:06:46.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These friends gave us big hugs
and gave us envelopes.

00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:47.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are fully convinced

00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:49.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were clothed by Jehovah’s love.

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:54.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to go to our assembly
and enjoy taking in spiritual food,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we were in that situation.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we lost everything physically,

00:07:00.757 --> 00:07:04.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were still able to keep on pioneering,
which we have been doing up to this day.

00:07:05.804 --> 00:07:07.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made a promise.

00:07:07.848 --> 00:07:10.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep seeking
first his Kingdom,

00:07:10.976 --> 00:07:14.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything else he will take care of.

00:07:14.188 --> 00:07:16.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where my joy comes from.

00:07:18.484 --> 00:07:21.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what type of tribulation
you go through in your life,

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even if it’s to the point of nakedness,

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will never ever be able to stop

00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:30.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or cut off the relationship
that we have with our God, Jehovah.

00:07:36.962 --> 00:07:39.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped this couple?

00:07:39.173 --> 00:07:41.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They lost everything in one night.

00:07:41.175 --> 00:07:44.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were unsure what they would do,
how they would go on.

00:07:44.512 --> 00:07:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice their resolve?

00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Brian said, ‘No matter
what tribulation we experience,

00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:53.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘even to the point of nakedness,

00:07:53.313 --> 00:07:56.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will never cut us off
from our relationship with Jehovah.’

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were touched by how
their brothers stepped in to help them.

00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They kept their hope in Jehovah
and the future alive.

00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:06.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from this?

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn that when we
are going through trials,

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:12.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even those trials that cause us
to lose our possessions

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be inadequately clothed,
we can maintain our joy

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the three things
we’ve been discussing:

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:23.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:26.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receiving relief from our brotherhood,

00:08:26.097 --> 00:08:29.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and holding fast to our hope.

00:08:29.309 --> 00:08:33.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of you immediately respond
to help your brothers and sisters

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:37.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you see a need,
and we appreciate that so much.

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:42.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Disasters are on the increase,
both in frequency and intensity,

00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:47.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus the need to provide relief
for our brothers continues to increase.

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:51.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we commend you
and thank you for what you do.

00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:55.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, some of you volunteer
to go into areas to help.

00:08:55.378 --> 00:08:59.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after Hurricane Dorian
in the Bahamas,

00:08:59.466 --> 00:09:01.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Witness pilots transported

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 700 volunteer workers
into those affected areas.

00:09:06.015 --> 00:09:11.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you assist your brothers
and sisters right in your own area.

00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:13.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
in Congo, many of our brothers

00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to flee their homes and villages

00:09:16.192 --> 00:09:20.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just the clothes on their backs
because of civil unrest.

00:09:20.113 --> 00:09:22.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all their possessions
and livelihood gone,

00:09:22.532 --> 00:09:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they do?

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:27.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, their brothers and sisters
in neighboring congregations,

00:09:27.454 --> 00:09:31.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they had limited means,
provided money,

00:09:31.124 --> 00:09:35.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food, clothing, and even housing
for their displaced brothers.

00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:40.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bolivia and Venezuela,
congregations shared meals

00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or did a local distribution of food.

00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at how
our brotherhood has stepped in

00:09:47.016 --> 00:09:50.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this COVID-19 pandemic,

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:55.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing food supplies,
relief supplies, emotional support,

00:09:55.066 --> 00:10:00.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual support—congregations
and families helping one another out.

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:03.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, see,
because of your self-sacrificing spirit

00:10:03.575 --> 00:10:07.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your generous donations,
you are a blessing

00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:10.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your brothers and sisters
all around the world.

00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a slap
in the face this is to Satan!

00:10:15.505 --> 00:10:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:20.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ll remember that at Job 1:11,

00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:25.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan insulted Jehovah
—and all of us who love Jehovah—

00:10:25.015 --> 00:10:27.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by insinuating that we would turn our back

00:10:27.935 --> 00:10:30.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah when going through trials.

00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:33.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that at Job 1:11.

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:36.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “But, for a change,
stretch out your hand

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:39.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strike everything he has,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will surely curse
you to your very face.”

00:10:43.117 --> 00:10:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Satan was convinced that when it
came to losing our possessions

00:10:47.497 --> 00:10:51.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or staying loyal to Jehovah,
we would choose our possessions.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:54.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan was convinced that when it
came to helping ourselves

00:10:54.504 --> 00:10:58.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or helping somebody else,
we would choose ourselves.

00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:01.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wrong he was!

00:11:01.053 --> 00:11:03.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How angry he must be

00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:07.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he sees what is happening
in Jehovah’s organization today!

00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:11.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?
Keep making him angry.

00:11:11.064 --> 00:11:14.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to help your brothers
and sisters in need.

00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:17.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do, not only do we gain happiness

00:11:17.445 --> 00:11:20.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we help our brothers to rejoice as well.

00:11:20.866 --> 00:11:24.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, dear friends,
may all of us be determined

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:28.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our joy alive
by doing those three things:

00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:31.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintaining our relationship
with Jehovah,

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing the love
and support of our brotherhood,

00:11:35.297 --> 00:11:38.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating
on our precious hope.

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never forget,

00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:44.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we continue to loyally serve
Jehovah despite nakedness

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:49.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—despite losing all of our possessions—
we make Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:53.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is one
of our greatest reasons for rejoicing.

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:02.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:05.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Danger.”

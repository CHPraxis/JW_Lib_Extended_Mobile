despite pressure
from the world around us?

Please follow along in your Bible

00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:56.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Brother Samuel Herd of the Governing Body

00:00:56.244 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduces and applies
the dramatic Bible reading entitled

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Caused Them to Rejoice.”

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing,”

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:17.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says Psalm 100:2.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:24.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s given us
many reasons to rejoice.

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:27.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us life with its many joys.

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:31.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us the Bible
to teach us how to enjoy life.

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:36.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he guides us
into countless joyful experiences.

00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:40.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the God who gives joy.

00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan, however, does not want us

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find joy in serving Jehovah.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,
he knows that joy helps us

00:01:50.298 --> 00:01:52.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on preaching and teaching

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:55.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very work he wants to stop.

00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:57.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he tries to destroy our joy,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes through official opposition

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:05.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at other times
through family and community pressure.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan also wants us

00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:10.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cut back our service to Jehovah

00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:14.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to obtain
unnecessary material things.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to think that getting
more and more material things

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:22.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring us lasting joy.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:23.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:26.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s tactics are not new.

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:28.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we now read portions of the books

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:31.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for lessons that can help us

00:02:34.426 --> 00:02:39.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “serve Jehovah with rejoicing” today.

00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:43.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what brought
Jehovah’s people joy back then

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:46.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what robbed them of their joy.

00:02:46.814 --> 00:02:51.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And consider why and how
<i>we</i>  can experience

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:53.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the joy of Jehovah” today,

00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:55.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under trying circumstances.

00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:08.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra, a priest and a copyist
of the Law of Moses,

00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:11.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the writer of the book
that bears his name.

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:15.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Ezra
picks up the history of Israel

00:03:15.092 --> 00:03:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the end of 2 Chronicles,

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which likely Ezra also wrote.

00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:23.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 537 B.C.E.,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many Jews
are about to return to Judah.

00:03:26.354 --> 00:03:30.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The nation has spent 70 years
in captivity to Babylon

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:33.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for practicing idol worship.

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:36.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve learned a hard lesson,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never again does the entire nation

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:42.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fall back into idolatry.

00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:47.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the time has come to get pure worship

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back on its feet in Jerusalem.

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:52.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account spans the reigns

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of several Persian kings,

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:56.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with King Cyrus,

00:03:56.968 --> 00:03:59.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has a joyful beginning.

00:08:03.717 --> 00:08:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is a very joyful time.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just as Moses said
when he instructed the nation

00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:12.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to celebrate the Festival of Booths:

00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will become nothing but joyful”!

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next year, they courageously

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and joyfully lay
the foundation for the temple.

00:08:22.653 --> 00:08:27.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about that at Ezra 3:10-13:

00:08:29.368 --> 00:08:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the builders laid the foundation
of the temple of Jehovah,

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:36.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then the priests in official clothing,
with the trumpets,

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:40.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Levites, the sons of Asaph,
with the cymbals,

00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:42.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stood up to praise Jehovah

00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the direction
of King David of Israel.

00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:49.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they began to sing in response

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:52.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by praising and giving thanks to Jehovah,

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:57.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for he is good; his loyal love
toward Israel endures forever.’

00:08:59.023 --> 00:09:03.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then all the people shouted
with a loud shout of praise to Jehovah

00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:08.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the foundation
of the house of Jehovah had been laid.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:13.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many of the priests, the Levites,
and the heads of the paternal houses

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—the old men who had seen the former house—

00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wept with a loud voice when they saw
the foundation of this house being laid,

00:09:21.295 --> 00:09:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while many others shouted joyfully
at the top of their voice.

00:09:25.508 --> 00:09:27.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the people could not distinguish

00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:31.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sound of the joyful shouts
from the sound of the weeping,

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:33.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the people were shouting so loudly

00:09:33.933 --> 00:09:37.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the sound was heard
from a great distance.”

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, some of the oldest members of the nation

00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:45.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot imagine
how this temple could possibly match

00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glory of Solomon’s temple.

00:09:48.197 --> 00:09:52.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the others’ joyful shouting
overpowers their weeping.

00:09:53.369 --> 00:09:55.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people of the surrounding lands, however,

00:09:55.913 --> 00:09:57.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not rejoice.

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, they cunningly target Israel’s joy.

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:07.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how in Ezra chapter 4:1-3:

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:11.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the enemies
of Judah and Benjamin heard

00:10:11.137 --> 00:10:15.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the returned exiles were building
a temple to Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they immediately approached Zerubbabel
and the heads of the paternal houses

00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:22.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said to them:”

00:10:22.315 --> 00:10:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us build along with you;

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:28.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for like you, we worship your God

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:30.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we have been sacrificing to him

00:10:30.448 --> 00:10:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since the days
of King Esar-haddon of Assyria,

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who brought us here.”

00:10:35.078 --> 00:10:37.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Zerubbabel and Jeshua

00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the rest of the heads
of the paternal houses of Israel

00:10:40.542 --> 00:10:42.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said to them:”

00:10:42.544 --> 00:10:45.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have no share with us
in building a house to our God,

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:49.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for we alone will build it
to Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:53.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as King Cyrus
the king of Persia has commanded us.”

00:10:54.014 --> 00:10:58.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zerubbabel discerns
that behind their enemies’ offer to help

00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:00.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lurk bad motives.

00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:02.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he rejects their offer,

00:11:02.814 --> 00:11:06.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they try to prevent the Jews
from working on the temple.

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:11.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how verses 4 to 7 continue:

00:11:11.365 --> 00:11:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the people of the land

00:11:14.117 --> 00:11:16.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were continually discouraging
the people of Judah

00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and disheartening them from building.

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:22.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They hired advisers against them
to frustrate their plans

00:11:22.584 --> 00:11:27.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the days of King Cyrus of Persia
until the reign of King Darius of Persia.

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:30.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus,

00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they wrote an accusation

00:11:32.052 --> 00:11:34.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And in the days
of King Artaxerxes of Persia,

00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
and the rest of his colleagues

00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wrote to Artaxerxes the king;

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they translated the letter into Aramaic,

00:11:47.443 --> 00:11:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
writing it with Aramaic characters.”

00:11:52.489 --> 00:11:55.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what Rehum,
the chief government official,

00:11:55.242 --> 00:11:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others of Israel’s enemies
write to the king.

00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what kind
of false accusations they make,

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Ezra 4:11-16:

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is a copy
of the letter that they sent him.”

00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To King Artaxerxes from your servants,

00:12:15.304 --> 00:12:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the men of the region Beyond the River:

00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:21.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And now let it be known to the king

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the Jews who came up here
from you to us have arrived at Jerusalem.

“They are rebuilding
the rebellious and wicked city,

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they are finishing the walls
and repairing the foundations.

00:12:34.824 --> 00:12:37.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now let it be known to the king

00:12:37.034 --> 00:12:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that if this city should be rebuilt
and its walls finished,

00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:45.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will not give tax, tribute, or toll,

00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:49.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will result in a loss
to the treasuries of the kings.

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since we eat the salt of the palace

00:12:52.633 --> 00:12:57.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it is not proper for us
to see the king’s interests harmed,

00:12:57.388 --> 00:13:01.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have therefore sent
to make this known to the king,

00:13:01.643 --> 00:13:04.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that there may be an investigation

00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:07.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the book of records of your ancestors.

00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:09.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will find in the book of records

00:13:09.943 --> 00:13:13.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and learn that this city
is a rebellious city,

00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“injurious to kings and provinces,

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:20.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and within it have been those
stirring up sedition

00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:22.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from ancient times.

00:13:22.664 --> 00:13:26.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why this city was destroyed.

00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:29.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are making known to the king

00:13:29.087 --> 00:13:33.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that if this city is rebuilt
and its walls are finished,

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:37.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have no control
of the region Beyond the River.”

00:13:37.846 --> 00:13:41.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do those false accusations sound familiar?

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:46.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the same ones
our enemies sometimes hurl against us today:

00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:48.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They don’t pay taxes.

00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:51.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They work
against the government’s interests.

00:13:51.193 --> 00:13:54.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are rebellious and seditious.

00:13:54.196 --> 00:13:56.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re uncontrollable.”

00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:58.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All false charges, of course!

00:13:59.576 --> 00:14:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And back then, they had their effect.

00:14:03.246 --> 00:14:05.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king orders the work halted,

00:14:05.582 --> 00:14:08.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and temple rebuilding comes to a standstill.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad!

00:14:10.045 --> 00:14:12.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Jews first returned,

00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:15.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t let fear of man

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stop them from doing Jehovah’s work.

00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now they do.

00:14:20.013 --> 00:14:21.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us today

00:14:21.932 --> 00:14:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face increasing opposition to Jehovah’s work.

00:14:25.394 --> 00:14:27.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But compromising or giving up

00:14:27.855 --> 00:14:30.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has never brought anyone joy

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:33.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just the opposite.

00:14:33.193 --> 00:14:36.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remaining faithful brings joy,

00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:38.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the face of violent persecution.

00:14:38.907 --> 00:14:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how is that possible?

00:14:41.744 --> 00:14:44.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a true-life example.

00:14:44.496 --> 00:14:46.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture a mother and daughter

00:14:46.582 --> 00:14:49.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surrounded by a mob of angry men

00:14:49.918 --> 00:14:53.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding that they
buy political party cards.

00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would the sisters do?

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they compromised and bought the cards,

00:14:58.302 --> 00:15:00.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their persecutors would rejoice.

00:15:00.304 --> 00:15:03.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But afterward the sisters would be miserable,

00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:06.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing they had denied
their heavenly Father.

00:15:06.977 --> 00:15:09.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters did not give in.

00:15:09.814 --> 00:15:14.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they didn’t enjoy
being ridiculed and mistreated.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, however,
their consciences were clean.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they felt deep joy,

00:15:20.491 --> 00:15:24.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing they had remained
faithful to Jehovah.

00:15:25.287 --> 00:15:27.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the Jews of Ezra’s day?

00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many may have left a stable life in Babylon

00:15:31.127 --> 00:15:34.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the arduous trek to Judah.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after about 14 years
of constant opposition,

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:41.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the laying
of the temple’s foundation up to the ban,

00:15:41.929 --> 00:15:46.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews have lost
their zeal for Jehovah’s work.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They go through the motions
of offering sacrifices,

00:15:49.896 --> 00:15:54.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they are not doing
what Jehovah <i>told</i>  them to do

00:15:54.776 --> 00:15:57.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—finish rebuilding the temple!

00:15:57.445 --> 00:15:59.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they meet resistance,

they rationalize that it must not be

00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:04.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s time to finish the work.

00:16:04.869 --> 00:16:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, even Governor Zerubbabel

00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:10.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and high priest Jeshua need encouragement.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide it,
Jehovah sends the prophet Haggai.

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:17.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn now
to the book of Haggai, chapter 1.

00:16:18.842 --> 00:16:21.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai’s clear and powerful messages,

00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:24.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivered during a period
of about four months,

00:16:24.222 --> 00:16:26.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get right to the heart of the matter,

00:16:26.683 --> 00:16:31.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read at Haggai 1:2-11:

00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:34.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:16:34.733 --> 00:16:36.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘These people say,

00:16:36.776 --> 00:16:40.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The time has not yet come
for the house of Jehovah to be built.”’

00:16:40.613 --> 00:16:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the word of Jehovah again came
through Haggai the prophet, saying:

00:16:45.201 --> 00:16:50.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Is it the time for you to dwell
in your paneled houses,

00:16:50.207 --> 00:16:52.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘while this house lies in ruins?

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:56.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:16:56.129 --> 00:16:59.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Set your heart on your ways.

00:16:59.007 --> 00:17:02.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You have sown much seed,
but you harvest little.

00:17:02.803 --> 00:17:06.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You eat, but it is not to satisfaction.

00:17:06.098 --> 00:17:09.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You drink, but you do not drink your fill.

00:17:09.434 --> 00:17:13.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“You put on clothing, but no one gets warm.

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:15.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“The one who hires himself out

00:17:15.774 --> 00:17:19.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“puts his wages in a bag full of holes.”’

00:17:19.528 --> 00:17:23.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set your heart on your ways.

00:17:26.243 --> 00:17:29.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go up to the mountain and bring in lumber.

00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:31.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And build the house,

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:36.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I may take pleasure in it 
and I may be glorified,’ Jehovah says.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You were expecting much
and receiving little;

00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:44.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and when you brought it
into the house, I blew it away.

00:17:44.803 --> 00:17:47.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For what reason?’
declares Jehovah of armies.

00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:51.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Because my house is in ruins,

00:17:51.018 --> 00:17:55.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘while each of you runs around
taking care of his own house.

00:17:55.064 --> 00:17:58.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘So the heavens above you
withheld their dew,

00:17:58.275 --> 00:18:00.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the earth withheld its produce.

00:18:00.736 --> 00:18:04.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I kept calling
for a drought on the earth,

00:18:04.031 --> 00:18:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘on the mountains,
on the grain, on the new wine,

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:11.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘on the oil,
on what grows from the ground,

00:18:11.205 --> 00:18:16.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on humans and livestock,
and on all the labor of your hands.’”

00:18:16.627 --> 00:18:19.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah compares the results
of the Jews’ self-centered efforts

00:18:19.755 --> 00:18:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of a hired worker who puts

00:18:22.258 --> 00:18:24.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wages into a moth-eaten sack.

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:29.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Jews
are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:18:29.056 --> 00:18:31.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he holds back his blessing.

00:18:31.392 --> 00:18:34.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the Jews’ labor are limited,

00:18:34.312 --> 00:18:36.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lives lack joy.

00:18:36.939 --> 00:18:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, some try to fill that void

00:18:40.443 --> 00:18:43.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by beautifying their own homes.

00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:48.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>material</i>  things
cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:18:48.034 --> 00:18:51.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:18:51.329 --> 00:18:54.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not wrong to enjoy nice things.

00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:59.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But material things
cannot bring us true and lasting joy,

00:18:59.587 --> 00:19:04.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if we neglect
Jehovah’s work to obtain them.

00:19:05.343 --> 00:19:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the lesson of Psalm 127:1:

00:19:07.971 --> 00:19:10.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:19:10.473 --> 00:19:12.475 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“it is in vain

00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:14.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that its builders work hard on it.”

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:18.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
when we unselfishly ‘seek first

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom and his righteousness,’ 

00:19:21.734 --> 00:19:24.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>he</i>  provides what we really need

00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:27.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at just the right time.

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:31.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 10:22 tells us:

00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:34.914 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah

00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:36.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“that makes one rich,

00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:39.711 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no <i>pain </i> with it.”

00:19:40.128 --> 00:19:44.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, will this rebuilt temple
really not attain to its former glory,

00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:46.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some believe?

00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:48.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through Haggai, Jehovah guarantees

00:19:48.803 --> 00:19:50.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the future glory of this house

00:19:50.972 --> 00:19:53.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be even greater.

00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:58.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading at Haggai 2:3-9.

00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:04.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Who is left among you 
who saw this house in its former glory?

00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:06.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How does it look to you now?

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Does it not seem
like nothing in comparison?

00:20:10.158 --> 00:20:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’
declares Jehovah,

00:20:14.621 --> 00:20:18.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and be strong,
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And be strong, all you people of the land,’
declares Jehovah,

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:24.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and work.

00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am with you,’
declares Jehovah of armies.

00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Remember what I promised you
when you came out of Egypt,

“‘and my spirit remains among you.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid.’

00:20:37.478 --> 00:20:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:43.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yet once more
—in a little while—

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:46.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will shake
the heavens and the earth

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the sea and the dry land.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will shake all the nations,

of all the nations will come in;

00:20:54.995 --> 00:21:00.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will fill this house with glory,’
says Jehovah of armies.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The silver is mine,

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:05.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the gold is mine,’
declares Jehovah of armies.

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:08.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The future glory of this house

00:21:08.342 --> 00:21:11.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be greater than the former,’
says Jehovah of armies.”

00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:17.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when the Creator and Owner
of the entire universe declares his purpose,

00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:22.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who or what could possibly prevent
him from carrying it out?

00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing and no one!

00:21:25.693 --> 00:21:29.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s straightforward message
is unmistakable.

00:21:29.613 --> 00:21:33.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, the returnees
need more encouragement.

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:35.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sends his angel

00:21:35.202 --> 00:21:38.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to another prophet, Zechariah.

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:43.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Zechariah 1:12-16,

00:21:43.711 --> 00:21:48.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together
the angel’s reassuring words for Israel.

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:52.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Zechariah 1:12-16.

00:21:54.597 --> 00:21:57.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the angel of Jehovah said:”

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah of armies,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how long will you withhold your mercy
from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,

00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:09.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with whom you have been
indignant these 70 years?”

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah answered the angel
who was speaking with me,

“with kind and comforting words.

00:22:14.742 --> 00:22:18.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the angel
who was speaking with me told me:”

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:22.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Call out, 
‘This is what Jehovah of armies says:

“‘“because I felt indignant
to a small extent,

“‘but they added to the calamity.”

00:22:37.807 --> 00:22:41.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Therefore this is what Jehovah says:

“‘“I will return to Jerusalem with mercy,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and my own house will be built in her,”

“and a measuring line
will be stretched out over Jerusalem.”’”

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To emphasize
just how protective Jehovah will be,

00:22:57.494 --> 00:23:01.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angel continues,
at chapter 2, verses 7-9:

“Come, Zion!

to the nations that were plundering you:

“‘For now I will wave
my hand against them,

00:23:28.817 --> 00:23:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you will certainly know
that Jehovah of armies has sent me.”

00:23:34.281 --> 00:23:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you let someone
poke his finger in your eye?

Of course not!

00:23:39.661 --> 00:23:43.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither will Jehovah
allow Israel’s opposers to harm them.

Then, in Zechariah 3:1, 2,

00:23:47.878 --> 00:23:51.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angel reveals 
the greater enemy behind the opposition.

“And he showed me Joshua the high priest

at his right hand to resist him.

Is not this one a burning log
snatched out of the fire?”

00:24:19.243 --> 00:24:22.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is all this intended simply to build up

00:24:22.747 --> 00:24:25.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israel’s confidence in themselves?

00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the contrary!

00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to remember
that only with Jehovah’s help

00:24:32.173 --> 00:24:34.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can they accomplish anything.

00:24:34.759 --> 00:24:36.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to the angel’s further words

00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:40.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Zechariah in chapter 4, verses 6, 7:

00:24:41.057 --> 00:24:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel:

00:24:45.019 --> 00:24:48.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:24:48.481 --> 00:24:52.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but by my spirit,’
says Jehovah of armies.

00:24:52.193 --> 00:24:54.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who are you, O great mountain?

00:24:54.946 --> 00:24:59.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Before Zerubbabel
you will become a level land.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will bring out
the top stone amid shouts of:

00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:06.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How wonderful! How wonderful!’”

00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Energized by Jehovah’s motivating words

00:25:10.253 --> 00:25:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his two prophets,

00:25:12.422 --> 00:25:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews stop wavering
in a lack of faith and resume

00:25:15.216 --> 00:25:17.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
construction of the temple.

00:25:17.218 --> 00:25:20.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Predictably, Israel’s enemy neighbors,

00:25:20.013 --> 00:25:22.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led by Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai,

00:25:22.974 --> 00:25:25.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also spring into action.

00:25:25.602 --> 00:25:27.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Returning to the book of Ezra,

00:25:27.812 --> 00:25:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read at chapter 5, verses 3-5:

00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:36.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time Tattenai the governor
of the region Beyond the River

00:25:36.237 --> 00:25:40.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues
came to them and asked them:”

00:25:40.492 --> 00:25:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who issued an order to you
to build this house

00:25:43.953 --> 00:25:46.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to finish this structure?”

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:48.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then they asked them:”

00:25:48.166 --> 00:25:51.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What are the names of the men
who are working on this building?”

00:25:51.753 --> 00:25:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God was watching
over the elders of the Jews,

00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:58.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they did not stop them
until the report could be sent to Darius

00:25:58.593 --> 00:26:02.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an official document
could be sent back concerning this.”

00:26:02.848 --> 00:26:05.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is another lesson for us today:

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:10.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we courageously do
Jehovah’s work despite opposition,

00:26:10.021 --> 00:26:12.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses our efforts

00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:15.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enables us to keep on serving him.

00:26:15.944 --> 00:26:19.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, though,
the Jews must continue their work

00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:21.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the temple under ban.

00:26:21.575 --> 00:26:23.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king who <i>issued</i>  the ban, however,

00:26:23.827 --> 00:26:27.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was assassinated
after reigning only seven months.

00:26:27.873 --> 00:26:30.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Tattenai and his accomplices

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:34.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are dealing with a <i>new</i>  king, Darius I.

00:26:35.672 --> 00:26:37.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In denouncing the Jews,

00:26:37.758 --> 00:26:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they try to use
Zerubbabel’s own words against him,

00:26:41.637 --> 00:26:44.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his statement that King Cyrus

00:26:44.515 --> 00:26:47.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
issued the order to rebuild the temple.

00:26:47.351 --> 00:26:52.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They ask King Darius
to investigate whether that’s really so.

00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:55.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius orders the investigation.

00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:58.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will King Darius decide?

00:26:58.904 --> 00:27:02.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the Jews’ renewed faith
and determination bring them joy?

00:27:02.575 --> 00:27:04.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just more trouble?

00:27:04.618 --> 00:27:09.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius learns that Cyrus
did indeed order that the temple be rebuilt.

00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ezra 6:6-12, we read

00:27:14.879 --> 00:27:17.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius’ stinging reply.

00:27:18.257 --> 00:27:22.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So now Tattenai the governor
of the region Beyond the River,

00:27:22.928 --> 00:27:25.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:27:28.768 --> 00:27:30.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—stay away from there.

00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:34.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not interfere with the work

“The governor of the Jews
and the elders of the Jews

00:27:37.151 --> 00:27:41.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“Furthermore, I am issuing an order

00:27:59.549 --> 00:28:01.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And whatever is needed

“I have also issued an order
that if anyone violates this decree,

00:28:44.052 --> 00:28:47.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And may the God
who has caused his name to reside there

00:28:47.555 --> 00:28:51.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“overthrow any king
and people who lift a hand

“to violate this order
and destroy that house of God,

00:28:54.771 --> 00:28:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which is in Jerusalem.

“I, Darius, issue this order.

00:29:00.026 --> 00:29:02.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let it be done promptly.”

00:29:03.655 --> 00:29:08.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon receiving the king’s command,
Tattenai and his colleagues have no choice.

00:29:08.702 --> 00:29:12.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only must they stop interfering
with the work on the temple,

00:29:12.831 --> 00:29:15.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they must help finance it.

00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:19.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful outcome for the faithful Jews!

00:29:19.671 --> 00:29:22.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 515 B.C.E.,

00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:27.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they hold the inauguration
of the house of God with joy,

00:29:27.054 --> 00:29:30.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as we read at verse 22:

00:29:30.807 --> 00:29:32.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They also joyfully held

00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:35.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Festival of Unleavened Bread
for seven days,

00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:38.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah caused them to rejoice

00:29:38.398 --> 00:29:42.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had made the heart
of the king of Assyria favorable toward them,

00:29:42.069 --> 00:29:45.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that he supported them
in the work of the house of the true God,

00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:47.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of Israel.”

00:29:49.743 --> 00:29:54.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, when wise and just officials
similarly intervene in our behalf,

00:29:54.748 --> 00:29:57.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re very grateful to them.

00:29:57.209 --> 00:30:01.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re most grateful
to Jehovah for directing matters.

00:30:01.463 --> 00:30:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 21:1 says:

00:30:04.258 --> 00:30:07.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“A king’s heart is like streams of water

00:30:07.261 --> 00:30:09.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“in Jehovah’s hand.

00:30:09.305 --> 00:30:11.974 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He directs it wherever He pleases.”

00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:16.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do not put
our ultimate hope in any ruler

00:30:16.187 --> 00:30:18.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or institution of this world.

00:30:18.981 --> 00:30:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of them
can bring us permanent salvation.

00:30:22.818 --> 00:30:25.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
before the end of Satan’s system,

00:30:25.613 --> 00:30:30.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the nations
will turn against Jehovah’s people.

00:30:30.034 --> 00:30:35.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they’ll experience an outcome
worse than that of Tattenai’s.

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can <i>we</i>  draw

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:41.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these portions
of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah?

00:30:41.921 --> 00:30:45.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jehovah blesses our determined efforts

00:30:45.007 --> 00:30:49.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on doing his work despite challenges,

00:30:49.136 --> 00:30:52.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he frustrates
the efforts of our opposers.

00:30:52.932 --> 00:30:56.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, when we put Jehovah’s work
ahead of material comforts,

00:30:56.227 --> 00:30:58.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gives us true joy.

00:30:59.939 --> 00:31:03.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the work Jesus
commissioned us to do today?

00:31:03.818 --> 00:31:08.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made it very clear
in his parting words to his followers:

00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:14.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of people of all the nations.”

00:31:15.496 --> 00:31:18.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we, with our hearts and hands,

00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:21.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting this assignment
ahead of material goals?

00:31:21.753 --> 00:31:25.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai foretold that one day,

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:29.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s temple
would become far more glorious

00:31:29.219 --> 00:31:31.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the one Solomon built.

00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:35.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:31:35.475 --> 00:31:40.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is using our preaching
to shake the nations.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of “precious things”
—new worshippers—

00:31:44.526 --> 00:31:46.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are coming to him.

00:31:46.653 --> 00:31:51.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are joyfully flocking
to the great spiritual temple

00:31:51.032 --> 00:31:53.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s arrangement for worshipping him

00:31:53.743 --> 00:31:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:31:57.873 --> 00:32:02.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is not the time to focus our attention

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on “paneled houses”

00:32:04.254 --> 00:32:08.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on any other unnecessary pursuit.

00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:12.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very soon, on a day we do not expect,

00:32:12.387 --> 00:32:14.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s world will end,

00:32:14.723 --> 00:32:18.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will enter Jehovah’s new world.

00:32:18.393 --> 00:32:22.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no matter how Satan tries to discourage

00:32:22.022 --> 00:32:24.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or distract us now,

00:32:24.316 --> 00:32:27.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we never let him rob us

00:32:27.152 --> 00:32:29.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our joy in Jehovah!

00:32:29.571 --> 00:32:32.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we, rather, walk with Jehovah

00:32:32.324 --> 00:32:35.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right into his peaceful new world,

00:32:35.577 --> 00:32:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we will serve
him forever with rejoicing.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zerubbabel,

00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:42.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeshua,

00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai,

00:32:43.877 --> 00:32:46.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zechariah have done much

00:32:46.755 --> 00:32:50.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Israel regain Jehovah’s favor.

00:32:51.093 --> 00:32:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, in 468 B.C.E.,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra himself comes to Jerusalem
to support true worship.

00:32:57.558 --> 00:32:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the nation needs still more direction.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah sends them another brave leader.

00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:09.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the next two days of this convention,

00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:13.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn
about that faithful and powerful man

00:33:13.199 --> 00:33:15.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah.

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:25.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible account of Ezra and the messages
of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:28.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assure us that nothing can prevent Jehovah

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from blessing our work
and causing us to rejoice.

00:33:32.134 --> 00:33:34.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be pleased to know

00:33:34.136 --> 00:33:37.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the dramatic Bible reading
that you just enjoyed

00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is available for download today

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:43.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from jw.org and in the <i>JW Library</i>® app.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:49.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worship a God of saving acts.

00:33:50.444 --> 00:33:55.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this mean for us as a group
and for you personally?

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:58.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we look forward to in the future?

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:01.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay close attention
to Brother Mark Sanderson

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:05.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body
as he answers these questions in the talk

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:08.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in Jehovah’s Acts of Salvation.”

00:34:16.846 --> 00:34:21.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the world, people everywhere
are looking for a savior.

00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:25.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They long for a savior
who can rescue them from disease,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from hunger,
from poverty, from crime,

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:32.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from war,
even from death.

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:37.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the midst of so many calamities
and so many problems,

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are Jehovah’s people rejoicing?

00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:44.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our magnificent,

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:48.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Almighty God,
Jehovah, is that Savior.

00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:51.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have him and,
as a result,

00:34:51.298 --> 00:34:54.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel joy in our hearts.

00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures describe Jehovah
as being a “Grand Savior.”

00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it is a part
of his personality, his identity,

00:35:03.143 --> 00:35:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to rescue
and save his faithful servants.

00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:12.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, knowing that Jehovah
wants to save us,

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how should it
make us feel?

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:18.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles and look
at this thought in the book of Psalms.

00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 9:14

00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says: “So that I may declare
your praiseworthy deeds

00:35:29.253 --> 00:35:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the gates of the daughter of Zion,
and rejoice

00:35:33.674 --> 00:35:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your acts of salvation.”

00:35:36.844 --> 00:35:41.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, how should we feel
about Jehovah’s ability to save us?

00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:43.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his acts of salvation?

00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the psalmist said
that we want to rejoice

00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:49.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s ability to save.

00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, brothers,
when we have faith,

00:35:53.235 --> 00:35:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidence,
that Jehovah wants to save us,

00:35:57.614 --> 00:36:02.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he has the ability to save us,
and that he has ways

00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:04.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and means to save us,

00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this truly is
a reason for us to rejoice.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have that faith,
if we have that confidence,

00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to be able
to face the future

00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:22.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with real confidence,
knowing that whatever trial may come our way,

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have our Savior.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, brothers,
to reassure us,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen our confidence,
that Jehovah really is our Savior,

00:36:34.068 --> 00:36:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps us to look to the past,
to Bible times,

00:36:37.488 --> 00:36:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah rescued
and saved his people

00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both as a nation
and also as individuals.

00:36:46.622 --> 00:36:50.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s look rapidly
at three different examples

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Scriptures where Jehovah
saved his people as a nation.

00:36:55.214 --> 00:36:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the first one.

00:36:57.258 --> 00:36:59.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s from Exodus chapter 14.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’ll remember here
that the nation of Israel

00:37:02.764 --> 00:37:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was right there at the Red Sea
with Pharaoh’s armies all around.

00:37:06.517 --> 00:37:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it looked hopeless,
but what did Jehovah do?

00:37:10.229 --> 00:37:14.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He opened up that Red Sea
right in front of his people

00:37:14.692 --> 00:37:18.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowed them to walk
through on dry land.

00:37:18.738 --> 00:37:21.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a salvation that was!

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, what about in the time
of Jehoshaphat, in the nation of Judah?

00:37:25.954 --> 00:37:29.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when all those armies
of the opposing nations

00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:31.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came and surrounded
them again?

00:37:31.918 --> 00:37:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, Jehoshaphat,
in 2 Chronicles chapter 20,

00:37:36.172 --> 00:37:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looked to Jehovah and said:
‘Jehovah, we just don’t know what to do,

00:37:40.009 --> 00:37:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our eyes are toward you.’

00:37:43.179 --> 00:37:45.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jehovah do?

00:37:45.223 --> 00:37:49.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“Take your position, stand still,

00:37:49.311 --> 00:37:52.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see
the salvation of Jehovah.”

00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:54.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what they did.
They went out.

00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:56.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took their position.

00:37:56.318 --> 00:37:58.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without them
having to fight at all,

00:37:58.486 --> 00:38:01.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah threw
those other armies into confusion

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:03.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they all
wiped each other out

00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the nation of Judah
having to do a thing.

00:38:06.536 --> 00:38:08.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saved his people.

00:38:08.955 --> 00:38:12.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a third example,
what about Hezekiah?

00:38:12.542 --> 00:38:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we had
this amazing Bible drama

00:38:15.545 --> 00:38:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several years ago at our regional convention
where we saw Hezekiah

00:38:19.508 --> 00:38:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look to Jehovah
for his salvation.

00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:24.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened?

00:38:24.304 --> 00:38:26.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah sent
one angel who wiped out

00:38:26.348 --> 00:38:29.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
185,000 men in one night.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now,
what’s the point, brothers?

00:38:32.312 --> 00:38:36.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s obvious
from our review of the Scriptures

00:38:36.149 --> 00:38:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is a Savior

00:38:39.528 --> 00:38:42.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his people as a group,
as a nation.

00:38:42.197 --> 00:38:45.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen it over and over again
in the Scriptures.

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about as individuals?

00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:51.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, here’s a nice example

00:38:51.123 --> 00:38:54.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what the Bible says
here in Psalm 34.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it first
before we look at the example.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Psalm 34:18.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 34:18

00:39:06.263 --> 00:39:10.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says: “Jehovah is close
to the brokenhearted;

00:39:10.851 --> 00:39:14.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He saves those
who are crushed in spirit.

00:39:14.855 --> 00:39:17.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many are the hardships
of the righteous one,

00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But what does it say here?
Notice, brothers]

00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:24.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah rescues
him from them all.”

00:39:24.573 --> 00:39:26.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what is it?
What’s the point?

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah rescues
the righteous one,

00:39:30.246 --> 00:39:34.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just the righteous nation
but the righteous one.

00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:37.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s our example.

00:39:37.044 --> 00:39:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the faithful woman Hannah.

00:39:39.755 --> 00:39:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember her situation.

00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:44.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah was barren.

00:39:44.468 --> 00:39:47.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was constantly being harassed

00:39:47.305 --> 00:39:51.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tormented
by her husband’s other wife Peninnah.

00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:54.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so she went to the temple,

00:39:54.187 --> 00:39:56.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she poured out
her heart to Jehovah.

00:39:56.689 --> 00:39:57.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you look at this with me?

00:39:57.982 --> 00:40:00.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 1 Samuel chapter 1,

00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:05.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Samuel chapter 1,

00:40:09.744 --> 00:40:13.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see here
that in verse 10,

00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:19.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “Hannah
was extremely bitter,

00:40:19.045 --> 00:40:24.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she began to pray to Jehovah
and to weep uncontrollably.”

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:28.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this faithful servant of God
just poured out her heart,

00:40:28.054 --> 00:40:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begged Jehovah for his help,

00:40:30.807 --> 00:40:33.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had
a very specific request.

00:40:33.017 --> 00:40:37.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in verse 11,
she asked Jehovah for a child, a male child.

00:40:37.355 --> 00:40:39.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she told Jehovah
that if she would get this child,

00:40:39.691 --> 00:40:42.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would dedicate him
to the service of God.

00:40:42.819 --> 00:40:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:40:45.405 --> 00:40:48.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
look down here at verse 18.

00:40:48.116 --> 00:40:51.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once Hannah had expressed
this prayer to Jehovah,

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:54.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect, she had just thrown
her burden onto him.

00:40:54.414 --> 00:40:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what verse 18 says:

00:40:56.499 --> 00:41:00.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her face
was no longer downcast.”

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do you remember at the beginning,
she was extremely bitter?

00:41:03.965 --> 00:41:06.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it says her face
was no longer downcast.

00:41:06.468 --> 00:41:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean?

00:41:08.011 --> 00:41:11.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah was already
giving her the strength

00:41:11.848 --> 00:41:14.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able
to endure her situation.

00:41:14.518 --> 00:41:17.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t end there
because now look at verse 20:

00:41:17.521 --> 00:41:21.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Within a year,” it says,
“Hannah became pregnant.”

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah gave her
the request of her heart.

00:41:26.196 --> 00:41:29.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, can you imagine
how Hannah must have felt?

00:41:29.783 --> 00:41:33.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look over at chapter 2
and verse 1, look what she says:

00:41:33.203 --> 00:41:37.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My heart rejoices in Jehovah;

00:41:37.291 --> 00:41:39.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my horn is exalted by Jehovah.

00:41:39.751 --> 00:41:43.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My mouth is opened wide
against my enemies,

00:41:43.255 --> 00:41:45.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for I rejoice

00:41:45.257 --> 00:41:48.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your acts of salvation.”

00:41:48.886 --> 00:41:52.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, obviously,
Hannah rejoiced

00:41:52.639 --> 00:41:55.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
had become her Savior

00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:58.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she had experienced
his acts of salvation.

00:41:58.937 --> 00:42:01.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point, brothers?
What’s the point?

00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:04.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as individuals,

00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:08.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can pray to Jehovah
with our specific distresses,

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:11.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our specific requests
and concerns.

00:42:11.325 --> 00:42:15.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah honors
those who honor him.

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:19.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know all of us
have experienced this when we feel

00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:22.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
has heard our prayer,

00:42:22.336 --> 00:42:26.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has in some way
acted in our behalf.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:28.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s look
at another example.

00:42:28.718 --> 00:42:32.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it’s Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.

00:42:32.596 --> 00:42:35.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember
those three faithful Hebrews were there,

00:42:35.266 --> 00:42:38.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and King Nebuchadnezzar
had erected this golden image.

00:42:38.602 --> 00:42:41.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said everyone
had to bow down to it,

00:42:41.439 --> 00:42:44.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they would be thrown
into the fiery furnace.

00:42:44.984 --> 00:42:49.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego do?

00:42:49.322 --> 00:42:53.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They absolutely refused
to obey that order.

00:42:53.951 --> 00:42:56.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to listen to Jehovah.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those men were tied up
just as Nebuchadnezzar had warned.

00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:05.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were tied up,
and they were thrown into that fiery furnace.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, dear brothers,
I want you to think about this.

00:43:08.257 --> 00:43:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you imagine
this scene in your mind?

00:43:10.927 --> 00:43:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that as they
were going into the fiery furnace,

00:43:14.097 --> 00:43:18.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were all in a panic and they
were regretting their decision?

00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:21.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, I’m so sorry that I
didn’t bow down to the image.’

00:43:21.396 --> 00:43:23.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not.

00:43:23.398 --> 00:43:26.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at what these men said.

00:43:26.276 --> 00:43:28.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Daniel chapter 3,

00:43:30.488 --> 00:43:34.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 3,
and let’s look at verse 16 here:

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego answered the king:

00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:45.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need
to answer you in this matter.

00:43:45.086 --> 00:43:48.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it must be,
our God whom we serve

00:43:48.006 --> 00:43:51.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘is able to rescue us
from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:43:51.217 --> 00:43:54.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and to rescue us from your hand.

00:43:54.137 --> 00:43:57.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But even if he does not,

00:43:57.349 --> 00:44:02.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘let it be known to you, O king,
that we will not serve your gods

00:44:02.354 --> 00:44:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.’”

00:44:06.483 --> 00:44:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, when you hear those words,

00:44:09.486 --> 00:44:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there any regret there?

00:44:12.572 --> 00:44:14.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any weakness?
Is there any panic?

00:44:14.783 --> 00:44:16.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:18.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though
they were facing death,

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego faced it with courage.

00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:25.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They faced it with resolve.

00:44:25.919 --> 00:44:28.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They faced it with dignity.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how they must have rejoiced
when after being rescued,

00:44:33.468 --> 00:44:37.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even Nebuchadnezzar himself
had to praise Jehovah

00:44:37.055 --> 00:44:39.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way he
had rescued his servants!

00:44:39.683 --> 00:44:43.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, brothers,
what’s the point of this review?

00:44:43.353 --> 00:44:46.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, in Bible times,

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God
has saved his people

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:51.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both as a nation
and as individuals.

00:44:51.945 --> 00:44:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Jehovah
delights to do this

00:44:55.365 --> 00:44:58.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that it is
a cause for rejoicing

00:44:58.494 --> 00:45:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah’s servants
experience his salvation.

00:45:02.539 --> 00:45:06.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s the question.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know Jehovah delights
to rescue us, to save us.

00:45:10.339 --> 00:45:13.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know he’s moved
to do so by his loyal love.

00:45:13.759 --> 00:45:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it really mean?

00:45:16.303 --> 00:45:21.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean today
that when any sort of trial comes our way,

00:45:21.225 --> 00:45:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is just going to rush in?

00:45:23.853 --> 00:45:27.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s just going to intervene
and rescue us every time?

00:45:27.648 --> 00:45:30.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it does not.
It does not mean that.

00:45:30.651 --> 00:45:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why?

00:45:32.695 --> 00:45:35.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah loves us
and has the power, why is it

00:45:35.448 --> 00:45:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he isn’t rescuing us
from every situation?

00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do you remember
what Satan said to Jehovah

00:45:42.371 --> 00:45:44.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Job
in Job chapter 1?

00:45:44.957 --> 00:45:49.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Satan said:
‘You’ve put a hedge around Job.

00:45:49.003 --> 00:45:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’ve blessed
everything he does.

00:45:51.047 --> 00:45:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You haven’t allowed any calamity
to come to him.

00:45:53.049 --> 00:45:57.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The only reason he serves you
is just because of selfish reasons.

00:45:57.011 --> 00:45:58.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He doesn’t really love you.

00:45:58.596 --> 00:46:01.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just worships you
for what he can get from you.’

00:46:01.474 --> 00:46:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that same charge

00:46:03.893 --> 00:46:08.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be made about any of us
if Jehovah just rescued us from everything.

00:46:08.481 --> 00:46:11.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will Jehovah do?

00:46:11.275 --> 00:46:13.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we’re facing trials,

00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:16.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s true
that in some circumstances,

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah may remove the trial

00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:21.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in many other situations,

00:46:21.452 --> 00:46:23.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah may strengthen us

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’ll be able
to endure the trial.

00:46:28.835 --> 00:46:33.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, when we feel,
when we experience,

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:37.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is acting on our behalf,
how does it make us feel?

00:46:37.802 --> 00:46:41.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We truly, truly rejoice.

00:46:41.681 --> 00:46:43.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, brothers,
this is not theory.

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:48.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This very week,
I lost my own father in death.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father was 90 years old.

00:46:50.899 --> 00:46:55.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had served
Jehovah faithfully for 63 years.

00:46:55.195 --> 00:46:57.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers, this is a trial

00:46:57.447 --> 00:47:01.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that every single one of us
experience as God’s people.

00:47:01.826 --> 00:47:04.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some of you, like me,

00:47:04.037 --> 00:47:08.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have experienced the death of a loved one
during this coronavirus pandemic.

00:47:08.875 --> 00:47:12.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you
that it’s not an easy situation.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we say?

00:47:15.257 --> 00:47:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can say myself
that we have felt the love of Jehovah

00:47:20.262 --> 00:47:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of the e-mails,
in all of the phone calls,

00:47:24.099 --> 00:47:27.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the different ways
brothers and sisters have found

00:47:27.185 --> 00:47:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide the support
that we need.

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:31.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s been true in my case.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s been true
for all of you who’ve had the same

00:47:35.027 --> 00:47:38.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or very similar experience
at this difficult time.

00:47:38.447 --> 00:47:41.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is giving us
what we need

00:47:41.533 --> 00:47:45.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue
to serve him faithfully.

00:47:45.287 --> 00:47:49.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when some big trial
comes your way,

00:47:49.124 --> 00:47:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask yourself: ‘Am I confident

00:47:52.961 --> 00:47:56.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that Jehovah’s loyal love
is going to move him

00:47:56.965 --> 00:47:59.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to act on my behalf?

00:47:59.551 --> 00:48:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Are his acts of salvation
going to be manifest for me

00:48:03.639 --> 00:48:06.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I am going
to feel them myself?’

00:48:06.767 --> 00:48:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
does that confidence

00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:13.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is going to intervene,
that he is going to help us,

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause us to rejoice
and be happy

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:18.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the knowledge
that our God is with us?

00:48:18.863 --> 00:48:21.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now in the following video,

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:24.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you to take notice
of this beautiful experience

00:48:24.118 --> 00:48:26.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a dear sister

00:48:26.162 --> 00:48:29.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who did not have the trial
removed from her,

00:48:29.957 --> 00:48:34.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just notice how Jehovah
has strengthened her to be able to endure.

00:48:42.845 --> 00:48:46.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Malawi in 1962.

00:48:46.807 --> 00:48:51.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my eyesight at two years of age
because of an eye disease.

00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:56.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to rely on the rains
for the food we eat and sell,

00:48:56.943 --> 00:48:59.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it is our only source of income.

00:49:01.322 --> 00:49:03.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also look after both my parents.

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:06.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father is 99 years old,

00:49:06.828 --> 00:49:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mother is 92 years old.

00:49:09.872 --> 00:49:13.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poverty is very time-consuming.

00:49:13.793 --> 00:49:17.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a lot of household chores to do

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:20.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep things clean and neat,

00:49:20.091 --> 00:49:24.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like fetching water for our daily needs.

00:49:24.012 --> 00:49:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening, after we have eaten,
this is the time for reading.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,
Father took the lead in our family worship,

00:49:32.979 --> 00:49:35.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which he still does.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:37.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now because of his failing eyesight,

00:49:37.525 --> 00:49:39.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read to them.

00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:41.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read with my fingers,

00:49:41.863 --> 00:49:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so nighttime is no problem.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My fingers are my eyes.

00:49:48.244 --> 00:49:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scripture that really touches my heart

00:49:51.623 --> 00:49:54.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is James 5:11, which says:

00:49:54.084 --> 00:49:55.460 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:57.003 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“We consider happy

00:49:57.003 --> 00:49:58.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
those who have endured.”

00:49:58.922 --> 00:50:01.049 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Job endured his trials,

00:50:01.049 --> 00:50:02.384 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and at the end,

00:50:02.384 --> 00:50:05.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw all the good that Jehovah
had blessed him with.

00:50:05.595 --> 00:50:07.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convinces me

00:50:07.973 --> 00:50:10.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blessing us with all the things
that we are lacking,

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:50:15.647 --> 00:50:18.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:50:20.235 --> 00:50:24.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom and his sovereignty
are first in my life.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:29.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is only God’s Kingdom that will solve
all these problems.

00:50:30.954 --> 00:50:35.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel privileged that I’ve been able
to serve as a regular pioneer

00:50:35.167 --> 00:50:38.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 36 years now and have been blessed

00:50:38.837 --> 00:50:41.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.

00:50:43.675 --> 00:50:46.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy with song 76.

00:50:55.187 --> 00:50:57.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t see myself as poor.

00:50:57.439 --> 00:51:02.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have the Bible and many 
different publications in Chichewa Braille.

00:51:02.277 --> 00:51:07.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the congregation, the ministry,
and our brothers and sisters.

00:51:07.157 --> 00:51:11.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these things make me very happy!

00:51:11.203 --> 00:51:14.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not worried
about our current situation

00:51:14.623 --> 00:51:17.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are spiritually rich.

00:51:36.187 --> 00:51:39.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t that amazing to see
that beautiful experience of our sister?

00:51:39.982 --> 00:51:42.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah
hasn’t taken away her trial.

00:51:42.568 --> 00:51:44.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s still blind.

00:51:44.195 --> 00:51:49.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She still has a very limited means,
but look how Jehovah has blessed her.

00:51:49.033 --> 00:51:51.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look how she’s able
to help so many people

00:51:51.702 --> 00:51:54.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to know
about Jehovah.

00:51:54.038 --> 00:51:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:51:55.665 --> 00:51:57.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s look
at a second video.

00:51:57.792 --> 00:52:01.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re going to watch a video
where Jehovah really did step in

00:52:01.629 --> 00:52:05.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remove a trial from our dear brother
who was in a refugee camp.

00:52:05.007 --> 00:52:06.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:52:07.176 --> 00:52:09.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the civil war,

00:52:09.429 --> 00:52:10.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to take refuge

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:12.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a safer part of the country.

00:52:12.807 --> 00:52:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrived,

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soldiers took us
to internment camps to hold us

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they could confirm our identities.

00:52:19.772 --> 00:52:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the camps, we lived in tents,

00:52:22.525 --> 00:52:25.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was unbearably hot in them.

00:52:25.945 --> 00:52:29.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:52:29.324 --> 00:52:34.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to wait in a queue
for four to five hours every day.

00:52:35.288 --> 00:52:37.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the war, our eldest son was killed.

00:52:37.916 --> 00:52:40.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big loss for our family.

00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah

00:52:45.465 --> 00:52:48.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find comfort in the Bible.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:52.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, the brothers
from the relief committee came

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:55.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and informed us
that a regional convention would be held.

00:52:55.058 --> 00:52:59.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had spoken to the camp officials,
requesting permission for us to go.

00:53:01.106 --> 00:53:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For four days, morning and evening,

00:53:03.733 --> 00:53:06.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we went to the officials
to ask for permission.

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:10.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they would not tell us if we
would be released for the convention.

00:53:10.657 --> 00:53:14.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly one afternoon,
much to our surprise,

00:53:14.327 --> 00:53:16.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were approved
to leave the camp for five days.

00:53:17.414 --> 00:53:20.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, we had been
in the internment camp for months.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:53:23.795 --> 00:53:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so happy that we got the permission
to attend the convention.

00:53:27.257 --> 00:53:29.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never expected it!

00:53:30.927 --> 00:53:33.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time, we had some clothes.

00:53:33.305 --> 00:53:35.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we had nothing
for the three-day convention.

00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:41.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the brothers outside the camp
helped us enormously.

00:53:41.563 --> 00:53:44.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were with us
and cared for all our needs

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could be ready for the convention.

00:53:49.154 --> 00:53:52.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still wondered
where we were going to stay

00:53:52.241 --> 00:53:54.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we would get
our accommodations.

00:53:55.911 --> 00:53:57.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when we arrived,

00:53:57.913 --> 00:54:00.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers hugged us
and warmly welcomed us.

00:54:01.166 --> 00:54:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really encouraged.

00:54:04.628 --> 00:54:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we faced
many challenges and difficulties

00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:09.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the internment camp,

00:54:09.758 --> 00:54:12.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that convention
was like a nourishing meal for us.

00:54:12.219 --> 00:54:15.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real joy eating at Jehovah’s table.

00:54:16.807 --> 00:54:19.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can never forget those moments.

00:54:20.978 --> 00:54:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the convention,
a brother from the Governing Body

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave a special talk to those
from the internment camps.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:30.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That talk really strengthened us.

00:54:31.989 --> 00:54:34.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention helped us to be courageous,

00:54:34.575 --> 00:54:37.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after we returned to the camp.

00:54:37.203 --> 00:54:40.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we faced many losses,

00:54:40.122 --> 00:54:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the convention not only gave us comfort

00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:45.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also helped us to face
the challenges ahead.

00:54:47.296 --> 00:54:50.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now my youngest son and I
are serving as ministerial servants,

00:54:50.883 --> 00:54:54.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife has been serving
as a regular pioneer

00:54:54.053 --> 00:54:56.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the past 17 years.

00:54:56.097 --> 00:55:00.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She continued pioneering even while
we were in the internment camp.

00:55:00.434 --> 00:55:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that Jehovah is always there,

00:55:03.813 --> 00:55:07.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

00:55:09.193 --> 00:55:12.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how wonderful
that our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped this dear brother
and his family

00:55:14.699 --> 00:55:17.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would be able
to attend the convention!

00:55:17.327 --> 00:55:20.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, dear brothers,
what have we seen thus far in this talk?

00:55:20.455 --> 00:55:23.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been able to see
that in the past, in Bible times,

00:55:23.207 --> 00:55:25.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was
the Savior of his people.

00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:28.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in our modern times right now,
we see how Jehovah

00:55:28.755 --> 00:55:31.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is strengthening us
and acting on our behalf

00:55:31.132 --> 00:55:34.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue
to serve him faithfully.

00:55:34.219 --> 00:55:37.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what about the very near future?

00:55:37.013 --> 00:55:39.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we say about that?

00:55:39.015 --> 00:55:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know
that these last days

00:55:41.684 --> 00:55:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very soon going to lead
into the great tribulation.

00:55:45.021 --> 00:55:47.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said
at Matthew 24:21,

00:55:47.774 --> 00:55:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is going to be a “great tribulation
such as has not occurred

00:55:52.112 --> 00:55:56.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the world’s beginning until now,
no, nor will occur again.”

00:55:56.908 --> 00:56:00.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the destruction
of Babylon the Great

00:56:00.328 --> 00:56:04.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before the outbreak of Armageddon,
what is going to happen?

00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:09.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog,
this coalition of nations,

00:56:09.504 --> 00:56:14.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to lead an all-out attack
on Jehovah’s servants.

00:56:14.301 --> 00:56:17.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now,
knowing that that attack

00:56:17.888 --> 00:56:21.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is coming closer and closer every day,
how should we be feeling?

00:56:21.433 --> 00:56:24.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should it make us feel
just completely filled with anxiety?

00:56:24.603 --> 00:56:27.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we be in terror
of those events that are coming?

00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:29.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:56:29.733 --> 00:56:34.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me
what Jesus said here in Revelation chapter 2.

00:56:34.613 --> 00:56:38.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at Revelation 2:10,

00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is speaking to anointed Christians

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation of Smyrna.

00:56:44.039 --> 00:56:46.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice what
he says to them:

00:56:46.458 --> 00:56:51.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid of the things
you are about to suffer.

00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:52.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:56:52.089 --> 00:56:55.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Devil will keep on throwing
some of you into prison

00:56:55.509 --> 00:56:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be
fully put to the test,

00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:02.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will have tribulation
for ten days.

00:57:02.266 --> 00:57:05.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Prove yourself faithful
even to death,

00:57:05.853 --> 00:57:09.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will give you
the crown of life.”

00:57:09.815 --> 00:57:13.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, what do we discern
from these words of Jesus?

00:57:13.694 --> 00:57:17.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,
those who die faithfully

00:57:17.615 --> 00:57:20.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep their integrity
are guaranteed

00:57:20.701 --> 00:57:23.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have salvation
from Jehovah.

00:57:23.412 --> 00:57:27.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something else
that we can discern from these words.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us
that during these last days,

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:35.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of Jehovah’s servants
are going to experience death.

00:57:35.257 --> 00:57:37.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our modern history already,

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:40.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know our brothers
have been thrown into prison.

00:57:40.262 --> 00:57:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have been tortured
and, yes,

00:57:42.765 --> 00:57:47.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have even been put to death
because of their integrity.

00:57:47.311 --> 00:57:49.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In South Korea alone,

00:57:49.563 --> 00:57:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a period of some 70 years,

00:57:52.775 --> 00:57:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
19,352 of our brothers

00:57:57.613 --> 00:58:00.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in prison
and 5 of those brothers

00:58:00.366 --> 00:58:04.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually put to death
because of their faith.

00:58:04.495 --> 00:58:07.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can we say
about those brothers in South Korea;

00:58:07.999 --> 00:58:11.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those that died in Nazi, Germany;
and those that died in Eritrea;

00:58:11.419 --> 00:58:15.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those that died during the Soviet Union
because of their faith?

00:58:15.506 --> 00:58:20.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that their salvation
is completely assured.

00:58:20.428 --> 00:58:24.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are completely safe
in the safest place in the universe

00:58:24.682 --> 00:58:29.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the memory
of our Grand God, Jehovah.

00:58:29.062 --> 00:58:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well then, what about our brothers
who are experiencing

00:58:32.649 --> 00:58:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution right now?

00:58:34.984 --> 00:58:39.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that some of our brothers
are watching this program right now

00:58:39.072 --> 00:58:44.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in countries where our work is banned
or under very, very severe restrictions.

00:58:44.077 --> 00:58:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we say about those
dear brothers and sisters?

00:58:47.497 --> 00:58:50.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read together
this encouraging thought

00:58:50.083 --> 00:58:52.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Psalm 67

00:58:52.419 --> 00:58:54.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 67

00:58:57.299 --> 00:58:59.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 1.

00:58:59.342 --> 00:59:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“God will show us favor

00:59:03.346 --> 00:59:07.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bless us; he will make
his face shine upon us

00:59:07.934 --> 00:59:11.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your way may be known
throughout the earth,

00:59:11.229 --> 00:59:15.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your acts of salvation
among all the nations.”

00:59:15.108 --> 00:59:16.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:59:16.777 --> 00:59:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah is doing
what verse 1 says.

00:59:19.488 --> 00:59:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s showing his favor,
and he’s blessing

00:59:22.074 --> 00:59:24.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his people in these countries
where the work is under ban.

00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:27.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as a result,
we are able to see

00:59:27.871 --> 00:59:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s acts of salvation
for his people.

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, there are
so many examples of this.

00:59:33.752 --> 00:59:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish we had another hour
to be able to tell you all of them.

00:59:36.421 --> 00:59:39.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’d like to just share
one experience

00:59:39.091 --> 00:59:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is similar to many,
many more that we have received.

00:59:42.344 --> 00:59:44.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It comes from Russia.

00:59:44.388 --> 00:59:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our sisters was there
in the prison in Russia.

00:59:47.724 --> 00:59:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of the female prisoners
who were in the cell with her

00:59:50.894 --> 00:59:53.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were imprisoned
for selling drugs.

00:59:53.355 --> 00:59:57.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one day, these two prisoners
began singing songs

00:59:57.192 --> 00:59:59.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about criminal life.

00:59:59.236 --> 01:00:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the sister didn’t understand
the language, but she just knew

01:00:01.905 --> 01:00:06.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the thoughts and the ideas
in these songs were immoral and foul.

01:00:06.118 --> 01:00:08.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she just didn’t want
to be in that environment.

01:00:08.495 --> 01:00:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she prayed
to Jehovah to help her.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, suddenly,
one of the women began singing

01:00:13.959 --> 01:00:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
song number 120
from our former songbook.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sister was shocked.

01:00:18.923 --> 01:00:21.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do you know this song?”
she asked.

01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then they all sang
the song together.

01:00:23.969 --> 01:00:28.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It turned out that this woman
had learned the song from her mother

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:31.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had previously studied
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:33.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had memorized the song.

01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:37.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister felt
the loving hand of Jehovah

01:00:37.942 --> 01:00:40.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in responding
to her prayer so quickly.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:45.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh brothers, it’s a wonderful experience,
but there are so many similar experiences

01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah has shown
his hand on behalf of his people

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in small ways
and sometimes in big ways.

01:00:52.957 --> 01:00:56.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s look
at one other experience.

01:00:56.711 --> 01:01:01.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many examples
of when our brothers, in the courtroom

01:01:01.132 --> 01:01:04.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during their own trials,
have made statements that are similar 

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:08.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego said to Nebuchadnezzar.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to give
you one example.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the statement
from Brother Sergey Skrynnikov

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:17.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave in the courtroom
at his own hearing.

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:20.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a small excerpt.

01:01:20.068 --> 01:01:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let us take a look
into the future.

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If for another ten years or so
the government keeps putting 

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah’s Witnesses into prisons
and correctional colonies,

01:01:28.743 --> 01:01:32.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘there will be about 200
of them in every prison.

01:01:32.372 --> 01:01:35.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Imagine four congregations

01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:37.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of Jehovah’s Witnesses
in one prison!

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:40.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The prison administrators
will be begging

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:43.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the Ministry of Justice
to set Jehovah’s Witnesses free.

01:01:43.883 --> 01:01:47.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What do you imagine the majority
of Witnesses would pray for?

01:01:47.679 --> 01:01:51.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Lord, don’t soften
the heart of the government;

01:01:51.015 --> 01:01:53.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“don’t let him set me free.

01:01:53.226 --> 01:01:58.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have so many Bible students
and sincere people to talk to.”’

01:01:58.023 --> 01:02:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:03.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hear the confidence
in his voice!

01:02:03.903 --> 01:02:08.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then look how he ended
his statement to the court.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what he said:

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is one and the same
whether we are free or in prison.

01:02:14.289 --> 01:02:16.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, we are not abandoned.

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:20.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He is with us everywhere
as long as we stay faithful to him.

01:02:20.587 --> 01:02:23.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . Hebrews 13:6 assures me:

01:02:23.423 --> 01:02:28.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah is my helper;
I will not be afraid.

01:02:28.053 --> 01:02:30.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What can man do to me?’

01:02:30.764 --> 01:02:35.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah God himself will help me.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:39.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of whom should I be afraid?”

01:02:39.064 --> 01:02:44.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Skrynnikov,
this very humble brother,

01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:46.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made this powerful statement
in the courtroom.

01:02:46.613 --> 01:02:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it show us?

01:02:48.615 --> 01:02:51.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Jehovah
is strengthening his people.

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:56.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s giving them the power and the courage
that they need to be so bold and so frank

01:02:56.915 --> 01:03:00.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before these powerful authorities.

01:03:00.335 --> 01:03:04.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we expect
in the very near future?

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This all-out attack

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:10.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Gog of Magog
will come against God’s people.

01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:13.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it begins,
what is Jehovah going to do?

01:03:13.182 --> 01:03:17.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let me read to you just an excerpt

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:21.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our <i>Pure Worship</i> book
that just beautifully expresses

01:03:21.815 --> 01:03:23.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we can expect to see:

01:03:23.984 --> 01:03:28.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Before they are destroyed,
our enemies will see the sign

01:03:28.823 --> 01:03:32.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the Son of man,
likely a supernatural manifestation

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the power of Jehovah and Jesus.

01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:40.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The opposers will see things
that cause them extreme anxiety.

01:03:40.876 --> 01:03:44.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As Jesus foretold,
‘people will become faint out of fear

01:03:44.964 --> 01:03:49.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and expectation of the things
coming upon the inhabited earth.’

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To their horror, they will realize

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that they miscalculated when they
attacked Jehovah’s people.

01:03:56.893 --> 01:04:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will be forced to know
the Creator in his role

01:04:00.229 --> 01:04:04.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as military commander,
Jehovah of armies.

01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:07.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will no doubt unleash
heavenly armies

01:04:07.278 --> 01:04:09.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and natural forces
in such a way

01:04:09.614 --> 01:04:12.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he protects his loyal servants

01:04:12.492 --> 01:04:15.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but eliminates his enemies.”

01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:17.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful description!

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just reminds me
of our video

01:04:19.916 --> 01:04:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a couple of years ago
at a regional convention where we saw

01:04:22.752 --> 01:04:26.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those forces coming against God’s people,
and then what did we see?

01:04:26.255 --> 01:04:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, suddenly, from the heavens,
here is Jesus Christ,

01:04:29.926 --> 01:04:34.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 144,000, and all those
heavenly armies riding into battle.

01:04:34.639 --> 01:04:37.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you remember that Jesus
just pulls back that bow

01:04:37.684 --> 01:04:42.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lets that arrow go,
and all of those enemies are gone forever.

01:04:42.647 --> 01:04:46.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
don’t you just long for the day

01:04:46.067 --> 01:04:49.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you will see those things
with your own eyes?

What a wonderful time

01:04:51.239 --> 01:04:56.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be when we experience
the salvation of Jehovah!

01:04:56.202 --> 01:04:59.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what can we say

01:04:59.205 --> 01:05:01.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we have discussed
this wonderful topic

01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:04.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah
as our Grand Savior?

01:05:04.669 --> 01:05:09.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we look to the future,
we really can have the confidence

01:05:09.007 --> 01:05:11.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what Isaiah 12:2 says.

01:05:11.843 --> 01:05:13.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it

01:05:13.386 --> 01:05:18.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 12:2.

01:05:18.266 --> 01:05:20.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Look!

01:05:20.268 --> 01:05:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is my salvation.

01:05:22.729 --> 01:05:26.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will trust
and feel no dread;

01:05:26.149 --> 01:05:29.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jah Jehovah
is my strength and my might,

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:33.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has become
my salvation.”

01:05:33.323 --> 01:05:37.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as Isaiah said,
we have no reason to fear

01:05:37.911 --> 01:05:41.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we have no reason to dread
if we have our confidence

01:05:41.832 --> 01:05:44.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our God, Jehovah.

01:05:44.209 --> 01:05:47.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether we face
death with dignity

01:05:47.796 --> 01:05:51.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these last days
or we experience

01:05:51.383 --> 01:05:54.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
miraculous deliverance
at the great tribulation,

01:05:54.803 --> 01:05:57.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either way,
what can we say?

01:05:57.973 --> 01:06:01.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that we
will have the same outcome.

01:06:01.727 --> 01:06:06.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will all experience the salvation
that comes from our God, Jehovah,

01:06:06.065 --> 01:06:11.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because what is the assurance
that Isaiah 54:17 gives us?

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:14.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No weapon formed against you

01:06:14.365 --> 01:06:16.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have any success.”

01:06:16.951 --> 01:06:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers,
if we have that confidence

01:06:20.496 --> 01:06:23.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
truly is our Grand Savior,

01:06:23.249 --> 01:06:26.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then no matter what calamity,
no matter what terror,

01:06:26.877 --> 01:06:30.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what trial
may come upon us now or in the future,

01:06:30.631 --> 01:06:33.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to continue to rejoice

01:06:33.884 --> 01:06:37.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s acts of salvation.

01:06:39.974 --> 01:06:43.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Sanderson,
for that Scriptural assurance

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:46.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
will always act in our behalf.

01:06:48.274 --> 01:06:51.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you now to stand
and sing a fitting song

01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:54.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that expresses
our confidence in Jehovah.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s song number 148, entitled

01:06:58.117 --> 01:07:00.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Provides Escape.”

There are many things in life

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prepare a person for greater things.

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, elementary school

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a student for high school.

00:00:13.618 --> 00:00:15.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Running shorter races

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a person to run a marathon.

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working as an apprentice

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a worker to serve as a professional.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this talk, we’re going to discuss

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:34.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how disciple-making now prepares us

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:37.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the greater disciple-making work

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:40.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world.

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s briefly discuss

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how making disciples right now
brings a lot of joy.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Psalm 105.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is the theme scripture

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:54.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for today’s program,

00:00:54.242 --> 00:00:56.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 105:3:

00:00:56.828 --> 00:00:59.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Boast about his holy name.

00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:04.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts
of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:09.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, we’re encouraged
to “boast about [Jehovah’s] holy name.”

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:11.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do this?

00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:13.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by preaching, teaching,

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping others come to know
Jehovah and his purposes.

00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:20.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the result of this?

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:24.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, honesthearted ones respond favorably,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they begin to seek Jehovah.

00:01:27.318 --> 00:01:29.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how are they affected?

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:31.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as the second part of that verse read,

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:36.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their hearts overflow with ‘rejoicing.’

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:41.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, taking it a little further,
how are we affected

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re able to help someone
start seeking Jehovah

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:47.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on that road to everlasting life?

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it makes our hearts rejoice,
isn’t that true?

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, there are
very few things in life

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:57.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can bring more joy

00:01:57.557 --> 00:02:00.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than helping someone start seeking Jehovah

00:02:00.768 --> 00:02:02.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on that narrow road to life.

00:02:02.937 --> 00:02:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To explain Bible truth to them,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their face light up

00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as little light bulbs
start going off in their mind

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:14.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they’re learning these truths,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them start making changes
in their life to please Jehovah,

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them become an unbaptized publisher
and come up from that baptismal pool

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:26.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe later get into the pioneer work

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:29.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there’s nothing this world can offer

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(no accomplishment, no paycheck)

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:34.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can equal the joy

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:38.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping someone start seeking Jehovah.

00:02:38.765 --> 00:02:42.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appropriately,
throughout this second day

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our program,

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:47.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have been taught many ways

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can improve in our disciple-making skills,

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is vital that we do so

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:57.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because eternal lives
hang in the balance.

00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:02.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the value of one eternal life?

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one brother said,
“If all of Jehovah’s Witnesses pioneered

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the end came and one person

00:03:08.963 --> 00:03:12.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned the truth, it would be worth it.”

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the value of one life.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:18.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, with all the money, the gold,
the silver, and the diamonds combined,

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could not buy one eternal life.

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:22.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s priceless.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:26.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not one but almost 304,000 thousand

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were helped to the point of baptism
during the last service year

00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:33.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of Jehovah blessing

00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the disciple-making skills of his people.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we mentioned before,

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning disciple-making skills now

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares us for the even greater

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disciple-making work of the new world.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s talk
about how vast this work will be

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this educational work in the new world.

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it, millions
have been made disciples

00:04:04.228 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these last years of the last days.

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the new world, apparently,

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
billions of disciples will need to be made.

00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:18.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much greater is a billion than a million?

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:20.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thousand times greater!

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re talking about thousands of times

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more disciples
needed to be made then than now.

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:32.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likely, we will carry on
this work of disciple-making

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world for centuries,
not just decades,

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as is the case in the last days.

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is really something
to think about, isn’t it?

00:04:42.558 --> 00:04:45.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it makes us think of what Jesus said

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:49.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his disciples at John 14:12.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them,
‘You will do works greater than I am doing.’

00:04:53.987 --> 00:04:56.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, really, we could say that

00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:59.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that disciple-making work
of the new world will be greater.

00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More people will be witnessed to
and will be made disciples

00:05:04.914 --> 00:05:08.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a larger area, a longer period of time.

00:05:08.835 --> 00:05:12.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And undoubtedly,
disciple-making in the new world

00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:17.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be even more joyful
than disciple-making now.

00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:21.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we said before, it’s
an indescribable joy to make a disciple now.

00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:24.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why will it be even more enjoyable?

00:05:24.518 --> 00:05:27.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about the environment.

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil will be gone.

00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:33.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll be like a 100-pound block
off of all our shoulders.

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:36.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spirit of the world will no longer exist

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:39.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that spirit of the world exhaled by Satan—

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Satan will be locked in the abyss;

00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:44.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, you could say, it’ll be airtight.

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:48.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll not be able to exhale
the spirit of the world from there.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One government will rule the entire earth.

00:05:52.046 --> 00:05:55.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All human governments will be gone.

00:05:55.257 --> 00:05:59.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think of this, never again
—never, ever—

00:05:59.053 --> 00:06:02.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will the unrighteous outnumber the righteous.

00:06:02.974 --> 00:06:05.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will always be the minority.

00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:08.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this wonderful environment

00:06:08.312 --> 00:06:11.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will undoubtedly make disciple-making

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:15.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more exhilarating in the new world.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s think for a moment

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:21.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how voluminous the work itself will be.

00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:26.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29 says that “all those

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the memorial tombs

00:06:30.126 --> 00:06:33.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will hear [Jesus’] voice and come out”

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—<i>all</i> in the tombs.

00:06:35.215 --> 00:06:37.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will be included among these ones

00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:40.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will come out of “the memorial tombs”?

00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:44.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open up to Acts chapter 24,

00:06:44.015 --> 00:06:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice who will be included

00:06:47.227 --> 00:06:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts 24:15:

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:55.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I have hope toward God,

00:06:55.027 --> 00:06:59.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which hope these men also look forward to,

00:06:59.323 --> 00:07:03.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there is going to be a resurrection

00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”

00:07:08.707 --> 00:07:10.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you notice, it’s guaranteed.

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is going to happen
—not maybe or a good possibility.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to happen!

00:07:15.923 --> 00:07:18.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to include

00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:21.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the righteous and the unrighteous.”

00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:23.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s a question:

00:07:23.264 --> 00:07:26.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why will the righteous
who are resurrected

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need further education?

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:32.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even though
they’re already servants of God,

00:07:32.732 --> 00:07:35.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will need to learn details

00:07:35.568 --> 00:07:38.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning fulfilled prophecies,

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:42.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the outworking of God’s purposes,

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that have happened since they died.

00:07:44.994 --> 00:07:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to be
brought up to speed, so to speak.

00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:51.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how much they’ll need to be taught

00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:56.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will depend largely upon
how long ago they died.

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:01.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will also need help
to continue in their righteous course

00:08:01.094 --> 00:08:05.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to obey the things
written in the scrolls.

00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 20:12 talks
about these new scrolls.

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “I saw the dead,
the great and the small,

00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“standing before the throne,
and scrolls were opened. . . .

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:21.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dead were judged
out of those things written

00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:25.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the scrolls according to their deeds.”

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:27.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> said this
about those new scrolls.

00:08:27.955 --> 00:08:32.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “These scrolls
will most likely set forth

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s requirements
for mankind at that time.

00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:41.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By studying these, all people,
including resurrected ones,

00:08:41.468 --> 00:08:44.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to know God’s will for them.

00:08:44.972 --> 00:08:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These scrolls will surely give us

00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:52.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
further insight into Jehovah’s mind.”

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:55.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s exciting, indeed, to ponder, isn’t it?

00:08:55.983 --> 00:09:00.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Included among the righteous
to be resurrected

00:09:00.154 --> 00:09:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be faithful ones

00:09:02.698 --> 00:09:06.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be brought back
to serve as “princes.”

00:09:06.953 --> 00:09:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 45:16 says that Jesus

00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will appoint “princes in all the earth.”

00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> pointed out
that one example would be Daniel.

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:23.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what Jehovah
promised him shortly before he died?

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:28.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “You will rest,
but you will stand up

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.”

00:09:31.853 --> 00:09:35.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he’s rested
in the grave for some 2,500 years,

00:09:35.857 --> 00:09:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will “stand up” in the resurrection.

00:09:38.568 --> 00:09:42.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’ll take his position
as one of these princes,

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:44.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as pointed out in <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:47.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, Daniel and others like him

00:09:47.953 --> 00:09:50.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be brought up to speed

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—updated, trained for their assignments.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:56.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, many of the princes will be selected

00:09:56.962 --> 00:10:01.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the faithful elders
who are taking the lead today,

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:04.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as pointed out by <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:08.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, Jesus, the Messianic King,
will make the appointments.

00:10:08.515 --> 00:10:10.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we know?

00:10:10.517 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be good appointments.

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:16.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be princes
who will truly love the people

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:20.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faithfully carry out all the directions

00:10:20.528 --> 00:10:22.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the heavenly government.

00:10:22.697 --> 00:10:27.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also included among “the righteous”
to be resurrected

00:10:27.118 --> 00:10:29.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be many of our loved ones

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may have thought they would live
to see the end of this system,

00:10:33.332 --> 00:10:36.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they died in the last days.

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what a joy it will be
for you brothers and sisters

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:43.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to welcome these ones back and teach them

00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:48.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all the things
that have happened since they died!

00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:50.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to be brought up-to-date

00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:53.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can help
in this great disciple-making work.

00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:56.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example: I think of my mother.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1938.

00:11:00.902 --> 00:11:05.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She died in 2012,
a little over eight years ago.

00:11:05.156 --> 00:11:08.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really wanted to see
the end of this system.

00:11:08.577 --> 00:11:12.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she was
of that “Judge Rutherford generation.”

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:15.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really wanted to see
that “prostitute” destroyed,

00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:18.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but cancer prevented that from happening.

00:11:18.712 --> 00:11:21.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
shortly before she died, I said:

00:11:21.006 --> 00:11:25.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, I know you wanted
to go into the new world

00:11:25.052 --> 00:11:30.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the overland passageway
(never die at all).

00:11:30.015 --> 00:11:33.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you’re going to have
to take the underground tunnel.

00:11:33.227 --> 00:11:35.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the main thing is to get there.

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:37.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you’re going to
very shortly close your eyes,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the next thing you’re going to see,

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:42.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to open your eyes
in that new world.”

00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:44.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when she comes back,

00:11:44.864 --> 00:11:49.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just think of the things that have happened
in the eight years that she’s been gone.

00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:52.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll have to be
brought up to speed, won’t she?

00:11:52.038 --> 00:11:56.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is JW Broadcasting®

00:11:56.542 --> 00:12:01.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:12:01.297 --> 00:12:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She doesn’t even know about the broadcast!

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll have to be brought up to speed,
but she’ll be so happy

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:11.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn about this and other developments.

00:12:11.557 --> 00:12:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s a question:

00:12:13.643 --> 00:12:18.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where will the billions
of new disciples come from?

00:12:18.064 --> 00:12:21.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the resurrected righteous ones

00:12:21.735 --> 00:12:24.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be educated,

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re already disciples, aren’t they?

00:12:26.906 --> 00:12:29.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where will the new disciples come from?

00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, ones born after Armageddon

00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:35.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be made disciples.

00:12:35.707 --> 00:12:39.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there will be a vast multitude

00:12:39.044 --> 00:12:43.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of unrighteous ones
who will return from the Grave.

00:12:43.423 --> 00:12:47.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they’ll come
from all different backgrounds.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll come back,
and they’ll need to be taught.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need help to accept Christ’s ransom,

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:59.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the things
that are written in the new scrolls,

00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:01.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because most of them will know nothing.

00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:03.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe some studied a while,

00:13:03.902 --> 00:13:06.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but death prevented them from continuing.

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most will know nothing
—completely unaware about the good news.

00:13:11.702 --> 00:13:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we said, they’ll come
from all time periods, locations, cultures.

00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:19.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may have been rulers, maybe slaves,

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:23.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe criminals,
maybe self-righteous persons,

00:13:23.756 --> 00:13:26.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe ones who died in combat,

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died in childbirth,

00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died of disease
(perhaps the coronavirus),

00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:36.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died by starvation, natural disaster.

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seems that the last thought
on their mind when they died

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be the first thought
when they come back.

00:13:43.818 --> 00:13:46.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking about the men who threw

00:13:46.321 --> 00:13:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace,

00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:51.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they died because of the heat.

00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll come back
with a vivid memory of that situation,

00:13:56.206 --> 00:14:01.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they’ll have to be taught
what happened after they died

00:14:01.127 --> 00:14:05.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how those three Hebrews
came out unharmed.

00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:10.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine all these backgrounds
of ones coming back.

00:14:10.762 --> 00:14:13.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine situations that could develop.

00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:15.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is just an example.

00:14:15.517 --> 00:14:18.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a former ruler

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:21.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had hundreds,
maybe thousands, of slaves

00:14:21.607 --> 00:14:24.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who catered to his every desire.

00:14:24.193 --> 00:14:26.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he comes back in the resurrection,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his overseer is one of his former slaves.

00:14:30.532 --> 00:14:35.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he tells him, gives him direction
(loving direction, but direction)

00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:38.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to plant a tree in a certain location.

00:14:38.874 --> 00:14:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, will he humble himself?

00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:44.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting, interesting possibilities.

00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:46.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the atheists
who will be resurrected.

00:14:46.757 --> 00:14:51.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here they ate Jehovah’s food,
they drank his water,

00:14:51.012 --> 00:14:53.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they breathed his air,
they walked on his ground,

00:14:53.806 --> 00:14:56.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they never gave him any credit,

00:14:56.642 --> 00:14:58.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they never acknowledged him at all.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us think of the illustration
of the pig under the apple tree.

00:15:02.815 --> 00:15:05.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gobbles up the apples off the ground,

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:09.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he never looks up to see
where they came from.

00:15:09.113 --> 00:15:11.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may not use that illustration

00:15:11.366 --> 00:15:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these atheists that come back,

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:19.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they will have to be helped to see
what a selfish life they lived.

00:15:19.416 --> 00:15:22.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re
going to have to praise Jehovah,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
acknowledge him, give him honor,
glory, and worship.

00:15:27.007 --> 00:15:29.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they do so?

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:30.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it will be up to them.

00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:34.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones.

00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:38.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s just ponder

00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:42.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of these ones that will come back
by means of some artwork.

00:15:42.189 --> 00:15:45.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, look at the following artwork, please.

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:47.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to show you people

00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:50.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different time periods,
different backgrounds,

00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:55.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being taught after they’re resurrected.

00:15:55.202 --> 00:15:57.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the artwork displays,

00:15:57.496 --> 00:16:00.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to imagine yourself teaching ones

00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:02.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these various backgrounds.

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:44.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers and sisters, that artwork

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just a little, tiny sampling

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:51.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones from various
time periods and backgrounds

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:54.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will return to the land of the living.

00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we mentioned,

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will empower Jesus

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:03.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resurrect all of these ones

00:18:03.374 --> 00:18:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(bringing them back from the memorial tombs)

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:10.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will ‘hear his voice,
and they will come out.’

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know it’ll be
in a controlled, orderly way.

00:18:13.885 --> 00:18:18.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah “is a God
not of disorder but of peace.”

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 14:33.

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also wants things
to “take place decently and by arrangement.”

00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 14:40.

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if they all came back at once,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
a chaotic population explosion, wouldn’t it?

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:38.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t even be taught properly.

00:18:38.702 --> 00:18:40.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t be cared for.

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it will be progressive
during the thousand years.

00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:47.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> said this:

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faithful Christians who died
shortly before the end of Satan’s system

00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:55.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will likely be among the first ones raised.

00:18:55.886 --> 00:19:00.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We can also expect an early resurrection

00:19:00.099 --> 00:19:05.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the faithful men of old
who will serve as ‘princes.’”

00:19:05.104 --> 00:19:08.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We touched on that previously.

00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:12.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, resurrected ones
will have much to learn,

00:19:12.945 --> 00:19:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you dear brothers and sisters

00:19:16.032 --> 00:19:18.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have the privilege to help them.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to learn
about Jehovah, his qualities,

00:19:21.746 --> 00:19:24.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the wonderful things he’s done.

00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:28.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many will need
to reject false religious ideas

00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:31.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they believed in Satan’s world.

00:19:31.798 --> 00:19:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s just an example:

00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:36.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine one who really believed

00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:39.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all good people go to heaven.

00:19:39.764 --> 00:19:43.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now he’s resurrected,
and he’s brought back here to the earth.

00:19:43.977 --> 00:19:46.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, he’ll know
that teaching was wrong.

00:19:46.855 --> 00:19:50.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about other false teachings
that he believed?

00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:52.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he change his mind and heart?

00:19:52.652 --> 00:19:55.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he accept these truths?

00:19:55.113 --> 00:19:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be up to him.

00:19:57.115 --> 00:20:00.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones.

00:20:00.494 --> 00:20:03.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’ll be many others
who will come back

00:20:03.372 --> 00:20:06.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will have to abandon
their former way of life.

00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:10.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking, as an example, a homosexual.

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:14.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this former homosexual
comes back in the resurrection,

00:20:14.174 --> 00:20:16.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he really thought

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:19.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and he was taught, and he came to believe—

00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:23.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God accepted him with that lifestyle.

00:20:23.183 --> 00:20:27.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now he’s going to learn
about Jehovah’s moral standards.

00:20:27.104 --> 00:20:29.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to learn

00:20:29.106 --> 00:20:32.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will not lower his standard
to accommodate us.

00:20:32.735 --> 00:20:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to come up to Jehovah’s standard.

00:20:35.738 --> 00:20:38.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he change?
Will he adjust?

00:20:38.616 --> 00:20:40.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be up to him.

00:20:40.618 --> 00:20:43.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones

00:20:43.871 --> 00:20:46.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy life eternal.

00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:51.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All must learn to walk
in Jehovah’s righteous ways

00:20:51.546 --> 00:20:54.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and willingly choose to do so.

00:20:54.882 --> 00:20:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what if someone
refuses to make the necessary changes?

00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:01.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i> commented on that.

00:21:01.431 --> 00:21:04.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “After being given ample time,

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:09.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“maybe even ‘a hundred years,’ to seek God,

00:21:09.272 --> 00:21:13.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some will show that they refuse
to practice righteousness.

00:21:13.777 --> 00:21:18.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Justly they will lose life
in that new world,

00:21:18.198 --> 00:21:23.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we can see from Isaiah 65:20,” which says:

00:21:23.203 --> 00:21:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the sinner will be cursed,

00:21:26.665 --> 00:21:31.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he is a hundred years of age.”

00:21:31.003 --> 00:21:34.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we expect this will be the minority,

00:21:34.381 --> 00:21:37.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the majority will be delighted
to make the adjustments

00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:41.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can live
in that wonderful new world.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think about what one brother told me

00:21:44.349 --> 00:21:46.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning his Bible student.

00:21:46.727 --> 00:21:50.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Bible student kept saying:
“Well, how do I know

00:21:50.314 --> 00:21:53.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m going to like life in the new world?

00:21:53.317 --> 00:21:55.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do I know I’m not going to be bored?”

00:21:55.528 --> 00:21:58.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, finally, the brother told him, he said,

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, one thing about it:

00:22:00.241 --> 00:22:04.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t like being there,
you don’t have to stay.”

00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:08.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was kind of humorous,
but it’s a lot of truth.

00:22:08.249 --> 00:22:13.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person has to willingly want to be there
and make the necessary changes.

00:22:13.254 --> 00:22:16.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we believe the vast majority

00:22:16.716 --> 00:22:19.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be delighted to do so.

00:22:19.635 --> 00:22:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a privilege it will be

00:22:22.138 --> 00:22:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach ones
in that new world at a time

00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Isaiah 11:9
will be true, which says:

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:33.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah

00:22:33.733 --> 00:22:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the waters [are] cover[ing] the sea.”

00:22:37.654 --> 00:22:39.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This earth—71 percent
of its surface is covered with water.

00:22:44.327 --> 00:22:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you smooth all the land out,

00:22:47.497 --> 00:22:50.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sea water would cover planet Earth

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:53.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one and two thirds miles deep.

00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:56.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a watery planet, isn’t it?

00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that illustration there in Isaiah
just shows how prolific

00:23:01.094 --> 00:23:04.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how widespread, how filled—
the earth will be

00:23:04.097 --> 00:23:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the knowledge of Jehovah” at that time.

00:23:07.184 --> 00:23:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that wonderful knowledge
will enable faithful humans

00:23:11.897 --> 00:23:16.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grow to perfection
and to sufficiently be equipped

00:23:16.902 --> 00:23:21.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face and pass the final test

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:24.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the thousand years.

00:23:24.702 --> 00:23:27.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good things
that you dear brothers and sisters

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have learned today
in the second day of our program

00:23:30.583 --> 00:23:34.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what you’ve learned today
about helping your Bible students now—

00:23:34.337 --> 00:23:36.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you in the new world.

00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:39.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you learned, you learned how to teach

00:23:39.717 --> 00:23:43.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your Bible students
to feed themselves spiritually,

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:47.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the meetings,
to avoid bad associations,

00:23:47.725 --> 00:23:50.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome unclean habits,

00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop a personal relationship
with Jehovah.

00:23:55.024 --> 00:23:59.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those very same things
you will need to teach these new ones

00:23:59.654 --> 00:24:02.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come back in the resurrection.

00:24:02.824 --> 00:24:07.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, at this time, let’s review
some of the good things

00:24:07.495 --> 00:24:10.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have learned today
about disciple-making.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s meditate on how these skills
will help in the new world.

00:24:15.712 --> 00:24:18.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, look at this video, please

00:24:18.507 --> 00:24:22.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a brief video that gives us some highlights

00:24:22.386 --> 00:24:25.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our first symposium,

00:24:25.013 --> 00:24:29.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was entitled “Improve Your Skills.”

00:24:33.063 --> 00:24:37.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there’s no death or pain in heaven,
where would this promise apply?

00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:39.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth.

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to learn
how to be part of that future?

00:24:43.157 --> 00:24:46.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If these are God’s promises,
wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word

00:24:46.493 --> 00:24:48.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out how to enjoy them?

00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:49.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can think of it this way.

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:54.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When parents with a severe genetic defect
have children, what happens?

00:24:54.084 --> 00:24:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get it!

00:24:55.878 --> 00:24:57.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No study is perfect.

00:24:57.254 --> 00:25:00.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making some effort; focus on that.

00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:04.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone’s enthusiasm
is contagious, it’s yours.

00:25:06.055 --> 00:25:08.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can help, if you want.

00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:11.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real question is, Do you trust him?

00:25:11.853 --> 00:25:15.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to; I really do.

00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:23.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw in that video,

00:25:23.114 --> 00:25:26.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to improve our skills.

00:25:26.618 --> 00:25:30.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the symposium, we saw six areas

00:25:30.371 --> 00:25:32.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can improve our skills.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each one of the six videos

00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:37.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that symposium
discussed one of those skills.

00:25:37.504 --> 00:25:42.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, Neeta, in the first video
(the Bible study conductor),

00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:47.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used questions to help the interested person

00:25:47.514 --> 00:25:50.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see the practical value of the Bible.

00:25:50.976 --> 00:25:54.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second video, the next time they met,

00:25:54.354 --> 00:25:58.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta unleashed the power of God’s Word

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing her student scriptures

00:26:01.653 --> 00:26:04.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highlight our spiritual need.

00:26:04.907 --> 00:26:07.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third video,

00:26:07.034 --> 00:26:10.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta illustrated Adamic sin

00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by likening it to inherited illness.

00:26:15.125 --> 00:26:17.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fourth video,

00:26:17.127 --> 00:26:19.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when her Bible student
seemed to be losing interest,

00:26:19.338 --> 00:26:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta learned the importance

00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:25.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of enthusiasm to motivate.

00:26:25.386 --> 00:26:29.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fifth video,
Neeta showed empathy

00:26:29.765 --> 00:26:32.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her student’s stressful circumstances

00:26:32.935 --> 00:26:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provided practical help.

00:26:35.438 --> 00:26:38.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, in the last (the sixth) video,

00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:42.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta’s conviction and Scriptural reasoning

00:26:42.695 --> 00:26:46.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped to reach her student’s heart

00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she reconsidered her situation

00:26:50.203 --> 00:26:53.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her views on morals.

00:26:53.373 --> 00:26:58.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you just imagine how you’ll use
those six skills in the new world?

00:26:58.002 --> 00:26:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll use questions, won’t you?

00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:04.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll use questions to help resurrected ones

00:27:04.384 --> 00:27:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see the practical value
of the Bible and the new scrolls.

00:27:08.388 --> 00:27:11.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, by the way,
the Bible will be used in the new world.

00:27:11.975 --> 00:27:15.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will unleash the power of God’s Word

00:27:15.937 --> 00:27:20.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power of the scrolls
by showing these new ones scriptures.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will use good illustrations
to help them reason.

00:27:24.696 --> 00:27:28.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will use enthusiasm to motivate.

00:27:28.742 --> 00:27:30.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will show empathy,

00:27:30.953 --> 00:27:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for ones who have scars

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:39.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of a horrible life
in Satan’s old world.

00:27:39.211 --> 00:27:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will also use conviction

00:27:42.298 --> 00:27:47.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Scriptural reasoning
to reach their heart.

00:27:47.303 --> 00:27:50.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s move to our second symposium,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was entitled “Accept Jehovah’s Help.”

00:27:54.435 --> 00:27:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed three aids
that Jehovah gives us.

00:27:57.647 --> 00:28:02.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at this brief video
that will remind us of that second symposium.

00:28:04.695 --> 00:28:08.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

00:28:08.908 --> 00:28:10.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did some research, 
and I think you’ll really like what I found.

00:28:14.831 --> 00:28:16.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:21.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting.

00:28:21.379 --> 00:28:23.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

00:28:25.008 --> 00:28:26.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

00:28:26.134 --> 00:28:27.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So sweet.”

00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:28.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

00:28:28.303 --> 00:28:29.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

00:28:29.888 --> 00:28:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I know you’re busy.

00:28:32.682 --> 00:28:34.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

00:28:34.142 --> 00:28:35.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to go.

00:28:37.062 --> 00:28:39.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade

00:28:39.314 --> 00:28:41.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then left it with him.

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:48.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as reminded in that video,

00:28:48.532 --> 00:28:51.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides research tools,

00:28:51.702 --> 00:28:54.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provides the brotherhood,

00:28:54.538 --> 00:28:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he provides help by means of prayer.

00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll use those things
in the new world, obviously.

00:29:02.004 --> 00:29:05.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like Neeta, she used research tools

00:29:05.424 --> 00:29:09.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare to discuss evolution
with her student.

00:29:09.929 --> 00:29:12.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she realized
she had a limited understanding

00:29:12.473 --> 00:29:14.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the student’s background,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she sought help from the brotherhood.

00:29:17.019 --> 00:29:19.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She brought along a publisher

00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a similar background to her student.

00:29:22.525 --> 00:29:26.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that third video,
when her student resisted

00:29:26.654 --> 00:29:30.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta’s encouragement
to prepare for her Bible study,

00:29:30.408 --> 00:29:33.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta prayed to Jehovah

00:29:33.578 --> 00:29:36.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her and to motivate the student.

00:29:36.914 --> 00:29:39.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know Jehovah hears prayers.

00:29:39.792 --> 00:29:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But imagine:
You’ll use research tools,

00:29:42.378 --> 00:29:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll use the brotherhood,

00:29:44.547 --> 00:29:48.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll use prayer
to make disciples in the new world.

00:29:48.593 --> 00:29:51.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to that third symposium:

00:29:51.846 --> 00:29:55.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students to . . .”

00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:58.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we talked about five things
we want to help them to do.

00:29:58.853 --> 00:30:01.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at this video,

00:30:01.064 --> 00:30:04.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will remind us of that third symposium.

00:30:06.444 --> 00:30:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you remember more from our studies,

00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers or the things
that touch your heart?

00:30:12.617 --> 00:30:14.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

00:30:14.161 --> 00:30:17.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah feels about something

00:30:17.914 --> 00:30:20.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking what that means for me.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:23.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

00:30:24.796 --> 00:30:27.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m having some people over this weekend.

00:30:27.382 --> 00:30:31.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t the club, but it was still fun.

00:30:31.929 --> 00:30:34.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it felt impossible.

00:30:34.848 --> 00:30:38.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be made new
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:30:38.477 --> 00:30:41.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remembered one of the Psalms:
“I will walk in your truth.

00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:44.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart to fear your name.”

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:52.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as reminded, there are five things

00:30:52.366 --> 00:30:55.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help our students to accomplish.

00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:59.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that first video in the symposium,
Neeta helped her student learn

00:30:59.957 --> 00:31:04.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed herself spiritually by demonstrating

00:31:04.754 --> 00:31:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how she herself prepared for their study.

00:31:07.924 --> 00:31:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second video,

00:31:09.926 --> 00:31:12.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta returned to the subject
of meeting attendance

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:15.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by pointing out that the next meeting

00:31:15.682 --> 00:31:20.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would consider a question
she had raised previously.

00:31:20.061 --> 00:31:22.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third video,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta helped her student
to seek good association

00:31:26.735 --> 00:31:30.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by arranging for her
to attend a Christian gathering.

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:33.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in the fourth video,

00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:37.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it became clear that the student
was not ready to be a publisher

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of an unclean practice,

00:31:39.748 --> 00:31:44.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta gently helped her
to appreciate what it means

00:31:44.753 --> 00:31:49.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become and remain clean in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:53.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the last video, that fifth one

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—most important—

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:57.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta helped her student

00:31:57.141 --> 00:32:00.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop strong love for Jehovah

00:32:00.352 --> 00:32:02.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be so strong

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:06.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would be able
to resist pressure from the world.

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:10.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can imagine
that you’ll use the very same skills.

00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:13.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll try to help your students there

00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:16.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish the same
five things we discussed.

00:32:16.952 --> 00:32:19.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to learn
to feed themselves spiritually.

00:32:19.914 --> 00:32:22.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to attend meetings.

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:26.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to see the need
to seek out good association,

00:32:26.254 --> 00:32:29.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid unclean practices

00:32:29.423 --> 00:32:32.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,

00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:35.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop deep love for Jehovah.

00:32:35.888 --> 00:32:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s obvious

00:32:38.016 --> 00:32:42.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our skills, our experience,

00:32:42.478 --> 00:32:46.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our qualities learned now
in the disciple-making work

00:32:46.774 --> 00:32:50.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be very valuable in the new world.

00:32:50.445 --> 00:32:54.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be able to put these skills
to good use then.

00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s all strive to improve as teachers.

00:32:59.162 --> 00:33:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Titus 1:9 says,

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should
“[hold] firmly to the faithful word

00:33:06.253 --> 00:33:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as respects [our] art of teaching.”

00:33:09.798 --> 00:33:13.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to be artists
—the “art of teaching.”

00:33:13.176 --> 00:33:15.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have heard
the difference between a laborer,

00:33:15.929 --> 00:33:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a craftsman, and an artist.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A laborer uses his back;
a craftsman has to add his mind;

00:33:23.228 --> 00:33:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but an artist adds his heart.

00:33:26.398 --> 00:33:30.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to be
just laborers or craftsmen, but artists

00:33:30.069 --> 00:33:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really putting our heart
into the disciple-making work.

00:33:33.822 --> 00:33:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it does take effort.

00:33:35.824 --> 00:33:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at one last scripture
here in 1 Timothy chapter 4

00:33:39.662 --> 00:33:43.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the effort involved—
and it’s worth the effort.

00:33:43.249 --> 00:33:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 4:15:

00:33:46.377 --> 00:33:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ponder over these things;
be absorbed in them,

00:33:51.382 --> 00:33:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your advancement

00:33:53.801 --> 00:33:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“may be plainly seen by all people.

00:33:56.804 --> 00:34:00.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay constant attention
to yourself and to your teaching.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Persevere in these things, for by doing this

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:10.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

00:34:10.318 --> 00:34:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true now;
it will be true in the new world.

And Jehovah is providing what we need

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:22.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he’s giving us excellent training;
he provides excellent tools.

00:34:22.497 --> 00:34:26.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to make good use
of both of these provisions.

00:34:26.585 --> 00:34:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do want to give this caution:

00:34:29.004 --> 00:34:31.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be overwhelmed, please.

00:34:31.006 --> 00:34:33.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve discussed a lot of skills,

00:34:33.008 --> 00:34:35.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of suggestions,
but don’t be overwhelmed.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to help you.

00:34:38.055 --> 00:34:40.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will bless your efforts to do your best.

00:34:40.557 --> 00:34:42.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we encourage you to just pick out

00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:46.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one or two skills at first and work on those.

00:34:46.438 --> 00:34:49.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you can move on to other things.

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:52.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In conclusion, think about this:

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many secular skills practiced today

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will not even exist in the new world.

00:35:00.703 --> 00:35:05.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doctors (no doctors), nurses, optometrists,

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:09.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undertakers, locksmiths, lawyers

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such professions will not even exist.

00:35:13.507 --> 00:35:17.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your skills as a disciple-maker

00:35:17.678 --> 00:35:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be in high demand.

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:24.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be able
to use these skills to the full,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:29.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will definitely rejoice greatly

00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:33.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

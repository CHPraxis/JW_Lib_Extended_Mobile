00:00:06 It was a struggle even to get water.
00:00:09 And the specialist gave us the diagnosis
00:00:11 of a very aggressive brain tumor.
00:00:14 My negative disposition
00:00:17 made me a very impatient, sarcastic, and demanding person.
00:00:21 The fact that I was not appointed as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:00:28 fulfilling all his promises.
00:00:31 And so I’m happy to endure.
00:00:34 And when everything around you is chaotic,
00:00:38 the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.
00:00:43 Regaining joy is a work in progress.

00:00:55 It’s not hard for him to care
00:00:57 for just one small human like me.

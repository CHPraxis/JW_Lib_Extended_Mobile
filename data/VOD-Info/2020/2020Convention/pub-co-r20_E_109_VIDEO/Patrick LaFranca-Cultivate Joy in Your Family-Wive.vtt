00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christian wives, are you happy?

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you love being a wife?

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably right now
you’re looking at your husband

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:11.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying, “Of course.”

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s good.

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could you add
even more joy to your marriage?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking,

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Yes, if only my husband would . . .’

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:26.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you finish the sentence.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think most husbands would admit

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:31.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have
some room for improvement.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this talk is for you.

00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:38.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you do as a wife
to add joy to your marriage?

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the first things is

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think about your God-assigned role.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:49.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, to Genesis 2:18.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:56.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Jehovah is going to explain

00:00:56.163 --> 00:01:00.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was making a wife for Adam:

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah God said:

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:06.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is not good for the man
to continue to be alone.

00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am going to make a helper for him,

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:12.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a complement of him.’”

00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:17.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Eve was going to be a helper

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:21.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a complement of Adam.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is a complement?

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we feel sure that you sisters

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know a lot about complementary colors.

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:34.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you go to pick out
an outfit with accessories,

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:39.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pick those with colors
that blend well together,

00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are a harmonious combination.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when you’re making a meal,

00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:50.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know there are certain foods
that go well with other foods,

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:52.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or complement, other foods,

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a Korean sister making kimchi

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably will make rice.

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:02.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or pasta with cheese,

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:04.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bacon and eggs, bread and butter

00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:08.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there are so many combinations
that complement one another.

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jehovah God created Eve,

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:15.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he built into her feminine qualities

00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:18.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he knew would really work well

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Adam’s masculine qualities.

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:26.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Adam and Eve had a prospect

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:31.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being a perfectly matched couple

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:33.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could work well together.

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:38.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eve could be fully happy
in working with her husband 

00:02:38.353 --> 00:02:42.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring for that garden
—the beautiful home God gave her.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:48.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, we know
that didn’t happen because of sin,

00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and along with sin, came stress.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are,
descendants of Adam and Eve.

00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:58.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’ve got too
—sin and stress.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah helps us, doesn’t he?

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he gives us principles
that can help us make a happy marriage.

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:09.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Ecclesiastes.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describe what a partnership
should be like.

00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wives, do you think of yourself
as your husband’s partner?

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:25.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read verse 9:

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Two are better than one
because they have

00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:30.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good reward for their hard work.”

00:03:30.783 --> 00:03:33.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So your husband has made a decision,

00:03:33.578 --> 00:03:36.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe you think,

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:39.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t know if that’s the best decision.’

00:03:39.793 --> 00:03:42.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re his partner.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how will you help him?

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’re going to support
that decision;

00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to try to make it work.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will be your reward?

00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all, you’re
going to accomplish so much more

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:00.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working together
than you could individually.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,
you’re going to strengthen your friendship

00:04:05.153 --> 00:04:08.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your partnership with your husband.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 10, it adds:

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:15.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if one of them falls,
the other can help his partner up.

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:18.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But what will happen to the one who falls

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no one to help him up?”

00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:24.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking,
‘Well, my husband is a strong man,’

00:04:24.256 --> 00:04:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably so.

00:04:26.258 --> 00:04:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But inside,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may be struggling
with serious insecurities.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, he may feel like a failure.

00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:37.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s lost his job

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feels like he’s not a good provider.

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:42.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re his partner.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:45.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you going to do to lift him up?

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:48.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably, you’re going to share with him

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:52.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some tactful words
of comfort and encouragement.

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll be a happy place.

00:04:55.622 --> 00:05:00.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Proverbs
contains much wisdom,

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:02.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of it is directed to wives.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:06.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Proverbs 14:1:

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:11.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The truly wise woman
builds up her house,

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the foolish one
tears it down with her own hands.”

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you are wise,
you will build up, or increase,

00:05:20.857 --> 00:05:25.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
respect for your husband
on the part of your children and of others.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to be foolish
by speaking negatively

00:05:31.493 --> 00:05:35.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—talking about
your husband’s deficiencies or failures;

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:39.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor would you want to undermine
his own confidence

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:43.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by nagging or arguing with him.

00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do so much
to contribute to a happy house.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:50.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at mealtimes,

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:54.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share in the conversation by adding,

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:57.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps, a spiritual gem
you found in your Bible reading

00:05:57.562 --> 00:06:00.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a nice experience
or even a humorous story

00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:04.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that will lift
the spirits of the whole family.

00:06:06.363 --> 00:06:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we want to go
to Proverbs chapter 31,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably right away you recognize

00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:18.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is the chapter
that describes a capable wife.

00:06:20.044 --> 00:06:22.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think all of you wives
want to be that.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to be that “Proverbs 31” wife.

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:27.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you read those verses,

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you realize that this woman is very busy.

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:34.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s out there
buying household supplies,

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for the health
and welfare of her family,

00:06:38.063 --> 00:06:42.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping others in need,
spending money wisely

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—diligently caring for all the duties

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a wife, mother, friend, and neighbor.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think many of you wives
are doing all of those things.

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:57.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you do it day in and day out,
and you don’t complain.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re happy
—happy because you’re giving.

00:07:02.798 --> 00:07:05.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you’re even happier

00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when this happens in verse 28:

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her children rise up
and declare her happy;

00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:17.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her husband rises up and praises her.”

00:07:17.063 --> 00:07:20.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they do appreciate what you do.

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:23.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they may not express it,
but they do appreciate it.

00:07:23.987 --> 00:07:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is another element
to a very happy marriage,

00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:31.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s expressed in verse 11:

00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:34.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her husband trusts her from his heart,

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:37.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he lacks nothing of value.”

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust is so important in a marriage.

00:07:43.966 --> 00:07:46.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wife must trust her husband,

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:49.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a husband must trust his wife.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to have conversations;

00:07:52.225 --> 00:07:56.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to express
your innermost feelings and thoughts.

00:07:56.604 --> 00:08:01.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must not have fear that
that’s going to be shared with others

00:08:01.568 --> 00:08:05.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that you’ll be belittled in some way.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s trust

00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:11.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a very important aspect of marriage.

00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you wives, build up your friendship,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your confidence with your husband.

00:08:17.668 --> 00:08:19.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 12, it adds:

00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She rewards him with good, not bad,

00:08:23.299 --> 00:08:26.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the days of her life.”

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wives, reward your husband with good

00:08:30.807 --> 00:08:34.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—support him on what he has to do—

00:08:34.227 --> 00:08:37.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know that he
will love you all the more.

00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:39.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “all the days of [your] life.”

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:41.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “all the days of [your] life,”

00:08:41.193 --> 00:08:43.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build up that friendship with your husband

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether he is a believer or not.

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:50.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to say in behalf
of the thousands

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:54.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of hardworking elders
and ministerial servants,

00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:57.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without your faithful support,

00:08:57.668 --> 00:09:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be much more challenging
to care for our responsibilities.

00:09:02.674 --> 00:09:07.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you very much,
dear wives, for what you’re doing.

00:09:08.471 --> 00:09:13.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes you feel obliged
to speak your mind,

00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:17.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a trusting relationship,
that’s expected.

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:19.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will you speak your mind?

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:22.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 26:

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:25.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She opens her mouth in wisdom;

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:29.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the law of kindness is on her tongue.”

00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:33.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So yes, you have
something worthwhile to say,

00:09:33.206 --> 00:09:36.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how you say it is very, very important.

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:41.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the law of kindness
govern your tongue?

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:44.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you say it in kindness,

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:47.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your husband will love you all the more.

00:09:49.473 --> 00:09:52.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s read verse 30:

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:56.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Charm may be false,
and beauty may be fleeting,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the woman
who fears Jehovah will be praised.”

00:10:01.569 --> 00:10:06.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, above all,
a capable wife who fears Jehovah

00:10:06.532 --> 00:10:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is highly valued and is to be praised.

00:10:10.453 --> 00:10:13.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you dear wives who fear Jehovah,

00:10:13.123 --> 00:10:15.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you worship him with awe and respect.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:18.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s so important
because that helps you

00:10:18.837 --> 00:10:22.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to easily be in subjection to your husband

00:10:22.549 --> 00:10:27.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know
that this pleases your heavenly Father.

00:10:29.014 --> 00:10:32.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you watch
the following dramatization,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the wife
rejoices in her husband.

00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:44.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so tired after work

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but glad to finally get home, until . . .

00:10:53.749 --> 00:10:55.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re home, Honey.

00:11:03.384 --> 00:11:06.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew he had congregation stuff
to work on,

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:08.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but seriously?

00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:11:11.017 --> 00:11:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed
to talk to the girls about this.

00:11:14.103 --> 00:11:15.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:11:19.776 --> 00:11:23.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it upset me
that he didn’t say anything,

00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:27.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I began to think.

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:34.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually something I’ve come to love
about John—his patience.

00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t overreact.

00:11:47.638 --> 00:11:50.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s thoughtful, concerned.

00:11:54.354 --> 00:11:56.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He really listens.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s why he’s such a good elder

00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:12.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why we’ve enjoyed
so many blessings together.

00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I forget,

00:12:30.392 --> 00:12:33.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could be more patient.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:12:39.568 --> 00:12:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:45.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls as soon
as they come through that door.

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:49.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the wife
rejoiced in her husband?

00:12:56.586 --> 00:13:00.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when she walked
into that kitchen, she saw the mess;

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wasn’t rejoicing.

00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:06.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she wanted to say something
to her husband, and she did.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:08.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did she say it?

00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:10.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did she yell at him?

00:13:10.183 --> 00:13:11.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:13.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made her point.

00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:15.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the husband react?

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:17.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t overreact.

00:13:17.816 --> 00:13:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let her think about it,
and he thought about it.

00:13:21.237 --> 00:13:23.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as she thought about it,

00:13:23.239 --> 00:13:26.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she thought:
‘You know, he didn’t overreact.

00:13:26.659 --> 00:13:29.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s one of the things
I love about my husband.

00:13:29.662 --> 00:13:32.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is so patient.’

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course, he talked with her,

00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:36.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they resolved the issue.

00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:38.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So love triumphed

00:13:38.713 --> 00:13:43.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over any possible argument or anger.

00:13:43.093 --> 00:13:47.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue, dear wives,
to rely on Jehovah

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:51.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you work
to make your marriage a delight,

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:55.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will bless and help you.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:59.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:13:59.277 --> 00:14:03.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

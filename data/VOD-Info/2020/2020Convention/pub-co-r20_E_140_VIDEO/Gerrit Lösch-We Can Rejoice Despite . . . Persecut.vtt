Since the beginning of Christianity,
Christians have been persecuted.

Please locate with me
2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul experienced persecution

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:20.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and referred to it at 2 Corinthians

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:24.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 11, verses 23-25,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says: “Are they ministers of Christ?

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reply like a madman,

“suffered countless beatings,

“and experienced many near-deaths.

“three times I experienced shipwreck,

a night and a day
I have spent in the open sea.”

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:02.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after recounting
his many difficulties,

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 12, verse 10,

00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote:

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So I take pleasure in weaknesses,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in insults, in times of need,

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For when I am weak, then I am powerful.”

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:27.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Paul took no pleasure
in persecution itself,

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:30.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he rejoiced
because of what can result from it,

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contributing to Jehovah’s vindication.

00:01:35.287 --> 00:01:40.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Philippians 1:14

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:43.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then verse 18.

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persecution gives us also an opportunity

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see Jehovah act in behalf of his people

00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:52.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and magnify his name.

00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:55.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can lead to a fine witness.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:59.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Philippians 1:14, 18,

00:01:59.813 --> 00:02:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote:

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now most of the brothers in the Lord

“and they are showing all the more courage

00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak the word of God fearlessly.”

00:02:18.374 --> 00:02:21.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 18: “With what result?

“Only that in every way,

“Christ is being proclaimed,
and I rejoice over this.

00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:33.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing.”

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:39.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of weakening our relationship
with Jehovah and our hope,

00:02:39.646 --> 00:02:42.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution can strengthen it.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:49.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the discussion recorded at Romans 5:3, 4,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul explains:

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:54.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us [exult] while in tribulations . . . ;

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:58.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“endurance, [leads to],
an approved condition;

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:02.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the approved condition, in turn, [to] hope,

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:05.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:10.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no doubt that hope helps us <i>mightily</i>

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure persecution.

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:17.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible uses the word “hope”
in different contexts.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of the “hope of salvation,”

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:24.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can refer to spiritual salvation.

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:28.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is hope of surviving Armageddon.

00:03:28.323 --> 00:03:33.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s hope of everlasting life
on the Paradise earth.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:36.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s hope of immortality in heaven.

00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:43.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope was he talking
about at Romans 5:3, 4?

00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:46.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About the heavenly hope.

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:48.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the context;

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 5:2

00:03:50.888 --> 00:03:53.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the second part of the verse says:

00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us rejoice,
based on hope of the glory of God.”

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:05.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All Christians in the first century
had the heavenly hope.

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:09.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hope was not just that problems
or world conditions would be resolved

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:13.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they would get healed
from some sickness.

00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hope was the heavenly hope.

00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:18.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 1:3 says:

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We always thank God . . .
when we pray for you . . .  

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:25.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the hope that is being reserved

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:27.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you in the heavens.”

00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:31.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Romans

00:04:31.306 --> 00:04:35.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 8, verses 20 and 21.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “great crowd” of Jehovah’s Witnesses
today hope that Jehovah

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reward them in an earthly paradise.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul pointed to that hope when he wrote

00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 8:20, 21:

00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the creation was subjected to futility,

00:05:00.586 --> 00:05:04.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not by its own will,
but through the one who subjected it,

00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:06.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the basis of hope

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:11.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the creation itself
will also be set free

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:14.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from enslavement to corruption

00:05:14.184 --> 00:05:18.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the glorious freedom
of the children of God.”

00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when Paul said

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:25.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:12

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “rejoice in the hope” ahead,

00:05:28.157 --> 00:05:30.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he meant the heavenly hope.

00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:33.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the “other sheep”

00:05:33.246 --> 00:05:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also rejoice in the hope
that’s ahead of them.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:41.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, we can all rejoice triumphantly.

00:05:41.087 --> 00:05:45.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is dark;
your hope is bright.

00:05:45.217 --> 00:05:50.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is collapsing;
your hope nears fulfillment.

00:05:50.222 --> 00:05:54.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope is based on credulity;

00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:56.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your hope is based on faith.

00:05:56.812 --> 00:05:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s hope leads to disappointment;

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your hope leads to success.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For with the new world so very near,

00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:08.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fondest hopes,
whether heavenly or earthly,

00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:12.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be realized
to our eternal satisfaction.

00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:19.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Titus 2:13:

00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:30.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“While we wait for the happy hope

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:34.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and glorious manifestation of the great God

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:36.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of our Savior, Jesus Christ.”

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:43.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, according to Romans 8:24, 25,

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:47.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hope will help us to endure.

00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope that is seen is not hope, . . .

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but if we hope for what we do not see,

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:59.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we keep [on] waiting for it with endurance,”
the scripture says.

00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:02.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are degrees of hope.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:07.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen or deepen our hope?

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:09.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As to the term “hope”:

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:13.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the Bible,
the basic sense of the Greek term <i>el·pis</i><i>ʹ</i><i>,</i>

00:07:13.518 --> 00:07:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“used here, [means] ‘expectation of good.’

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In this context,
Paul mentions hope last in a series

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:26.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—after tribulation, endurance,

00:07:26.073 --> 00:07:28.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an approved condition.

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:32.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he is obviously
not referring to the initial hope

00:07:32.329 --> 00:07:35.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gained by accepting the good news from God.

00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:39.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, he is referring to a reinforced hope

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that a Christian can gain after enduring.

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When a Christian faithfully endures trials,

00:07:46.886 --> 00:07:50.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he realizes that he has God’s approval.

00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:54.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This realization
strengthens his initial hope.”

00:07:56.646 --> 00:08:01.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul,
we can rejoice despite persecution.

00:08:03.362 --> 00:08:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may encounter
hateful words and actions at school,

00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at work, in our family,

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:08:23.299 --> 00:08:25.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:08:27.596 --> 00:08:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you

00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:35.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and persecute you
and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

“against you for my sake.

00:08:37.648 --> 00:08:40.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:43.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since your reward is great in the heavens,

00:08:43.487 --> 00:08:47.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for in that way
they persecuted the prophets prior to you.”

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:52.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note which provisions

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:58.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped our brother and sister to rejoice

00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite persecution.

00:09:09.264 --> 00:09:12.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early one morning,
armed Russian special forces

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broke into my home.

00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:22.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They handcuffed me
and searched my place.

00:09:24.072 --> 00:09:27.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took me
to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two days later, the court sentenced
me to pretrial detention.

00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:38.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared because I didn’t know

00:09:38.712 --> 00:09:41.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would be treated in prison.

00:09:41.048 --> 00:09:43.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Threatening that things would
get worse for me, the officer demanded

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I incriminate myself, admit guilt,
and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:09:49.598 --> 00:09:51.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:09:51.642 --> 00:09:53.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so hard without her.

00:09:54.604 --> 00:09:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For two months, I didn’t have

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any spiritual food or a Bible,

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:01.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided to make one.

00:10:01.736 --> 00:10:03.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife sent me a notebook,

00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:06.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every day I wrote down verses

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was able to remember.

00:10:08.493 --> 00:10:11.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I had written about 500 verses,

00:10:11.538 --> 00:10:12.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was given a Bible.

00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:14.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:18.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so spiritually hungry,
I read it through in four months.

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:20.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time,
I wrote letters

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my wife and friends
and shared interesting things

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I learned from my reading.

00:10:24.552 --> 00:10:26.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the letters I received

00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:30.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from my friends and my dear wife
gave me the feeling

00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:33.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers and sisters
were so close to me,

00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:36.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:37.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t lonely.

00:10:37.899 --> 00:10:41.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if my friends
were right there with me.

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:46.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pretrial detention
isolates a person from society.

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:49.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s impossible to isolate
someone from Jehovah.

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the day,
I prayed to Jehovah many times,

00:10:53.249 --> 00:10:55.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I especially waited for bedtime.

00:10:56.043 --> 00:10:58.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When everyone was in bed
and only the night-light was on,

00:10:58.838 --> 00:11:02.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.

00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:05.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when I was all alone

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:10.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the cell and, of course,
I took advantage of the situation.

00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:14.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would get down on my knees
and would literally cry

00:11:14.104 --> 00:11:17.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:11:17.274 --> 00:11:20.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to write my requests to God

00:11:20.736 --> 00:11:23.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a sheet of paper and then mark off
the ones that he answered.

00:11:23.697 --> 00:11:28.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced that Jehovah
was very close to me.

00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:31.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also quietly sang our songs

00:11:31.122 --> 00:11:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the day.

00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:36.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I was all alone,
I sang at the top of my voice.

00:11:36.628 --> 00:11:39.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to give
a witness whenever possible.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:41.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discussed a variety of topics

00:11:41.925 --> 00:11:45.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything from tattoos
to “the king of the north.”

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:49.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All my fears
and anxieties were for nothing.

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:53.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in detention 343 days,

00:11:53.938 --> 00:11:55.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “not even a hair” fell from my head.

00:11:57.066 --> 00:12:00.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the most interesting
year of my life

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an excellent school to help
refine my spiritual qualities.

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:07.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a great honor
to uphold God’s sovereignty in this way!

00:12:17.713 --> 00:12:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is helping you today to rejoice

00:12:20.382 --> 00:12:24.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any opposition
you may be experiencing now?

00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:27.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is your relationship with Jehovah,

00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:31.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brotherhood,
and your heavenly or earthly hope

00:12:31.602 --> 00:12:33.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all these things.

00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:40.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we rejoice
in the love of Jehovah and our brothers.

00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:44.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are enduring persecution,

00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:46.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be assured that your brothers

00:12:46.368 --> 00:12:49.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only your friends,
not only brothers in your congregation,

00:12:49.788 --> 00:12:53.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all around the earth
—are praying in your behalf.

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:56.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angels observe you

00:12:56.044 --> 00:12:59.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel proud if you stay faithful.

00:12:59.924 --> 00:13:04.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can greatly contribute
to the encouragement of the faithful angels.

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:09.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels,

00:13:09.892 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your brothers can “take pride in you”

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rejoice
“because of your endurance and faith”

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:19.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite persecution.

00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:25.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Turner,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:13:25.826 --> 00:13:29.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:32.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Hunger.”

Warm greetings to one and all.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The final session of our
“Always Rejoice!” Regional Convention

00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is about to begin.

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:12.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take your seats.

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:15.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the music-video presentation,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect on the joy we share
with fellow servants of Jehovah,

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both past and present.

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:26.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please listen quietly and enjoy the video.

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:50.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have now reached
the final portion of this convention.

00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program will emphasize the joy

00:10:53.473 --> 00:10:57.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from our
close relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:02.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s stand and sing a song
that expresses our heartfelt joy.

00:11:02.315 --> 00:11:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song is number 62,
entitled “The New Song.”

00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:09.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 62.

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:50.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:55.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier we learned how Nehemiah
and his fellow workers

00:13:55.407 --> 00:14:00.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overcame opposition
and successfully completed Jerusalem’s walls.

00:14:00.412 --> 00:14:03.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what further challenges
lay ahead of them?

00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite you to watch
the drama’s stirring conclusion,

00:14:08.295 --> 00:14:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Nehemiah: “The Joy of Jehovah</i>
<i>Is Your Stronghold”—Part II.</i>

00:14:28.273 --> 00:14:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was now Tishri, the start of a month-long festival.

00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:38.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had just rebuilt the wall of Jehovah’s great city.

00:14:38.158 --> 00:14:40.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was time to rebuild

00:14:40.911 --> 00:14:43.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spirituality of his chosen people.

00:14:44.873 --> 00:14:47.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many did not know God’s Law.

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:51.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to help us gain understanding

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a man who had come before me—Ezra?

00:14:56.927 --> 00:14:59.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the regulations and judicial decisions of Jehovah.

00:15:01.557 --> 00:15:04.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and other Levites read aloud

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:05.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Law of Moses.

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:09.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They not only read it but they explained it,

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting meaning into it.

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:17.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a people, we began to understand

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:19.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how badly we had disappointed Jehovah

00:15:21.076 --> 00:15:23.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working on the Sabbath,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offering lame sacrifices,

00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:30.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and divorcing our wives to marry foreign women.

00:15:30.503 --> 00:15:35.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hurt our hearts, but by reading God’s Law,

00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:38.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were learning to be Jehovah’s people again.

00:15:38.052 --> 00:15:41.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not mourn or weep.

00:15:41.055 --> 00:15:43.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that you know what displeases God,

00:15:43.808 --> 00:15:45.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can do what pleases him.

00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:48.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So go.

00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:52.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eat the choice things, and drink what is sweet,

00:15:52.441 --> 00:15:54.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send a portion to those who have nothing.

00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:57.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not feel sad,

00:15:57.155 --> 00:16:01.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:16:07.957 --> 00:16:10.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed Jehovah’s instructions

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to observe the Festival of Booths.

00:16:27.644 --> 00:16:31.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent days rejoicing and giving thanks 

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:34.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s blessing.

00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:36.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then on the 24th day,

00:16:36.027 --> 00:16:38.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we assembled to read God’s Law,

00:16:40.073 --> 00:16:41.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to confess our sins,

00:16:43.827 --> 00:16:46.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weep over our wrongdoing.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made a binding agreement in writing.

00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:17.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We resolved to obey Jehovah’s Law.

00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:21.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:26.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some soon forgot their promise.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peleth!

00:17:29.873 --> 00:17:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reham,

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:36.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s our rent payment.

00:17:36.296 --> 00:17:38.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put them in a bag.

00:17:38.007 --> 00:17:39.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basket is hard to carry.

00:17:43.137 --> 00:17:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear about Nehemiah’s latest idea?

00:17:46.432 --> 00:17:49.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You mean the plan to repopulate Jerusalem?

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean his ridiculous proposal to force families

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:53.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move into the city—1 out of 10 by lot.

00:17:55.649 --> 00:17:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I heard.

00:17:57.651 --> 00:17:59.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I had to be one who was chosen.

00:17:59.445 --> 00:18:01.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why me?

00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t he care what this does to landholders like me?

00:18:04.742 --> 00:18:05.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!

00:18:06.869 --> 00:18:08.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when are you supposed to move?

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:11.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move?

00:18:11.082 --> 00:18:13.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not moving anywhere.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:15.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t selected.

00:18:17.713 --> 00:18:18.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not yet, you mean.

00:18:18.923 --> 00:18:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you are,

00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:25.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:31.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king sent Nehemiah here to rebuild the city.

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:35.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is the governor.

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:37.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Governors come, governors go.

00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:39.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king is waiting for Nehemiah to return,

00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when he does, things will get back to normal.

00:18:42.071 --> 00:18:44.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when Nehemiah goes back,

00:18:44.741 --> 00:18:46.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will still be here.

00:18:46.743 --> 00:18:49.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is his will that Jerusalem be rebuilt.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you believe that?

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:55.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you would go along with Nehemiah?

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so ungrateful?

00:19:01.508 --> 00:19:02.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:19:05.303 --> 00:19:06.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your rent!

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that all about?

00:19:21.278 --> 00:19:23.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham refuses to move into Jerusalem,

00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:29.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to support him.

00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you say?

00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:35.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him Nehemiah is doing Jehovah’s will.

00:19:37.294 --> 00:19:39.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham doesn’t understand how happy

00:19:39.338 --> 00:19:43.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be if-if he would just follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:49.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we will move if we are selected?

00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:51.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:19:54.144 --> 00:19:58.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d rather be like Nehemiah than like Raham.

00:19:58.607 --> 00:20:00.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You agree?

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:01.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:20:01.485 --> 00:20:02.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:20:10.536 --> 00:20:12.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the inauguration of the walls,

00:20:13.622 --> 00:20:16.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we filled Jerusalem with songs of praise 

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:18.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thanksgiving to God.

00:20:23.465 --> 00:20:26.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our great joy could be heard from far away.

00:20:30.556 --> 00:20:33.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally returned to the king,

00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:35.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about that day often.

00:20:35.603 --> 00:20:39.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what I know now, I wish I had never left.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah raised up a messenger

00:20:54.872 --> 00:20:56.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who chronicled the things that happened

00:20:56.874 --> 00:20:58.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jerusalem during my absence.

00:21:00.545 --> 00:21:02.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name was Malachi.

00:21:07.051 --> 00:21:08.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:21:08.553 --> 00:21:10.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite not being a Jew,

00:21:10.555 --> 00:21:12.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still found his way into the temple.

00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:17.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He utilized his Jewish family ties

00:21:17.812 --> 00:21:20.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take advantage of the other Jews.

00:21:20.648 --> 00:21:22.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What brings you to the temple?

00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been some time.

00:21:23.693 --> 00:21:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wanted to see you,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oh, and to bring you this small gift.

00:21:30.408 --> 00:21:33.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, you are always so generous.

00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing, really.

00:21:36.081 --> 00:21:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Umm, is there nothing I can do for you?

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:40.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since you asked,

00:21:40.251 --> 00:21:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s one little thing you could do.

00:21:42.712 --> 00:21:44.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me. What can I do for you?

00:21:44.714 --> 00:21:46.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, speaking of family . . .

00:21:47.968 --> 00:21:49.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our relatives, yours and mine, I mean,

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visit from Samaria, it would be so nice

00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:55.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a place to eat with them.

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, right here in the temple, that is.

00:21:58.937 --> 00:22:02.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, they worship Jehovah too—often.

00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:05.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well, sometimes.

00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A room in the temple?

00:22:07.988 --> 00:22:10.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know I can’t do that.

00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:15.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is, all the rooms are in use.

00:22:15.203 --> 00:22:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them?

00:22:17.247 --> 00:22:19.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t some of them just storerooms?

00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:22.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those are provisions for the Levites.

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:26.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can’t you clear one out for me? just one?

00:22:26.465 --> 00:22:27.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only need one.

00:22:28.634 --> 00:22:30.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will Nehemiah say?

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What difference does it make?

00:22:33.764 --> 00:22:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:22:36.558 --> 00:22:38.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if he finds out?

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is going to tell him?

00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:42.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to tell him?

00:22:42.147 --> 00:22:43.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no!

00:22:43.148 --> 00:22:44.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why worry?

00:22:58.497 --> 00:23:01.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once again our high priest has given in to Tobiah.

00:23:03.586 --> 00:23:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where should I put this grain?

00:23:05.254 --> 00:23:06.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s room here.

00:23:06.547 --> 00:23:08.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful! I’ve got it.

00:23:10.676 --> 00:23:12.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look who’s coming.

00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:18.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you hurry, please?

00:23:18.392 --> 00:23:21.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once they get out of our way, let’s, uh,

00:23:21.145 --> 00:23:24.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s set the table here and then the chairs 

00:23:24.482 --> 00:23:26.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kind of along the wall.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, tell me, please,

00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:29.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where should we store our provisions now?

00:23:29.904 --> 00:23:30.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever you want.

00:23:30.988 --> 00:23:32.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s your problem.

00:23:32.073 --> 00:23:34.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now move along,

00:23:34.534 --> 00:23:37.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like now, please.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, so we’ll unload here,

00:23:39.997 --> 00:23:42.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then like I said, chairs there, table here.

00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:48.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could Eliashib let anyone,

00:23:48.256 --> 00:23:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let alone a man like Tobiah,

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:52.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take over a room for his own use

00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:54.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after all that Nehemiah did

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preserve the sacredness of the temple?

00:23:56.723 --> 00:23:58.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most people don’t give tithes anymore anyway.

00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:01.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to eat,

00:24:01.227 --> 00:24:03.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to go tend our own flocks and fields.

00:24:03.396 --> 00:24:05.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of no value to serve God.

00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:08.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, brothers!

00:24:08.526 --> 00:24:11.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t let their wrong acts take away our joy.

00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:12.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:24:12.572 --> 00:24:14.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have we benefited from serving Jehovah?

00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:17.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes. And doesn’t the scripture say:

00:24:17.702 --> 00:24:19.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take good care of your sheep”?

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:22.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also says:

00:24:22.958 --> 00:24:25.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings.”

00:24:26.086 --> 00:24:28.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must wait on Jehovah.

00:24:28.755 --> 00:24:31.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, he will straighten everything out.

00:24:33.885 --> 00:24:35.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi saw how far the people had fallen.

00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:39.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Levites,

00:24:39.057 --> 00:24:41.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once the proud keepers of Jehovah’s standards,

00:24:41.935 --> 00:24:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now found themselves questioning

00:24:44.187 --> 00:24:45.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the value of their own service.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young man!

00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:16.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not offer a sheep?

00:25:18.222 --> 00:25:20.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bigger the offering,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the bigger the blessings.

00:25:23.018 --> 00:25:24.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides,

00:25:25.062 --> 00:25:27.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know it’s more impressive to the neighbors, huh?

00:25:29.108 --> 00:25:31.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I already have an offering.

00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:33.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, yes, but look!

00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:35.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You seem like a nice man.

00:25:35.656 --> 00:25:38.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So today, for you, a special price—huh?—

00:25:38.743 --> 00:25:41.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hardly more than you paid for these doves.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come take a look.

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:45.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sheep is blind!

00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at how it walks!

00:25:47.877 --> 00:25:51.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young man, that’s absolutely normal for this breed.

00:25:51.422 --> 00:25:55.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says not to offer blind, lame, or sick animals.

00:25:57.178 --> 00:25:59.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If ever I can afford to offer a sheep, it’ll be a sound one.

00:25:59.722 --> 00:26:01.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste your money!

00:26:01.015 --> 00:26:03.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s a fine sheep at a fine price.

00:26:03.184 --> 00:26:04.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:26:04.268 --> 00:26:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be practical!

00:26:05.895 --> 00:26:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it’s only a tradition.

00:26:08.397 --> 00:26:09.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bah!

00:26:11.484 --> 00:26:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Temple services are not the same.

00:26:14.779 --> 00:26:17.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if they don’t even think about Jehovah.

00:26:21.911 --> 00:26:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azubah!

00:26:24.455 --> 00:26:25.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong?

00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:29.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azubah, what happened?

00:26:32.046 --> 00:26:33.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s Raham?

00:26:42.015 --> 00:26:43.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A certificate of divorce?

00:26:47.145 --> 00:26:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to be a good wife,

00:26:49.272 --> 00:26:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t enough.

00:26:54.527 --> 00:26:56.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham sent me away.

00:26:56.321 --> 00:26:57.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t fear, Azubah.

00:26:58.657 --> 00:27:00.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can live here with us.

00:27:01.576 --> 00:27:03.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can all share.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, God!

00:27:05.121 --> 00:27:06.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all my fault.

00:27:06.748 --> 00:27:08.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You mustn’t think that way.

00:27:09.543 --> 00:27:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t give him children.

00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With or without children,

00:27:14.965 --> 00:27:16.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
marriage is sacred.

00:27:18.385 --> 00:27:20.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:27:20.178 --> 00:27:22.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will never send you away.

00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:27:55.756 --> 00:27:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:27:57.841 --> 00:27:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a visitor last night.

00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was your wife,

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:09.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or should I say your former wife.

00:28:10.354 --> 00:28:11.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:28:11.397 --> 00:28:14.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you care how you’ve hurt your innocent mate?

00:28:14.525 --> 00:28:16.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:28:16.569 --> 00:28:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look! Moses said if you find something

00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:21.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indecent with your wife, a man must write 

00:28:21.073 --> 00:28:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certificate of divorce, hand it to her,

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dismiss her.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If giving me no children isn’t indecent, then what is?

00:28:28.414 --> 00:28:30.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m tired of living with her.

00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:32.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gizla?

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:28:37.381 --> 00:28:39.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse

00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to take a wife from the nations!

00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:44.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says: “They will turn your sons away

00:28:44.263 --> 00:28:46.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from following me to serve other gods;

00:28:46.557 --> 00:28:49.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you”!

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are you to counsel me?

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:53.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find his own joy,

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I intend to find mine.

00:28:55.984 --> 00:29:00.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:01.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really think you can give

00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:03.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yourself more joy than he can?

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah,

00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:30.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do we treat each other so treacherously,

00:29:30.977 --> 00:29:33.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
profaning your covenant?

00:29:43.323 --> 00:29:45.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi!

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say to the priests who are despising my name:

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:56.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A son honors a father, and a servant his master.

00:29:56.503 --> 00:30:01.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So if I am a father, where is the honor due me?

00:30:01.508 --> 00:30:06.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I am a master, where is the fear due me?”

My good man!

00:30:20.444 --> 00:30:22.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My good man, I see you have no offering.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you Levites despised Jehovah’s name?

00:30:50.516 --> 00:30:52.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despised it?

00:30:52.143 --> 00:30:53.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:56.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You present a blind, lame, or sick animal

00:30:56.981 --> 00:31:00.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a sacrifice and say that it is nothing bad.

00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:02.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:31:02.153 --> 00:31:03.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the meat is in our pot,

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:06.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no one can tell if it was lame or sound.

00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:09.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Jehovah? Can he tell the difference?

00:31:09.994 --> 00:31:12.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day Jehovah will come to his temple.

00:31:12.413 --> 00:31:15.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will cleanse you sons of Levi by fire.

00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi, what’s gotten into you?

00:31:17.877 --> 00:31:19.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should you complain

00:31:19.212 --> 00:31:21.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when everyone else approves?

Why not?

There are some who don’t do that

The lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge,

But you,

you have made many stumble.

00:32:58.354 --> 00:33:00.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s message revealed that the problem

was in their hearts.

00:33:04.193 --> 00:33:06.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of that,

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:29.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:33:37.018 --> 00:33:38.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must be a prophet.

00:33:38.728 --> 00:33:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I serve Jehovah as you do.

00:33:40.229 --> 00:33:43.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can tell you that when you speak with one another

00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:45.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah, he pays attention.

who fear him and meditate on his name.

but my heart was always with my people.

00:34:19.602 --> 00:34:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I requested to return to them.

00:34:23.523 --> 00:34:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I found shocked me.

00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:27.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib!

00:34:28.737 --> 00:34:30.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Where are all the Levites and the singers?

00:34:36.786 --> 00:34:39.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are away right now.

00:34:39.247 --> 00:34:40.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Away?

00:34:40.624 --> 00:34:42.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are they away?

00:34:44.377 --> 00:34:45.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah is here!

00:34:45.504 --> 00:34:46.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah,

00:34:46.254 --> 00:34:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show Governor Nehemiah around.

00:34:52.427 --> 00:34:53.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excuse me, please.

00:34:55.347 --> 00:34:56.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:35:02.104 --> 00:35:03.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah,

00:35:03.146 --> 00:35:05.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell me about the temple services.

00:35:05.649 --> 00:35:07.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have all the provisions that you need?

00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:08.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Governor Nehemiah,

00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:10.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have nearly no provisions at all.

00:35:10.362 --> 00:35:11.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can that be?

00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:13.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a long time, the priests and the Levites

00:35:13.615 --> 00:35:15.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not taken their duties seriously.

00:35:15.826 --> 00:35:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the people saw that,

00:35:17.244 --> 00:35:18.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:35:18.871 --> 00:35:21.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the tithes,

00:35:21.165 --> 00:35:24.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most Levites and singers returned to their fields.

00:35:24.043 --> 00:35:26.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you not returned?

00:35:27.379 --> 00:35:29.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, I’m getting by.

00:35:29.423 --> 00:35:31.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always believed that Jehovah helps

00:35:31.008 --> 00:35:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who trust in him.

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:36.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know he will correct things in his time.

00:35:36.472 --> 00:35:40.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Eliashib not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your absence,

00:35:41.727 --> 00:35:44.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests.

00:35:45.856 --> 00:35:48.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Eliashib—

00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:51.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took our storeroom and emptied it of our provisions.

00:35:51.529 --> 00:35:54.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave it to Tobiah to use as a dining hall.

00:36:07.044 --> 00:36:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah, help us get rid of these things.

00:36:15.303 --> 00:36:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:36:19.932 --> 00:36:21.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib!

00:36:21.392 --> 00:36:23.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have you been doing?

00:36:23.102 --> 00:36:24.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you and the deputy rulers

00:36:24.771 --> 00:36:26.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neglected the house of God?

00:36:26.397 --> 00:36:27.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah.

00:36:27.148 --> 00:36:27.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and they,

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please cleanse this room

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replace the utensils.

00:36:30.943 --> 00:36:31.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my lord.

00:36:31.569 --> 00:36:32.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gather all the Levites,

00:36:32.654 --> 00:36:34.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:36:34.197 --> 00:36:36.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m assigning them all back to their posts.

00:36:36.824 --> 00:36:40.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah, I’m placing you, Shelemiah,

and Zadok in charge of the storerooms.

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:43.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanan will be your assistant.

00:36:43.122 --> 00:36:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your responsibility

00:36:44.541 --> 00:36:46.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distribute provisions to your brothers.

00:36:46.251 --> 00:36:47.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah,

00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:49.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wait-wait a second.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me explain this.

00:36:50.255 --> 00:36:52.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will tell all Judah

00:36:52.048 --> 00:36:54.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring in the tenth of the grain,

00:36:54.259 --> 00:36:56.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new wine, and the oil.

00:36:56.428 --> 00:36:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can explain this.

00:36:59.014 --> 00:37:01.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no, wait.

00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:15.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do remember me, O my God,

00:37:16.698 --> 00:37:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not wipe out my acts of loyal love

00:37:19.493 --> 00:37:21.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the house of my God.

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only had they neglected Jehovah’s house

00:37:30.587 --> 00:37:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of the Jews

00:37:32.047 --> 00:37:34.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continued to conduct business on the Sabbath

00:37:36.218 --> 00:37:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a day Jehovah had declared as holy.

00:37:41.598 --> 00:37:43.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you selling today?

00:37:43.058 --> 00:37:46.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the best quality fish from Tyre.

00:37:47.938 --> 00:37:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you not care that this is the Sabbath?

00:37:52.234 --> 00:37:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah.

00:37:57.114 --> 00:37:59.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is this evil thing you’re doing?

00:37:59.658 --> 00:38:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why God brought disaster on this city!

00:38:01.827 --> 00:38:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people think it’s acceptable now.

00:38:03.287 --> 00:38:04.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah think?

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:08.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped the buying and selling

00:38:08.334 --> 00:38:10.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ordered the doors closed

00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:11.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to keep the Sabbath day holy.

00:38:20.679 --> 00:38:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the following week, the merchants tried again.

00:38:25.518 --> 00:38:27.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the meaning of this?

00:38:27.561 --> 00:38:29.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know God’s Law: No work, 

00:38:33.985 --> 00:38:36.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no business on the Sabbath!

00:38:36.028 --> 00:38:36.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go!

00:38:36.988 --> 00:38:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and all the Levites, guard the gates 

00:38:39.031 --> 00:38:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:38:40.783 --> 00:38:42.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let anyone in!

00:38:51.127 --> 00:38:55.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, too, remember to my credit, O my God,

00:38:55.339 --> 00:38:57.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show me pity 

00:38:57.592 --> 00:38:59.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your abundant loyal love.

00:39:04.599 --> 00:39:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was another thing that I had to do.

00:39:06.935 --> 00:39:08.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come along.

You have to listen to me. I’m your father!

00:39:14.609 --> 00:39:16.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with your children?

00:39:17.529 --> 00:39:20.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t like coming to the temple.

00:39:20.031 --> 00:39:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sweetie, why don’t you like it?

00:39:23.993 --> 00:39:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Shvok Y-ati!</i>

00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:27.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here now!

00:39:31.835 --> 00:39:33.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, my lord.

00:39:33.878 --> 00:39:35.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:39:37.424 --> 00:39:40.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:39:40.093 --> 00:39:41.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:39:41.553 --> 00:39:43.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:39:44.389 --> 00:39:46.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not?

00:39:46.057 --> 00:39:47.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:39:47.142 --> 00:39:49.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:39:51.062 --> 00:39:52.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go!

00:39:52.272 --> 00:39:54.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder your children don’t love Jehovah.

00:39:54.983 --> 00:39:56.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aah!

00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:57.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you imagine that you could succeed

00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:59.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without Jehovah’s blessing?

00:39:59.821 --> 00:40:01.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for Jehovah’s blessing!

00:40:01.114 --> 00:40:02.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you?

00:40:02.074 --> 00:40:04.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you didn’t obey him.

00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:07.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, how can Jehovah bless something 

00:40:07.287 --> 00:40:09.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is against his will?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was I surprised?

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:15.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people were just following

00:40:15.754 --> 00:40:18.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the bad example of those taking the lead.

00:40:19.758 --> 00:40:21.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib’s grandson married a Horonite,

00:40:21.802 --> 00:40:24.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the daughter of Sanballat.

00:40:34.023 --> 00:40:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you no respect for God’s Law?

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should not give your daughters to their sons

00:40:40.654 --> 00:40:43.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or accept any of their daughters for your sons

00:40:43.824 --> 00:40:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or yourselves!

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it not because of these that King Solomon sinned?

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandfather, say something.

00:40:55.544 --> 00:40:56.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be still, my son.

00:40:56.545 --> 00:40:58.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it not something unheard of

00:40:58.672 --> 00:41:01.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to commit this great evil

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by marrying foreign women?

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:10.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have defiled the priesthood!

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:15.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not serve as a priest or remain in Jerusalem.

00:41:19.819 --> 00:41:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine.

00:41:21.237 --> 00:41:23.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go to Samaria.

00:41:23.698 --> 00:41:25.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re more tolerant there.

00:41:29.662 --> 00:41:31.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he’s my grandson.

00:41:31.998 --> 00:41:34.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why did you allow him

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to disregard Jehovah’s laws?

00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:41.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know our temple services

00:41:41.341 --> 00:41:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are what preserve our relationship with God!

00:41:45.178 --> 00:41:47.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as I left,

00:41:47.597 --> 00:41:49.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of you,

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:52.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you let it fall apart.

00:42:04.406 --> 00:42:09.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time, but true worship was restored.

00:42:23.383 --> 00:42:25.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back on all

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:27.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah enabled us to do

00:42:31.975 --> 00:42:34.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the opposition we faced, . . .

00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend

00:42:35.812 --> 00:42:37.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we turn the accusation of sedition

00:42:37.981 --> 00:42:40.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Nehemiah.

00:42:40.108 --> 00:42:42.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next sound they hear

00:42:42.027 --> 00:42:44.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be our battle cry.

00:42:44.613 --> 00:42:46.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:42:46.823 --> 00:42:49.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the bad influences we avoided, . . .

00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:51.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:42:51.995 --> 00:42:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:42:54.164 --> 00:42:55.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste your money!

00:42:55.415 --> 00:42:56.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be practical!

00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:58.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it’s only a tradition.

00:42:58.585 --> 00:43:00.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to eat,

00:43:00.295 --> 00:43:02.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to go tend our own flocks and fields.

00:43:02.214 --> 00:43:04.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of no value to serve God.

00:43:04.216 --> 00:43:07.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the sleepless nights, . . .

00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you see? These people hate what we’re doing.

00:43:11.307 --> 00:43:11.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hate us.

00:43:11.974 --> 00:43:14.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to live and work around them like we do.

00:43:14.894 --> 00:43:16.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the sweat and toil, . . .

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:43:18.898 --> 00:43:19.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re worn out.

00:43:19.899 --> 00:43:21.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:24.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . I just remember the joy we felt

00:43:27.072 --> 00:43:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we were serving Jehovah the right way.

00:43:31.535 --> 00:43:34.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought we were just working on a wall,

00:43:36.957 --> 00:43:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah was rebuilding our faith.

00:43:47.301 --> 00:43:50.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never forget how Jehovah

00:43:50.137 --> 00:43:53.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought us together to accomplish his will.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He taught us to rely on him,

00:44:01.357 --> 00:44:03.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he strengthened us.

00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:06.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eat the choice things, and drink what is sweet,

00:44:06.654 --> 00:44:09.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send a portion to those who have nothing.

00:44:09.073 --> 00:44:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not feel sad,

00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:14.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:44:26.257 --> 00:44:29.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do remember me favorably, O my God.

00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:44.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah was a man of courage.

00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:47.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have stayed in the luxurious palace

00:44:47.112 --> 00:44:50.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Shushan and served Jehovah from there.

00:44:50.365 --> 00:44:51.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t.

00:44:51.575 --> 00:44:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a need arose,

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was ready to make the long journey

00:44:56.663 --> 00:44:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jerusalem to support his brothers.

00:44:59.416 --> 00:45:01.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wouldn’t be easy.

00:45:02.294 --> 00:45:05.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he had to ask the king of Persia to let him go.

00:45:05.005 --> 00:45:07.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Nehemiah

00:45:07.007 --> 00:45:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:45:10.177 --> 00:45:12.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he rely on his personality

00:45:12.888 --> 00:45:15.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or his good record with the king?

00:45:15.265 --> 00:45:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch this part again.

00:45:19.102 --> 00:45:22.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins,

00:45:22.314 --> 00:45:24.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:26.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:27.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speak frankly.

00:45:27.861 --> 00:45:29.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you seeking?

00:45:31.156 --> 00:45:35.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens.

00:45:38.789 --> 00:45:41.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it pleases the king

00:45:41.208 --> 00:45:45.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if your servant has found favor with you,

00:45:45.629 --> 00:45:47.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send me to Judah,

00:45:47.673 --> 00:45:49.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the city where my forefathers are buried,

00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:52.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let me rebuild it.

00:45:58.434 --> 00:45:59.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may go.

00:45:59.727 --> 00:46:02.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with us.

00:46:06.275 --> 00:46:10.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah immediately and humbly prayed to Jehovah,

00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:12.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the true Source of courage.

00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:14.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he prayed repeatedly

00:46:14.825 --> 00:46:17.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout his assignment,

00:46:17.245 --> 00:46:19.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah blessed his efforts.

00:46:19.997 --> 00:46:23.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So lesson number one for us today:

00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:24.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When times are hard,

00:46:24.752 --> 00:46:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be quick to lean on Jehovah.

00:46:27.463 --> 00:46:29.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if things are going well?

00:46:29.715 --> 00:46:32.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still reliant on Jehovah?

00:46:32.343 --> 00:46:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or might we find ourselves

00:46:34.804 --> 00:46:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becoming complacent, perhaps even saying:

00:46:38.016 --> 00:46:41.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Things are good in my life now.

00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:44.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know there’s a need to get to work,

00:46:44.605 --> 00:46:48.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I’ve been serving Jehovah for many years now.

00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:50.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ve done my part.

00:46:50.904 --> 00:46:53.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let someone else do it”?

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:56.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah bless such an attitude?

00:46:56.534 --> 00:47:00.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be better to turn to Jehovah in prayer,

00:47:00.622 --> 00:47:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him to give you the courage and joy

00:47:04.626 --> 00:47:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to reach out in your service to him?

00:47:09.214 --> 00:47:12.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just might be surprised

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the doors Jehovah opens for you.

00:47:16.846 --> 00:47:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, once Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem,

00:47:19.975 --> 00:47:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t just give orders, did he?

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that he daily worked

00:47:26.523 --> 00:47:28.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
alongside his fellow Israelites

00:47:28.358 --> 00:47:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the break of dawn

00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the stars came out.”

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,

00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:38.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we show a self-sacrificing spirit,

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give us the energy needed

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out the task at hand.

00:47:44.833 --> 00:47:47.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Israelites completed

00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:50.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wall-building project in just 52 days!

00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing feat,

00:47:53.175 --> 00:47:56.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the face of continual opposition!

00:47:59.431 --> 00:48:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it came in the form of mocking.

00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the opposers threatened to attack!

00:48:05.813 --> 00:48:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were Samaritans in the north,

00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:12.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ammonites in the east, Arabs in the south,

00:48:12.444 --> 00:48:15.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ashdodites in the west.

00:48:15.072 --> 00:48:19.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem was surrounded by enemies.

00:48:19.118 --> 00:48:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could have been easy to feel trapped

00:48:21.203 --> 00:48:23.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give in to fear.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Nehemiah do?

00:48:25.249 --> 00:48:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was his pattern?

00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his own words, he says:

00:48:30.337 --> 00:48:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We prayed to our God.”

00:48:33.799 --> 00:48:37.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Nehemiah strengthened the people

00:48:37.261 --> 00:48:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling them:

00:48:38.637 --> 00:48:42.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid of them.

00:48:42.308 --> 00:48:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember Jehovah, who is great and awe-inspiring.”

00:48:46.937 --> 00:48:49.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they kept building.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Nehemiah’s enemies

00:48:51.234 --> 00:48:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
realized that their open threats had failed,

00:48:53.861 --> 00:48:56.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did they give up?

00:48:56.656 --> 00:48:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:48:57.406 --> 00:49:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They now turned to other forms of opposition.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:05.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they tried three different schemes

00:49:05.206 --> 00:49:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sidetrack Nehemiah from the work.

00:49:08.209 --> 00:49:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice them?

00:49:10.253 --> 00:49:12.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the video again.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked to meet Nehemiah halfway.

00:49:20.763 --> 00:49:22.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell this to Nehemiah:

00:49:24.017 --> 00:49:24.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come,

00:49:24.976 --> 00:49:27.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let us set a time to meet together

00:49:27.687 --> 00:49:29.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Valley Plain of Ono.”

00:49:29.814 --> 00:49:31.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to lure me away

00:49:31.483 --> 00:49:33.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jerusalem to do me harm.

00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:38.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spread false rumors.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, it’s time to implement your plan.

00:49:43.411 --> 00:49:46.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, write this down:

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Among the nations it has been heard,

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Geshem is also saying it,

00:49:52.963 --> 00:49:56.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you and the Jews

00:49:56.675 --> 00:49:59.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are scheming to rebel.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why you are building the wall.”

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:08.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they used a traitor to try and trick Nehemiah.

00:50:08.019 --> 00:50:10.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re coming to kill you—by night!

00:50:10.939 --> 00:50:12.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go into the temple

00:50:12.899 --> 00:50:14.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and close the doors.

00:50:14.401 --> 00:50:16.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah,

00:50:16.194 --> 00:50:18.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should a man like me run away?

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t understand.

00:50:20.324 --> 00:50:23.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:50:23.076 --> 00:50:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the only safe place.

00:50:25.495 --> 00:50:27.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m not a priest.

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:29.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I entered the temple,

00:50:29.416 --> 00:50:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:50:31.126 --> 00:50:33.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not go in.

00:50:33.629 --> 00:50:36.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:50:42.096 --> 00:50:43.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see!

00:50:43.764 --> 00:50:47.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah and Sanballat put you up to this,

00:50:47.685 --> 00:50:49.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t they, you hypocrite?

00:50:49.812 --> 00:50:51.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah remember them

00:50:51.772 --> 00:50:53.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you false prophets

00:50:53.357 --> 00:50:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who keep trying to frighten me.

00:50:54.984 --> 00:50:57.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, Hanani,

00:50:57.152 --> 00:50:59.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have work to do.

00:51:02.867 --> 00:51:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three schemes, three failures

00:51:06.495 --> 00:51:08.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so lesson number two:

00:51:08.914 --> 00:51:13.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Nehemiah, we might encounter opposers

00:51:13.586 --> 00:51:17.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who scheme to bring our loyal service to a halt.

00:51:18.716 --> 00:51:22.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may invite us to meet them halfway, so to speak.

00:51:22.428 --> 00:51:25.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may try to convince us that if we serve Jehovah

00:51:25.765 --> 00:51:27.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just a little less zeal,

00:51:27.683 --> 00:51:30.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could pursue

00:51:30.019 --> 00:51:33.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worldly goals at the same time.

00:51:33.105 --> 00:51:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because God’s Kingdom

00:51:34.857 --> 00:51:37.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes first in our lives,

00:51:37.068 --> 00:51:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be like Nehemiah and refuse to compromise.

00:51:41.322 --> 00:51:44.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know where this world is headed.

00:51:46.327 --> 00:51:49.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opposers also spread false accusations against us.

00:51:49.914 --> 00:51:52.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands, we’re accused

00:51:52.083 --> 00:51:54.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of posing a threat to the State.

00:51:54.586 --> 00:51:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some accusations have been successfully

00:51:57.046 --> 00:51:58.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rebutted in court.

00:51:58.798 --> 00:52:00.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever the outcome,

00:52:00.675 --> 00:52:03.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re confident that Jehovah will direct matters

00:52:03.928 --> 00:52:06.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his will.

00:52:06.639 --> 00:52:09.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opposition may also come from those

00:52:09.768 --> 00:52:13.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who pretend to serve Jehovah.

00:52:13.271 --> 00:52:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a fellow Jew tried to get Nehemiah

00:52:16.232 --> 00:52:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to break God’s Law to save his life,

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so former Witnesses may try

00:52:21.738 --> 00:52:25.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get us to compromise in one way or another.

00:52:26.785 --> 00:52:29.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we reject apostates because we know

00:52:29.621 --> 00:52:31.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our lives are saved,

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:36.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by breaking God’s laws, but by keeping them.

00:52:37.879 --> 00:52:41.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time, Nehemiah refused to fall into their trap.

00:52:41.717 --> 00:52:43.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:52:43.218 --> 00:52:45.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he had a brilliant mind?

00:52:45.053 --> 00:52:45.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:49.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because he relied on Jehovah,

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:53.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave him the insight needed

00:52:53.895 --> 00:52:57.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see through their deceptions.

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the wall was built,

00:52:59.359 --> 00:53:01.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah left Jerusalem for a while.

00:53:01.987 --> 00:53:05.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did he find on his return?

00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:09.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of coming back to find true worship thriving,

00:53:09.703 --> 00:53:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he found it barely surviving.

00:53:13.082 --> 00:53:15.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the work that he had done

00:53:15.876 --> 00:53:19.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the people to trust in Jehovah

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how do you think he felt?

00:53:21.966 --> 00:53:24.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have said: “That’s it!

00:53:24.802 --> 00:53:26.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m out!

00:53:26.428 --> 00:53:30.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let someone else clean this up,” and walked away.

00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:31.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did he?

00:53:31.684 --> 00:53:33.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch again.

00:53:33.644 --> 00:53:35.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you and the deputy rulers

00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:36.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neglected the house of God?

00:53:36.939 --> 00:53:39.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and they, please cleanse this room.

00:53:39.692 --> 00:53:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know God’s Law:

00:53:41.944 --> 00:53:44.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No work, no business

00:53:44.363 --> 00:53:45.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Sabbath!

00:53:45.906 --> 00:53:47.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go!

00:53:47.199 --> 00:53:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:53:50.119 --> 00:53:52.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:53:52.705 --> 00:53:55.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:53:55.708 --> 00:53:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Eliashib’s grandson married a Horonite,

00:54:01.214 --> 00:54:03.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the daughter of Sanballat.

00:54:06.594 --> 00:54:09.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should not give your daughters to their sons

00:54:09.055 --> 00:54:11.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or accept any of their daughters for your sons!

00:54:11.808 --> 00:54:13.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have defiled the priesthood!

00:54:13.434 --> 00:54:15.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not serve as a priest

00:54:15.395 --> 00:54:17.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or remain in Jerusalem.

00:54:18.731 --> 00:54:20.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time

00:54:20.566 --> 00:54:24.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but true worship was restored.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah didn’t walk away, did he?

00:54:32.245 --> 00:54:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he persevered in his assignment.

00:54:35.498 --> 00:54:36.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:54:36.583 --> 00:54:39.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he held on to his joy.

00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:43.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, his main source of joy came,

00:54:43.715 --> 00:54:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not from his accomplishments,

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not from the security of walls,

00:54:49.429 --> 00:54:52.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even from what others were doing.

00:54:52.432 --> 00:54:55.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From where does true joy come?

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah himself told us:

00:54:58.688 --> 00:55:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:55:03.693 --> 00:55:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is lesson number three for us:

Despite challenges and setbacks,

00:55:09.533 --> 00:55:12.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be joyful because true joy comes

00:55:12.744 --> 00:55:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:55:16.164 --> 00:55:19.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah was a man like you and me.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, he didn’t have Jehovah’s power

00:55:22.754 --> 00:55:24.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
displayed supernaturally to him

00:55:24.798 --> 00:55:27.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Moses and Joshua did.

00:55:27.092 --> 00:55:29.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did he have?

00:55:29.595 --> 00:55:33.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had prayer, he had faith,

00:55:33.432 --> 00:55:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had trust.

00:55:36.018 --> 00:55:38.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those were his tools.

00:55:38.145 --> 00:55:40.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is no doubt that Jehovah

00:55:40.898 --> 00:55:43.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was active on behalf of Nehemiah,

00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guiding and blessing his efforts.

00:55:46.195 --> 00:55:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have those same tools today.

00:55:49.865 --> 00:55:53.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah, put faith in him,

00:55:53.661 --> 00:55:56.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust that he will bless your self-sacrificing efforts.

00:55:58.082 --> 00:56:00.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah gave Nehemiah 

00:56:00.125 --> 00:56:03.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the courage, the energy, the insight, 

00:56:03.629 --> 00:56:06.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the perseverance to carry out his assignment,

00:56:06.924 --> 00:56:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll do the same for you.

00:56:11.637 --> 00:56:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Nehemiah,
we gain strength

00:56:14.306 --> 00:56:17.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our association
with faithful fellow believers.

00:56:17.935 --> 00:56:21.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise,
our next song draws attention

00:56:21.022 --> 00:56:24.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the blessings we enjoy
as a united brotherhood.

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:29.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song is entitled
“We Are Jehovah’s Army!”

00:56:29.196 --> 00:56:33.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s stand and sing together
song number 71.

00:56:33.659 --> 00:56:37.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may remain standing
for any announcements.

00:56:37.622 --> 00:56:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 71.

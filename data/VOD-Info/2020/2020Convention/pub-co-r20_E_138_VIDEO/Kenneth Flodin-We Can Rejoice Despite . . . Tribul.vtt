Did you notice that in each of the titles

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our symposium talks,
it uses the word “despite”?

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:15.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English word “despite” can mean
without being blocked or thwarted.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our ability to rejoice
will not be blocked or thwarted.

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can actually rejoice despite trials.

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:28.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially,
that sounds contradictory, doesn’t it?

00:00:28.508 --> 00:00:31.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I usually associate with rejoicing

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:35.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the receiving of gifts, not trials.

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:38.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, that is the very point.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rejoice
despite trials because of gifts

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:44.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah provides for us.

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to review
three of those in our symposium:

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:50.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah,

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:53.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our precious brotherhood,

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the glorious hope we have for the future.

00:00:56.287 --> 00:01:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 5,

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:03.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3-5,

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:08.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can identify
when this first gift

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:12.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is introduced in the verses
—a relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:16.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 5:3-5 says: “Not only that,

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but let us rejoice while in tribulations,

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we know
that tribulation produces endurance;

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endurance, in turn, an approved condition.”

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “an approved condition” with whom?

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s with Jehovah.

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:33.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The approved condition,
in turn, hope,

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hope
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:37.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why not?

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:39.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of this relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Because the love of God

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:46.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has been poured out into our hearts
through the holy spirit,

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was given to us.”

00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:53.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we endure trials,
we can sense Jehovah’s approval,

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:57.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps us
to rejoice despite the hardship.

00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:00.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now find Romans 8:38, 39.

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know, Paul experienced
one trial after the other,

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet he was convinced that no trial

00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could distance him from Jehovah
(could separate him from God’s love),

00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:15.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an abiding relationship.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:38, 39 says: “For I am convinced

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:24.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that neither death nor life
nor angels nor governments

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor things now here nor things to come

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor powers nor height nor depth

00:02:31.178 --> 00:02:34.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then he says] nor any other creation

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to separate us from God’s love

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our relationship with God
can help us in times of trial.

00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:47.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how about the second gift from Jehovah?

00:02:47.654 --> 00:02:51.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:9
—1 Peter 5:9—

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:54.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan tries to capitalize on our trials,

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:57.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice the admonition here in verse 9.

00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:02.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But take your stand
against him, firm in the faith.”

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will help?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Knowing that the same
kind of sufferings [so trials]

00:03:08.884 --> 00:03:11.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are being experienced
by the entire association

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your brothers in the world.”

00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:17.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have felt that trust,

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:20.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the support from our brotherhood,
particularly in these last six months or so.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve sensed it so clearly.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:26.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:12 is our third gift from Jehovah

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a provision to help us to endure trials.

00:03:29.573 --> 00:03:34.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:12 and it says it
so very crystal clear.

00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:38.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Rejoice in the hope.”

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:41.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it adds: “Endure under tribulation.

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persevere in prayer.”

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:48.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our relationship with Jehovah,
the brotherhood,

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:52.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our hope can help us
deal with these circumstances,

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it might vary
depending on circumstance.

00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as an example,
a brother in prison might have

00:03:58.394 --> 00:04:01.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no access at all to the brotherhood.

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:03.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what sustains him?

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:07.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that case, it would be
his relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:12.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be remembering Brother Harold King
on JW Broadcasting®.

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For four and a half years,

00:04:14.203 --> 00:04:18.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was in solitary confinement
in a Chinese prison.

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:20.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was he really all alone?

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The authorities thought so,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he had the best cell mate
anyone would ever want.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:31.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in his video interview:

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:34.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I had a lovely relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:37.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I loved him very dearly.
He was real.

00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t fictitious.”

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Brother King was able
to rejoice under that trial

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:48.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had developed
that real relationship with his God.

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example:
A depressed brother or a sister

00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:56.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be struggling to maintain
his relationship with God.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:05:00.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s another gift
from Jehovah that can come into play.

00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may be supported by one
or more of the brotherhood.

00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:08.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like a person
who’s fighting to breathe properly.

00:05:08.634 --> 00:05:12.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s still alive,
but he’s struggling to hold on.

00:05:12.597 --> 00:05:15.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in comes
the support of a medical team,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he begins functioning normally again
and breathing properly.

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:23.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brotherhood can come
to our aid and support

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:28.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re suffering depression
or some other serious trial.

00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:33.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can our hope
help us to rejoice despite the trial?

00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:37.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example:
Some of us have Christian parents

00:05:37.665 --> 00:05:42.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are now old and incapacitated
in some way, and that’s a trial for us.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be like a loved one
having a bad accident,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he’s laid up in a hospital bed.

00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:52.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can’t take care of himself.

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:57.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the doctor comes in and says,
“He’s going to have a full recovery.”

00:05:57.602 --> 00:05:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that gives us hope.

00:05:59.896 --> 00:06:04.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s similar with our elderly parents
because of our sure hope for the future.

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:06.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like Jehovah saying,

00:06:06.612 --> 00:06:10.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They’re going to have a full recovery
from the ravages of old age.’

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope helps us to rejoice.

00:06:13.702 --> 00:06:18.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever our situation or trial, we can
be sure that one or more of these provisions

00:06:18.582 --> 00:06:22.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us
suffer through the hardship with joy.

00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:25.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to find now Romans chapter 8,

00:06:29.594 --> 00:06:33.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 8, and we’re going
to look at verses 35 and 37.

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:37.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,
we’re going to be considering

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:40.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of the seven trials
mentioned in verse 35.

00:06:40.272 --> 00:06:42.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please identify them with me.

00:06:42.065 --> 00:06:45.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:35 says:

00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:48.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who will separate us
from the love of the Christ?

00:06:48.906 --> 00:06:51.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will [1] tribulation or [2] distress

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or [3] persecution
or [4] hunger or [5] nakedness

00:06:54.745 --> 00:06:56.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or [6] danger or [7] sword?”

00:06:56.747 --> 00:06:59.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the seven,
but now look at verse 37.

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:03.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “On the contrary,
in all these things [all seven of them]

00:07:03.296 --> 00:07:08.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are coming off completely victorious
through the one who loved us.”

00:07:09.052 --> 00:07:11.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, each symposium talk

00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:14.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will include a video
of a brother or sister

00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:18.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who experienced a trial, a severe one.

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:21.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will identify which of these gifts

00:07:21.648 --> 00:07:26.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped them to rejoice
despite the tribulation.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider that first one
that Paul addressed;

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s called “tribulation.”

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:35.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tribulation refers to suffering
caused by some trying situation,

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:39.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly a debilitating illness.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:42.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 12,

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:50.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Corinthians chapter 12, and we’re going
to look at verses 7 and 8.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tribulation was vexing to Paul,

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:56.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much so that he
called it a thorn in his flesh.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:08:00.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 12:7, 8 says:
“To keep me from becoming overly exalted,

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:03.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was given a thorn in the flesh,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me,

00:08:06.445 --> 00:08:09.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might not be overly exalted.

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:11.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Three times I begged the Lord about this,

00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:14.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would depart from me.”

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:19.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A thorn in the flesh”
—so this obviously was a physical malady,

00:08:19.584 --> 00:08:23.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said it kept “slapping [him],”
so it was continuing on.

00:08:23.922 --> 00:08:28.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just like the common cold or flu,
and we’re better in a week or so.

00:08:28.468 --> 00:08:30.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was continual.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a chronic trial for him to deal with,

00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:35.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and based on the Scriptures,
it’s thought that it may have been

00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:39.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a serious degeneration of his eyesight.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that would have been
very disconcerting to Paul.

00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:46.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he prayed three times
that it would be gone.

00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:48.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Take it away from me.’

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, they did not have
eyeglasses with corrective lenses back then

00:08:51.534 --> 00:08:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no eye surgery was available.

00:08:53.995 --> 00:08:57.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a chronic tribulation.

00:08:57.832 --> 00:09:00.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
By means of holy spirit,

00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:05.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had on a number of occasions
cured people of their sickness.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he could have easily wondered:

00:09:07.926 --> 00:09:10.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where is this gift of the holy spirit
when I need it?

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:12.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need a cure.’

00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:16.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what helped Paul to rejoice
despite his tribulation?

00:09:16.727 --> 00:09:19.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his close,
abiding relationship with Jehovah.

00:09:19.939 --> 00:09:22.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you still have 2 Corinthians
chapter 12 there,

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together verse 9.

00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is where Jehovah tells Paul,

00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:31.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You will have no miraculous cure.’

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:35.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 9: “But he said to me:

00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My undeserved kindness
is sufficient for you,

00:09:38.374 --> 00:09:41.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my power is being made perfect
in weakness.’”

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says, ‘No cure,

00:09:43.797 --> 00:09:48.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m going to give you the power
to continue on despite the tribulation.’

00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:53.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice the relationship
that Paul evidently has with Jehovah

00:09:53.223 --> 00:09:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last part of that verse.

00:09:55.809 --> 00:10:00.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Most gladly, then,
I will boast about my weaknesses,

00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:05.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order that the power of the Christ
may remain over me like a tent.”

00:10:05.403 --> 00:10:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rejoiced in the strength from Jehovah.

00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:13.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 10;
he said: “So I take pleasure

00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:17.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and we can substitute
with the word “rejoice.” I rejoice]

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in weaknesses,
in insults, in times of need,

00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in persecutions
and difficulties, for Christ.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For when I am weak,
then I am powerful.”

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we want you to watch a video,

00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:34.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is an example of tribulation.

00:10:34.892 --> 00:10:38.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped this brother and his wife

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice under tribulation
in the form of a serious illness?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For  the last 45 years,
I’ve been in the pioneer work,

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:01.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveling work,

00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:05.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Bethel here
for a number of years.

00:11:05.382 --> 00:11:08.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My health was very good

00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:11.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never had any problems at all.

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:15.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I had a headache.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was severe.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really couldn’t see clearly—anything.

00:11:23.192 --> 00:11:27.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to the Bethel doctor,
and he referred us to a specialist,

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:29.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the specialist
gave us the diagnosis

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:34.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor
called glioblastoma.

00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:39.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:11:41.795 --> 00:11:44.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, after surgery, he had radiation

00:11:44.798 --> 00:11:47.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chemotherapy at the same time.

00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A year later, he had to have another surgery.

00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:56.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now he is on his fourth type

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of chemotherapy treatment.

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:03.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first time that he got sick,
the hardest thing

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:07.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to see my husband
become increasingly dependent

00:12:07.405 --> 00:12:11.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon me and upon other people.

00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want this

00:12:14.037 --> 00:12:16.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to define who we are.

00:12:19.626 --> 00:12:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers played a pivotal role

00:12:22.129 --> 00:12:24.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tried to help us.

00:12:24.757 --> 00:12:28.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother found out
that I had to go in for surgery.

00:12:28.427 --> 00:12:30.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me a scripture,

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:33.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we prayed together.

00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:35.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll always remember that.

00:12:35.851 --> 00:12:37.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a beautiful example.

00:12:39.814 --> 00:12:43.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also get a lot
of encouragement from Sara,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:52.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we go out in service,
I’ve gotten the opportunity

00:12:52.577 --> 00:12:56.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help people

00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:59.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just talk to them
and encourage them.

00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:05.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my Bethel assignment

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:09.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Service Department,
I have a brother or two

00:13:09.345 --> 00:13:13.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will come over and review a case

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:18.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re considering,
and I get a lot of joy in that way.

00:13:18.062 --> 00:13:22.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very thankful that I
can still do a little something

00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:24.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me,

00:13:27.822 --> 00:13:32.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’s been humble
through this whole thing, it’s been easier.

00:13:34.454 --> 00:13:38.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My hope is strong, and I’m going to keep

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:40.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on going this way
and serve Jehovah

00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:44.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on into the new world
or whatever comes.

00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:49.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Scott and Sara Shoffner

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:51.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a good relationship with Jehovah,

00:13:51.973 --> 00:13:55.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sara supported Scott wonderfully.

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:59.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice
the additional gift from Jehovah?

00:13:59.147 --> 00:14:03.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scott said that the brotherhood
played a pivotal role in helping them.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembered
a specific scripture and a prayer

00:14:06.112 --> 00:14:08.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was shared before his surgery,

00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:12.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and young brothers came in and helped him
with his assignment afterward.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his own words,
he said that that brought him “a lot of joy”

00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:18.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy despite tribulation.

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how about you?

00:14:20.961 --> 00:14:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which of the provisions
from Jehovah is buoying you up

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you deal
with your particular trial or tribulation?

00:14:28.553 --> 00:14:30.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your relationship with Jehovah?

00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:35.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the brotherhood, your hope,
or maybe some other gift from God?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re stressed, under tribulation,

00:14:39.064 --> 00:14:43.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember this: It’s as if Jehovah
is watching the monitor,

00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sees us in pain of heart.

00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:49.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he reassures us and says: ‘Be calm.

00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:51.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to be OK.’

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:54.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no matter the pain,
no matter the tribulation,

00:14:54.329 --> 00:14:56.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we remember
those words at Romans

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 8, verses 37 and 39:

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:05.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In all these things we
are coming off completely victorious

00:15:05.633 --> 00:15:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who loved us.”

00:15:07.677 --> 00:15:10.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 39, it’s saying that nothing,

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:14.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing, no tribulation
“will be able to separate us

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:18.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from God’s love
that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:23.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rejoice despite tribulation.

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:26.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now it’s my pleasure to introduce

00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:29.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Samuel Herd,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:15:29.074 --> 00:15:31.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the talk on the symposium

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Rejoice Despite . . . Distress.”

Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this special edition
of JW Broadcasting®

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
originating from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our programs this month and next

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will feature the entire
regional convention program for 2020.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:24.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in cancellations

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of gatherings around the world,
Jehovah continues to provide

00:00:28.424 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual “food at the proper time.”

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time this program was recorded,

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local governments
had already mandated social distancing.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In compliance,
we filmed the entire convention program

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without an audience, and we are pleased
to present it to you now.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In behalf of the Governing Body
and all the brothers and sisters

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working unitedly here at world headquarters,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s my pleasure
to extend to every one of you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very warm welcome!

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our convention program
this year has as its theme

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always Rejoice!”

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our theme scripture
for this opening day is Philippians 4:4:

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:17.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again I will say, Rejoice!”

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This first session of our convention
begins with a music-video presentation.

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:29.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video highlights the joy we experience

00:01:29.027 --> 00:01:31.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we gather together for worship.

00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have with you a cellular telephone
or other electronic device,

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please adjust it to a setting
that will not disturb others.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:45.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, please enjoy the presentation.

00:11:48.692 --> 00:11:52.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are delighted that you could join us
for this opening session

00:11:52.487 --> 00:11:56.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Always Rejoice”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:11:56.617 --> 00:12:00.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please stand as we
sing together song number 111,

00:12:00.913 --> 00:12:04.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Our Reasons for Joy.”

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:09.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may pause the program
for your local opening prayer.

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:12.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 111.

00:14:32.732 --> 00:14:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:14:34.984 --> 00:14:39.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it realistic for us
to rejoice at all times?

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:43.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, how is it possible?

00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay careful attention
to Brother Kenneth Cook,

00:14:47.497 --> 00:14:50.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:54.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he directs attention
to our source of joy in the talk

00:14:54.671 --> 00:14:57.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why Jehovah Is ‘the Happy God.’”

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:08.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the 2020 “Always Rejoice”!

00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:11.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regional Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the start, we wish to convey to you

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:19.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greetings from the Governing Body
and the entire Bethel family.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want you to know that we love you,
and we keep you in our prayers.

00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, whether you are watching
this from home or from some other location,

00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is our convention for 2020.

00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:38.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what an encouraging theme,
“Always Rejoice”!

00:15:38.089 --> 00:15:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to discuss this subject

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:43.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now more than ever before, don’t we?

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to rejoice
as the world crumbles around us?

00:15:47.599 --> 00:15:49.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is.

00:15:49.643 --> 00:15:54.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who love Jehovah
can always find reasons to rejoice.

00:15:54.022 --> 00:15:56.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout this convention,
we will discuss

00:15:56.858 --> 00:15:59.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four things
that will help us to rejoice.

00:15:59.736 --> 00:16:01.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are they?

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) We will consider
the reasons we have for rejoicing,

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we will examine
how we can cultivate godly joy,

00:16:11.123 --> 00:16:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) we will look at how we
can maintain joy despite trials,

00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (4) we will discuss
how to express joy,

00:16:20.048 --> 00:16:24.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, the joy we receive
from serving Jehovah.

00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:27.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s lay the foundation
for all of this

00:16:27.431 --> 00:16:29.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by first answering the question:

00:16:29.892 --> 00:16:32.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is true joy?

00:16:32.644 --> 00:16:35.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is commonly called joy

00:16:35.105 --> 00:16:38.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an emotion that is stirred
by a feeling of well-being,

00:16:38.776 --> 00:16:40.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a sense of success,

00:16:40.861 --> 00:16:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or because of expecting
something good.

00:16:43.906 --> 00:16:47.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for this reason,
joy may seem to come and go

00:16:47.493 --> 00:16:50.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on what
is happening around us.

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might call it circumstantial joy.

00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:56.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not the case with true joy.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:00.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because true joy
—godly joy—

00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an aspect of the fruitage
of God’s holy spirit.

00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:07.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True joy is a quality of the heart

00:17:07.805 --> 00:17:12.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is not dependent on external things
happening around us.

00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This godly quality comes
from knowing that you have the truth,

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are doing what pleases God,

00:17:19.483 --> 00:17:23.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that your Kingdom hope
is certain to be fulfilled.

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, we see
there’s a big difference

00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:28.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between having circumstantial joy

00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:31.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having “joy of holy spirit.”

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is illustrated for us in the Scriptures

00:17:34.498 --> 00:17:38.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the example
of the Christians in Thessalonica.

00:17:38.002 --> 00:17:41.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul and others
helped them to prepare ahead of time

00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:44.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face persecution with joy,

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:46.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare they did.

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:48.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:17:48.262 --> 00:17:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became strong in faith.

00:17:51.265 --> 00:17:53.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read
about what this did for them

00:17:53.893 --> 00:17:58.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 1:6.

00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read the verse, ask yourself,

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where did their deep-seated joy come from?’

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse reads:

00:18:06.322 --> 00:18:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you became imitators of us,
and of the Lord,

00:18:09.992 --> 00:18:14.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seeing that you accepted
the word under much tribulation

00:18:14.539 --> 00:18:17.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with joy of holy spirit.”

00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:20.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did their joy come from?

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things are mentioned:
They imitated good examples,

00:18:25.174 --> 00:18:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had the joy that comes
from having God’s holy spirit on them.

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can acquire
“joy of holy spirit,” as mentioned here,

00:18:35.184 --> 00:18:37.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by applying what we learn

00:18:37.437 --> 00:18:41.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeking Jehovah’s blessing,
his spirit.

00:18:41.107 --> 00:18:44.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is not a mere personality trait

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:47.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are born with then, is it?

00:18:47.155 --> 00:18:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it doesn’t come to us
simply because of pleasant circumstances.

00:18:51.701 --> 00:18:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Joy of holy spirit”
is found deep within us.

00:18:56.206 --> 00:19:01.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it should not be confused
with simply being cheerful or exuberant.

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:04.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is not superficial.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not found
in constantly smiling or laughing.

00:19:08.635 --> 00:19:11.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To show the difference,
think of a comedian

00:19:11.638 --> 00:19:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who seems to be able
to find what is funny

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just about any situation in life.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:22.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, deep down inside,
he may be very unhappy.

00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:26.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, like the Christians
in Thessalonica,

00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:29.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can have “joy of holy spirit”

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we
are under tribulation.

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not smile
through a bad time,

00:19:34.577 --> 00:19:39.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our deep inner joy
in serving Jehovah is immovable.

00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of “the new personality”

00:19:41.918 --> 00:19:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that true Christians put on
in order to be like Christ.

00:19:46.256 --> 00:19:51.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with this basic understanding
of godly joy in mind,

00:19:51.011 --> 00:19:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s give our attention
to Brother Stephen Lett,

00:19:54.222 --> 00:19:57.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
as he welcomes us

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:01.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this “Always Rejoice”! convention.

00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:05.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please listen carefully
as he explains why godly joy

00:20:05.817 --> 00:20:08.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is such a special quality.

00:20:10.113 --> 00:20:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the “Always Rejoice”!

00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:20:18.455 --> 00:20:19.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:21.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you were able to arrange

00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:23.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attend all three days

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.004 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of this convention.

00:20:26.004 --> 00:20:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were the apostle Paul’s words

00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:4 chosen

00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:35.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the theme for this year’s convention?

00:20:35.514 --> 00:20:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, over the past four years,

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:41.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
has used conventions

00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to highlight qualities

00:20:44.648 --> 00:20:47.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that endear us to Jehovah

00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to be victorious

00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our struggle
against Satan and his world.

00:20:55.951 --> 00:21:00.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had convention themes
that focused on the need

00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:02.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for loyalty,

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
endurance,

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:08.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
courage,

00:21:08.922 --> 00:21:11.550 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and love.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.885 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This year,

00:21:12.885 --> 00:21:14.345 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the convention theme highlights

00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:16.972 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the need for joy.

00:21:16.972 --> 00:21:19.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At Nehemiah 8:10,

00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:21.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told:

00:21:21.769 --> 00:21:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:21:26.273 --> 00:21:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future,

00:21:28.651 --> 00:21:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith will be tested
as never before.

00:21:33.447 --> 00:21:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we acquire true joy
with the help of God’s holy spirit,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to stand firm

00:21:41.121 --> 00:21:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weather all the storms
that come our way.

00:21:46.877 --> 00:21:51.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy is a deep-seated quality
of the heart.

00:21:51.715 --> 00:21:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a state of happiness that remains

00:21:55.511 --> 00:22:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the conditions
around us are pleasant or not.

00:22:00.224 --> 00:22:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, a person
can be disturbed about something

00:22:05.187 --> 00:22:09.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still have joy in his heart.

00:22:10.109 --> 00:22:13.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the apostles were flogged

00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:15.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for speaking about the Christ.

00:22:15.573 --> 00:22:18.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, “they went out
from before the Sanhedrin,

00:22:18.743 --> 00:22:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rejoicing because they
had been counted worthy

00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be dishonored in behalf of his name.”

00:22:27.502 --> 00:22:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, they weren’t rejoicing
over the flogging they had received.

00:22:32.507 --> 00:22:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as servants of God,

00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:37.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found true joy

00:22:37.261 --> 00:22:41.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping their integrity to him.

00:22:42.558 --> 00:22:46.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, is it possible for a Christian

00:22:46.646 --> 00:22:49.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always to be rejoicing?

00:22:49.607 --> 00:22:54.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, because true joy is an aspect

00:22:54.612 --> 00:22:58.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit.

00:22:58.199 --> 00:23:00.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an inward quality,

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:04.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joy is not dependent on external things,

00:23:04.205 --> 00:23:06.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even on our brothers.

00:23:06.708 --> 00:23:11.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does depend on God’s spirit.

00:23:11.129 --> 00:23:13.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as already noted,

00:23:13.298 --> 00:23:17.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy comes
from that deep inner satisfaction

00:23:17.927 --> 00:23:20.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of knowing that we have the truth,

00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re doing what pleases Jehovah,

00:23:23.933 --> 00:23:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that our Kingdom hope is sure.

00:23:28.354 --> 00:23:33.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So godly joy is not the transient joy

00:23:33.193 --> 00:23:38.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people experience 
because they’ve secured a well-paying job,

00:23:38.198 --> 00:23:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gone on an exotic vacation,

00:23:41.284 --> 00:23:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attained fame and prestige,

00:23:44.454 --> 00:23:48.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or acquired some
coveted material item

00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:50.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or large sum of money.

00:23:50.502 --> 00:23:55.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, true joy has to be cultivated

00:23:55.507 --> 00:23:57.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of holy spirit.

00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:01.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To obtain Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:06.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to draw close to him
and give him exclusive devotion.

00:24:06.309 --> 00:24:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 5:32,

00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told that God gives holy spirit

00:24:12.274 --> 00:24:16.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those obeying him as ruler.”

00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:20.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these three days,
the convention program

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:24.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to deepen
our appreciation

00:24:24.744 --> 00:24:26.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for godly joy.

00:24:26.872 --> 00:24:30.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn what true joy is,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to cultivate it,

00:24:32.502 --> 00:24:36.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to maintain it during difficult times,

00:24:36.089 --> 00:24:38.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to display it

00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:41.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it wells up in our hearts.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such joy will clearly identify us

00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:48.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as disciples of Jesus,

00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:51.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will enable us to serve

00:24:51.313 --> 00:24:55.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as beacons of light in this dark world

00:24:55.234 --> 00:24:59.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw others to our “happy God.”

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll note
that nearly the entire second day

00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:07.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been devoted
to the joy of disciple-making.

00:25:09.122 --> 00:25:11.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly joy will help us

00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face challenges to our integrity.

00:25:14.837 --> 00:25:18.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that it was
“the joy that was set before him”

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped Jesus to face

00:25:20.551 --> 00:25:24.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an excruciating death on a torture stake.

00:25:25.347 --> 00:25:29.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please pay rapt attention
to the talks and videos.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look up the scriptures,
and read them along with the speakers,

00:25:34.148 --> 00:25:37.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus allowing God’s Word

00:25:37.067 --> 00:25:42.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to exert its powerful force
on your heart.

00:25:42.072 --> 00:25:45.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this convention
become a milestone

00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:47.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your development

00:25:47.828 --> 00:25:52.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:25:53.626 --> 00:25:58.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are
that he made us “in his image,”

00:25:58.589 --> 00:26:00.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving us the capacity

00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:05.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel and express godly joy!

00:26:05.012 --> 00:26:10.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we are
that he also gives us his holy spirit

00:26:10.017 --> 00:26:13.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cultivate that kind of joy!

00:26:13.479 --> 00:26:17.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much,

00:26:17.274 --> 00:26:20.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray that each one of you

00:26:20.945 --> 00:26:23.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will forever respond to the words

00:26:23.864 --> 00:26:27.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the psalmist at Psalm 100:2:

00:26:27.618 --> 00:26:31.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:36.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come into his presence
with joyful shouting.”

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:43.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wish to thank Brother Lett
for building up our anticipation

00:26:43.384 --> 00:26:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this “Always Rejoice”! convention.

00:26:46.429 --> 00:26:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Lett highlighted,

00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:52.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
godly joy is indeed a very special quality.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:56.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such true joy
comes from Jehovah himself.

00:26:56.189 --> 00:26:59.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible
says that he always

00:26:59.817 --> 00:27:03.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has reasons to rejoice
—so much so

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:07.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that being happy
describes his personality.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see this for ourselves

00:27:09.744 --> 00:27:13.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read 1 Timothy 1:11.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The context in verses 8 through 10

00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:19.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists many of the bad qualities and actions

00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:22.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people of this world display.

00:27:22.423 --> 00:27:25.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they can change if they listen

00:27:25.093 --> 00:27:27.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our joyful God, Jehovah.

00:27:27.762 --> 00:27:31.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,
note the apostle Paul’s inspired words

00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 11,
as he goes on to say

00:27:35.562 --> 00:27:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the glorious good news
of the happy God,

00:27:40.024 --> 00:27:43.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with which I was entrusted.”

00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:46.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can Jehovah be called happy

00:27:46.072 --> 00:27:50.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite seeing all of the problems
and suffering on the earth?

00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:55.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, among the many things
that make him happy are the following four.

00:27:55.081 --> 00:27:58.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Jehovah is the Creator.

00:27:58.168 --> 00:28:01.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he does is perfect.

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:04.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:4 says:

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:06.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Perfect is his activity.”

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, Jehovah
can rightly rejoice in his creation.

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:14.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fact is undeniable,
and it’s clearly stated

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:18.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Psalm 104:31.

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read it together,

00:28:20.857 --> 00:28:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how determined
Jehovah is to keep his joy.

00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:28.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31 says:

00:28:28.323 --> 00:28:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The glory of Jehovah will last forever.

00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will rejoice in his works.”

00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:40.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:
Jehovah will not be denied, will he?

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:44.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will find joy
in what he has accomplished.

00:28:44.631 --> 00:28:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can take that from him.

00:28:46.842 --> 00:28:50.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the happy God whose purpose for man

00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:52.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the earth will be realized.

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:56.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adding to his happiness is reason (2)

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is generous.

00:28:58.729 --> 00:29:02.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know what the Bible
says about those who give.

00:29:02.482 --> 00:29:06.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And aren’t we grateful
for all that Jehovah is providing

00:29:06.486 --> 00:29:11.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us and support us
now through a very difficult time?

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:14.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) Jehovah’s heart is made glad

00:29:14.661 --> 00:29:17.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the faithfulness of his servants.

00:29:17.664 --> 00:29:20.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never forgets all that we have done.

00:29:20.751 --> 00:29:24.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 23:15, he says:

00:29:24.171 --> 00:29:26.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If your heart becomes wise,

00:29:26.632 --> 00:29:30.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then my own heart will rejoice.”

00:29:30.177 --> 00:29:33.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we remain faithful to Jehovah,

00:29:33.472 --> 00:29:37.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy that we
can bring to him will last forever.

00:29:37.851 --> 00:29:42.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(4) Because Jehovah is perfect,

00:29:42.272 --> 00:29:44.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he always does what is right.

00:29:44.525 --> 00:29:49.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will never do anything
to spoil his own happiness.

00:29:49.405 --> 00:29:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now that we have looked
at what makes Jehovah the happy God,

00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:56.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to know what makes us happy,

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, what makes us truly happy

00:29:58.706 --> 00:30:01.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—deep-down-inside happy.

00:30:01.709 --> 00:30:06.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, it’s not difficult
to find superficial happiness.

00:30:06.505 --> 00:30:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, when you’re near
someone with a funny laugh,

00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:13.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you often find yourself
laughing as well?

00:30:13.345 --> 00:30:15.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happens, right?

00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:18.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not even know
what you’re laughing about, true?

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:22.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is this:
It’s not all that difficult

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to experience superficial happiness.

00:30:25.608 --> 00:30:29.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to find lasting joy takes effort,

00:30:29.028 --> 00:30:33.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it takes appreciation
for what we have.

00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:38.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will now look at some
of the things that bring us real joy,

00:30:38.245 --> 00:30:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as you might expect,
it begins with Jehovah.

00:30:43.125 --> 00:30:46.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our relationship with Jehovah

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our foremost reason for joy,

00:30:49.215 --> 00:30:51.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not just any relationship;

00:30:51.842 --> 00:30:53.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note of what is needed

00:30:53.928 --> 00:30:58.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read Psalm 16:11.

00:30:58.849 --> 00:31:03.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we do so, first,
notice what Jehovah does.

00:31:03.354 --> 00:31:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, see what type of relationship
we can have with him.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, make the connection to having joy.

00:31:11.696 --> 00:31:15.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 16:11 reads:

00:31:15.408 --> 00:31:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You make known to me the path of life.

00:31:18.995 --> 00:31:23.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your presence is abundant joy.”

00:31:24.834 --> 00:31:27.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So again, first, what does Jehovah do?

00:31:27.754 --> 00:31:31.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kindly makes
“the path of life” known to us.

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:35.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, what type of relationship
can we have with him?

00:31:35.928 --> 00:31:40.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A very close one, it says,
as if “in [his very] presence.”

00:31:40.892 --> 00:31:44.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we read that “in [his] presence,”
there is what?

00:31:44.896 --> 00:31:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abundant joy.”

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:52.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, along with having
a close relationship with Jehovah,

00:31:52.612 --> 00:31:56.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned there,
what else brings us joy?

00:31:56.533 --> 00:31:58.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s holy spirit does.

00:31:58.993 --> 00:32:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His holy spirit generates joy
in those who receive it.

00:32:03.706 --> 00:32:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason, we should pray
to receive his holy spirit every day.

00:32:08.378 --> 00:32:11.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else promotes true joy within us?

00:32:11.256 --> 00:32:13.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our marvelous hope.

00:32:13.383 --> 00:32:16.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we have
an abundance of spiritual food,

00:32:16.678 --> 00:32:20.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under difficult circumstances.

00:32:20.265 --> 00:32:23.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That joyful blessing
was foretold in God’s Word.

00:32:23.852 --> 00:32:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see it, please go

00:32:25.854 --> 00:32:30.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Isaiah 65:13, 14.

00:32:30.859 --> 00:32:35.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in these verses,
Jehovah draws a contrast

00:32:35.363 --> 00:32:37.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between good people
and bad people

00:32:37.949 --> 00:32:40.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says this,
starting in verse 13:

00:32:43.288 --> 00:32:47.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore this is what
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Look!

00:32:47.959 --> 00:32:51.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will eat,
but you will go hungry.

00:32:51.379 --> 00:32:52.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:32:52.797 --> 00:32:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will drink,
but you will go thirsty.

00:32:56.426 --> 00:32:58.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:32:58.053 --> 00:33:02.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will rejoice,
but you will suffer shame.

00:33:02.015 --> 00:33:03.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:33:03.391 --> 00:33:08.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My servants will shout joyfully
because of the good condition of the heart,

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:13.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will cry out
because of the pain of heart.’”

00:33:14.903 --> 00:33:19.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see yourself
on Jehovah’s side of this contrast?

00:33:19.116 --> 00:33:22.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve been keeping up
with God’s organization,

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should feel well-fed spiritually.

00:33:25.372 --> 00:33:27.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bad conditions of this world

00:33:27.374 --> 00:33:30.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must not be permitted
to take away from our joy.

00:33:30.752 --> 00:33:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah said:
“[We] shout joyfully.”

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:34.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:33:34.631 --> 00:33:37.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of the good condition
of the heart.”

00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:40.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are more ready than ever before

00:33:40.429 --> 00:33:43.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the realization of our hope.

00:33:43.182 --> 00:33:47.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
the world around us is suffering

00:33:47.603 --> 00:33:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they lack clear direction

00:33:50.647 --> 00:33:53.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are without real hope.

00:33:53.192 --> 00:33:57.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout our lives,
and especially at times like this,

00:33:57.529 --> 00:34:00.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should take note
of Jehovah’s help.

00:34:00.991 --> 00:34:05.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see that Jehovah is helping us,
we know that he is with us.

00:34:05.954 --> 00:34:10.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just know it
—and this too brings us immense joy!

00:34:10.959 --> 00:34:15.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we find joy in hearing
the expressions of faith

00:34:15.506 --> 00:34:19.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come from our dear brothers
and sisters, don’t we?

00:34:19.301 --> 00:34:23.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is true whether we
meet together for worship in person

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whether we meet
by means of video.

00:34:26.642 --> 00:34:31.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, with so much
to add to our inner joy,

00:34:31.355 --> 00:34:35.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can come to have a joy
so strong and so deep within us

00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:37.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nothing can shake it.

00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even persecution,

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though not enjoyable in itself,
can lead to joy.

00:34:43.742 --> 00:34:45.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:49.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said at Matthew 5:11, 12:

00:34:49.582 --> 00:34:53.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people reproach you

00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and persecute you and lyingly say

00:34:55.796 --> 00:34:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every sort of wicked thing
against you for my sake.

00:34:59.175 --> 00:35:01.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:35:01.635 --> 00:35:04.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since your reward is great.”

00:35:04.388 --> 00:35:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we be joyful

00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though we are persecuted?

00:35:10.186 --> 00:35:13.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when we endure persecution

00:35:13.773 --> 00:35:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with joy and keep our integrity,

00:35:16.192 --> 00:35:19.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we gain a victory and Jehovah’s approval.

00:35:19.737 --> 00:35:22.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Rejoice and be overjoyed,

00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:26.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since your reward is great.”

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so far, we have defined true joy,

00:35:29.413 --> 00:35:33.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have examined why Jehovah
is called “the happy God,”

00:35:33.584 --> 00:35:37.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have reviewed
a number of things that bring us godly joy.

00:35:37.588 --> 00:35:40.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at this point, you may be wondering,

00:35:40.675 --> 00:35:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I really be happy if I am suffering?’

00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:46.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a very good question.

00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:49.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s look some more at how

00:35:49.434 --> 00:35:53.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in what sense we can “always rejoice.”

00:35:53.146 --> 00:35:58.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that at times all of us
may be saddened by injustice,

00:35:58.151 --> 00:36:01.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poor health, unemployment, grief,

00:36:01.696 --> 00:36:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other causes of anxiety

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as mankind has experienced
with this global pandemic.

00:36:09.245 --> 00:36:11.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of our brothers and sisters

00:36:11.831 --> 00:36:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been affected
by such things, haven’t they?

00:36:14.542 --> 00:36:16.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since that is the case,

00:36:16.586 --> 00:36:20.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look at how we can apply
the words of our convention theme,

00:36:20.798 --> 00:36:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:4.

00:36:25.094 --> 00:36:29.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we read verse 4
—Philippians 4:4—

00:36:29.933 --> 00:36:33.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the apostle Paul writing this

00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:36.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while he was in prison bonds, or chains.

00:36:36.398 --> 00:36:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, full of faith,

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said this with God’s spirit on him:

00:36:41.903 --> 00:36:44.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:36:44.698 --> 00:36:48.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again I will say, Rejoice!”

00:36:48.618 --> 00:36:51.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why could Paul say this so emphatically?

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the apostle Paul was a man

00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:58.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had true godly joy.

00:36:58.378 --> 00:37:02.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had true joy that was not dependent
on what was happening around him

00:37:02.883 --> 00:37:05.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or what was happening to him.

00:37:05.135 --> 00:37:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From a heart filled with faith,
he said that he had joy

00:37:08.597 --> 00:37:11.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was focused in,
or on, the Lord.

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:14.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why Paul was joyful

00:37:14.311 --> 00:37:19.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any injustice
or anxiety that he experienced.

00:37:19.149 --> 00:37:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always rejoice,”
he said, “again . . . rejoice.”

00:37:24.112 --> 00:37:27.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help us to apply
these inspired words?

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:32.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Paul, we too can always rejoice,
despite unpleasant circumstances,

00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:36.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we grow in faith and seek true joy.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:40.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too seek joy that’s not merely
the result of what happens

00:37:40.754 --> 00:37:44.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around us or what happens to us.

00:37:44.174 --> 00:37:47.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray earnestly for God’s spirit,

00:37:47.511 --> 00:37:50.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helps us to succeed

00:37:50.222 --> 00:37:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep our deep inner joy
no matter what trial we may face.

00:37:54.643 --> 00:37:56.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more than this,

00:37:56.979 --> 00:38:00.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have Jehovah’s example to imitate.

00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:05.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has maintained his joy
despite much heartache.

00:38:05.237 --> 00:38:07.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has he endured?

00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:11.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, over a period of about 4,000 years,

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw a number of angels
rebel against his sovereignty.

00:38:16.665 --> 00:38:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw Adam and Eve rebel.

00:38:19.168 --> 00:38:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He watched wickedness
spread across the earth.

00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw false worship spread,

00:38:25.174 --> 00:38:28.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this included
what his chosen people, the Israelites,

00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:31.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did as they reverted again

00:38:31.764 --> 00:38:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and again to apostasy.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, Jehovah saw his enemies

00:38:37.978 --> 00:38:40.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put his Son to death.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through it all,
though unimaginably painful for Him,

00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:47.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never lost his deep-seated joy.

00:38:47.905 --> 00:38:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, imagine his joy

00:38:51.033 --> 00:38:56.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched the vast majority
of the angels keep their integrity.

00:38:56.038 --> 00:38:58.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine his joy

00:38:58.249 --> 00:39:02.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched
faithful Israelites keep their integrity

00:39:02.128 --> 00:39:04.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when faced with death.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:09.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And imagine Jehovah’s joy
as he saw thousands turn

00:39:09.218 --> 00:39:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to following his Son
and become true Christians

00:39:13.222 --> 00:39:17.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a number that today
reaches into the millions.

00:39:17.476 --> 00:39:20.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always been able

00:39:20.062 --> 00:39:23.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the light beyond the storm.

00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:28.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we imitate the happy God
and count our blessings every day,

00:39:28.446 --> 00:39:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during the most difficult times.

00:39:32.074 --> 00:39:36.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us to do this, we have
an entire convention now to enjoy

00:39:36.913 --> 00:39:41.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of it centered
on the thought of always rejoicing.

00:39:41.375 --> 00:39:45.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention includes talks,
symposiums, interviews,

00:39:45.713 --> 00:39:48.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Bible drama, and many videos

00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:51.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will teach us how to cultivate

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and display “joy of holy spirit.”

00:39:54.514 --> 00:39:59.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please look at the convention program,
and let’s see what’s in store for us.

00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:02.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Scriptural theme for the first day

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:07.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also our convention theme scripture,
Philippians 4:4,

00:40:07.193 --> 00:40:11.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which again says:
“Always rejoice in the Lord.

00:40:11.072 --> 00:40:14.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again I will say, Rejoice!”

00:40:14.325 --> 00:40:17.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so much to look forward to

00:40:17.495 --> 00:40:20.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the first day of this program.

00:40:20.373 --> 00:40:23.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
the opening symposium will show

00:40:23.918 --> 00:40:27.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s Jehovah’s advice,
not the world’s wisdom,

00:40:27.213 --> 00:40:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings true joy
when we follow it.

00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:34.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the dramatic Bible reading
will help us to visualize

00:40:34.053 --> 00:40:37.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the events recorded
in the book of Ezra.

00:40:37.348 --> 00:40:40.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, we will enjoy
a faith-strengthening review

00:40:40.935 --> 00:40:44.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how in the past
Jehovah saved his people

00:40:44.939 --> 00:40:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a group and as individuals.

00:40:48.777 --> 00:40:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this critical time,

00:40:51.988 --> 00:40:54.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important for us to take to heart

00:40:54.324 --> 00:40:57.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we will hear in that talk, entitled

00:40:57.535 --> 00:41:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in Jehovah’s Acts 
of Salvation.”

00:41:02.499 --> 00:41:07.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon session,
the second symposium of the day

00:41:07.003 --> 00:41:10.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will explain how the joy
in a family is enhanced

00:41:10.382 --> 00:41:15.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when each member appreciates
and cherishes the others.

00:41:15.303 --> 00:41:17.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last symposium of the day

00:41:17.931 --> 00:41:21.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show how creation
provides convincing proof

00:41:21.059 --> 00:41:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:41:24.229 --> 00:41:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be followed
by a talk that will discuss

00:41:27.524 --> 00:41:30.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we can find more peace and more joy

00:41:30.944 --> 00:41:34.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by avoiding jealousy and competition.

00:41:34.447 --> 00:41:37.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the first day concludes
with a talk that will show us

00:41:37.951 --> 00:41:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how those who truly know
Jehovah are optimistic.

00:41:41.872 --> 00:41:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are generous and patient.

00:41:44.833 --> 00:41:47.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As with each part of this convention,

00:41:47.544 --> 00:41:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listen carefully to this talk, entitled

00:41:51.131 --> 00:41:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close Friendship With Jehovah
Brings the Greatest Joy!”

00:41:56.053 --> 00:42:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now look ahead to the second day
of our convention program.

00:42:00.641 --> 00:42:05.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptural theme
is based on Psalm 105:3,

00:42:05.228 --> 00:42:10.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there in verse 3, we are encouraged
to “boast about his holy name.

00:42:10.192 --> 00:42:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts of those
seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:42:15.197 --> 00:42:19.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One important way
to “boast about [Jehovah’s] holy name”

00:42:19.243 --> 00:42:22.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by means of our disciple-making work.

00:42:22.621 --> 00:42:26.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tying that in with our convention theme,

00:42:26.083 --> 00:42:29.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first symposium of the day
will leave no doubt

00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:32.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our joy increases as our skills

00:42:32.965 --> 00:42:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the disciple-making work improve.

00:42:35.843 --> 00:42:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following this, the second symposium

00:42:39.263 --> 00:42:42.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show how we can find joy
in the ministry when we rely

00:42:42.683 --> 00:42:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the help that God
gives us for this work.

00:42:45.978 --> 00:42:48.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The baptism talk

00:42:48.439 --> 00:42:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help those soon-to-get-baptized
to keep in mind

00:42:51.984 --> 00:42:55.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they need to do in order to be happy

00:42:55.237 --> 00:42:57.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and forever.

00:42:57.948 --> 00:43:00.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon portion
of the second day’s program,

00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:05.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will hear experiences during a series
of videos that will make you proud

00:43:05.623 --> 00:43:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be part of our international brotherhood

00:43:08.751 --> 00:43:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of disciple-makers.

00:43:11.295 --> 00:43:14.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last symposium of day two

00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:16.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will focus on ways you can help
your Bible students

00:43:16.842 --> 00:43:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome their fears

00:43:18.928 --> 00:43:22.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experience Jehovah’s help
and his blessings.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be followed
by a convention highlight

00:43:25.643 --> 00:43:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Part I of the Bible drama

00:43:28.437 --> 00:43:32.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that faith-strengthening drama,

00:43:35.444 --> 00:43:39.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will enjoy the final talk
of the second day, entitled

00:43:39.824 --> 00:43:44.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Making Disciples Now Prepares Us
for New World Disciple-Making.”

00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:48.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This talk will help
to increase our enthusiasm

00:43:48.874 --> 00:43:52.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for the disciple-making
work of today

00:43:52.044 --> 00:43:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for that yet to come.

00:43:55.923 --> 00:43:59.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we go to the final day
of our program.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a Scriptural theme
taken from Psalm 37:4,

00:44:03.764 --> 00:44:06.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final day focuses our attention

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what lies at the heart of true joy.

00:44:10.313 --> 00:44:12.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:4 says:

00:44:12.607 --> 00:44:15.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah as our focus,

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we start the day
with a seven-part symposium

00:44:26.746 --> 00:44:30.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will highlight how we
can endure trials with joy.

00:44:30.917 --> 00:44:34.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward,
during the public Bible discourse,

00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:38.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker will explain
what riches God promises

00:44:38.716 --> 00:44:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they can be obtained.

00:44:42.178 --> 00:44:45.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the concluding session of our convention,

00:44:45.556 --> 00:44:49.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be delighted to watch
the thrilling climax of the Bible drama

00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:53.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:57.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the convention program
will conclude with the talk

00:44:57.986 --> 00:45:01.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find Exquisite Delight in Jehovah!”

00:45:01.573 --> 00:45:03.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will all benefit

00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:07.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the speaker reviews
what helps us now

00:45:07.078 --> 00:45:11.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we have
to look forward to in the future.

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see a preview

00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:17.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the many videos
we will enjoy at this convention?

00:45:17.922 --> 00:45:20.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought so.
Let’s watch.

00:45:23.345 --> 00:45:26.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

00:45:27.932 --> 00:45:30.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:45:30.352 --> 00:45:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the specialist gave us the diagnosis

00:45:32.395 --> 00:45:35.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor.

00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:38.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:42.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient, sarcastic,
and demanding person.

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:46.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:52.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:45:52.582 --> 00:45:55.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:45:55.502 --> 00:45:59.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when everything
around you is chaotic,

00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:03.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:08.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regaining joy is a work in progress.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:13.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired
the beauty and power of the sea.

00:46:13.186 --> 00:46:16.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:18.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just one small human like me.

00:46:25.824 --> 00:46:27.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful preview!

00:46:27.868 --> 00:46:29.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have so many blessings

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate
and to draw strength from.

00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:35.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, enjoy the blessings

00:46:35.417 --> 00:46:38.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cultivating “joy of holy spirit.”

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:40.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this opening discussion,

00:46:40.756 --> 00:46:45.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear that godly joy
does not come from random events;

00:46:45.177 --> 00:46:47.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor does it come from this world.

00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:50.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, godly joy
—true joy—

00:46:50.599 --> 00:46:54.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an aspect of the fruitage
of God’s holy spirit.

00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:58.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will be one of the many blessings
that we will experience

00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:00.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to rejoice?

00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:04.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer,
which this convention will highlight,

00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:08.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at 2 Corinthians 13:11.

00:47:08.242 --> 00:47:10.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read it along with me

00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:14.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 13:11.

00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:19.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Finally, brothers,
continue to rejoice,

00:47:19.587 --> 00:47:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be readjusted, to be comforted,
to think in agreement,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to live peaceably;

00:47:26.468 --> 00:47:30.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the God of love and of peace
will be with you.”

00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:34.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you continue to rejoice

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:36.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in serving Jehovah,
what is the promise?

00:47:36.937 --> 00:47:41.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The promise is that “the God of love
and of peace will be with you.”

00:47:41.942 --> 00:47:43.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,

00:47:43.944 --> 00:47:47.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s be determined
to “always rejoice.”

00:47:47.406 --> 00:47:49.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn, Jehovah,

00:47:49.408 --> 00:47:52.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the happy God,”
will always be with us.

00:47:54.747 --> 00:47:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Cook, for giving us
a preview of the convention program!

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:04.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly want
to keep listening to this entire program

00:48:04.465 --> 00:48:07.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as not to miss any
of what has been prepared.

00:48:09.637 --> 00:48:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People everywhere search for joy,
but many fail to find it.

00:48:14.642 --> 00:48:16.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can true joy be found?

00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:23.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give attention
to the first symposium of this convention.

00:48:23.776 --> 00:48:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Leonard Myers, a helper

00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:48:28.281 --> 00:48:30.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will begin with the talk

00:48:30.283 --> 00:48:34.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Contributes to Joy?—A Simple Life.”

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will then introduce the one to follow.

00:48:44.714 --> 00:48:47.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening song of our convention program

00:48:47.175 --> 00:48:50.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminded us
that “our reasons for joy are abundant”

00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:53.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that true joy “is well-founded,

00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:56.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with roots reaching deep in God’s Word.”

00:48:56.934 --> 00:49:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a tree anchors itself
in the earth’s nourishing soil,

00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:05.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so true joy is anchored
in the sayings of Jehovah.

00:49:05.318 --> 00:49:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those sayings
promise us joy that will last forever.

00:49:10.198 --> 00:49:15.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it also true
that Satan’s world promises to give us joy?

00:49:15.203 --> 00:49:18.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, any measure of joy
derived from things in Satan’s world

00:49:18.832 --> 00:49:21.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as pursuing wealth, wrongdoing,

00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:25.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extreme views of work,
or friendships in the world—

00:49:25.255 --> 00:49:29.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a false joy that is short-lived.

00:49:29.259 --> 00:49:32.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to our illustration of the tree.

00:49:32.262 --> 00:49:36.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can a tree survive if its roots
have been poisoned with chemicals?

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:38.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:40.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how long will we experience joy

00:49:40.812 --> 00:49:44.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we seek it
in this poisonous world of Satan?

00:49:44.316 --> 00:49:46.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long at all.

00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:50.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will contrast
what the world teaches about joy

00:49:50.822 --> 00:49:53.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what God’s Word teaches.

00:49:53.325 --> 00:49:57.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you listen and watch,
consider these questions:

00:49:57.078 --> 00:50:01.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do the world’s ways
of finding joy not work?

00:50:01.416 --> 00:50:05.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And am I pursuing
what truly contributes to joy?

00:50:06.796 --> 00:50:11.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we’ll discuss how pursuing
a simple life contributes to joy.

00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:18.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world teaches that pursuing wealth
and having money will make you happy.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And an illustration of Jesus
in Luke chapter 12 highlights that point.

00:50:22.312 --> 00:50:26.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there with me, Luke chapter 12.

00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:29.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the illustration,
the land of a rich man produced well.

00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:32.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He planned on building bigger storehouses.

00:50:32.781 --> 00:50:37.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice, Luke 12:19,
what the man said to himself:

00:50:37.202 --> 00:50:41.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have many good things
stored up for many years;

00:50:41.707 --> 00:50:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”

00:50:46.837 --> 00:50:50.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the man thought
that because of having many good things,

00:50:50.507 --> 00:50:54.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could enjoy them for many years.

00:50:54.011 --> 00:50:57.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice what God told him,
according to verse 20:

00:50:57.723 --> 00:51:02.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unreasonable one, this night
they are demanding your life from you.

00:51:02.519 --> 00:51:06.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who, then, is to have the things
you stored up?”

00:51:06.273 --> 00:51:11.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in reality, the man’s joy
from pursuing wealth was short-lived.

00:51:12.529 --> 00:51:16.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To further illustrate this point,
as you watch the following dramatization,

00:51:16.867 --> 00:51:20.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how a brother
responds to an offer of more money

00:51:20.371 --> 00:51:22.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it affects his joy.

00:51:41.475 --> 00:51:43.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to see me?

00:51:43.018 --> 00:51:44.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, come on in and go ahead
and close the door, please.

00:51:47.022 --> 00:51:48.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for coming up.

00:51:48.148 --> 00:51:49.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, absolutely.

00:51:49.024 --> 00:51:52.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, all of your projects have
come in on schedule and under budget.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:57.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:51:57.741 --> 00:51:59.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
the whole division to start.

00:51:59.952 --> 00:52:02.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Management team

00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:04.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I liked the sound of that,

00:52:04.623 --> 00:52:07.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:52:08.544 --> 00:52:10.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did sound like a lot more work,

00:52:10.629 --> 00:52:13.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Victor was so positive.

00:52:13.466 --> 00:52:15.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may be a little overtime
here and there,

00:52:15.593 --> 00:52:18.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wouldn’t worry about it
—not with your skill.

00:52:18.971 --> 00:52:22.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me I could think
about it before deciding.

00:52:22.642 --> 00:52:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But come on, this was a no-brainer.

00:52:28.606 --> 00:52:30.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new position was great!

00:52:30.733 --> 00:52:34.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the money—well,

00:52:34.195 --> 00:52:37.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wasn’t too bad either.

00:52:37.365 --> 00:52:40.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exciting
to work directly with clients,

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the hours

00:52:46.082 --> 00:52:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were crazy.

00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:51.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that the easy thing to do

00:52:51.504 --> 00:52:55.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the right thing
to do are seldom the same.

00:52:55.091 --> 00:52:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see an example of this
in this week’s Bible reading.

00:52:58.928 --> 00:53:00.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True worship,

00:53:00.555 --> 00:53:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right thing, was not easy
but required hard work.

00:53:05.476 --> 00:53:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Hezekiah demonstrated
his zeal for Jehovah’s worship . . .

00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:14.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our question for the audience is,
How could we explain this to someone?

00:53:15.153 --> 00:53:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ava, please.

00:53:21.034 --> 00:53:24.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most nights I was wiped out.

00:53:27.665 --> 00:53:29.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All around the world,

00:53:29.459 --> 00:53:32.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people wonder if life has any purpose.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit

00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:38.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even when I wasn’t working, . . .

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:39.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so sorry.

00:53:39.552 --> 00:53:41.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you take this door for me?

00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:45.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty minutes.

00:53:45.725 --> 00:53:47.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working.

00:53:47.769 --> 00:53:49.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:53:53.817 --> 00:53:55.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As highlighted in the video,

00:53:55.819 --> 00:53:59.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why will pursuing money not make us happy?

00:53:59.531 --> 00:54:02.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we wouldn’t be
following Jehovah’s advice,

00:54:02.659 --> 00:54:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would cause us
to fall into “a snare,” or trap,

00:54:06.329 --> 00:54:09.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned at 1 Timothy 6:9.

00:54:09.666 --> 00:54:14.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without our even realizing it,
that snare can consume our time

00:54:14.462 --> 00:54:18.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time that we need to be spending
on spiritual things.

00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:21.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was that shown in the video?

00:54:21.469 --> 00:54:24.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the pay raise, bonuses,
new car, and other things

00:54:24.806 --> 00:54:28.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have made our brother happy
for a short time.

00:54:28.059 --> 00:54:32.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did you notice how
pursuing money was a snare for him?

00:54:32.939 --> 00:54:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most nights he was exhausted
from working long hours.

00:54:36.651 --> 00:54:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He arrived late
to the meeting and fell asleep.

00:54:40.697 --> 00:54:44.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice what happened
to his participation in the field ministry

00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:47.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most important work on earth?

00:54:47.287 --> 00:54:49.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It suffered, didn’t it?

00:54:49.289 --> 00:54:53.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t prepared, and he experienced
interruptions from his workplace.

00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:56.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that money is useful.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need it to buy food,
shelter, and clothing.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But trading spiritual things for wealth
is always a poor investment.

00:55:07.182 --> 00:55:10.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
a life focused on serving Jehovah

00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:15.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a simple life
that brings deep and lasting joy.

00:55:15.232 --> 00:55:19.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus emphasized this
in his words at Matthew 6:22:

00:55:19.987 --> 00:55:24.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, then, your eye is focused,
your whole body will be bright.”

00:55:25.534 --> 00:55:30.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basic meaning of the Greek word
for “focused” is “single or simple.”

00:55:31.623 --> 00:55:36.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It can convey the idea of singleness
of mind or devotion to one purpose.”

00:55:36.628 --> 00:55:41.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
if we focus our life on material things,

00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could take up a lot
of our time and energy,

00:55:44.053 --> 00:55:48.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we may not take time
to pray, study, or preach.

00:55:49.516 --> 00:55:54.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better to follow
Jesus’ instruction and keep our life simple!

00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:58.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By focusing on putting
God’s service first in our life,

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:00.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll have true joy.

00:56:00.986 --> 00:56:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:56:03.906 --> 00:56:07.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how our brother gains joy
when he makes a different decision.

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:13.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:56:13.499 --> 00:56:14.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:56:14.291 --> 00:56:16.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
 the whole division to start.

00:56:16.335 --> 00:56:18.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor’s offer really took me by surprise.

00:56:22.049 --> 00:56:23.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wow!

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The perks were tempting!

00:56:29.974 --> 00:56:32.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew there was a lot at stake,

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:35.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I told him I’d talk to Lisa

00:56:35.521 --> 00:56:37.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get back to him tomorrow.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was this job going to mean
for our spiritual goals?

00:56:51.662 --> 00:56:54.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would we still be able
to keep our life simple?

00:56:58.586 --> 00:57:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were we ready to trade
our time together as a family

00:57:02.298 --> 00:57:03.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more money?

00:57:21.734 --> 00:57:23.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Victor how much
I appreciated the opportunity

00:57:27.532 --> 00:57:31.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but felt that it just wasn’t
the right fit for our family.

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money was tight, but we were OK.

00:57:35.623 --> 00:57:37.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had what we needed.

00:57:41.337 --> 00:57:42.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying no to that promotion

00:57:42.839 --> 00:57:46.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant holding off on a few upgrades,

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also meant more time
for meeting preparation, . . .

00:57:57.395 --> 00:57:58.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Miller.

00:57:58.396 --> 00:57:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go on and look at the—

00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:06.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>. . . </i> more time for the ministry,

00:58:11.076 --> 00:58:12.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more time

00:58:12.869 --> 00:58:14.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each other.

00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:24.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the happiness
of our brother and his family

00:58:24.297 --> 00:58:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he decided to live a simple life?

00:58:27.509 --> 00:58:30.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why does a simple life
bring us happiness?

00:58:30.762 --> 00:58:34.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 5:12 highlights one reason.

00:58:34.307 --> 00:58:38.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that together
—Ecclesiastes 5:12.

00:58:38.562 --> 00:58:42.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:58:42.232 --> 00:58:44.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse says:

00:58:44.234 --> 00:58:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sweet is the sleep of the one serving,

00:58:46.862 --> 00:58:48.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether he eats little or much,

00:58:48.989 --> 00:58:51.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the plenty belonging to the rich one

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:54.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not permit him to sleep.”

00:58:54.744 --> 00:58:59.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who possess much
may be anxious about losing their possessions

00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:03.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus lose sleep worrying about them.

00:59:03.044 --> 00:59:07.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, those with little materially
have less to worry about,

00:59:07.257 --> 00:59:11.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can enjoy,
as the verse says, “sweet . . . sleep.”

00:59:11.511 --> 00:59:13.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:59:13.513 --> 00:59:18.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we refuse to allow material things
to interfere with our sacred service,

00:59:18.018 --> 00:59:22.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we gain satisfaction, peace, and joy.

00:59:22.564 --> 00:59:24.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’re presented with an offer

00:59:24.858 --> 00:59:27.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the one given
to our brother in the video,

00:59:27.152 --> 00:59:29.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should you do?

00:59:29.488 --> 00:59:31.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, pray.

00:59:31.907 --> 00:59:36.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for help to make a decision
that will be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:40.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, ask yourself:
Will this decision complicate my life?

00:59:40.833 --> 00:59:45.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how will this affect
the time I spend serving Jehovah?

00:59:45.212 --> 00:59:47.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Questions like those
helped our brother in the video

00:59:47.714 --> 00:59:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a decision that brought great joy.

00:59:51.885 --> 00:59:56.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, any decision you make
that promotes a simple life

00:59:56.223 --> 01:00:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focused on serving Jehovah
will lead to joy that “is well-founded,

01:00:00.936 --> 01:00:04.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with roots reaching deep in God’s Word.”

01:00:04.481 --> 01:00:07.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us attain the true joy

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:09.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from living a simple life.

01:00:11.363 --> 01:00:14.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a simple life
is not the only thing that leads to joy.

01:00:14.658 --> 01:00:17.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:21.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now considers the next talk
of this symposium,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Contributes to Joy?
—A Clean Conscience.”

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do
if you were tempted or pressured

01:00:34.887 --> 01:00:36.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to commit
some sort of wrongdoing?

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:38.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many people
in the world

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:41.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would give in
to the temptation or the pressure,

01:00:41.393 --> 01:00:44.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if they felt that they
could benefit in some way

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they thought that no one
would find out about it.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would doing that
really contribute to a person’s joy?

01:00:52.154 --> 01:00:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous talk,
we saw a dramatization

01:00:55.157 --> 01:00:57.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a brother named Ben.

01:00:57.159 --> 01:01:02.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, he chose to accept a promotion
at work that put him under great stress.

01:01:02.123 --> 01:01:05.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take another look
at him in that position

01:01:05.376 --> 01:01:08.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how he handles
things when his boss

01:01:08.838 --> 01:01:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pressures him to be dishonest.

01:01:17.805 --> 01:01:20.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben, it looks like you forgot
to sign off on a job order.

01:01:24.312 --> 01:01:26.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually,

01:01:26.564 --> 01:01:27.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these failed that quality inspection.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:28.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, by like two tenths of a point.

01:01:31.778 --> 01:01:34.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I already talked to Steve
about replacing the components,

01:01:34.447 --> 01:01:36.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to get that order adjusted,

01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:39.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll have a new one for you
on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:46.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:47.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no time for that.

01:01:47.794 --> 01:01:49.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a huge account.

01:01:49.837 --> 01:01:51.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t sign off on this,

01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:54.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d be hurting the whole company.

01:01:54.133 --> 01:01:55.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

01:01:57.345 --> 01:02:00.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor, I’m-I’m not sure

01:02:00.515 --> 01:02:03.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m really comfortable

01:02:04.143 --> 01:02:06.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bypassing the inspection when . . .

01:02:06.854 --> 01:02:09.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I’m not asking you to tell some big lie.

01:02:10.316 --> 01:02:12.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a technicality.

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:16.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, a good quarter

01:02:16.239 --> 01:02:17.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means good bonuses for everyone

01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:19.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including you.

01:02:24.164 --> 01:02:26.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to do it,

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:30.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the last thing that Lisa and I needed

01:02:30.295 --> 01:02:32.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for me to lose my job.

01:02:39.054 --> 01:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t have a choice.

01:02:43.475 --> 01:02:45.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you lie, they can’t believe you.

01:02:47.854 --> 01:02:48.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they might not . . .

01:02:48.855 --> 01:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling myself
that it was no big deal.

01:02:52.317 --> 01:02:54.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All lies are bad, even little ones.

01:02:54.945 --> 01:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One lie leads to another,
and they cause much harm.

01:03:06.915 --> 01:03:09.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple, right?

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear what Ben said?

01:03:21.096 --> 01:03:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I kept telling myself
that it was no big deal.”

01:03:24.725 --> 01:03:26.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if that were really true,

01:03:26.727 --> 01:03:30.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why was he so uncomfortable
about what he had done?

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:34.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is because wrongdoing
does not lead to true joy.

01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:37.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben’s conscience was not clean.

01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:41.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was telling him
that Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.

01:03:42.576 --> 01:03:44.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the conscience?

01:03:44.828 --> 01:03:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young boy was asked
that question, and he said,

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you’re good,
you don’t even know you have it,

01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you’re bad,
it hurts.”

01:03:54.046 --> 01:03:58.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another child said that in her head
there was a green light

01:03:58.091 --> 01:04:02.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a red light, and that when she was told
to do something that she knew was wrong,

01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:05.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the red light would flash.

01:04:05.098 --> 01:04:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they both
had the right idea.

01:04:07.601 --> 01:04:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our conscience is our inner sense
of right and wrong

01:04:11.855 --> 01:04:14.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah instilled in us.

01:04:14.733 --> 01:04:19.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says that it is
like a ‘law written in the human heart.’

01:04:19.405 --> 01:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of people in general,

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what Romans 2:15 says,

01:04:24.576 --> 01:04:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it explains
the function of the conscience.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 2:15:

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:35.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are the very ones
who demonstrate the matter of the law

01:04:35.254 --> 01:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be written in their hearts,

01:04:37.923 --> 01:04:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while their conscience
is bearing witness with them,

01:04:41.135 --> 01:04:44.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and by their own thoughts
they are being accused

01:04:44.722 --> 01:04:47.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even excused.”

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us a conscience
so that we can evaluate

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any situation
that arises in life,

01:04:53.939 --> 01:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a right choice,
and then judge ourselves afterward

01:04:57.401 --> 01:04:59.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the choice we made.

01:04:59.403 --> 01:05:02.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we allow ourselves
to do what we know is wrong,

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:05.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our conscience
will surely strike us.

01:05:05.951 --> 01:05:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, if we repeatedly
ignore our conscience,

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:11.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will malfunction
and become insensitive

01:05:11.624 --> 01:05:14.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will not recognize
dangers that could damage

01:05:14.794 --> 01:05:17.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our relationship with Jehovah.

01:05:17.838 --> 01:05:21.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time a person does something
he knows he should not do,

01:05:21.592 --> 01:05:24.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his conscience may prick him
and he may feel guilty.

01:05:24.804 --> 01:05:27.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he does it
again and again,

01:05:27.306 --> 01:05:30.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his conscience
will gradually fail to respond,

01:05:30.476 --> 01:05:33.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he may get involved
in even more serious wrongdoing.

01:05:33.854 --> 01:05:38.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seemingly small compromises
often lead to larger ones,

01:05:38.276 --> 01:05:41.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and larger compromises
further distance people

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the happy God,

01:05:43.573 --> 01:05:48.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that leads to feelings
of worthlessness and heartache.

01:05:48.494 --> 01:05:52.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whereas a clean conscience
that results from obeying Jehovah

01:05:52.665 --> 01:05:55.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings us self-respect,

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:58.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal dignity, and real joy.

01:05:58.379 --> 01:06:01.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we
safeguard our conscience

01:06:01.215 --> 01:06:03.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it is always clean?

01:06:03.634 --> 01:06:08.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By studying Bible principles
and meditating on how to apply them,

01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:11.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that when we are faced
with important decisions,

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will know how
to respond in a way

01:06:14.312 --> 01:06:16.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will contribute
to our joy.

01:06:16.856 --> 01:06:19.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to sensitize
our conscience

01:06:19.692 --> 01:06:24.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning and loving Jehovah’s view
of what is right and what is wrong 

01:06:24.697 --> 01:06:27.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being convinced
that living in harmony

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his standards
is the best way of life.

01:06:30.411 --> 01:06:32.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how
the psalmist David felt.

01:06:32.997 --> 01:06:37.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to turn
to Psalm 19:8,

01:06:37.168 --> 01:06:40.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 19:8, he wrote:

01:06:40.004 --> 01:06:43.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The orders
from Jehovah are righteous,

01:06:43.258 --> 01:06:45.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“causing the heart to rejoice;

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:48.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the commandment of Jehovah is clean,

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:51.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the eyes shine.”

01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So maintaining a clean conscience
in all areas of our daily life

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:00.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring us joy—in our use of alcohol,
in business dealings,

01:07:00.734 --> 01:07:02.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with entertainment choices,

01:07:02.736 --> 01:07:06.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in our dealings
with the opposite sex.

01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:09.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we have a clean conscience,
as Jehovah’s people,

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:12.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are not ashamed
to give a witness to others.

01:07:12.787 --> 01:07:16.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the apostle Paul wrote
at 2 Corinthians 1:12,

01:07:16.207 --> 01:07:19.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can boast that “our conscience
bears witness

01:07:19.044 --> 01:07:22.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have conducted ourselves
in the world . . . with holiness

01:07:22.923 --> 01:07:25.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and godly sincerity.”

01:07:25.592 --> 01:07:28.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it takes
real courage to be honest

01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:32.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to face whatever consequences
may come our way.

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:35.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:39.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how Ben benefits
from being honest.

01:07:43.819 --> 01:07:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Javi.

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben.
How are you doing?

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
How’s the job going?

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:48.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, the machine is running great!

01:07:48.573 --> 01:07:50.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I did have a question
on the specs for the Harrison job.

01:07:50.701 --> 01:07:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we take a quick look?

01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:52.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:52.953 --> 01:07:55.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, let’s see here.

01:07:55.163 --> 01:07:56.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Need a hand?

01:07:56.498 --> 01:07:57.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m good.
I just . . .

01:08:01.586 --> 01:08:03.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

01:08:04.965 --> 01:08:07.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened, guys?

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got—we got to do something!

01:08:11.722 --> 01:08:12.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, disconnect . . .

01:08:12.973 --> 01:08:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Yeah, yeah, get it going.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:23.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dead

01:08:23.692 --> 01:08:25.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I’m pretty sure it’s dead.

01:08:27.738 --> 01:08:29.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just say that it stopped working.

01:08:29.364 --> 01:08:32.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you do,
don’t tell Victor what happened.

01:08:43.712 --> 01:08:46.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just got this set up last month.

01:08:46.632 --> 01:08:48.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would it just stop working?

01:08:48.634 --> 01:08:49.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

01:08:51.178 --> 01:08:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you can actually smell

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:55.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coffee.

01:08:56.934 --> 01:08:58.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to Victor.

01:08:58.978 --> 01:09:00.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t throw yourself under the bus, Man!

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:02.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll help you get this cleaned up.

01:09:02.356 --> 01:09:03.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will have to know.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of the most expensive
units in the shop.

01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take the blame,

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just making yourself look bad.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
It’s OK.

01:09:14.994 --> 01:09:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a mistake.

01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll explain it.

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to get this back online.

01:09:47.234 --> 01:09:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I think Victor
actually appreciated my honesty.

01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:56.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wasn’t the only one.

01:09:57.328 --> 01:09:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark had some questions,

01:10:00.706 --> 01:10:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a great discussion.

01:10:10.216 --> 01:10:13.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, instead of his conscience
troubling him,

01:10:13.219 --> 01:10:15.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben had real peace of mind.

01:10:15.513 --> 01:10:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also gained the trust
and respect of others.

01:10:18.599 --> 01:10:21.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you
have a clean conscience?

01:10:21.269 --> 01:10:25.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being determined,
as Hebrews 13:18 says,

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:29.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to conduct yourselves
honestly in all things,’

01:10:29.277 --> 01:10:32.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether other humans are aware
of your good conduct or not.

01:10:32.947 --> 01:10:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you can sleep each night
with the satisfaction of knowing

01:10:37.201 --> 01:10:39.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is pleased with you.

01:10:39.913 --> 01:10:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they say, ‘There is no pillow
so soft as a clean conscience.’

01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It rewards us
with peace of mind and joy.

01:10:49.005 --> 01:10:53.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides a clean conscience,
what else brings true joy?

01:10:53.551 --> 01:10:57.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:10:57.514 --> 01:11:00.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
considers the next talk
of this symposium,

01:11:00.183 --> 01:11:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Contributes to Joy?
—Meaningful Work.”

01:11:11.319 --> 01:11:14.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is a gift from God.

01:11:14.406 --> 01:11:16.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his inspired Word tells us

01:11:16.825 --> 01:11:19.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced in our view of work.

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the world
teaches extreme views of work

01:11:23.206 --> 01:11:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are contrary to God’s view.

01:11:26.042 --> 01:11:30.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have the view that work
should be avoided at all costs,

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they work hard at not working.

01:11:34.676 --> 01:11:38.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others have the view
that the more you work,

01:11:38.388 --> 01:11:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier you will be.

01:11:41.224 --> 01:11:44.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

01:11:44.769 --> 01:11:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our brother’s emphasis

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on secular work actually robs him of joy.

01:11:55.572 --> 01:11:59.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The company took on new clients this year,
and I knew that Victor

01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really depending on me
to keep things on schedule.

01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:05.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to let him down,

01:12:06.666 --> 01:12:09.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I stepped up

01:12:09.002 --> 01:12:10.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took on the overtime hours.

01:12:14.967 --> 01:12:17.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I figured it was temporary,

01:12:17.803 --> 01:12:21.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I even got to take home
a bigger paycheck.

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:28.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is
that that’s not all I took home.

01:12:33.151 --> 01:12:36.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of each week, I was burned-out.

01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:44.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the weekends

01:12:50.252 --> 01:12:51.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well,

01:12:52.671 --> 01:12:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they weren’t really any better.

01:12:56.884 --> 01:13:01.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I spent a lot
of Saturdays back at the office.

01:13:10.648 --> 01:13:13.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project took a lot longer than I thought.

01:13:13.692 --> 01:13:17.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That pretty much took out field service
and the meetings.

01:13:17.655 --> 01:13:19.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew that management

01:13:19.406 --> 01:13:21.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be impressed.

01:13:21.075 --> 01:13:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That machine is essential
so that I can get the parts out.

01:13:23.786 --> 01:13:26.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got the reports in right on time.

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!
This is costing a lot of money.

01:13:28.082 --> 01:13:29.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a first quarter that I have to meet,

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:30.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and without this,

01:13:30.918 --> 01:13:32.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to—it’s going to kill me.

01:13:34.505 --> 01:13:37.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know we had a contract
that you’re supposed to—

01:13:37.716 --> 01:13:39.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like I said,
I don’t care about your third-party vendors.

01:13:39.969 --> 01:13:41.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is unacceptable.

01:13:43.472 --> 01:13:46.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working harder than ever,

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the end,
I’m not sure anyone even cared.

01:13:56.861 --> 01:14:01.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that being industrious
and working hard is good.

01:14:01.449 --> 01:14:04.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did our brother
in the video experience

01:14:04.118 --> 01:14:07.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he adopted
the world’s extreme view of work?

01:14:07.288 --> 01:14:09.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it make him happier?

01:14:09.749 --> 01:14:13.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we put secular work
above everything else,

01:14:13.461 --> 01:14:17.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could lose out
on needed rest and spiritual pursuits.

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:21.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother in the video
sacrificed precious time with his family

01:14:21.636 --> 01:14:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and activity with the congregation

01:14:24.013 --> 01:14:28.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he did not have
a balanced view of secular work.

01:14:28.893 --> 01:14:33.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me
what Ecclesiastes 4:6

01:14:33.439 --> 01:14:36.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicates about being balanced

01:14:36.567 --> 01:14:39.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ecclesiastes 4:6:

01:14:39.278 --> 01:14:42.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Better is a handful of rest

01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than two handfuls of hard work

01:14:46.035 --> 01:14:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and notice what it adds]
and chasing after the wind.”

01:14:51.874 --> 01:14:56.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Chasing after the wind”
is an exercise in futility.

01:14:56.671 --> 01:15:00.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t catch the wind
and hold on to it.

01:15:00.592 --> 01:15:03.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person who is a workaholic

01:15:03.595 --> 01:15:06.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may never enjoy the fruitage of his labor

01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:10.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if his work consumes
all his time and energy.

01:15:10.185 --> 01:15:14.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His work can become as pointless
as “chasing after the wind.”

01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:19.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We accept with joy our obligation

01:15:19.194 --> 01:15:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide for ourselves
and those who depend on us.

01:15:22.739 --> 01:15:24.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also need to remember

01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is more to life than work.

01:15:28.411 --> 01:15:31.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us
the instructions we need

01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:36.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a balanced life
and have a proper view of work.

01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:40.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Bible encourages us

01:15:40.757 --> 01:15:43.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work hard at what we do
to make a living,

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meaningful secular work

01:15:45.762 --> 01:15:49.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can bring us joy
and a feeling of accomplishment.

01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:53.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we do, we want to do it well.

01:15:53.353 --> 01:15:56.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, as Ephesians 4:28 says,

01:15:56.106 --> 01:15:59.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“doing good work” allows us
to “have something to share

01:15:59.568 --> 01:16:01.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone in need.”

01:16:01.987 --> 01:16:05.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are advised in Scripture

01:16:05.574 --> 01:16:09.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make sure
of the more important things.”

01:16:09.161 --> 01:16:11.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the most important work we can do

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:17.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stated clearly at 1 Corinthians 15:58.

01:16:17.002 --> 01:16:21.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me
1 Corinthians 15:58:

01:16:22.883 --> 01:16:25.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, my beloved brothers,

01:16:25.886 --> 01:16:28.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be steadfast, immovable,

01:16:28.889 --> 01:16:33.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“always having plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:36.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that your labor is not in vain

01:16:36.521 --> 01:16:39.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in connection with the Lord.”

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:43.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Having plenty to do in the work
of the Lord”

01:16:43.654 --> 01:16:45.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is good for us,

01:16:45.697 --> 01:16:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is pleasing to Jehovah.

01:16:48.825 --> 01:16:52.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

01:16:52.412 --> 01:16:56.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how our brother benefits
from working hard

01:16:56.041 --> 01:17:00.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his secular job
and in spiritual pursuits.

01:17:14.852 --> 01:17:16.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had been a busy week,

01:17:17.813 --> 01:17:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the weekend was going to be even busier

01:17:20.816 --> 01:17:22.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and better!

01:17:29.658 --> 01:17:33.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, I needed to make
an important stop.

01:17:36.749 --> 01:17:38.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s Ben.

01:17:38.292 --> 01:17:39.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come in!

01:17:39.627 --> 01:17:41.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s so good to see you.

01:17:41.670 --> 01:17:42.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too.

01:17:42.963 --> 01:17:44.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, John,

01:17:44.089 --> 01:17:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are you feeling?

01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:48.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, how are you doing?

01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:49.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
Good.

01:17:49.428 --> 01:17:50.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m so glad . . .

01:17:50.554 --> 01:17:53.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This illness had been so hard
on John and Sandy.

01:17:56.102 --> 01:17:59.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even imagine
what they were going through.

01:18:10.533 --> 01:18:13.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so encouraging
to see John’s positive attitude.

01:18:16.205 --> 01:18:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

01:18:17.665 --> 01:18:21.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a fantastic conversation
in the ministry.

01:18:28.718 --> 01:18:31.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Tom and I
finally figured out that glitch

01:18:31.012 --> 01:18:32.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the A/V system.

01:18:32.763 --> 01:18:33.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Tom, go ahead and hit play.

01:18:33.931 --> 01:18:35.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s playing.

01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:35.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

01:18:37.894 --> 01:18:39.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right!

01:18:39.103 --> 01:18:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

01:18:40.062 --> 01:18:40.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whew!

01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:45.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything looked and sounded great!

01:18:52.033 --> 01:18:54.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We definitely were busy

01:18:54.702 --> 01:18:56.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the best way possible,

01:18:57.914 --> 01:19:00.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing things that really mattered

01:19:00.958 --> 01:19:03.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for people who love Jehovah.

01:19:08.466 --> 01:19:13.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw a balanced
and joyful man in that video.

01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:16.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brother worked hard
at his secular job

01:19:16.182 --> 01:19:20.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it allowed him to provide
for his family’s physical needs.

01:19:20.645 --> 01:19:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in the video
that the brother had a picture

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his family at his workplace?

01:19:27.151 --> 01:19:30.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a nice reminder
of one of the reasons

01:19:30.488 --> 01:19:32.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was working hard.

01:19:32.824 --> 01:19:36.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, it may be that you work at a job

01:19:36.619 --> 01:19:39.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t particularly enjoy doing.

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:43.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, you
work hard and give it your best

01:19:43.918 --> 01:19:48.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’re doing it
for your family and for Jehovah.

01:19:48.256 --> 01:19:51.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you do your job well,

01:19:51.176 --> 01:19:54.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth is that
you can find pleasure in it

01:19:54.429 --> 01:19:58.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at least in what it provides.

01:19:58.016 --> 01:20:00.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing “the work of the Lord”

01:20:00.685 --> 01:20:04.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes work that we do
on behalf of the congregation.

01:20:04.648 --> 01:20:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We experience the greater happiness

01:20:07.108 --> 01:20:11.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from giving,
as stated at Acts 20:35.

01:20:12.739 --> 01:20:15.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did our brother in the video
that we just observed

01:20:15.909 --> 01:20:18.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give of himself to the congregation?

01:20:18.662 --> 01:20:20.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:24.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took the time
to visit a brother in the hospital,

01:20:24.084 --> 01:20:27.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know
that such visits are truly appreciated.

01:20:27.587 --> 01:20:29.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He participated in the ministry

01:20:29.756 --> 01:20:32.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spread the good news
of the Kingdom.

01:20:32.425 --> 01:20:34.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He helped out at the Kingdom Hall

01:20:34.928 --> 01:20:38.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the audio/video setup working.

01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:41.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like him, we make ourselves available

01:20:41.435 --> 01:20:45.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for whatever has to be done
to care for Kingdom interests.

01:20:45.647 --> 01:20:48.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the day,

01:20:48.358 --> 01:20:53.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brother was with his family
and friends—probably very tired.

01:20:53.363 --> 01:20:56.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a good tired.

01:20:56.366 --> 01:21:01.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was enjoying a period
of relaxation and personal satisfaction.

01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:07.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, all of his hard work
brought him genuine happiness.

01:21:08.712 --> 01:21:11.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, as Jehovah’s servants,

01:21:11.757 --> 01:21:15.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us want to be busy
in the best ways possible.

01:21:15.761 --> 01:21:20.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created us
to enjoy both work and leisure,

01:21:20.766 --> 01:21:24.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Ecclesiastes 3:13:

01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That everyone should eat and drink

01:21:28.524 --> 01:21:32.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

01:21:32.778 --> 01:21:36.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

01:21:36.573 --> 01:21:40.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your life balanced,

01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:44.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will enjoy
all of the work you do even more.

01:21:45.916 --> 01:21:48.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please listen as Brother James Mantz,

01:21:48.335 --> 01:21:50.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

01:21:50.504 --> 01:21:54.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now considers
the final talk of this symposium,

01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:59.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Contributes to Joy?
—True Friendships.”

01:22:05.519 --> 01:22:07.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to modern technology,

01:22:07.813 --> 01:22:09.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people the world over say

01:22:09.523 --> 01:22:12.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have more “friends” than ever.

01:22:12.151 --> 01:22:15.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All they have to do
is add a person’s name

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:18.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their list of “friends”
on a social network.

01:22:18.741 --> 01:22:21.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some boast of having hundreds,

01:22:21.118 --> 01:22:24.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even thousands, of such “friends.”

01:22:24.663 --> 01:22:27.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others don’t have access to the Internet,

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:30.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they make friends
the old-fashioned way

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:35.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at work, at school,
or in the neighborhood.

01:22:35.049 --> 01:22:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having good friends is very important.

01:22:39.095 --> 01:22:41.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to ask ourselves:

01:22:41.722 --> 01:22:44.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is true friendship?

01:22:44.433 --> 01:22:47.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where should I look for true friends?

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:52.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can my choice of friends affect my joy?

01:22:52.066 --> 01:22:55.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:59.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about the effect
our brother’s choice of friends

01:22:59.532 --> 01:23:02.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has on his joy.

01:23:07.915 --> 01:23:09.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, believe me,

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s not the only dirt I have on Victor.

01:23:12.837 --> 01:23:14.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we’re listening.

01:23:14.964 --> 01:23:17.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week,
he’s talking in his office, right?

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:20.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has no idea
that I’m standing right there,

01:23:20.344 --> 01:23:22.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s bragging
to his buddy . . .

01:23:22.555 --> 01:23:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t want to hear this.

01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:28.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lunch with them seemed harmless,

01:23:28.102 --> 01:23:31.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this was anything but upbuilding.

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:33.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

01:23:35.026 --> 01:23:36.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the Bible people.

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:41.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-oh.

01:23:41.574 --> 01:23:43.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t look now!

01:23:43.409 --> 01:23:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think they have someone.

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:46.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might try to convert us too!

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the deal with these people?

01:23:55.713 --> 01:23:56.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s cool

01:23:56.923 --> 01:23:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you want to believe
in fairy tales and everything,

01:23:59.175 --> 01:24:00.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but keep it to yourself,

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right?

01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:02.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!
Exactly!

01:24:04.013 --> 01:24:05.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

01:24:05.181 --> 01:24:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those carts are everywhere now!

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re all over the city.

01:24:13.273 --> 01:24:15.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t finish my lunch.

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never noticed
how sarcastic and negative

01:24:20.697 --> 01:24:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my coworkers could be.

01:24:26.369 --> 01:24:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had always thought of them as,

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, as friends.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what kind of friends was I making?

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the brother’s face
at the end of the video?

01:24:53.939 --> 01:24:55.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t look very happy.

01:24:55.941 --> 01:24:57.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

01:24:57.943 --> 01:25:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The association seemed harmless.

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:03.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Workmates were just taking
their lunch break together,

01:25:03.657 --> 01:25:07.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their conversation
went in a negative direction.

01:25:07.494 --> 01:25:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began talking
about finding dirt on a fellow worker.

01:25:11.581 --> 01:25:14.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it got personal.

01:25:14.126 --> 01:25:16.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His coworkers started to make fun

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:19.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Witnesses
who were preaching using a cart.

01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Proverbs chapter 19.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read three verses here,

01:25:26.847 --> 01:25:31.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these verses reveal
the disappointing reality

01:25:31.268 --> 01:25:33.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of looking to the world

01:25:33.437 --> 01:25:36.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a source of true friends.

01:25:36.356 --> 01:25:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Proverbs chapter 19,
we’ll start with verse 4,

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:43.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then read verses 6 and 7:

01:25:43.113 --> 01:25:46.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wealth attracts many friends,

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:49.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the poor man
will be deserted even by his friend.

01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:52.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many seek the favor of a noble,

01:25:52.873 --> 01:25:56.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and everyone is a friend
to the man who gives gifts.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the brothers of a poor man hate him;

01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:03.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“how much more he is shunned by his friends!

01:26:03.175 --> 01:26:08.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pursues them with requests,
but no one responds.”

01:26:09.181 --> 01:26:11.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships in the world

01:26:11.183 --> 01:26:14.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are often based on selfish motives.

01:26:14.395 --> 01:26:16.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As verse 4 says:

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wealth attracts friends;

01:26:18.732 --> 01:26:21.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
poverty drives them away.’

01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such friendships can be shallow,

01:26:24.738 --> 01:26:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they can end abruptly.

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:29.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One 42-year-old woman

01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:33.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had over a thousand “friends”
on her social network.

01:26:33.414 --> 01:26:35.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, not one of those “friends”

01:26:35.749 --> 01:26:38.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
responded to her plea for help

01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:41.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before she took her own life.

01:26:41.422 --> 01:26:45.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships with the world
are not only disappointing

01:26:45.009 --> 01:26:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can also damage
our relationship with Jehovah.

01:26:49.138 --> 01:26:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With good reason,

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the footnote to 1 Corinthians 15:33 warns us:

01:26:56.145 --> 01:27:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bad associations corrupt good morals.”

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:04.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cultivating friendships with people

01:27:04.278 --> 01:27:09.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do not serve Jehovah
is like trying to mix oil with water.

01:27:09.075 --> 01:27:11.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just doesn’t work.

01:27:11.369 --> 01:27:13.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

01:27:13.371 --> 01:27:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Scriptures
teach that true friends

01:27:16.415 --> 01:27:20.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be found only among Jehovah’s people.

01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:25.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian brotherhood is the only place

01:27:25.716 --> 01:27:28.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we can find friends
like the one described

01:27:28.386 --> 01:27:31.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 18:24.

01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:33.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to that scripture,

01:27:33.808 --> 01:27:37.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the distinction
between a companion

01:27:37.687 --> 01:27:39.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a true friend.

01:27:39.731 --> 01:27:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 18:24 reads:

01:27:43.693 --> 01:27:47.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are companions
ready to crush one another,

01:27:47.572 --> 01:27:51.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is a friend
who sticks closer than a brother.”

01:27:53.286 --> 01:27:55.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian brothers and sisters

01:27:55.496 --> 01:27:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not simply companions, or acquaintances,

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:01.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone we happen to know;

01:28:01.461 --> 01:28:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are loyal friends.

01:28:04.047 --> 01:28:06.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can rely on them.

01:28:06.049 --> 01:28:08.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:28:08.051 --> 01:28:10.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it because we’re all the same age?

01:28:10.094 --> 01:28:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it because we come from the same national,

01:28:13.014 --> 01:28:15.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
economic, or social background?

01:28:15.099 --> 01:28:17.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:28:17.101 --> 01:28:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friends in the Christian congregation

01:28:19.187 --> 01:28:21.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stick “closer than a brother”

01:28:21.439 --> 01:28:25.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they share our faith, our values,

01:28:25.985 --> 01:28:29.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love for Jehovah, and our hopes.

01:28:29.989 --> 01:28:33.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They work with us
side by side in the ministry.

01:28:33.284 --> 01:28:35.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support us when we’re discouraged

01:28:35.662 --> 01:28:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when we’re facing a trial.

01:28:38.081 --> 01:28:40.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They rejoice with us when we have good times

01:28:40.834 --> 01:28:43.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together in Jehovah’s service.

01:28:43.503 --> 01:28:48.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the true friendships that we enjoy now
in the Christian congregation

01:28:48.466 --> 01:28:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to last forever.

01:28:51.761 --> 01:28:55.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the brother
having lunch with his workmates?

01:28:55.724 --> 01:28:58.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:28:58.185 --> 01:29:00.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch his face closely

01:29:00.562 --> 01:29:04.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how having
true friends affected his joy.

01:29:15.452 --> 01:29:16.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so glad

01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:18.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had taken a day off from work.

01:29:18.747 --> 01:29:21.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long had it been since Lisa and I

01:29:21.416 --> 01:29:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to spend a whole day together
in midweek service?

01:29:34.638 --> 01:29:36.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lisa started a Bible study.

01:29:40.602 --> 01:29:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we got to share our day
with good friends

01:29:43.605 --> 01:29:45.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people like Sam and Chloe.

01:29:45.607 --> 01:29:47.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve really been there for us

01:29:47.442 --> 01:29:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the ups and downs.

01:30:00.289 --> 01:30:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at that!

01:30:01.707 --> 01:30:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,

01:30:02.541 --> 01:30:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that you?

01:30:04.168 --> 01:30:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing over there?

01:30:08.964 --> 01:30:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you guys know about this?

01:30:19.308 --> 01:30:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know where we’d be

01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Jehovah hadn’t helped us
to keep our priorities straight

01:30:26.357 --> 01:30:28.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—keeping our life simple,

01:30:30.819 --> 01:30:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a clean conscience,

01:30:37.117 --> 01:30:38.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staying focused on work

01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:40.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has real meaning,

01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having real friends.

01:30:49.505 --> 01:30:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What more can you ask for?

01:30:54.844 --> 01:30:57.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that the way we feel
after we spend time

01:30:57.471 --> 01:31:00.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our true friends in the congregation?

01:31:00.558 --> 01:31:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it about our brothers and sisters

01:31:03.477 --> 01:31:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes those friendships
so special, so precious?

01:31:07.982 --> 01:31:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do those friendships
bring us so much joy?

01:31:11.819 --> 01:31:16.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our friendship
is based on a solid foundation.

01:31:16.824 --> 01:31:20.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when we meet
a fellow Witness for the first time,

01:31:20.286 --> 01:31:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we already know a lot about each other.

01:31:22.872 --> 01:31:25.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about all the things
we share in common:

01:31:25.958 --> 01:31:29.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worship the only true God, Jehovah;

01:31:29.253 --> 01:31:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we speak the same pure language of truth;

01:31:33.382 --> 01:31:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we adhere to Jehovah’s high moral standards;

01:31:36.677 --> 01:31:41.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have the same hope for the future.

01:31:41.307 --> 01:31:44.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These things are the foundation

01:31:44.477 --> 01:31:49.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a relationship
built on confidence and trust

01:31:49.107 --> 01:31:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a true friendship.

01:31:52.068 --> 01:31:56.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a contrast to people
who do not know Jehovah!

01:31:56.322 --> 01:31:59.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether their friendships are formed online,

at work, at school, or in the neighborhood,

01:32:02.829 --> 01:32:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
friendships in the world
are often based on shared interest.

01:32:07.834 --> 01:32:11.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, true friendships

01:32:11.212 --> 01:32:14.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are based on common values.

01:32:14.674 --> 01:32:19.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Proverbs 17:17,

01:32:19.679 --> 01:32:23.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the kind
of friendships we will enjoy

01:32:23.558 --> 01:32:27.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they are based on spiritual values.

01:32:27.729 --> 01:32:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 17:17:

01:32:31.107 --> 01:32:35.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A true friend shows love at all times

01:32:35.278 --> 01:32:40.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is a brother
who is born for times of distress.”

01:32:40.283 --> 01:32:43.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True friends support one another

01:32:43.161 --> 01:32:47.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

01:32:47.248 --> 01:32:49.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our true friendships

01:32:49.584 --> 01:32:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a valuable contribution to our joy.

01:32:55.507 --> 01:32:57.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People everywhere want to be happy,

01:32:57.884 --> 01:33:00.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many fail to find true joy

01:33:00.845 --> 01:33:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re looking in the wrong place.

01:33:04.224 --> 01:33:06.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed in this symposium,

01:33:06.977 --> 01:33:09.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world claims that we can be happy

01:33:09.729 --> 01:33:14.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we pursue wealth,
if we engage in sinful conduct,

01:33:14.359 --> 01:33:17.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we adopt extreme views of work,

01:33:17.612 --> 01:33:22.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we cultivate friendships
anywhere we can find them.

01:33:22.325 --> 01:33:26.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such assertions originate
with the ruler of the world,

01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the father of the lie, Satan the Devil.

01:33:30.125 --> 01:33:33.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look for happiness in Satan’s world,

01:33:33.587 --> 01:33:36.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to be disappointed.

01:33:36.548 --> 01:33:40.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, this first symposium

01:33:40.218 --> 01:33:42.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our “Always Rejoice”! Convention

01:33:42.596 --> 01:33:44.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has identified four factors

01:33:44.973 --> 01:33:48.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that contribute to our lasting joy.

01:33:48.018 --> 01:33:50.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word teaches us

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that joy comes from first,
living a simple life;

01:33:54.608 --> 01:33:57.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, having a clean conscience;

01:33:57.861 --> 01:34:00.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, doing meaningful work;

01:34:00.614 --> 01:34:04.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fourth, having true friendships.

01:34:04.701 --> 01:34:07.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving Father, Jehovah,

01:34:07.204 --> 01:34:10.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knows what makes us truly happy.

01:34:10.415 --> 01:34:14.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we
continue to follow his sound advice.

01:34:14.044 --> 01:34:16.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, we will find

01:34:16.755 --> 01:34:20.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
abundant joy that lasts forever.

01:34:22.261 --> 01:34:25.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for highlighting how God’s Word

01:34:25.514 --> 01:34:29.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guides us to a way of life
that is truly joyful.

01:34:30.602 --> 01:34:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite all who are able to do so

01:34:33.522 --> 01:34:36.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand and sing song number 89,

01:34:36.275 --> 01:34:40.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Listen, Obey, and Be Blessed.”

01:34:41.697 --> 01:34:46.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may wish
to remain standing for some announcements.

01:34:46.243 --> 01:34:49.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 89.

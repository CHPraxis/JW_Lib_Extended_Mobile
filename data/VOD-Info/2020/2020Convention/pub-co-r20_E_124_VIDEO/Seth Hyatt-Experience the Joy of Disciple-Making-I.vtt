00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:06.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy is a quality that is essential

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for effective disciple-making.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, the word “empathy”

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:16.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t occur in the main text
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:19.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the idea is clearly conveyed

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in expressions like “fellow feeling.”

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:27.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus Christ
are beautiful examples

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:32.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones who display empathy
in their dealings with others.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:36.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Jehovah said to his people:

00:00:36.017 --> 00:00:41.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever touches you
touches the pupil of my eye.”

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:43.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jesus was approached by a leper

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begging to be healed,

00:00:49.031 --> 00:00:51.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was Jesus’ response?

00:00:52.326 --> 00:00:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account tells us
that he reached out his hand,

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touched the man, and said: “I want to!”

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:01.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy is the ability to understand
another person’s thinking,

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:11.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feelings, concerns, anxieties.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not come naturally,

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it can be cultivated.

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures provide us with examples

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of individuals who were empathetic.

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:27.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the apostle Paul,

00:01:27.905 --> 00:01:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was a very effective disciple-maker,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also empathetic.

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn in your Bible, please,
to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verses 7 and 8:

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:52.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:54.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“tenderly cares for her own children.

00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God

00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also our very selves,

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:19.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Paul approach his ministry?

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he says he was “gentle,”

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he displayed “tender affection,”

00:02:26.676 --> 00:02:30.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who responded to the good news

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:33.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became “beloved to [him].”

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:38.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul uses a very powerful illustration

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:42.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that of a mother caring for her children.

00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the human context,

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is probably no more
powerful example of empathy

00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than that of a mother.

00:02:50.493 --> 00:02:53.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She feels her child’s pain.

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:58.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her child rejoices, she rejoices.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her child weeps, she weeps.

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy.

00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:07.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice,

00:03:07.428 --> 00:03:12.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said that he was ‘determined to impart
not only the good news of God

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his own soul’?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true
that as we help individuals today,

00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:24.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not a matter of only imparting
the facts of the truth?

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students need help in many ways.

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:34.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the apostle Paul,
we’re self-sacrificing,

00:03:34.582 --> 00:03:39.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
willing to put the interests of others
ahead of our own interests.

00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re empathetic.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:46.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:48.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take note of how Neeta

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides practical assistance
to her Bible student.

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:03.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry I’m late.

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:04.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fine.

00:04:06.532 --> 00:04:07.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this mine?

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My treat.

00:04:09.577 --> 00:04:11.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, brilliant! Thanks.

00:04:11.704 --> 00:04:13.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t have any breakfast.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we left off at paragraph 10.

00:04:17.627 --> 00:04:21.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, I don’t have it in me today.

00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:23.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got like two hours of sleep.

00:04:26.136 --> 00:04:28.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you all right?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just super stressed—can’t focus.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:35.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really sorry.

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My boyfriend, school,

00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:42.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work, everything else

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:45.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I just don’t even have time to breathe.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my schedule gets a bit crazy,

00:04:48.243 --> 00:04:51.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on organizing what I can.

00:04:51.872 --> 00:04:53.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s that?

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I give everything a proper place.

00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’m not really
the organization type.

00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:01.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can help,

00:05:02.592 --> 00:05:06.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, if you want.

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:08.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess a little help couldn’t hurt.

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:12.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how organized
is your place right now?

00:05:15.397 --> 00:05:18.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well,

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:21.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with God all things are possible.”

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where shall we start?

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re the neat freak. You tell me.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find the bed;
we’ll work from there.

00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:47.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:50.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Neeta display empathy?

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:55.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she was observant,
she was a good listener,

00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:59.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she offered practical assistance,
didn’t she?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had some food for her Bible student.

00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the dramatization,

00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was helping in other practical ways.

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:13.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think we would all agree
that she showed fellow feeling

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her Bible student.

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and I have to do these things as well.

00:06:18.547 --> 00:06:20.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be observant.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you know about your Bible student?

00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:27.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the student’s circumstances in life?

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the student’s family situation?

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:35.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the student have hobbies, interests?

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:39.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the religious background?

00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:41.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does your student believe?

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, be observant, and ask good questions.

00:06:46.494 --> 00:06:48.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you ask a question,

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:52.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give your student time to answer.

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:54.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is our inclination

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we ask our student a question

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the answer doesn’t come quickly?

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tend to jump in to save our student,

00:07:05.472 --> 00:07:08.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that approach isn’t really helpful.

00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:12.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you ask a question, be patient

00:07:12.146 --> 00:07:16.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—allow the student
time to think and to respond.

00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:20.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the student responds, be positive

00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—commend the student
for being honest, forthright,

00:07:24.576 --> 00:07:29.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if the answer
is not exactly what you were hoping for.

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:34.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep in mind
that as we observe and listen

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:37.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask questions
and display personal interest,

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re very careful not to pry into matters

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are really not our business.

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:46.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we don’t want to show
inappropriate interest

00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:50.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by becoming overly familiar
with the Bible student.

00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:58.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does your Bible student
need practical assistance?

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we listen and observe,

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:04.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re in a position to share information

00:08:04.618 --> 00:08:08.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be truly helpful to the student.

00:08:08.206 --> 00:08:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid the tendency
—the temptation—

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:14.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give superficial advice.

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:19.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s much better to meditate, do research,

00:08:19.384 --> 00:08:22.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you can give the student

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:24.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tailored Bible-based advice

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taken from Bible-based publications

00:08:28.018 --> 00:08:31.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that specifically address
the student’s needs.

00:08:31.188 --> 00:08:33.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is beautiful.

00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:38.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be prepared, too,
to explain how to apply the counsel.

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:42.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People’s lives are so complicated;

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face so many challenges
that they may not know how.

00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So explain, but don’t pressure.

00:08:52.252 --> 00:08:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best change
always comes from the inside out.

00:08:57.133 --> 00:09:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, the Bible student’s heart

00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:02.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should motivate him or her

00:09:02.889 --> 00:09:05.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make necessary adjustments in life.

00:09:07.852 --> 00:09:10.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does your student need

00:09:10.063 --> 00:09:13.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Well, assist him.

00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that you can provide
transportation yourself,

00:09:19.323 --> 00:09:23.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it may be a matter of helping the student
to know where the Kingdom Hall is

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:26.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then helping him to understand

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the public transportation system.

00:09:30.209 --> 00:09:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever help is needed,
take those steps.

00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ensure that your student
has wholesome association.

00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:41.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time goes by,

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:45.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your student is sure
to lose former associates,

00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:47.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either because the student decides

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:51.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the former associates decide.

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:53.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fill the void,

00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:55.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and include your student

00:09:55.903 --> 00:09:59.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in gatherings in keeping
with his spiritual advancement

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as appropriate.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:06.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, show fellow feeling.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:10.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, empathy is not a technique;

00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a quality that springs from the heart.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s communicated in so many ways,

00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just by our words and our actions

00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:24.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by our facial expressions,
our gestures, our body language

00:10:24.225 --> 00:10:27.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all communicate a message to the student.

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:30.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the student will discern very quickly

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if our words and actions
are motivated by love.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are,
then we are demonstrating empathy

00:10:39.616 --> 00:10:44.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflecting the love and concern
that Jehovah has for the Bible student.

00:10:44.622 --> 00:10:49.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what will draw
the student to Jehovah.

00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege we have to share
in this vital disciple-making work!

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:10:56.301 --> 00:11:01.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us succeed
in showing the quality of empathy.

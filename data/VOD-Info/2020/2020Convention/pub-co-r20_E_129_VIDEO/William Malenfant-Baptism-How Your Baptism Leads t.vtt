Among the many things
that Jesus Christ revealed to his disciples

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was this very old and fundamental truth:

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:16.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.”

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus learned this truth
from his Father, Jehovah God,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is the greatest example of a happy Giver.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 1:27,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see clear evidence
of Jehovah’s generosity.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:34.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:27 says:

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:38.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And God went on to create
the man in his image,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in God’s image he created him;

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
male and female he created them.”

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:51.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This verse describes humans
as a unique creation,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different in many ways
from all other forms of life on earth.

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made in Jehovah’s image.

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:03.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God designed us
to reflect his personality.

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have within us
the capability of cultivating

00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:11.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine quality of generosity

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiencing the happiness
that comes from giving.

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really do get pleasure
out of giving to family, friends,

00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:23.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to people we don’t know.

00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us feel good to give to others.

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:32.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,
the most important giving that we can do

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the key to happiness in life

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to give our Creator what he deserves.

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:44.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 4:11

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:49.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets forth clearly the things
that Jehovah God deserves,

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:54.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it shows the reason why
we should give such things to God.

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:59.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me Revelation 4:11.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are worthy, Jehovah our God,

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:10.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to receive the glory
and the honor and the power,

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:14.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you created all things,

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:17.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and because of your will
they came into existence

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were created.”

00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We exist because Jehovah created us.

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:27.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fact makes him worthy

00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:30.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive from us glory,

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honor, and power.

00:02:32.593 --> 00:02:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you candidates for baptism
have made the decision to do,

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:42.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give Jehovah God
glory and honor and power.

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:45.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do this by praising his name,

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:47.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by obeying him,

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:49.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by using your life

00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your power, energy,
and your whole strength—

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:54.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do his will.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By getting baptized
in symbol of your dedication to God,

00:03:00.497 --> 00:03:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are declaring publicly

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:06.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have given yourself to Jehovah.

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:10.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have made a gift to God
of your heart, mind, and strength

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your very being.

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have made this decision

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:18.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you have come to know Jehovah

00:03:18.432 --> 00:03:20.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you love him.

00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are happy
to acknowledge your decision

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give yourselves to God,

00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:32.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wholeheartedly welcome
you baptism candidates.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving of yourself in baptism
will lead to great happiness

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it opens up opportunities

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give of yourself in ways that truly count.

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:51.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your baptism brings you
into a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:54.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It allows you
to participate in doing his will

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:58.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his approval
because you are obeying him.

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:02.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:05.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualified to present the evidence

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:09.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is the only “living and true God”!

00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:15.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dedication and baptism
opens the door for you

00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:19.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become a part
of the worldwide brotherhood,

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a true modern-day miracle.

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is nothing anywhere on this planet

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:30.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can compare to the visible part
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made up of people from all nations,
tribes, languages, and backgrounds

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who really do love God
and love one another.

00:04:41.392 --> 00:04:43.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have more opportunities now

00:04:43.853 --> 00:04:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than ever before to give
and receive encouragement.

00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:51.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of the encouragement
you get from the brotherhood,

00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:57.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in fulfillment of Jesus’ promise

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:00.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mark 10:29, 30.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those two verses,

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:05.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus assured his disciples

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would “get 100 times more”

00:05:08.295 --> 00:05:11.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they left behind in this old world,

00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:13.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and in the coming system of things,”

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:17.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said that they
would have “everlasting life.”

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:20.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have given Jesus
pleasure to share

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wonderful and encouraging promise
with his disciples,

00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:29.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it most certainly made
the disciples happy.

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:31.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it is, isn’t it?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving and making other people happy
makes us happy.

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The happiness you can experience
by helping others is unlimited

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah focuses
on your motive for giving

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:47.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why you give.

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:50.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never takes
for granted what you do,

00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:53.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will always reward you for it.

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:58.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me Hebrews 6:10,

00:05:58.137 --> 00:06:00.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note of the fact

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:04.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
remembers why you give

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:08.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you do
to advance Kingdom interests

00:06:08.106 --> 00:06:12.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 6:10.

00:06:12.944 --> 00:06:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:06:15.572 --> 00:06:20.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:06:20.577 --> 00:06:25.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love you showed
for his name by ministering

00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:29.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continuing to minister
to the holy ones.”

00:06:29.836 --> 00:06:31.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the scripture shows,

00:06:31.838 --> 00:06:34.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah won’t forget what you do

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:38.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are motivated
by love for his name.

00:06:39.763 --> 00:06:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now consider more closely two areas

00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:48.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which baptism broadens
your opportunities to give:

00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:50.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, making disciples,

00:06:50.983 --> 00:06:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, helping your brothers
and sisters in the faith.

00:06:56.906 --> 00:06:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The foremost way
for you and for me to give

00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by sharing
the good news of the Kingdom

00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making disciples.

00:07:04.831 --> 00:07:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ exhortation to make disciples

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:13.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The commission to make disciples

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:16.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given not only
to the first-century Christians

00:07:16.342 --> 00:07:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to all of Jesus’ disciples,

00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:22.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right down to the time of the end
in which we are living.

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think for a moment

00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:28.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is involved in disciple-making.

00:07:28.688 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the result of preaching and teaching.

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that it takes time

00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:37.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for and take part in the ministry.

00:07:38.782 --> 00:07:42.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sample presentations
we see in the midweek meetings

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:44.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not complicated,

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:47.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s good that they
don’t change too often.

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have a presentation well in mind

00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:53.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be prepared for the field service,

00:07:53.797 --> 00:07:58.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may need to give up some time
you formerly spent on yourself.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:04.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes time to learn a presentation
and to become familiar with it.

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:07.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking the time is worth it.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good feeling
to be prepared and ready to preach

00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:17.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have something to say and a video 
to show whenever you have the opportunity.

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:21.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are sheep out there,

00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:24.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we don’t know where they are,

00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we try to call on everyone.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to hear about the Kingdom,

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether they accept the message or not.

00:08:34.256 --> 00:08:36.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t become discouraged

00:08:36.383 --> 00:08:39.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you don’t have
the kind of results you anticipated.

00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:43.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just keep on preaching,
and you will be blessed.

00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:48.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you preach,
you are engaging

00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:51.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most important work
being done today

00:08:51.523 --> 00:08:54.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—announcing God’s Kingdom—

00:08:54.318 --> 00:08:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of Matthew 24:14:

“And this good news of the Kingdom

and then the end will come.”

00:09:11.794 --> 00:09:14.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are successful
in obeying Jesus’ words

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:17.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach the Kingdom message

00:09:17.008 --> 00:09:20.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when people reject the good news.

00:09:20.094 --> 00:09:23.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t control how people respond,

00:09:23.222 --> 00:09:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you do not let up in preaching
the lifesaving message of truth.

00:09:28.228 --> 00:09:33.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honest hearts respond
to the Kingdom message.

00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and trust in Jehovah

00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his powerful spirit to help you.

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:44.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your work will have
everlasting results for you personally

00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for those who listen to you
and embrace the truth.

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul tells us

00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:9

00:09:55.422 --> 00:09:58.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by sharing in the ministry,

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you become Jehovah’s fellow worker.

00:10:01.845 --> 00:10:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine?

00:10:03.847 --> 00:10:06.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah invites imperfect humans

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cooperate with him,
the almighty Creator,

00:10:10.229 --> 00:10:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a special work that he
considers highly important.

00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith and hope
become stronger as you give

00:10:19.322 --> 00:10:22.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sharing with others
what you know about Jehovah

00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Kingdom.

00:10:24.952 --> 00:10:29.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
the simple and enriching truth stated

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:34.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 11:24;

00:10:34.212 --> 00:10:38.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it applies both materially and spiritually.

00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:43.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Proverbs 11:24,

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:45.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it reads:

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One gives generously

00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and ends up with more;

00:10:50.812 --> 00:10:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“another withholds what should be given,

00:10:54.483 --> 00:10:57.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he comes to poverty.”

00:10:58.195 --> 00:11:01.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how much
you give to Jehovah,

00:11:01.031 --> 00:11:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will always get back
more than you give.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t outgive Jehovah!

00:11:08.414 --> 00:11:10.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:11:10.624 --> 00:11:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seize every opportunity
to give of yourself in the ministry,

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:19.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your giving
will continue to bring you happiness.

00:11:19.008 --> 00:11:23.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more involved you are,
the happier you will be.

00:11:23.888 --> 00:11:28.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Engage in the ministry
every week if at all possible.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, think seriously about reaching out

00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:35.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as an auxiliary pioneer
or a regular pioneer.

00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:40.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to pioneers about the joy
they get from the ministry.

00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:42.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s contagious!

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:46.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many doors to wonderful experiences 
and blessings

00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:50.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open to those who reach out
to expand their ministry.

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:56.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your regular participation
in the preaching work

00:11:56.671 --> 00:12:01.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows you the opportunity
to develop skill in using the Bible,

00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:06.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting conversations,
and in using the Teaching Toolbox.

00:12:07.349 --> 00:12:11.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us enjoy doing
the things that we do well;

00:12:11.103 --> 00:12:15.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re good at something,
usually you like doing it.

00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:19.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work at improving
the quality of your ministry.

00:12:19.653 --> 00:12:23.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, your joy will increase.

00:12:23.574 --> 00:12:25.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way joy increases

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by participating in various forms
of the ministry

00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—public witnessing,
house to house, informal,

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:36.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telephone witnessing, and letter writing.

00:12:36.003 --> 00:12:40.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you can develop 
your skills in using the Bible,

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:45.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your tablet, or cell phone 
to bring up scriptures or videos.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take the time to practice
starting conversations

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using the Teaching Toolbox.

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:56.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does take practice
to find exactly what you’re looking for

00:12:56.274 --> 00:12:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to use it to give a witness.

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:02.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approaching strangers

00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:05.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and engaging them
in conversation about the Bible

00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be a challenge.

00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:14.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One reason is because some of us
are more reserved than others.

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:19.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to introduce
Sister Loraini Jackson.

00:13:19.923 --> 00:13:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Jackson has been serving
for many years in special full-time service

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:28.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visiting a variety of lands
with her husband, Geoffrey.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Jackson,

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:35.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at first, 
when you learned the truth

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Fiji as a young person,

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did you feel
about sharing in the ministry?

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Malenfant,

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am shy and reserved by nature.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:50.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
that when I first learned

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:54.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us
to preach his good news,

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was excited,

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even more so, I was terrified.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:04.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that preaching
would mean approaching strangers

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to have
conversations with them,

00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:09.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often when they least expected it.

00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:13.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really,
all I wanted to do is just be quiet

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be on my own.

00:14:15.564 --> 00:14:20.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think there are many brothers
and sisters who feel the same way.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:25.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to share
in the ministry more fully?

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:27.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the main thing
that has helped me

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is relying on Jehovah’s help
through prayer.

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:35.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many others, I talk to Jehovah
constantly about my struggles

00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the struggle to say the right thing,

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the struggle to not show fear

00:14:41.257 --> 00:14:44.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my manner or my voice,

00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:46.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the struggle to remember
the right scriptures to use

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to use them well

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:51.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, if someone is rude,

00:14:51.183 --> 00:14:55.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to remain calm and kind.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:58.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words are appreciated.

00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us, what are some of the things

00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:04.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bring you joy in the ministry?

00:15:04.697 --> 00:15:07.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things that bring me joy
are the very things

00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:10.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not have done
without Jehovah’s help

00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:14.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things like conversing freely
with people (strangers)

00:15:14.833 --> 00:15:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah and the Bible

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:21.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then having the opportunity
to see people’s eyes light up

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they read or understand
a Bible verse for the first time

00:15:26.845 --> 00:15:28.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I think those are really precious)

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, helping a Bible student
work through a problem

00:15:32.768 --> 00:15:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then also trying
to become their friend.

00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:40.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think things like these really show
Jehovah’s power and support.

00:15:40.734 --> 00:15:44.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all I can do is thank him for them.

00:15:44.071 --> 00:15:47.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very encouraging for all of us,
Sister Jackson.

00:15:47.867 --> 00:15:49.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My final question is,

00:15:49.994 --> 00:15:52.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel about participating

00:15:52.621 --> 00:15:55.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in various aspects of the ministry?

00:15:55.541 --> 00:15:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I still lack so much,
but I’m so grateful

00:15:58.628 --> 00:16:01.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the opportunities I’ve been given

00:16:01.756 --> 00:16:04.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to participate
in various aspects of the ministry

00:16:04.926 --> 00:16:09.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’ve allowed me
to help others start their own journeys

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to becoming Jehovah’s friend,

00:16:11.641 --> 00:16:14.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ve also given me an opportunity

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:19.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with Jehovah
and really rely on him.

00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel the ministry helps one,

00:16:22.986 --> 00:16:24.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if one is shy,

00:16:24.988 --> 00:16:27.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on others,

00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah, on Jesus,

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on people and their needs

00:16:31.828 --> 00:16:35.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not so much on one’s own limitations.

00:16:35.957 --> 00:16:40.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true,
I’m still very reserved and shy.

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:44.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as those close to me know,
some days are good,

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:47.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other days I feel
like hiding somewhere

00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:49.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not saying much.

00:16:49.054 --> 00:16:53.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the ministry
has helped me manage my shyness

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:58.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has helped train me
to accept other assignments of service.

00:16:58.105 --> 00:17:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am convinced that anyone,
whether timid or otherwise,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can rejoice in the ministry,

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided that they
rely constantly on Jehovah

00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on him.

00:17:11.285 --> 00:17:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Sister Jackson,

00:17:14.122 --> 00:17:17.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for such encouraging expressions of faith.

00:17:19.127 --> 00:17:22.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is there to help us

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we trust in him
and put forth a sincere effort

00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:29.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give of ourselves
in the preaching activity.

The second way to give is by helping

00:17:33.767 --> 00:17:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those related to us in the faith.”

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote about this at Galatians 6:10.

00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:42.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:46.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, then,
as long as we have the opportunity,

00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:49.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us work what is good toward all,

00:17:49.908 --> 00:17:54.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

related to us in the faith.”

00:17:54.913 --> 00:17:58.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you are part of a beautiful family.

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:01.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Willingly use your time, energy,

and resources to assist
your fellow believers

00:18:04.465 --> 00:18:07.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “work what is good toward [them].”

00:18:07.551 --> 00:18:10.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about your brothers 
in the congregation

00:18:10.221 --> 00:18:14.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and identify those whom you
can assist in practical ways.

00:18:14.433 --> 00:18:16.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself,

00:18:16.435 --> 00:18:18.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there someone in the congregation

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:22.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I could help by giving
that person a ride to a meeting

or perhaps running
an errand for him or for her?’

00:18:25.903 --> 00:18:30.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps visit the elderly
and offer to assist them in practical ways.

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:35.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all want to show personal interest
in our brothers and sisters

00:18:35.497 --> 00:18:38.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be a source
of encouragement to them.

00:18:39.626 --> 00:18:44.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we want to support
relief efforts for needy Christians.

00:18:44.548 --> 00:18:46.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Natural disasters occur,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there is sickness as well as poverty,

00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:51.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among many other things.

00:18:51.972 --> 00:18:53.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it thrill you

00:18:53.974 --> 00:18:56.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you read how
the brothers respond generously

00:18:56.435 --> 00:19:00.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist fellow believers
who are in need?

At 2 Corinthians 8:1-4,

00:19:04.193 --> 00:19:06.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul expresses deep appreciation

for the brothers in Macedonia,

00:19:09.073 --> 00:19:12.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

in the relief ministry for the holy ones.”

00:19:56.788 --> 00:20:00.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in Macedonia
took the initiative

to provide loving help
to their spiritual family

00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of their own poverty.

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:10.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fine example for us to be generous

00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to assist
our spiritual brothers and sisters

00:20:14.306 --> 00:20:16.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever way we can!

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:22.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving to others
can be done in different ways.

00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:26.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that thought in mind,

00:20:26.152 --> 00:20:30.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are happy to interview
Sister Penny Pierce.

00:20:30.364 --> 00:20:34.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pierce,
you have raised a family;

00:20:34.118 --> 00:20:37.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve spent decades
in special full-time service

00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and traveled to a variety of lands

00:20:39.916 --> 00:20:43.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your husband, Guy,
who was a member of the Governing Body.

00:20:43.628 --> 00:20:47.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, like Dorcas, 
you have a reputation

00:20:47.173 --> 00:20:51.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “[abounding] in good deeds 
and gifts of mercy.”

00:20:51.094 --> 00:20:53.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us, Sister Pierce,

00:20:53.179 --> 00:20:56.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what motivates you to assist others?

00:20:56.516 --> 00:21:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is found
at 1 Chronicles 29:14, where it says:

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For everything is from you,

00:21:02.773 --> 00:21:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have given to you
what comes from your own hand.”

00:21:06.276 --> 00:21:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So anything that I may give
actually comes from Jehovah.

00:21:10.364 --> 00:21:12.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, with the coronavirus,

00:21:12.658 --> 00:21:17.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen an outpouring
of Jehovah’s people giving.

00:21:17.121 --> 00:21:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have given time and energy,

00:21:20.124 --> 00:21:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotions, a listening ear.

00:21:22.293 --> 00:21:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And video chatting
—everyone (young and old)

00:21:25.337 --> 00:21:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave love, faith, and trust.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it didn’t cost anything.

00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,
‘Jehovah is doing wonderful things

00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:34.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of a tragic pandemic.’

00:21:34.347 --> 00:21:39.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you said
is truly practical and very helpful.

00:21:39.352 --> 00:21:43.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pierce,
please tell us the experience you had

00:21:43.231 --> 00:21:45.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you hosted brothers and sisters

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:48.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during a special preaching campaign.

00:21:48.486 --> 00:21:53.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at times, we have
the opportunity to help materially too.

00:21:53.199 --> 00:21:55.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago,
when the family was home,

00:21:55.577 --> 00:21:58.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had 30 people
coming to stay at our home.

00:21:58.204 --> 00:22:00.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were going to preach to refugees.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had one bathroom,
and I had 25 dollars,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which I spent completely on food.

00:22:06.171 --> 00:22:08.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I had zero.

00:22:08.173 --> 00:22:10.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never told anyone
that we didn’t have money.

00:22:10.509 --> 00:22:12.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew they didn’t have money too.

00:22:12.636 --> 00:22:14.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a wonderful time!

00:22:14.721 --> 00:22:18.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the friends left Sunday night,
I had more food than when they came.

00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:22.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That food lasted us for ten days,
to the end of the month.

00:22:22.896 --> 00:22:25.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I worried about the effect
on my teenage sons.

00:22:25.983 --> 00:22:28.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked one how he felt.

00:22:28.444 --> 00:22:33.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, 
“I know you have a jar of flour and oil.”

00:22:33.365 --> 00:22:36.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t worry anymore.

00:22:36.076 --> 00:22:38.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah certainly blessed you.

00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:42.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us how you view
what you did to host the friends

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came to preach in your area.

00:22:45.002 --> 00:22:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these acts
of kindness that I did

00:22:47.797 --> 00:22:49.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were very small to me,

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:53.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but often I didn’t know the big impact
it would have on their lives.

00:22:53.469 --> 00:22:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when you realize

00:22:55.471 --> 00:22:58.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve had the privilege
of working with holy spirit.

00:22:58.266 --> 00:23:01.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing I did;
it’s what Jehovah did.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful, Sister Pierce.

00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we would like to hear
a final expression from you

00:23:09.486 --> 00:23:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the joy that you
receive personally from giving.

00:23:14.324 --> 00:23:18.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One never gives to Jehovah
without receiving back a hundred fold.

00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:20.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not come from the same source,

00:23:20.372 --> 00:23:22.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it will come.

00:23:22.416 --> 00:23:25.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises at Acts 20:35:

00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:29.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.”

00:23:29.047 --> 00:23:33.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to admit,
Jehovah spoils me with blessings.

00:23:33.427 --> 00:23:37.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much,
Sister Pierce.

00:23:37.389 --> 00:23:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has certainly blessed you

00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:44.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your generosity
and your warm Christian hospitality.

00:23:47.233 --> 00:23:52.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping one another
strengthens the bonds of the brotherhood.

00:23:52.196 --> 00:23:57.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is nothing like knowing
that your brothers really do love you.

00:23:57.952 --> 00:24:01.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how the brothers
in Jerusalem felt when they were in need

00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:05.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received loving assistance
from the brothers in Corinth.

00:24:06.461 --> 00:24:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Corinthians 9:11-14.

00:24:12.425 --> 00:24:14.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is where the apostle Paul describes

00:24:14.761 --> 00:24:18.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reaction
of the needy brothers in Jerusalem

00:24:18.139 --> 00:24:22.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the generosity
of the brothers in Corinth.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 2 Corinthians 9:11-14.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Paul wrote:

00:24:30.611 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything you are being enriched

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:36.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for every sort of generosity,

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:41.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which produces through us
an expression of thanks to God;

of this public service

“is not only to provide well
for the needs of the holy ones

“but also to be rich
in many expressions of thanks to God.

“Through the proof
that this relief ministry gives,

upon you.”

00:25:25.083 --> 00:25:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in Jerusalem
glorified Jehovah,

00:25:29.004 --> 00:25:32.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just because they received
some material provisions,

00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:36.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather, it was
because the brothers in Corinth,

00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:39.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who for the most part
were new in the Christian faith,

00:25:39.139 --> 00:25:43.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were motivated by love
to send material help.

00:25:43.143 --> 00:25:46.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the truth was in their hearts

00:25:46.855 --> 00:25:51.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made them cheerful givers
to their brothers in Jerusalem.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:56.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they all were happy
and felt Jehovah’s love and approval.

00:25:57.449 --> 00:26:00.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You baptism candidates will rejoice

00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:03.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you sense and are convinced

00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:07.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is pleased with what you do.

00:26:07.752 --> 00:26:11.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 19:17 tells us

00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:15.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah views
unselfish giving to those in need.

00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:17.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:26:17.553 --> 00:26:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one showing favor
to the lowly

00:26:20.723 --> 00:26:23.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is lending to Jehovah,

00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:26.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He will repay him for what he does.”

00:26:26.729 --> 00:26:31.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine “lending to Jehovah”?

00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:34.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we give spiritual or material help

00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:36.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in need,

00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:40.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees and views it
as a loan to him.

00:26:40.494 --> 00:26:44.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you can’t outgive Jehovah.

00:26:44.206 --> 00:26:47.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By giving to others and refreshing them,

00:26:47.584 --> 00:26:51.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the giver, in turn, will benefit himself.

00:26:51.004 --> 00:26:54.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 11:25 says:

00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:56.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The generous person will prosper,

00:26:56.802 --> 00:27:01.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever refreshes others
will himself be refreshed.”

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today you feel happy

00:27:06.228 --> 00:27:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are giving
of yourself to Jehovah

00:27:09.565 --> 00:27:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve him forever.

00:27:11.734 --> 00:27:16.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You make us happy
by making that decision.

00:27:16.155 --> 00:27:20.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We exhort you to maintain your happiness

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing what you
can reasonably do to help others

00:27:24.122 --> 00:27:28.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving both in the ministry
and in the congregation.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give back to you

00:27:31.546 --> 00:27:35.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more ways than you can imagine.

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:37.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May the way in which you live

00:27:37.594 --> 00:27:40.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as dedicated servants of Jehovah

00:27:40.597 --> 00:27:44.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect forever the fundamental truth

00:27:44.142 --> 00:27:46.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
revealed by Jesus:

00:27:46.394 --> 00:27:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There <i>is</i>  more happiness in giving

00:27:49.815 --> 00:27:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than there is in receiving.”

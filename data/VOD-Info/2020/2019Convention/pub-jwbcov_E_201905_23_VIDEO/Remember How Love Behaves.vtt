Absalom quickly organized

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a full-scale conspiracy for the throne.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He forced his own father,

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:15.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David, to flee for his life.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While David was traveling through Bahurim,

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shimei began walking along a mountainside.

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ugh!

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You bloodguilty man!

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should this dead dog,

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shimei, curse my lord the king?

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go over, please,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take off his head.

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:46.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened next, Nathan?

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David wasn’t so quick to act.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave him alone!

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps Jehovah will see my affliction

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will restore goodness to me.

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:16.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mephibosheth

00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his grandfather had tried to kill David.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When David became king

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked Mephibosheth to the palace, 

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he must have wondered why.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is your servant.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mephibosheth,

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not be afraid,

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I will certainly show loyal love to you

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of your father Jonathan,

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will return to you all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the land of Saul your grandfather.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you will always dine at my table.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:09.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your servant,

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have turned your attention

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a dead dog like me?

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come.

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, Saul, and their army

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
returned from striking down the Philistines.

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The women of all the cities of Israel

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greeted them with a celebration

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of song and dance.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The women began singing,

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul has struck down his thousands,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and David his tens of thousands.”

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only thing left to give him

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the kingship!

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that day on,

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul was always suspicious of David.

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:18.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jealousy controlled Saul

00:03:18.302 --> 00:03:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ruined his friendship with David

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was popular, good-looking,

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically strong, a talented musician,

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:38.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had been anointed as the next king.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is my eldest daughter, Merab.

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will give her to you as a wife.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who am I to be son-in-law to the king?

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other men would have used this opportunity

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to boast or to promote themselves.

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some just couldn’t understand

00:04:09.645 --> 00:04:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why David wouldn’t take more credit.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David,

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re the finest warrior we’ve ever had.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haven’t you earned the right

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:18.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept some praise?

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But who really trains me for battle?

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who rescues me from the sword?

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is my Rock; he should be praised.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is any man next to him?

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was sick.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:45.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absalom saw this

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an opportunity to seize power.

00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like his father David,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had many gifts.

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was born into a wealthy

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and powerful family.

00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:03.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned heads wherever he went,

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:06.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he relished the attention.

00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men would come to the city gate

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the king would hear their legal case.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I were appointed judge in the land,

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every man with a legal case

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or judgment could come to me 

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would see that he receives justice.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are from the royal house, my lord.

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:34.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother too has royal blood.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that I was born to lead.

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God will do what’s best for his people.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absalom seemed

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be interested in the people

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who came to David,

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:54.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was only interested in himself.

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ark of the covenant

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was finally brought to Jerusalem.

00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:07.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David and the people danced and celebrated.

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:14.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he forgotten that he is king,

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:16.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dancing like a common fool?

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How glorious the king of Israel made himself

00:06:29.868 --> 00:06:31.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the eyes of the slave girls

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his servants,

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as an empty-headed man!

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My celebration was before Jehovah.

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:42.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Michal did not love others

00:06:42.214 --> 00:06:44.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much as she loved herself.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was faithful to Jehovah for decades.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he let his guard down,

00:07:13.662 --> 00:07:17.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he coveted a married woman.

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:27.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring Bath-sheba to me.

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David and Bath-sheba committed adultery,

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:34.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she became pregnant.

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:42.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To hide their sin,

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:43.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David secretly ordered

00:07:43.442 --> 00:07:44.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bath-sheba’s husband to be killed.

00:07:55.245 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he hurt the God

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had done so much for him.

00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:20.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the run from Saul,

00:08:20.979 --> 00:08:23.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s men came to see Nabal,

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:25.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose sheep they had protected.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked only for what Nabal could spare.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David didn’t wait to react.

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:43.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone strap on your sword!

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David took action,

00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:49.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t seek Jehovah’s direction.

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:52.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Jehovah intervened

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through Nabal’s discerning wife, Abigail.

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, let the blame be on me.

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah who has held you back

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:08.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from incurring bloodguilt

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:10.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from taking revenge.

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:12.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will have no regret in your heart.

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nabal was senseless,

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:17.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was still David’s Israelite brother,

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:20.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he deserved to be treated lovingly.

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:23.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David had become provoked, and Abigail 

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:25.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rescued him from making

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the situation much worse.

00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:29.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Praise Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:09:31.258 --> 00:09:33.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has sent you this day to meet me.

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:43.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Amalekites kidnapped

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:46.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wives and children of David and his men.

00:09:50.902 --> 00:09:52.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his men became very bitter.

00:09:54.823 --> 00:09:56.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You!

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our families were never safe here.

00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:01.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You led them to their death!

“Life for life,” David—you should be stoned!

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patience, patience, please

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah may yet rescue them.

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:10:25.687 --> 00:10:28.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David looked to Jehovah for help.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David fought the Amalekites,

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:41.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rescued all of the kidnapped Israelites,

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:43.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and recovered all of the flocks

00:10:43.413 --> 00:10:44.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been taken.

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah protected us

00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave into our hand the marauder band

00:10:51.213 --> 00:10:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came against us.

00:10:53.423 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David could have given the spoils of war

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:58.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to those who trusted in him,

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:00.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he shared with all.

00:11:00.555 --> 00:11:03.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as though they had never wronged him.

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve escaped from the camp of Israel.

00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have fallen and died.

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:18.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Saul and his son Jonathan have died.

00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:20.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know?

00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:24.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stood above him and put him to death.

00:11:58.154 --> 00:12:00.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teach all of our people this dirge

00:12:00.782 --> 00:12:03.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Saul and Jonathan:

00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:08.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul and Jonathan,

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:11.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beloved and cherished during their life.

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:18.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How the mighty have fallen

00:12:22.095 --> 00:12:24.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the weapons of war have perished!”

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not once did David

00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:32.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mention Saul’s hurtful acts.

00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:35.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To David, the assassination of Saul

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:37.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an unrighteous act,

00:12:37.652 --> 00:12:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and David could never rejoice over that.

00:12:47.245 --> 00:12:49.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here I’m dwelling in a house of cedars

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:51.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while the ark of the covenant

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah is under tent cloths.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do whatever is in your heart,

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:58.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the true God is with you.

00:12:59.716 --> 00:13:02.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had spoken too quickly.

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:09.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David.

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nathan.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on, Nathan.
What is it?

00:13:15.565 --> 00:13:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah says:

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You are not the one

00:13:18.568 --> 00:13:20.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will build me a house to dwell in.’

00:13:23.448 --> 00:13:26.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s son Solomon would build the temple.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But David didn’t feel sorry for himself,

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:35.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he didn’t try to push ahead

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:37.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without Jehovah’s blessing.

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:41.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David knew God’s will, and he rejoiced in it.

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:45.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, he gathered

00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:47.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vast amount of materials

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:49.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so his son could build.

00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:11.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David had been pursued ruthlessly by Saul.

00:14:19.462 --> 00:14:22.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his men faced hunger, fear,

00:14:22.006 --> 00:14:24.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and threat of death.

00:14:27.637 --> 00:14:29.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Saul!

00:14:29.848 --> 00:14:31.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, God has surrendered

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your enemy into your hand.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:37.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me pin him to the ground.

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:43.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David could have ended his trial

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:45.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then and there,

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:47.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was a man of love.

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:49.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not harm him.

00:14:49.534 --> 00:14:54.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint

00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:55.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I should lift my hand

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:57.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the anointed of Jehovah.

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:11.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all that Saul had done,

00:15:11.514 --> 00:15:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David left the judging to Jehovah,

00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom he loved and trusted.

00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was on the run from Saul.

00:15:30.116 --> 00:15:31.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His friend Jonathan,

00:15:31.743 --> 00:15:34.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul’s son, hatched a plan to protect David.

00:15:35.997 --> 00:15:38.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could David really believe Jonathan?

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:39.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan was second in line to the throne.

00:15:42.712 --> 00:15:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only David seemed to stand in his way.

00:15:46.382 --> 00:15:48.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul had betrayed David.

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:50.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might Jonathan do the same?

00:15:50.136 --> 00:15:52.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could David put his life in Jonathan’s hands?

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:57.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah do that to Jonathan

00:15:57.644 --> 00:16:00.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more if I do not disclose it to you

00:16:00.605 --> 00:16:03.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send you away in peace.

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I swear never to withdraw

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:07.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal love from you and your household.

00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:12.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah be between us forever.

00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:17.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David loved Jonathan, and he believed him.

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That trust saved David’s life.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abner had been chief of Saul’s army.

00:16:26.798 --> 00:16:29.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pursued David in the wilderness

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:31.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and supported David’s rival

00:16:31.344 --> 00:16:33.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after David became king.

00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why was Abner coming to see David?

00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord the king,

00:16:42.605 --> 00:16:44.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a covenant with us.

00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now support you as king

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:49.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah has promised us

00:16:49.112 --> 00:16:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
salvation by means of your hand.

00:16:58.413 --> 00:17:00.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will make a covenant with you.

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David trusted Abner

00:17:04.919 --> 00:17:07.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hoped that he would now remain loyal.

00:17:12.135 --> 00:17:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Joab saw things differently.

00:17:14.345 --> 00:17:15.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have you done?

00:17:15.555 --> 00:17:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know Abner!

00:17:17.348 --> 00:17:18.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He came here to fool you

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:19.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to get to know your every move

00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:21.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find out everything that you’re doing!

00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful.

00:17:23.688 --> 00:17:25.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the law:

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You must not hold a grudge,

00:17:27.692 --> 00:17:29.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and you must love your

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fellow man as yourself.’

00:17:32.196 --> 00:17:35.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joab’s distrust grew into vengeance.

00:17:35.116 --> 00:17:37.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He later killed Abner.

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:43.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who hate expect the worst,

00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:46.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but those who love never lose hope.

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:01.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah chose David to be king,

00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:04.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had already rejected Saul.

00:18:04.187 --> 00:18:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, it wasn’t yet Jehovah’s time

00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:09.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for David to begin ruling.

00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waiting wasn’t always easy for David.

00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:15.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became a fugitive running for his life.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even his own men once threatened to kill him!

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:24.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty-two years had passed.

00:18:24.332 --> 00:18:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, he became king over all of Israel.

00:18:30.296 --> 00:18:32.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, King Saul and even some

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:35.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of David’s friends abandoned him,

00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:37.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but David endured it all.

00:18:37.345 --> 00:18:40.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had never abandoned David,

00:18:40.682 --> 00:18:42.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so how could David ever give up

00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:44.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his love for Jehovah?

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When David was anointed as king,

00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he couldn’t have imagined the tests

00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:55.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would come his way.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But love helped him to face all of them.

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:05.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David saw that without love,

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:07.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we become jealous,

00:19:09.544 --> 00:19:11.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get puffed up,

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behave indecently,

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:18.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for our own interests,

00:19:21.264 --> 00:19:24.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become provoked.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love helped David to be patient,

00:19:29.063 --> 00:19:30.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be kind,

00:19:33.109 --> 00:19:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to brag,

00:19:37.822 --> 00:19:40.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to keep account of the injury,

00:19:43.202 --> 00:19:46.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to rejoice over unrighteousness.

00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, love helped him

00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:51.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rejoice with the truth,

00:19:53.254 --> 00:19:56.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bear all things,

00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to believe all things,

00:19:59.969 --> 00:20:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hope all things,

00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to endure all things.

00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:09.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David faced many trials.

00:20:09.187 --> 00:20:12.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But love was equal to all of them.

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:17.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When David comes back to life,

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:20.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he, like love itself,

00:20:20.448 --> 00:20:23.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can live on forever.

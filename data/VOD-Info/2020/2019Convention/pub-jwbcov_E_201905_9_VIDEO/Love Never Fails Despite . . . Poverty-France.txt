00:00:03 My wife Elizabete and I immigrated to Europe in 2006
00:00:07 because of the economic situation and civil war in Angola.
00:00:15 We were very poor in Angola.
00:00:18 We had nothing to eat.
00:00:20 Sometimes we spent several days starving, with nothing to eat.
00:00:26 Despite everything, we were happy.
00:00:30 We never had the desire to immigrate.
00:00:34 We’d rather have stayed in Angola.
00:00:36 There is a big difference
00:00:39 between the African and European cultures.
00:00:44 When we arrived in France, we quickly saw the dangers we could face.
00:00:50 It was easier to have a spiritual routine in Angola.
00:00:54 Many things can distract us from our spiritual routine today.
00:01:00 If we’re not careful, modern technology can draw us away from Jehovah.
00:01:07 Despite our simple life,
00:01:09 we strive to be generous
00:01:12 and to teach our daughters to be generous and hospitable.
00:01:17 We can do small things to help others.
00:01:21 We just want to show our brothers how much we love them.
00:01:25 Relying on Jehovah for all our needs
00:01:29 and showing love to our neighbors is the most beautiful answer to poverty.

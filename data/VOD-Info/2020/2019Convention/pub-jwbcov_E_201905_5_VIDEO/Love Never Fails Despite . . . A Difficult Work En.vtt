From 1992 to 1993,

00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked in a technical assistance company.

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, my boss
asked me to lie to the clients,

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling them that they
would receive new parts

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when actually they were refurbished parts.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said: “No way!”

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t do that.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said I’d prefer to be fired rather than
do something that would displease Jehovah.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:29.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only that,
but my supervisor was verbally abusive.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes he would throw my lunch

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the trash on purpose just to be mean.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later,
my supervisor became very sick.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made the most
of the opportunity to witness to him.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he had moved
from the neighborhood,

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was studying the Bible, and that the brothers
were visiting him at his home.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before he died,
he said that he was very happy

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was learning about Jehovah.

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This showed me that with Jehovah’s help,
we can keep our integrity

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also help others to get to know him.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started my training as a bank clerk,

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t seem to be a problem initially.

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not much later, though,
my superior called me in.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She told me
that it actually would be a problem

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if customers saw me in the ministry

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I should simply stop preaching.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I explained to her that I never intended
to harm my employer’s interests.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to stop preaching—I could not do that.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was still
in my employment probation period.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two weeks later, I was summoned

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Human Resources Department
at the bank’s headquarters.

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They politely requested that I quit preaching

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I should think twice
about what was more important to me:

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my employer’s interests or my ministry.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I respectfully explained that to me

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the most important
and that I would continue preaching.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:52.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My probation period ended,
my training continued,

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and during the rest of my apprenticeship
it was never mentioned again.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am really grateful to Jehovah.

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was he who gave me
the strength not to compromise.

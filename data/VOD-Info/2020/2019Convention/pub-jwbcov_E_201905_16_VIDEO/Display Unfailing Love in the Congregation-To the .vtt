Some time ago,

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could spend entire days

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about Jehovah in the ministry.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I was so sad when I got sick,

00:00:15.202 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was used to being
out in the preaching work.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like I don’t have the strength to do

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much as I used to.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is so great.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He puts into the hearts of his people

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the desire to visit me and help me.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve cleaned my house.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even washed my clothes
and prepared my meals.

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes me happy to see them arrive,

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I tell them: “It’s so good to see you.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go, have some coffee.”

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They bring me tortillas and fruit,

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they say to me:
“Take them. They’re for you.”

00:00:56.368 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They prepared food, brought it over,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we ate it together.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved that.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so protected,
as if I were surrounded by my children.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters really help me.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A couple of days before our meeting,

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they write out my comments in big letters.

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I can practice them over and over again.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way,
I can give a comment at the meeting.

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I am sad when the brothers leave.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish they could always be by my side.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I remember Jehovah is always with me.

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago, I was in better health.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could still go out in service.

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers and sisters
have come to my aid.

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been able to go out
in public witnessing with the carts.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I continually see
Jehovah’s support and protection.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really touches my heart.

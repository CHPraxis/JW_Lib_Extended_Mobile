One day at school,

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a boy asked me in front of everybody

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why I don’t salute the flag.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to go up

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of the entire class
and give an answer.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:16.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a little scared, but I knew
I had to defend Jehovah and his name.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in a new school,

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wasn’t expecting to be pressured

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to smoke electronic cigarettes, or vape.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really intimidating.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid that if I didn’t do it,
I’d get beat up.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I love Jehovah and his standards,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I knew I needed to take a firm stand.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remembered from family worship
and our practice lessons

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the first thing I needed to do
was pray to Jehovah.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:43.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the only thing I had time to say was,
“Jehovah please help me!”

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My personal study and my Bible reading

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to view Jehovah as a close friend,

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my love for him moved me to take a stand.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quickly found out that just saying no
wasn’t going to be enough.

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My stand for Jehovah
had to be serious and specific.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to rely on him and pray, so I did.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I also realized
that I needed to do research.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found some Bible principles

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really helped me,
like not “defiling the flesh.”

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the pressure to vape came up again,

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
to give me the right words.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made me calm, and I told them:

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of what I’ve read
in the Bible, I choose not to vape.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:26.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not going to do it.
Don’t ask me again.”

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:30.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was always with me,
and I never ever felt alone.

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me boldness to talk to many students,

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve started many Bible studies.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, the pressure stopped,

00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the kids seemed
to really respect me for my stand.

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has helped me
to trust and rely on Jehovah more than ever.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:48.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love Jehovah,
and I’m so happy I took a stand for him.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would stand up for any friend,

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m glad I stood up for Jehovah 
because he’s the very best friend 

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could ever ask for.

I started studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses when I was 14.

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The moment I realized that God did exist,

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:14.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy and prayed, saying:

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:16.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I just assumed you didn’t exist.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please forgive me.”

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right away, I told my family
that I wouldn’t be able to join 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christmas and birthday parties
that we cherished.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother called all our relatives

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spoke to them in tears as
she told them that her daughter had joined

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:37.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a terrible religion.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She even told my study conductor
to give back her daughter.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She felt like I was taken from her.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I observed those things, at times,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if I was doing something wrong.

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, I knew

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if I compromised,
Jehovah would be sad.

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had kindly let me know the truth.

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I strongly felt that in order to please him,
I should not give up.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would have been easier
if I had given up, then.

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, I knew that if I did,

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t be able to draw
my parents to the truth.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I would get emotional
if I tried to talk with them face-to-face,

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:33.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I wrote them letters instead.

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:37.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed and prayed
and kept telling my mother

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much I appreciated her.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, she realized
that she hadn’t lost her daughter,

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was relieved.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now someone is calling on her, and we have

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very peaceful and pleasant relationship.

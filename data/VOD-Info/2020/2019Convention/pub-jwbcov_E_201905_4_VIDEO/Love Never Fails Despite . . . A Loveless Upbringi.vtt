Throughout my childhood,

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t receive the love
that a child should have from his family.

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:12.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my father to alcoholism
when I was very young,

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:16.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then my older brother committed suicide.

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to raise myself.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up, I was often beaten,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saw scenes of horrible violence.

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, I became a drug addict.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This loveless upbringing
made me a very violent person,

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unable to love and trust anyone.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was depressed.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t have a normal,
happy life like everyone else.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, Joseph
came home completely drunk.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He set the apartment on fire.

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in one night, we lost everything we had.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been studying the Bible
for just a few months

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the sister gave me
an envelope full of cash.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The local congregation wanted to help us buy,

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, everything we had lost.

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘It’s incredible that people
who don’t even know me

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can show such deep love and affection.’

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I met with two brothers

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that same evening, and I asked them,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can God really forgive my sins?”

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed me 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,
I realized that I could change.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had found the truth.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
I was able to give up drugs,

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
alcohol, and cigarettes in three months. 

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, I’m a very happy man.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned to trust people,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become a loving husband,

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a caring father.

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite my loveless upbringing,

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah showed me that “love never fails.”

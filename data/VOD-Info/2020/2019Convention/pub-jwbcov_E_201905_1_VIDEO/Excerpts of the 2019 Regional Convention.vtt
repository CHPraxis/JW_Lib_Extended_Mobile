My life was only work and sleep.

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:10.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t receive the love
a child should have from his family.

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we spent several days starving, 
with nothing to eat.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We lost everything we had.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing I needed to do
was pray to Jehovah.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the only thing I had time to say was
“Jehovah, please help me!”

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time, he answers my prayer.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was holding my hand,

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could almost hear him saying, 
‘I’m with you.’

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My love for Jehovah
and for my fellow Christians

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivated me to take the brothers in.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I comforted others, 
it brought me comfort too.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that the love shown 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to me by the brothers and sisters
was in imitation of Jehovah.

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah showed me that “love never fails.”

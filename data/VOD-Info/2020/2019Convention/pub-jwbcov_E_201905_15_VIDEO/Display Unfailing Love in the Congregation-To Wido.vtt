It was a dark and gloomy morning,

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my husband
and my daughter took their bicycles

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and went out to care for their Bible studies.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That evening, around 5:00 p.m.,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was waiting for them to return,

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead,

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received a message

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my husband had died

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an accident.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night,
I really wanted to receive comfort,

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because of the bad weather,

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t tell others about the accident.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That evening, my two daughters and I

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tried to look for strength and comfort

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reading our organization’s publications.

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unexpectedly,

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even despite the bad weather,

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three of our brothers and sisters
visited our home.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They rode their motorbikes
over two hours through the heavy rain.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At around midnight,

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven more brothers
and sisters from our small group

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to our house by foot.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took them an hour and a half

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk barefoot through the rain and mud

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the dark to reach us.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was strengthened

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the brothers’
and sisters’ visit that night.

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our village was very superstitious,

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worried that the death of my husband

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would bring reproach to Jehovah’s name,

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I prayed about this matter to Jehovah.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,
many more brothers and sisters

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our neighboring congregations
visited our family.

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than reproach,

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love of the brothers brought
glory and praise to Jehovah’s name.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the love and support
that our brothers and sisters showed us,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my oldest daughter
is currently serving at Bethel

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my younger daughter
is happily serving Jehovah with me.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:14.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world,
I would like to tell my husband

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the unfailing love the brothers
and sisters have shown our family

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I trained our daughters

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to progress spiritually
to the best of my ability

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their help.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One elder said to me,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are more than happy to assist
with your material needs.”

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I have become a widow,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such kindness helped me
to overcome my despair

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and renew my hope.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love of our brothers and sisters

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enabled our family to endure this tragedy.

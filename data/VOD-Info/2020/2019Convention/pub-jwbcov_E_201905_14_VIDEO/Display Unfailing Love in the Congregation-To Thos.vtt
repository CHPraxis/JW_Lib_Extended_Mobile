In the circuit work,
we visit several poor communities

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:11.907 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the challenges
we face here is security.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these communities,
there are a lot of conflicts and shootings

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between rival drug cartels
and between gang members and the police.

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s common for us to see
armed gang members when we’re preaching,

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often they are taking drugs.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re visiting
the congregations in these communities,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers really take care of us
and don’t let us out of their sight.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re always thinking about our safety
because we’re not locals,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s possible that some gang members
may not like us being there.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of these communities
have a lot of steps to walk up and down,

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of our brothers
have physical limitations.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, just knowing
that our brothers are always close by

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the strength
to continue serving them in the circuit.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these acts of love,
whether large or small,

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really motivate us
to keep working for Jehovah.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We owe a lot to the brothers and sisters

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for helping us
get through all of these situations.

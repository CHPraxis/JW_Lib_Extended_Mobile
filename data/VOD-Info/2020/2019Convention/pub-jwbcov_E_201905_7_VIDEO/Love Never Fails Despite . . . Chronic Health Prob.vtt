I’ve been suffering from a very rare type
of cancer since I was eight years old.

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a tumor growing
along my spine next to my heart.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It causes heart problems
and very violent back pains.

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged Jehovah not to fall apart.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was going to break down,

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before I had even finished my prayer,

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt a veil
of peace and serenity envelop me.

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was holding my hand,

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could almost hear
him saying, ‘I’m with you.’

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experiencing such extreme trials

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowed me really
to taste Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s wonderful.

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a lot of things I’d like to do,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I am unable to because of my sickness.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had many feelings since my childhood:

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
frustration, anger, even denial.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:05.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah really helped me
accept my situation.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always taught me

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cherish my relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, I just need to know
that Jehovah loves me.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I don’t feel well,

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray to him very intensely
for very precise things.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time, he answers my prayer.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matteo started to pioneer when he was 14.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We
—his parents—

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with his brother, his sister,
and his friends thought,

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If Matteo, who has cancer,

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be a regular pioneer,
then we should also do it.’

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the most precious blessing is to see

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is always there for me, constantly,

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know he will never let me down.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His “undeserved kindness”
is sufficient for me.

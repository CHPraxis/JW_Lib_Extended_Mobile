Thinking back,

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I knew
what it meant to show love,

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had a lot to learn.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:16.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been at this for hours.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need sleep.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just five minutes.

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, Carl’s been calling.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You really should pay him another visit.

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grace says he’s not doing too good.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I promise
—just as soon as I get past this talk.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d known Carl and Grace since I was 17.

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carl had been my spiritual dad.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always there for me.

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with him being in and out

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the hospital, 
I tried to be there for them.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:23.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’d just been so busy<i>.</i>

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed like so many new responsibilities

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hit me all at once.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Capra, do you have a second?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Kev.

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhh, maybe a little later, OK?

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I figured that once my schedule freed up,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d make more time for everyone,
including Carl.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I didn’t realize

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how quickly time can run out.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:20.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grace said no one could know

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d pass so suddenly
and not to beat myself up about it.

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I would lament that decision

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a long time.

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never again

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to miss an opportunity to show love.

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:40.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Capra, do you have a second?

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Kevin.
How’s it going?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good . . .

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that learning
to show love more fully then,

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would help prepare us for what lay ahead.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, showing love

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:17.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would call for even greater sacrifices.

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hands up!
Get down!

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get down!
Get down!

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the floor!
On the floor!

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are they?

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are they?

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:39.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Answer me!

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you know where they are.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:57.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so glad that I never gave up
in learning to show love

00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah never gave up on me.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when I see Carl,

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have centuries of happy memories,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
centuries of showing him
and all of my brothers

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sisters loyal love.

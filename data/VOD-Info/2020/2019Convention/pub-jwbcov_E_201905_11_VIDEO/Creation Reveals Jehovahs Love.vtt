Everything on earth

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made from fewer than one hundred
naturally occurring elements,

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as oxygen,

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
carbon,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calcium,

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and iron.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are such elements formed?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many are created inside of stars,

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where tremendous heat and pressure

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cause atoms to fuse together.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stars like our sun fuse hydrogen,
the lightest element,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to form helium,
a heavier element.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helium fuses to make carbon.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a star progressively forms
heavier elements,

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it becomes larger.

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its core becomes hotter and denser.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the core collapses on itself

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the star explodes,

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becoming a supernova.

00:01:01.165 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A supernova forms even heavier elements

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shoots them into space.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible does not describe exactly
how Jehovah formed the earth.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah ensured that earth contains

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the elements needed for life.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I see your heavens,
the works of your fingers,

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the moon and the stars
that you have prepared,

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is mortal man
that you keep him in mind,

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a son of man
that you take care of him?”

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The atmosphere

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of earth’s amazing life-support systems—

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its mix of gases sustains life.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It insulates the earth

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:20.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prevents temperature extremes

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could destroy life.

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It protects
against most life-threatening radiation

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and objects from space.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living things
both depend on the atmosphere

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to it.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people and animals breathe,

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they absorb oxygen and put carbon dioxide

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back into the air.

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plants absorb carbon dioxide
and release oxygen.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:58.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonliving systems also help

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to renew and to protect the atmosphere.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carbon dioxide trapped in rocks is recycled

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the air when volcanos erupt.

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earth’s gravity holds the atmosphere
close to the surface.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And its magnetic field
may prevent solar winds

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from eroding the atmosphere into space.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth, 
our well-supplied and well-protected home,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is indeed a loving gift.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As for the heavens,
they belong to Jehovah,

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the earth he has given
to the sons of men.”

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all plant life on earth,
the most abundant is grass.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Found on every continent,

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:06.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it covers more than one third of the planet.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grass serves as food.

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:28.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nearly 70 percent of all agricultural land

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grows grass crops.

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grass provides shelter.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bamboo, a type of grass,

00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can grow taller than 40 meters,

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 131 feet.

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This makes it a popular building material.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grass can be clothing.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in our lives almost every day.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:14.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grass is just one of many plants

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah created to meet our needs.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are mentioned by name

00:05:24.928 --> 00:05:27.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Genesis 1:12.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the earth began to produce grass,

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seed-bearing plants

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:35.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and trees yielding fruit along with seed,

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to their kinds.

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:42.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then God saw that it was good.”

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:51.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Temperatures in the Arctic
can drop to minus 50 degrees Celsius,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:59.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The polar bear, however,
maintains its body temperature

00:05:59.546 --> 00:06:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at around 37 degrees Celsius,
or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a marvel of thermal engineering.

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The transparent hairs of a polar bear
scatter the sun’s visible light,

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:17.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making them appear white.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ultraviolet rays are trapped in the fur.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bear’s black skin helps it

00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to absorb that captured heat.

00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oils in its fur also help
to keep the bear warm and dry.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From extreme temperatures

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to extreme depths,

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Mariana Trench in the Pacific

00:06:56.603 --> 00:07:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is deeper than earth’s tallest mountains.

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creatures survive here
despite perpetual darkness

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the crushing weight of the waters.

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:18.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fish living at extreme depths
have a highly concentrated chemical

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:21.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their cells that keeps proteins
and membranes working properly.

00:07:27.092 --> 00:07:31.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has marvelously equipped
these and other animals.

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:35.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this say
about our own value in God’s eyes?

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:41.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Observe intently the birds of heaven;

00:07:41.106 --> 00:07:45.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they do not sow seed or reap 
or gather into storehouses,

“yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:52.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you not worth more than they are?”

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the moment we are born,

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:02.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience the world through our senses.

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:08.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Touch lets us feel safe and loved.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:16.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We use it to explore and learn.

00:08:16.808 --> 00:08:19.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sounds we hear convey meaning.

00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With two ears,
we can locate a sound’s direction.

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:31.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different wavelengths of light

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are perceived as a range of vivid colors.

00:08:34.951 --> 00:08:39.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Images from each eye combine in 3-D

00:08:39.164 --> 00:08:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can better judge
depth and distance.

00:08:44.294 --> 00:08:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can detect over ten thousand smells

00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:49.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using a small group of cells

00:08:49.383 --> 00:08:52.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that detect microscopic materials in the air.

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:55.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We taste,

00:08:55.931 --> 00:08:58.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see, smell,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touch, and hear

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:04.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one enjoyable experience,

with all the senses converging in one place

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:08.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our brain.

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:11.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some two hundred billion nerve cells

00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:13.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are connected by trillions of tiny contacts.

00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brain interprets
chemical signals from each sense,

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:21.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
connects new information
to what we already know,

00:09:21.873 --> 00:09:24.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stores lasting memories.

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:29.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is a precious gift
from our loving Creator.

00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:33.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David was inspired to write:

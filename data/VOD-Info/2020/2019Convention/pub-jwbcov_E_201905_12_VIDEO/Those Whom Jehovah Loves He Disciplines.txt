00:00:02 I was raised in the truth
00:00:04 and had good spiritual examples in my family
00:00:07 that helped me to set goals at a young age.
00:00:11 I progressed to baptism in my teen years
00:00:13 and also started regular pioneering as a teenager.
00:00:16 But I started hanging around the wrong crowd
00:00:19 (inside the congregation first
00:00:21 and then bad association outside)
00:00:24 partying, drinking heavily,
00:00:28 living a double life.
00:00:30 I knew I couldn’t continue that and stay at home
00:00:33 because my parents were still serving Jehovah faithfully,
00:00:35 so I decided to move out
00:00:37 and go into the world 100 percent because I just wanted to have fun.
00:00:43 Well, with nothing holding me back,
00:00:45 the partying and the heavy drinking
00:00:46 led to experimenting with drugs and living an immoral lifestyle.
00:00:52 The lifestyle in the world was pretty much to work all week
00:00:56 and to party on the weekend, and that’s what we did.
00:00:58 But I eventually saw that that was just a vicious cycle.
00:01:05 Eventually, things got to the point where
00:01:09 I started having money problems—losing work.
00:01:12 I lost my license at one point, lost my apartment, couldn’t pay the rent.
00:01:17 And so I knew this was not the way to true happiness,
00:01:21 and I was miserable.
00:01:23 I thought back to the time when I was the happiest,
00:01:26 and that’s when I was serving Jehovah full-time.
00:01:29 And I wanted that back.
00:01:31 So I poured my heart out to Jehovah in prayer,
00:01:34 and I let him know that I wanted to return to him.
00:01:38 I knew from personal experience that if you break a bone,
00:01:42 such as your arm, you need help; you need to see a doctor.
00:01:45 Only they are qualified to fix it —set the bone right so it can heal.
00:01:49 I knew I had to seek out the elders
00:01:52 because they’re trained, spiritual doctors.
00:01:55 They know how to use the Scriptures to help you heal.
00:01:59 So I went to them because I wanted to return to Jehovah.
00:02:04 I didn’t even have dress clothes anymore; I had lost all that.
00:02:07 I just went back in jeans and a T-shirt.
00:02:09 My parents didn’t even know I was coming, but I showed up at the meeting anyway.
00:02:15 The elders, when I met with them, were so loving and kind and patient.
00:02:19 I’ve learned firsthand that Jehovah’s discipline is for the best.
00:02:25 Yeah, it’s true; it may hurt; it may sting initially.
00:02:28 But if we allow ourselves to be molded and trained by it,
00:02:32 it’ll always work out for the best.
00:02:34 I’m so glad that I made the decision to return to Jehovah.
00:02:40 Jehovah blessed me
00:02:42 with the happiness that I longed for and a lot more:
00:02:46 privileges of service I never would have imagined.
00:02:49 And I’ve experienced through Jehovah’s discipline
00:02:51 his greatest quality—love.
00:02:54 And I’ve never been happier.

Around the world,

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:07.123 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses show unfailing love.

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:08.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the next hour,

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.460 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’ll hear reports that highlight

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real-life examples of such love.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll consider how economic hardship,

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
natural disasters, and political upheaval

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give us the opportunity

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show our unfailing love
toward our brothers.

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later in the program,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see the immense support
that’s given to special preaching campaigns

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the construction of places of worship.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these examples will prove
that Jehovah’s organization

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lives up to the words of 1 Peter 2:17:

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have love
for the whole association of brothers.”

00:00:46.596 --> 00:00:49.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,
many of the reports will highlight

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only <i>brotherly </i> love
but also <i>neighborly </i> love.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do this by going to extraordinary lengths

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:01.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach despite many challenges.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To get us started,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see some examples
of unfailing love in Africa.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Specifically, we’ll be talking

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our brothers thrive spiritually

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite challenging economic circumstances.

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:19.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now have the privilege of getting reports

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Brother Paul Rahajanirina,

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:25.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the Madagascar Branch Committee;

00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Brother Baston Nyirenda,

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:30.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the Malawi Branch Committee;

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from Brother Robert Elongo,

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the Congo (Kinshasa) Branch Committee.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.182 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, Brother Rahajanirina,

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.985 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how have our brothers in Madagascar

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:44.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
experienced brotherly love?

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Rahajanirina,

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sharing those beautiful examples

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brotherly love.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s travel to Malawi
to speak for a moment

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Brother Nyirenda.

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:08.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Nyirenda,
how has the organization

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:11.034 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
shown love to our brothers in Malawi?

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Nyirenda.

00:06:17.727 --> 00:06:21.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to see how Jehovah
not only provides spiritual food

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also makes it easier
for us to consume it.

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now focus on our brothers

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Elongo,

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do economic circumstances

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pose a challenge for our brothers there?

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.214 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Curzan,

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:40.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the economic challenges are quite noticeable

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in connection with conventions

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and assemblies.

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of our brothers
have to travel on foot,

00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:50.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with bicycles, motorcycles,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even trucks
to reach the convention sites.

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They simply do not have enough money

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:58.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to arrange for other means of travel.

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once at the convention site,

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the visiting brothers stay
in the homes of local brothers.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cases,
the branch has provided tents

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that brothers who may already have

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people staying in their house

00:07:12.215 --> 00:07:14.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also have guests stay in their yard.

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite these logistical challenges,

00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close to 800,000 brothers and sisters

00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:25.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the regional convention
in our branch territory.

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers love conventions very much,

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they always look
forward to the next one.

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:36.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But hospitality is needed also
when it’s not convention season.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes political instability

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires our brothers
to relocate to stay safe.

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when that happens,
examples such as this sister’s

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show the evidence
of the unfailing love in our brotherhood.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband has passed away,

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I take care of three children

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nine grandchildren.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a full house.

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s challenging to provide
even for our basic needs.

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:18.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A conflict broke out in the Kasai region,

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:22.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so brothers from that region
came all the way

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on foot with no shoes

00:08:24.954 --> 00:08:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and only the clothes on their backs.

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw how many there were

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in what state,

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:36.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it broke my heart.

00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:39.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I prayed to Jehovah,

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so Jehovah gave me courage
and boldness to take the brothers in.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to host
three families in my house.

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no foam mattresses
for those 18 people.

00:08:54.383 --> 00:08:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I could do was spread a piece of cloth

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the cement floor of the house
for them to sleep on.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:05.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the house has only one bedroom
and a living room,

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked the brothers
to sleep in the bedroom

00:09:08.331 --> 00:09:11.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sisters with their children
to sleep in the living room.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My love for Jehovah
and for my fellow Christians

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivated me to take the brothers in.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received many blessings

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the organization
—Bethel—

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sent food:
flour, rice, oil, and clothes.

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:34.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was selling charcoal,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
packing it in smaller bags
to get some money to feed all of us.

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Jehovah helped me in many ways

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:47.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even with my small business,
and that we all lived together

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any disputes—

00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was clear evidence of Jehovah’s support.

00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything that has happened
has touched my heart so deeply.

00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to remain faithful

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God’s organization

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up to the end.

00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have many friends
among the brothers and sisters

00:10:07.657 --> 00:10:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sought refuge in my house.

00:10:10.526 --> 00:10:12.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These friends help me and tell me,

00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep your love intact to the end.”

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I look forward to seeing the brothers
and sisters who sought refuge here

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—who came empty-handed—

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world, in Paradise.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will have a house
and eat to their heart’s desire

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any problems.

00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:47.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When convention season
and political upheaval happen to coincide,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arranging for accommodations
for everyone can be challenging.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This happened in 2017.

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:58.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers near the convention site

00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:01.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were already housing the brothers

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been displaced
because of the fighting in their home region.

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, arrangements were made

00:11:06.816 --> 00:11:09.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accommodate
those coming for the convention.

00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:12.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some brothers

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked their non-Witness neighbors

00:11:15.324 --> 00:11:17.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accommodate their guests

00:11:17.326 --> 00:11:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and they did with pleasure.

00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the visiting brothers made sure

00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:24.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the Kingdom message
with their hosts,

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many positive results.

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching experiences, Brother Elongo.

00:11:29.739 --> 00:11:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for your fine report.

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:36.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s go to Asia.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have with us
Brother Yasushi Wakabayashi,

00:11:39.882 --> 00:11:42.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves on the Taiwan Branch Committee,

00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:44.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also Brother Maurice Raj,

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:47.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 who serves on the Myanmar Branch Committee.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you may know,
Asia has recently been struck

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:53.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by several natural disasters.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to start
by asking Brother Wakabayashi,

00:11:56.565 --> 00:11:58.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What kinds of natural disasters

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:00.136 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have the brothers and sisters

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.138 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
experienced in Taiwan?

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have experienced
many typhoons and earthquakes.

00:12:07.376 --> 00:12:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, an earthquake in 1999

00:12:11.547 --> 00:12:15.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
killed some 2,400 people.

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:19.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although large earthquakes
have not been very common,

00:12:19.054 --> 00:12:23.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did have
a magnitude 6.4 earthquake

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2016.

00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:30.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An apartment building
where a sister lived completely collapsed.

00:12:30.132 --> 00:12:33.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, she was not home
when the earthquake hit.

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another earthquake struck last year.

00:12:38.107 --> 00:12:42.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was so encouraging
to see how much our brothers and sisters,

00:12:42.478 --> 00:12:46.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the midst of disaster,
value spiritual food.

00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:56.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
are currently working as translators

00:12:56.826 --> 00:13:00.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Amis Remote Translation Office
in Hualien.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amis is an indigenous language

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoken in the eastern part of Taiwan.

00:13:07.736 --> 00:13:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earthquake struck
around midnight of February 6th.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:16.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We heard very loud noises
and people screaming outside.

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:22.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furniture fell over,
and all my belongings were on the floor.

00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Ruan ran into my room

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:28.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave me a pair of shoes to wear.

00:13:28.657 --> 00:13:33.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was stepping
on broken glass as we fled outside.

00:13:33.128 --> 00:13:37.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we had were the clothes
on our backs and a bag.

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Losing everything
was hard on us emotionally.

00:13:45.374 --> 00:13:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the most important thing was,

00:13:47.443 --> 00:13:50.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to focus on what I’d lost,

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how to resume
the supply of spiritual food

00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:56.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to continue to translate
spiritual food for the Amis people.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to move the translation office

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:04.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a Kingdom Hall close by,
where it was safe.

00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:08.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters
all wanted the translation work to continue,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so everyone cooperated
to get things set up at the office.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:18.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother even asked me:
“Do you need a car?

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:20.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We can lend you one so you can commute

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your home to the office.”

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we could agree,

00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he drove the car
to where we were staying

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave us the keys.

00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
sent things without asking us.

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:41.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent many clothes,

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:44.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting bags, ties,

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shoes for my wife

00:14:46.068 --> 00:14:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—almost everything.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had something
new to wear every day.

00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:55.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gave me a sense of urgency

00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resume our work as soon as possible,

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:02.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to translate our publications,
and not to set things back.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to resume
our work at the RTO

00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:09.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just about a week after the earthquake.

00:15:11.393 --> 00:15:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation arranged
to witness to the victims at the shelter

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same weekend after the earthquake.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some asked me:

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are also a victim,
and yet you are comforting others.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?”

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I believed when I comforted others,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it brought me comfort too.

00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:35.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love and zeal the brothers displayed

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such difficult times
deeply touched our hearts.

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers and sisters
are always very quick

00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help when a natural disaster strikes.

00:15:56.672 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, during the recent typhoon,

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:03.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a tree fell on a sister’s house.

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:07.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She later wrote to us
about the events that followed.

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wrote: 
“As soon as you found out that my house

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was badly damaged by a tree
—yes, immediately—

00:16:15.758 --> 00:16:19.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“arrangements were made
not only to visit us

00:16:19.194 --> 00:16:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also to fix and rebuild.

00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It has been a great witness

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:27.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to all my unbelieving family members,

00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:30.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
relatives, and neighbors”

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:34.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a great example of unfailing love.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, while it is good not to presume

00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon the love of our brothers,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes the brothers and sisters

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be reluctant to ask for help.

00:16:46.555 --> 00:16:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, after a typhoon,

00:16:49.358 --> 00:16:53.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an elder called a sister
to ask if she was doing OK.

00:16:53.796 --> 00:16:57.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: 
“I’m fine. We can manage.”

00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:00.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But actually her roof had blown away,

00:17:00.402 --> 00:17:05.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which to me would not really
qualify as being OK.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So congregation elders
have encouraged our brothers and sisters

00:17:09.745 --> 00:17:12.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be shy but to accept the help

00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:15.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are offered by the organization

00:17:15.684 --> 00:17:19.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a reflection of Jehovah’s love.

00:17:19.054 --> 00:17:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s such a good point.

00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:24.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, we’re living at the end
of this system of things,

00:17:24.893 --> 00:17:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all that it entails,

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:30.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah asks us to trust in him.

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:33.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that report,
Brother Wakabayashi.

00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:34.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are welcome.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s speak with Brother Maurice Raj

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Myanmar Branch Committee.

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:43.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Raj, what Scriptural principles

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have guided our brothers in Myanmar

00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:48.951 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to show love during natural disasters?

00:19:45.868 --> 00:19:50.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During one of our circuit visits,
it started to rain heavily.

00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:52.875 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
According to the news on the radio,

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
many of the roads in the area had collapsed;

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were reports
of landslides in Hakha,

00:19:57.512 --> 00:19:59.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the next congregation in our circuit.

00:20:00.215 --> 00:20:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The distance from where I was
to Hakha was 65 miles.

00:20:03.685 --> 00:20:05.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the dangerous conditions,

00:20:05.687 --> 00:20:08.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I decided to walk to Hakha.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I received a phone call from the branch.

00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:13.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They requested

00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Disaster Relief Committee
to go and assist

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers in need in the disaster areas.

00:20:19.735 --> 00:20:23.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The committee prepared food
and other supplies in a nearby city.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The road was very muddy,

00:20:26.842 --> 00:20:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the trip took a long time.

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:33.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took four days to reach Hakha by foot.

00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrived in Hakha, 
we discovered

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:38.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some of the brothers
and sisters lost their homes.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I met with the congregation elders,

00:20:40.923 --> 00:20:44.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we arranged to make
shepherding visits on these families.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brought me joy to see that they
were comforted through Jehovah’s Word.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we arrived in Hakha,
we arranged to distribute

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:57.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food and other provisions
that we had brought with us.

00:20:57.773 --> 00:21:01.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, we started a journey together
to help other congregations.

00:21:01.977 --> 00:21:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very difficult time
for the brothers.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother said: 
“Because we were running low on food,

00:21:09.785 --> 00:21:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our family was planning
to eat just one meal per day.

00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:16.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now with the relief committee’s help,

00:21:16.491 --> 00:21:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can eat all three meals.”

00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:21.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were so happy

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were really thankful
to Jehovah and his organization

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:27.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their loving support.

00:21:29.104 --> 00:21:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trip was quite rough,

00:21:31.139 --> 00:21:34.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we felt that Jehovah
supported us in wonderful ways.

00:21:34.977 --> 00:21:38.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some places, the roads were very bad.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we had to cling
to the edge of a cliff.

00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to climb up very steep mountains

00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:48.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then climb down steep mountains.

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even had to cross streams
with strong currents.

00:21:52.294 --> 00:21:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I couldn’t give up,

00:21:54.463 --> 00:21:56.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I kept saying to myself:

00:21:56.498 --> 00:21:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is for God’s Kingdom.
This is for God’s Kingdom.

00:21:59.334 --> 00:22:01.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep walking.’

00:22:01.336 --> 00:22:04.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helped me
to continue on my journey.

00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:07.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide the congregations
with the supplies,

00:22:07.542 --> 00:22:10.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we walked 120 miles over four days.

00:22:12.047 --> 00:22:14.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God used us to show to his people

00:22:14.716 --> 00:22:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he never abandons them

00:22:17.052 --> 00:22:20.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he really cares about them.

00:22:20.989 --> 00:22:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing this brings such joy to our hearts.

00:22:25.227 --> 00:22:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a wonderful privilege

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:31.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to be involved
in this relief work with Jehovah

in behalf of our brothers and sisters.

00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you for sharing
that excellent example

00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:18.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of showing unfailing love for our brothers.

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Raj.

00:23:22.017 --> 00:23:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we visit Europe.

00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:27.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Jasin Ali
serves on the Albania Branch Committee,

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Lars Kassholm,
on the Scandinavia Branch Committee.

00:23:31.126 --> 00:23:33.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s speak with Brother Ali.

00:23:33.995 --> 00:23:35.465 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Albania branch

00:23:35.465 --> 00:23:37.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
oversees the work in Kosovo,

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:38.400 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where a preaching campaign

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.961 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was recently arranged.

00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:41.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ali,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:45.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why was there a need
for a preaching campaign in Kosovo?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publisher-to-population ratio

00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:50.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Kosovo is the largest in all Europe,

00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 1 publisher
to more than 8,700 inhabitants.

00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that quite a number of cities

00:23:57.385 --> 00:23:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and villages are seldom preached in,

00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:03.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many others
have never received a witness.

00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:06.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this preaching campaign started,

00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:09.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
almost one million of Kosovo’s population

00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:11.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had never heard the truth.

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:15.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While many people
in this territory have a religious outlook

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have heard of the Bible
and about Jesus Christ,

00:24:18.974 --> 00:24:23.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many often connect religion
with some of the atrocities

00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:26.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were committed
in recent political conflicts in the region.

00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numerous families
have been personally affected

00:24:29.818 --> 00:24:32.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the war of the 1990’s in Kosovo,

00:24:32.654 --> 00:24:36.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in many cases,
they have lost loved ones in death.

00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:39.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it truly was an expression of love

00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the brothers and sisters
who answered the call for help

00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:44.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this campaign.

00:24:49.037 --> 00:24:51.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we heard about the campaign,

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:54.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thought about how wonderful it would be

00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:58.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if at least 200 volunteers would come.

00:24:58.046 --> 00:25:02.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrilled but also really nervous

00:25:02.284 --> 00:25:07.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we found out
that over 600 volunteers were going to come.

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we heard about the campaign

00:25:09.824 --> 00:25:11.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being organized in Kosovo,

00:25:11.826 --> 00:25:14.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were very excited
and really wanted to take part in it.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our limited income meant

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:20.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would have to calculate
the cost carefully.

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:23.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, because I lost my sight,

00:25:23.638 --> 00:25:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the adjustment
to a new environment preaching in villages

00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obviously would not be easy for me.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was offered a scholarship

00:25:33.815 --> 00:25:35.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a university in Tirana.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my mind was made up,

00:25:37.485 --> 00:25:40.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my goal was to take part in this campaign

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give my best to Jehovah.

00:25:42.257 --> 00:25:44.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I serve at Bethel,

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used my vacation days

00:25:46.061 --> 00:25:47.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come here for the campaign.

00:26:07.582 --> 00:26:09.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This campaign has been

00:26:09.084 --> 00:26:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an answer to my prayers.

00:26:10.518 --> 00:26:12.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like Jehovah was saying:

00:26:12.354 --> 00:26:13.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Keep trying.

00:26:13.355 --> 00:26:15.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You have brothers and sisters

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are supporting you.’

00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:21.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have worked with brothers and sisters

00:26:21.763 --> 00:26:23.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all over the world on this campaign.

00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:26.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sacrifices that they
have made to come here

00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been a real source

00:26:28.103 --> 00:26:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of encouragement to me.

00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:31.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood how much appreciation

00:26:31.973 --> 00:26:33.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the volunteers were showing

00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:35.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the opportunity from Jehovah

00:26:35.043 --> 00:26:36.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support the campaign.

00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was deeply touched.

00:26:39.281 --> 00:26:42.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I could use all the words
in the world to describe the joy

00:26:42.317 --> 00:26:45.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this campaign gave me,
they wouldn’t be enough.

00:26:45.153 --> 00:26:47.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I have seen with my own eyes

00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:48.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my worldwide family,

00:26:48.823 --> 00:26:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel in my heart the love and care

00:26:51.559 --> 00:26:54.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that they have for us.

00:27:03.905 --> 00:27:07.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you heard,
the campaign had a profound effect

00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:09.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the local publishers.

00:27:09.277 --> 00:27:11.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it also had an impact in the field.

00:27:11.946 --> 00:27:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one day a group
of publishers from different countries

00:27:15.984 --> 00:27:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were having lunch in a local restaurant.

00:27:19.154 --> 00:27:21.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They noticed that a group of policemen

00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:23.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were having lunch in the same restaurant

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:25.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were often looking over at them.

00:27:25.694 --> 00:27:28.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So two brothers decided to approach them

00:27:28.463 --> 00:27:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start a conversation with them.

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:34.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the officers said
that he had seen the publishers in the city

00:27:34.602 --> 00:27:36.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knew all of them very well.

00:27:36.771 --> 00:27:38.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he added:

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are doing a very fine work.

00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If everyone did the same work as you,

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there would be
no more need for a police force!”

00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:48.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This campaign resulted

00:27:48.983 --> 00:27:52.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only in the formation
of new groups and pregroups in some areas

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:55.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also motivated the local publishers.

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:59.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing to see
how initiatives like this campaign

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:03.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be an expression
of both brotherly and neighborly love.

00:28:03.998 --> 00:28:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Ali.

00:28:06.067 --> 00:28:09.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we turn to Brother Lars Kassholm
in Scandinavia.

00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:12.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scandinavia branch office oversees,

00:28:12.574 --> 00:28:15.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among other places, the work in Sweden.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have recent world events

00:28:17.545 --> 00:28:20.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
shaped the preaching efforts in Sweden?

00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:24.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In Sweden, meeting refugees in the ministry

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been common for many years,

00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:30.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have had
foreign-language congregations for decades.

00:28:30.892 --> 00:28:34.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in 2015,

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:38.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 160,000 refugees arrived in Sweden.

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:43.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So over a period of two years,
the Service Department approved

00:28:43.671 --> 00:28:47.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forming 45 new foreign-language groups

00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:49.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pregroups in Sweden,

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so today we have over 90,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plus a number
of foreign-language congregations.

00:28:57.185 --> 00:28:59.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in small congregations,

00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:01.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers have worked very hard

00:29:01.956 --> 00:29:05.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite refugees to the meetings.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has often resulted
in Kingdom Halls packed to capacity.

00:29:15.303 --> 00:29:18.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands of refugees
come to Sweden every year.

00:29:25.547 --> 00:29:28.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these are sent
into different refugee camps

00:29:28.483 --> 00:29:30.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around Jönköping.

00:29:32.387 --> 00:29:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came from Burundi

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:36.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a refugee because of the war.

00:29:36.858 --> 00:29:39.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to Sweden when I was 17.

00:29:39.427 --> 00:29:41.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came alone.

00:29:41.663 --> 00:29:45.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come as a refugee,
you are a stranger.

00:29:45.567 --> 00:29:49.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You miss your family, you miss your friends,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you miss everything.

00:29:52.273 --> 00:29:55.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need hope, they need the truth,

00:29:55.944 --> 00:30:00.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah has given us
the privilege to give this to them.

00:30:08.122 --> 00:30:10.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these camps were in isolated areas.

00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:18.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes when you visited them,
there could be

00:30:18.833 --> 00:30:23.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three or four different nationalities
in the same room.

00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the friends
also learned a few different greetings.

00:30:33.481 --> 00:30:37.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before setting off,
we downloaded videos in up to 30 languages.

00:30:45.827 --> 00:30:49.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we connected
interested ones with brothers

00:30:49.664 --> 00:30:52.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who spoke their language through video calls.

00:30:58.573 --> 00:31:01.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we did not receive
permission to preach at the camp,

00:31:01.876 --> 00:31:05.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to find other methods.

00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried to invite people

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:10.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a meeting in Swahili,

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:12.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more than 50 people came.

00:31:13.821 --> 00:31:16.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to borrow several child seats

00:31:16.324 --> 00:31:19.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask many of the friends to help.

00:31:20.528 --> 00:31:24.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that Jehovah has helped me
to become more open-minded

00:31:24.532 --> 00:31:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—much more patient and empathetic.

00:31:27.936 --> 00:31:29.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were long days,

00:31:29.938 --> 00:31:32.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes you were tired in the evening.

00:31:32.106 --> 00:31:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you looked out
and saw your brothers and sisters

00:31:34.576 --> 00:31:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the same sacrifice,

00:31:36.844 --> 00:31:39.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that motivated you to continue.

00:31:41.583 --> 00:31:45.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you saw the way
they accepted the truth,

00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:48.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how it formed and transformed them,

00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was worth all the effort.

00:32:00.068 --> 00:32:05.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although many of us from Sweden
are known as somewhat reserved,

00:32:05.073 --> 00:32:09.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we meet a person
who has lost everything

00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:13.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything, even his family and friends—

00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really touches our hearts.

00:32:17.218 --> 00:32:20.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, our territory reminds us

00:32:20.655 --> 00:32:24.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ words at John 4:35:

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:27.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lift up your eyes and view the fields,

00:32:27.462 --> 00:32:29.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are white for harvesting.”

00:32:31.399 --> 00:32:36.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Sweden is one
of the most secular lands in the world,

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the influx of refugees,

00:32:38.773 --> 00:32:42.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we now have territories
filled with God-fearing people.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These people are very often
very disappointed in their religion,

00:32:47.015 --> 00:32:49.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we are now happy to help them

00:32:49.617 --> 00:32:53.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by offering them a solid hope for the future

00:32:53.087 --> 00:32:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving them a meaning in life.

00:32:55.657 --> 00:32:59.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
it takes an effort to study the Bible

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone in another language.

00:33:01.562 --> 00:33:05.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to be used by Jehovah
in this special way

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings us even closer to him.

00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:11.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we are very grateful to Jehovah

00:33:11.806 --> 00:33:14.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this opportunity we have now

00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:17.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help refugees in Sweden.

00:33:17.345 --> 00:33:20.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate the brothers
and sisters in Sweden

00:33:20.214 --> 00:33:23.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for setting a good example
of neighborly love.

00:33:23.651 --> 00:33:26.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that report, Brother Kassholm.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve now come to North America,

00:33:28.723 --> 00:33:31.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll be talking
with Brother Anthony Griffin,

00:33:31.392 --> 00:33:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the United States Branch Committee.

00:33:34.662 --> 00:33:38.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll continue focusing
on neighborly love.

00:33:38.132 --> 00:33:40.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Griffin,
you mentioned to me earlier

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve seen a pattern,

00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:43.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a pattern of what it takes

00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:46.007 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to show personal interest.

00:33:46.007 --> 00:33:48.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us a bit more about that?

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:49.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:33:49.343 --> 00:33:51.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you talk to brothers and sisters

00:33:51.913 --> 00:33:54.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have progressive Bible studies

00:33:54.515 --> 00:33:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who have successfully aided
new ones to serve Jehovah,

00:33:58.186 --> 00:34:02.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you’ll notice
is that patterns begin to emerge.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the patterns is that they prepare

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:07.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they go out in service.

00:34:07.295 --> 00:34:08.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does that help?

00:34:08.996 --> 00:34:11.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re prepared, you’re more relaxed,

00:34:11.365 --> 00:34:15.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus you’re more friendly
when you present the good news at the door.

00:34:15.937 --> 00:34:20.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another pattern
is that effective Bible teachers—

00:34:20.942 --> 00:34:25.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They think, they pray, and they act

00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:30.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the personal needs
and concerns of Bible students,

00:34:30.284 --> 00:34:32.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether those needs are physical

00:34:32.954 --> 00:34:36.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or emotional or spiritual.

00:34:36.257 --> 00:34:38.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s kind of what—

00:34:38.259 --> 00:34:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds you of what Paul
said at 1 Corinthians 9:22.

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:45.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he became

00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:47.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all things

00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:51.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to people of all sorts,

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:56.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that [he] might
by all possible means save some.”

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this means that inside

00:34:59.213 --> 00:35:03.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every successful Bible teacher

00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a heart that is filled
with love for people.

00:35:07.755 --> 00:35:10.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s this love,
this outstretching love,

00:35:10.992 --> 00:35:14.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has motivated some
to learn a new language.

00:35:14.328 --> 00:35:17.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have moved
to a foreign-language congregation

00:35:17.532 --> 00:35:21.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to help and assist 
more to learn about Jehovah.

00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:24.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example of this,
I’d like to introduce you

00:35:24.772 --> 00:35:27.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Sister Sally Giltinan.

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:31.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Giltinan did not allow anything

00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop her from showing neighborly love.

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just prior to my baptism,

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unfortunately, I became critically ill.

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:45.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was eventually told
that I had two hours to live.

00:35:45.927 --> 00:35:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The doctors insisted that I have

00:35:48.029 --> 00:35:50.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a blood transfusion,
and I took my stand.

00:35:50.264 --> 00:35:53.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no question
that I was willing to die for Jehovah.

00:35:53.935 --> 00:35:57.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question to me was,
Was I willing to live for him?

00:35:57.505 --> 00:35:59.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I became all the more determined

00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:02.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use my life to serve Jehovah.

00:36:02.476 --> 00:36:04.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obviously, I lived.

00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It motivated me
to really be focused on the ministry.

00:36:10.518 --> 00:36:13.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began regular pioneering when I was 17.

00:36:13.354 --> 00:36:15.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a privilege

00:36:15.356 --> 00:36:18.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study with people
who were Baptist and Catholic

00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:20.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Methodist and Episcopalian

00:36:20.228 --> 00:36:23.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some were Atheists,
some were rich, some were poor.

00:36:23.965 --> 00:36:27.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were five parents
that came with their children,

00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:30.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were 13 children.

00:36:30.004 --> 00:36:32.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in such a supportive congregation,

00:36:32.373 --> 00:36:35.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were so many young pioneers 
who had the energy

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those couples were so important to me.

00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:41.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my husband and I got married,

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were in a rural congregation in Virginia.

00:36:45.853 --> 00:36:49.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, we wound up
in the Spanish territory.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With so many migrant workers,

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:56.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wanted to be able to talk to them.

00:36:56.264 --> 00:36:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a challenge
because I didn’t speak Spanish!

00:36:58.866 --> 00:37:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never let that stop me,

00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:04.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I learned enough
to get my foot in the door.

00:37:05.273 --> 00:37:08.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While I didn’t speak Spanish,
I spoke the language of love

00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:12.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s love—
and that’s what they were relating to.

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:16.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I would work so hard
to prepare for Bible studies.

00:37:16.017 --> 00:37:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the goal
was not just to teach doctrinal truth

00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to teach them to know Jehovah.

00:37:23.524 --> 00:37:27.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would take some Bible students
to visit other Bible students

00:37:27.261 --> 00:37:29.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they could encourage one another.

00:37:29.764 --> 00:37:33.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the brothers determined
that they could hold a meeting.

00:37:33.634 --> 00:37:37.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought 20 or 25 would come.

00:37:37.271 --> 00:37:40.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eighty-two people came
to the first Spanish meeting.

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:43.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was such a joyful day

00:37:43.577 --> 00:37:46.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to watch them associate with each other.

00:37:47.548 --> 00:37:50.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a family,
and it continues to be to this day.

00:37:51.252 --> 00:37:54.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 35 years, David and I
have driven separately to the meetings.

00:37:54.956 --> 00:37:57.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We generally take
two different cars to pick people up.

00:37:57.558 --> 00:38:00.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I usually have a car
full of people that I’m bringing.

00:38:00.995 --> 00:38:03.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will often have people he’s picking up.

00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m going to teach people

00:38:05.933 --> 00:38:08.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know Jehovah and to love him,

00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it begins with me.

00:38:11.138 --> 00:38:13.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if my heart is filled with love

00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:15.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah and for people,

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopefully it will show.

00:38:17.979 --> 00:38:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously,
you try really hard to teach the truth.

00:38:21.248 --> 00:38:24.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that, if anything,

00:38:24.118 --> 00:38:27.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been the language of love.

00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted so much
for them to feel that love

00:38:29.657 --> 00:38:32.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah showed me in the beginning.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So showing personal interest
by applying Bible principles

00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it really does work!

00:38:45.906 --> 00:38:50.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this can be demonstrated
in many different ways.

00:38:50.011 --> 00:38:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
in Los Angeles, California,

00:38:52.813 --> 00:38:55.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a brother
who was in a coffee shop,

00:38:55.716 --> 00:38:58.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he noticed a man
who was reading a newspaper.

00:38:58.819 --> 00:39:02.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he approached the man,
and he simply asked him,

00:39:02.523 --> 00:39:05.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is there any good news in there today?”

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:08.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that led to a conversation,

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:11.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the man brought up
something that concerned him.

00:39:11.665 --> 00:39:14.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was concerned about his young daughter.

00:39:14.402 --> 00:39:16.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brother asked him,

00:39:16.404 --> 00:39:18.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can I show you something on the website

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:21.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might assist you
in helping your daughter?”

00:39:21.075 --> 00:39:24.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he showed him
one of the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:26.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then after further discussion,

00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the man wanted to know
where the Kingdom Hall was.

00:39:29.884 --> 00:39:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brother took him
right back to the website

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed him the address
of the local Kingdom Hall.

00:39:36.357 --> 00:39:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result of all of this?

00:39:39.226 --> 00:39:43.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That man who was reading
the newspaper at the coffee shop

00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:44.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now one of our brothers.

00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:46.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his daughter?

00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making wonderful progress in the truth.

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you, Brother Griffin,

00:39:51.238 --> 00:39:53.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sharing those beautiful experiences

00:39:53.374 --> 00:39:56.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about showing personal interest.

00:39:57.244 --> 00:39:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now talk for a moment
about how our brothers

00:39:59.914 --> 00:40:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithfully care for our places of worship,

00:40:02.583 --> 00:40:06.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which essentially is
an aspect of showing love for Jehovah

00:40:06.487 --> 00:40:08.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our fellow brothers and sisters.

00:40:09.523 --> 00:40:11.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This takes us to Oceania,

00:40:11.525 --> 00:40:14.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we have Brother Kegawale Biyama,

00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:17.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s joining us
from the Papua New Guinea Branch Committee,

00:40:17.198 --> 00:40:19.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Abraham Lincoln,

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the Micronesia Branch Committee.

00:40:22.236 --> 00:40:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We turn first to Brother Biyama.

00:40:25.306 --> 00:40:27.541 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What need for places of worship

00:40:27.541 --> 00:40:30.144 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
currently exists in Papua New Guinea?

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:32.713 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Currently, we need to construct

00:40:32.713 --> 00:40:35.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
22 new Kingdom Halls

00:40:35.149 --> 00:40:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and renovate 26 existing halls.

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:43.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the increasing interest
shown in the field,

00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:48.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of our big congregations
in our main towns have had to split.

00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:53.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attendances at those
congregations’ weekend meetings

00:40:53.434 --> 00:40:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are generally double the seating capacity

00:40:56.971 --> 00:40:59.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their existing Kingdom Halls.

00:40:59.173 --> 00:41:01.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when a new Kingdom Hall is built,

00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters do all they can

00:41:04.812 --> 00:41:07.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support the LDC brothers who have come

00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from afar to assist with that building.

00:41:21.962 --> 00:41:25.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish
the construction work here in PNG,

00:41:25.232 --> 00:41:28.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many challenges.

00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:30.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes there is no road,

00:41:30.437 --> 00:41:32.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the brothers and sisters

00:41:32.106 --> 00:41:33.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have to carry all the materials

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:36.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the site to build a Kingdom Hall.

00:41:38.345 --> 00:41:43.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s hard to travel
to other areas for work

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we leave behind
our family and our friends.

00:41:48.889 --> 00:41:53.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we work on a Kingdom Hall,
everyone in the congregation helps us.

00:41:53.727 --> 00:41:55.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cook for us

00:41:55.729 --> 00:41:58.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support the work on the site.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation, they gave
everything they had to support the work.

00:42:05.005 --> 00:42:08.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wake up early in the morning

00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:11.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walk down the mountains,

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:14.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing food with them.

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:18.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes them three or four hours.

00:42:18.085 --> 00:42:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They come onto the construction site,

00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:24.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cook food.

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:31.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the construction team eats,

00:42:31.232 --> 00:42:34.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they clean up

00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:36.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they walk back.

00:42:36.136 --> 00:42:39.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes them three to four hours again,

00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so around 9:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m.,
they arrive home.

00:42:44.411 --> 00:42:47.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s hard for them

00:42:47.081 --> 00:42:51.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have
their own family to support.

00:42:51.185 --> 00:42:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a huge sacrifice that they’ve given
to come and support this work.

00:42:57.358 --> 00:43:00.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
we get encouragement at the meetings

00:43:00.561 --> 00:43:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we are out witnessing.

00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some give encouragement
to help us do this work.

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:12.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we go out
on the weekends to swim and play.

00:43:12.973 --> 00:43:16.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that way,
we meet a lot of brothers and sisters,

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they become as family to us.

00:43:20.247 --> 00:43:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When brothers and sisters
give everything to support us in the work,

00:43:24.785 --> 00:43:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this encourages me
to give my best to do this work.

00:43:30.691 --> 00:43:33.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Construction is hard work,

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:36.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are many challenges.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:39.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you will receive
many wonderful blessings.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will learn to trust in Jehovah,

00:43:42.403 --> 00:43:46.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also you will be happy doing this work.

00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fascinating to see how
the outpouring of love for Jehovah

00:44:00.354 --> 00:44:03.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be manifested in not only practical ways,

00:44:03.357 --> 00:44:05.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as by cooking food for our brothers,

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:08.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how
it can motivate the brothers

00:44:08.629 --> 00:44:11.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to the construction project.

00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:14.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and the love we see is not limited

00:44:14.935 --> 00:44:17.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the construction of the building

00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:21.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but extends to the upkeep
of the hall as well.

00:44:21.275 --> 00:44:25.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many passersby have stood
in front of the Kingdom Hall property

00:44:25.612 --> 00:44:30.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take pictures
because of its well-kept look.

00:44:30.284 --> 00:44:34.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really shows how our love
can be a great shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:37.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Biyama,
for that good report.

00:44:37.658 --> 00:44:41.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while some places
have a huge need for Kingdom Halls,

00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:43.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others require similar effort

00:44:43.564 --> 00:44:46.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the remoteness of the location.

00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:49.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lincoln, the island of Tonoas

00:44:49.169 --> 00:44:51.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of your branch territory.

00:44:51.171 --> 00:44:53.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the brothers there

00:44:53.173 --> 00:44:54.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show how much they treasure

00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:56.710 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
their places of worship?

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.379 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The brothers take seriously 

00:44:58.379 --> 00:44:59.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
their responsibility

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.582 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to maintain the Kingdom Hall,

00:45:01.582 --> 00:45:04.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as was visible
in a recent renovation project.

00:45:04.918 --> 00:45:08.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the assistance
of local and international servants,

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:11.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this small congregation of 31 publishers

00:45:11.525 --> 00:45:15.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was able to complete
the project in only 11 weeks.

00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our island of Tonoas is very beautiful.

00:45:22.603 --> 00:45:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many people have no jobs.

00:45:30.244 --> 00:45:33.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Previously, the Kingdom Hall was very small.

00:45:33.947 --> 00:45:38.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we endeavored
to clean inside and out,

00:45:38.018 --> 00:45:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were many things
that were in bad condition

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:45.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was no money
—not enough.

00:45:45.492 --> 00:45:50.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was no longer suitable
for a sizable group to worship Jehovah there.

00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very happy when we heard

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s organization would help us

00:45:56.136 --> 00:45:57.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Kingdom Hall in Tonoas.

00:45:59.373 --> 00:46:04.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are grateful for the way
Jehovah’s love was clearly manifested

00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:08.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the love of our brothers
from distant lands.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were difficulties
that we experienced when the materials

00:46:13.587 --> 00:46:15.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arrived in Chuuk from Guam.

00:46:17.257 --> 00:46:19.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We received the materials,

00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:22.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using a flatbed truck to take them
to a barge to be transported

00:46:22.763 --> 00:46:25.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the capital island of Weno to Tonoas.

00:46:25.599 --> 00:46:27.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon reaching Tonoas,

00:46:27.801 --> 00:46:32.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was very difficult to unload
because there is no dock.

00:46:32.473 --> 00:46:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We used a motorboat to carry the materials

00:46:35.509 --> 00:46:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the barge to the drop-off point

00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:41.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it could reach the job site.

00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:46.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our island, people do not view
construction as being women’s work.

00:46:47.287 --> 00:46:51.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with the help of the brothers
who came from distant lands,

00:46:51.425 --> 00:46:56.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they really helped the sisters
to understand how to use the tools.

00:46:57.464 --> 00:47:00.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many villagers would kind of mock them:

00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:04.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look at those Jehovah’s Witnesses
going to work.

00:47:04.905 --> 00:47:08.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not supposed to be women’s work!”

00:47:09.543 --> 00:47:12.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our sisters ignored it

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their deep love for Jehovah;

00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:16.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they walked, singing our songs

00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:19.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they would not hear
others mocking them.

00:47:21.555 --> 00:47:26.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we are very thankful
to our God, Jehovah,

00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:29.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to our brothers around the world

00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:32.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their love and hard work on behalf

00:47:32.366 --> 00:47:34.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our new Kingdom Hall.

00:47:40.407 --> 00:47:43.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really is a beautiful building for Jehovah

00:47:43.877 --> 00:47:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for people in Tonoas to see

00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:49.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what love Jehovah’s people have among them.

00:47:50.183 --> 00:47:55.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Hebrews 6:10 plainly tells us
about Jehovah’s promise,

00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:58.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘he will not forget the love and hard work’

00:47:58.258 --> 00:48:02.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his people performed on our behalf.

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:07.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we can see how deep
the Pacific Ocean is that separates us,

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:10.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of Jehovah’s love for us,

00:48:10.203 --> 00:48:15.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it feels as if we are
very close together as a family.

00:48:22.115 --> 00:48:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took the action
and efforts of many involved

00:48:25.452 --> 00:48:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete this renovation project.

00:48:27.554 --> 00:48:30.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this action,
the brothers and sisters

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed how much
they value their Kingdom Halls

00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as places where we can go

00:48:34.861 --> 00:48:38.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “give thanks to [Jehovah]
in the great congregation,”

00:48:38.365 --> 00:48:41.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Psalm 35:18.

00:48:41.568 --> 00:48:44.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of love goes
into building each Kingdom Hall,

00:48:44.371 --> 00:48:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you highlighted that well.

00:48:46.373 --> 00:48:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lincoln, thank you very much.

00:48:48.408 --> 00:48:49.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have one more continent to visit,
and that’s South America.

00:48:53.614 --> 00:48:56.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we have Brother Douglas Little,

00:48:56.116 --> 00:48:58.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves
on the Bolivia Branch Committee,

00:48:58.685 --> 00:49:01.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also have Brother Geraldo Meilsmith,

00:49:01.822 --> 00:49:04.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s on the Brazil Branch Committee.

00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends in South America

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set a great example of reaching out

00:49:08.528 --> 00:49:10.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the many indigenous peoples,

00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:14.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’ll be focusing on that
for the next few minutes.

00:49:14.468 --> 00:49:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Little,
what does the branch in Bolivia do

00:49:18.005 --> 00:49:19.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to reach remote populations

00:49:19.906 --> 00:49:21.508 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the good news?

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:23.176 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Curzan,

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:27.180 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Bolivia has dozens of indigenous languages

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread throughout the country.

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these languages
have over a million speakers,

00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:37.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others,
only a few hundred speakers.

00:49:37.724 --> 00:49:41.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Acts 1:8 speaks about witnessing

00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:44.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the most distant part of the earth,”

00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:47.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel that we need to do our part.

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:52.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way that we
reach out to these populations

00:49:52.005 --> 00:49:54.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is through campaigns.

00:49:54.207 --> 00:49:56.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we have established

00:49:56.209 --> 00:50:00.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an area or language
has potential for growth,

00:50:00.547 --> 00:50:05.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look at how we can give
that field more permanent support.

00:50:05.485 --> 00:50:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
we encourage pioneers

00:50:09.656 --> 00:50:13.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take up the challenge
of learning an indigenous language.

00:50:13.326 --> 00:50:16.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when pioneers from other countries

00:50:16.296 --> 00:50:20.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
write expressing
their interest in serving in Bolivia,

00:50:20.367 --> 00:50:25.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we include a recommendation
of an indigenous language group

00:50:25.238 --> 00:50:27.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could consider serving in.

00:50:27.808 --> 00:50:31.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to give you an idea of what it’s like,

00:50:31.378 --> 00:50:36.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would like you to meet
these two sisters who came here to serve.

00:50:36.783 --> 00:50:41.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents were in the international
construction work before we were born.

00:50:41.254 --> 00:50:44.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we didn’t know it as we were growing up,

00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:46.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were planning on someday

00:50:46.593 --> 00:50:50.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moving to another country to pioneer.

00:50:51.598 --> 00:50:52.899 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My name is Jessica.

00:50:52.899 --> 00:50:54.134 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My name is Mariah.

00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:55.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re from the United States.

00:50:55.669 --> 00:50:57.771 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we’re serving in Beni, Bolivia.

00:51:03.376 --> 00:51:07.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had our doubts at first
about moving to another country.

00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:12.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re pioneering in this area,

00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re in the sun a lot.

00:51:14.154 --> 00:51:18.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re either walking or riding a motorcycle

00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:20.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or sometimes a bicycle out in service.

00:51:28.135 --> 00:51:30.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you are adapting to a new culture

00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a new culture and new ways of eating

00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:37.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are different than what we’re used to.

00:51:38.812 --> 00:51:43.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once we got here
and we started going out in service,

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:47.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we met the brothers and sisters
and we fell in love with Bolivia.

00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:57.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once, we were preaching by boat,

00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:00.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we arrived at one indigenous community.

00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:02.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a man on a motorcycle came,

00:52:02.869 --> 00:52:06.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he started picking everybody up
and collecting them.

00:52:06.239 --> 00:52:07.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we were worried at first.

00:52:07.574 --> 00:52:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought that he didn’t want
them to listen to us,

00:52:10.177 --> 00:52:12.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so he was taking them all away.

00:52:12.345 --> 00:52:15.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it turned out in the end
that he was the son

00:52:15.148 --> 00:52:17.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the chieftain there in that community,

00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:19.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was gathering everyone together

00:52:19.786 --> 00:52:21.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could all listen to us.

00:52:21.788 --> 00:52:26.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something that you
would never really get to do back home.

00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:40.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moving here has helped us

00:52:40.373 --> 00:52:43.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see Jehovah’s hand

00:52:43.844 --> 00:52:46.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more directly in our life.

00:52:46.947 --> 00:52:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve gotten to be part of activities

00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:52.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe we’ve heard about in a <i>Yearbook </i>

00:52:52.552 --> 00:52:54.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe we hear about on the broadcast,

00:52:54.554 --> 00:52:59.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but getting to live those activities
makes us feel very happy

00:52:59.159 --> 00:53:01.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and closer to the organization as well.

00:53:01.228 --> 00:53:03.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get to see

00:53:03.296 --> 00:53:07.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah is moving
the organization in the last days

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach as many people as possible.

00:53:09.302 --> 00:53:11.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really drew us a lot closer to Him

00:53:11.905 --> 00:53:15.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we were forced to trust
more in him than in ourselves.

00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:21.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put the car in motion,

00:53:21.014 --> 00:53:23.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will bless you.

00:53:29.222 --> 00:53:31.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has richly blessed

00:53:31.892 --> 00:53:34.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these efforts of our brothers and sisters

00:53:34.594 --> 00:53:37.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach out to the indigenous populations.

00:53:37.597 --> 00:53:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To give you another example,

00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:41.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2016,

00:53:41.868 --> 00:53:45.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a caravan of 11 four-wheel-drive vehicles

00:53:45.438 --> 00:53:48.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 62 brothers and sisters

00:53:48.341 --> 00:53:51.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to the remote Izozog region,

00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:55.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the people speak Bolivian Guarani.

00:53:55.715 --> 00:54:00.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were able to bring with them
the recently translated <i>Teach Us </i> book.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:04.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the brothers and sisters
went door to door in each small village,

00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:07.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the villagers would walk by

00:54:07.093 --> 00:54:11.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell them not to forget
to visit their houses too.

00:54:11.398 --> 00:54:14.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some were so excited to receive the brothers

00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:19.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they didn’t want to risk
not being home when they came by,

00:54:19.239 --> 00:54:22.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they brought their chair
to their neighbor’s house

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:25.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the brothers and sisters 
were already visiting

00:54:25.378 --> 00:54:29.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sat down 
to participate in the discussion.

00:54:29.382 --> 00:54:32.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Little,
for sharing that with us,

00:54:32.152 --> 00:54:34.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wish Jehovah’s continued blessing

00:54:34.988 --> 00:54:37.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the preaching work in Bolivia.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:41.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll now travel to Brazil
to speak with Brother Meilsmith.

00:54:41.561 --> 00:54:44.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As in Bolivia, the branch in Brazil

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made concerted efforts
to cover remote territories.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.469 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us a bit about that,

00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:50.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Meilsmith?

00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:45.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we graduated
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:55:45.291 --> 00:55:49.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our surprise,
we were assigned to the Sateré-Mawé field.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an indigenous language
spoken in the Amazon rain forest.

00:55:57.837 --> 00:55:59.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a challenge for us
because the assignment

00:55:59.973 --> 00:56:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles)
away from our home and our friends.

00:56:06.946 --> 00:56:09.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My name is Alex, and this is my wife, Rosane.

00:56:09.082 --> 00:56:10.650 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been serving in this language

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:12.819 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for about a year and a half.

00:56:18.491 --> 00:56:21.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to put into practice right away
everything we had learned.

00:56:21.828 --> 00:56:25.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how could we do that
if we didn’t know the language?

00:56:25.665 --> 00:56:29.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we heard was blah, blah, blah;
I couldn’t understand anything!

00:56:29.302 --> 00:56:33.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know a sister who’s a native speaker,
so we asked her for a lot of help.

00:56:33.907 --> 00:56:37.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to be able to know enough
to at least be able to preach

00:56:37.077 --> 00:56:39.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understand a little bit of the language.

00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:50.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We noticed that the Sateré people

00:56:50.757 --> 00:56:53.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would come into the city
and then go home on a crowded boat.

00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:57.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we and some other sisters
decided to go with them.

00:56:57.063 --> 00:56:59.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were a little nervous,

00:56:59.332 --> 00:57:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we didn’t know
where we were going to spend the night

00:57:02.202 --> 00:57:05.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even if the people
would allow us to stay in the village.

00:57:07.373 --> 00:57:09.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were very loving
and received us well.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:12.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even offered
for us to stay in their houses.

00:57:18.017 --> 00:57:20.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we didn’t know the language very well,

00:57:20.253 --> 00:57:23.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we decided to learn just one presentation

00:57:23.623 --> 00:57:26.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to teach them Jehovah’s name.

00:57:26.259 --> 00:57:27.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We showed God’s name at every door.

00:57:27.894 --> 00:57:29.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them were really surprised.

00:57:29.462 --> 00:57:30.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had a Bible;

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had God’s name
right there in their Bible,

00:57:32.765 --> 00:57:34.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they didn’t know that Jehovah is God.

00:57:34.734 --> 00:57:38.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exciting for us to see them
learning Jehovah’s name for the first time.

Who would want to learn a language

00:57:49.282 --> 00:57:51.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoken in the rain forest
by only 10,000 people?

00:57:52.085 --> 00:57:54.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that Jehovah
loves all sorts of people.

00:57:54.754 --> 00:57:56.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants even people who live

00:57:56.756 --> 00:57:59.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in isolated places,
like the rain forest, to know him.

00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:10.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve fallen in love with the people,
the assignment, and the language.

00:58:10.436 --> 00:58:12.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful language.

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:17.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even with all the sacrifices
we’ve made materially,

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve never lacked anything.

00:58:19.345 --> 00:58:22.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that going
through the experience of living here

00:58:22.015 --> 00:58:24.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has strengthened our confidence in Jehovah.

00:58:24.384 --> 00:58:26.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s helped us to not rely
on our own strength.

00:58:26.986 --> 00:58:30.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve really seen
how well Jehovah takes care of us.

00:59:55.808 --> 00:59:57.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s such a good point.

00:59:57.977 --> 01:00:02.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love we show
is ultimately an extension of Jehovah’s love

01:00:02.415 --> 01:00:04.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those with a spiritual need.

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:07.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for your report, Brother Meilsmith.

01:00:07.453 --> 01:00:09.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that concludes our travels

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:13.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit our brothers
and sisters around the globe.

01:00:13.059 --> 01:00:15.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the different examples

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:18.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brotherly and neighborly love
we’ve seen in the past hour?

01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:21.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how our brothers and sisters in Africa

01:00:21.401 --> 01:00:24.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show love by helping each other to cope

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with difficult economic circumstances.

01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:30.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we visited Asia,
we saw the love

01:00:30.777 --> 01:00:33.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shown during times of natural disasters.

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Europe, preaching campaigns

01:00:36.816 --> 01:00:39.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were used to share the good news.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:42.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw examples from North America

01:00:42.288 --> 01:00:46.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how personal interest
can reach a humble person’s heart.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a lot of love and effort
was put into supporting

01:00:50.196 --> 01:00:53.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
construction, renovation, and upkeep

01:00:53.666 --> 01:00:56.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of places of worship in Oceania.

01:00:56.636 --> 01:00:59.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, in South America,

01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:01.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we joined our brothers and sisters
as they went out of their comfort zone

01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:05.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach
to indigenous and remote populations.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first talk of this convention,

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the chairman promised that this symposium

01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:14.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would make you feel proud

01:01:14.654 --> 01:01:17.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a part
of our international brotherhood.

01:01:17.557 --> 01:01:21.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confident
these examples had that effect.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, each one of us needs to ask himself:

01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:27.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I doing my part?

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I show unfailing love

01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:32.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward my brothers and my neighbors?’

01:01:32.672 --> 01:01:36.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah requires of us.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although our circumstances may differ,

01:01:38.978 --> 01:01:43.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we do our utmost
to display love in daily life,

01:01:43.182 --> 01:01:47.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we prove that we are taught
by Jehovah, our Father,

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:50.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose “love never fails.”

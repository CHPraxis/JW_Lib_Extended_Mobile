When you’re little,
you just want to be happy.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, my father
had a problem with alcohol,

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no child wants to live through that.

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, my family
from the United States came to visit us.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They looked so happy!

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way they talked,
it was as though they only had fun

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a good life

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no economic problems.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself, ‘How can we live

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such poverty
while their life is so great?’

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the life I wanted for my family.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I was nine years old,

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left my mother and the rest of my family

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cross the border into the United States.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood.

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I joined a local gym
to learn how to defend myself.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trainer, Leo, was like a father to me.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always tried to give us good advice.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raymond was part of the boxing team.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a good friend.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got along really well.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He respected me, and he looked after me.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After several years of being around Raymond

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other members of the team,
I felt really comfortable.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To some extent, I admired him

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I could see
that he was really doing well,

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Raymond was selling drugs.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:11.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that it wasn’t right.

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in time,

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:15.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to sell drugs as well.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raymond was in a drug deal gone wrong,

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was murdered.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself,
‘This could happen to me too.’

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had been six years
since I had seen my mom and my siblings.

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother was studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped her to cope
with a lot of suffering.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brought her peace.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was so happy.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize
that this was what I really needed.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also thought about my friends at the gym.

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:13.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted them to understand why life
was so hard for all of us,

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I returned to the United States.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they weren’t interested.

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:25.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My trainer, Leo, told me
that I didn’t need to sell drugs anymore;

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could make me a professional boxer,

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could help out my family in that way.

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even gave me the nickname The Bible Boy.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I realized that
that was just a temporary solution.

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:50.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I was learning
was going to help me forever.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was determined to serve Jehovah.

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:56.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I returned to Mexico.

00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:59.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible
and take it seriously.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to view Jehovah as my Father

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he helped me
to find real relief from my pain,

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have peace—a tranquility
that makes you feel

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accepted, loved, and wanted.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enjoyed
an incredible life serving Jehovah.

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:27.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decades later, my father was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:27.454 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so kind to me,

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family, and my siblings.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah
for the life he’s given me.

00:04:39.466 --> 00:04:44.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had so many blessings in my life:
a wonderful wife

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:46.014 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and great friends, 

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:47.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
including those that I serve

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.184 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
alongside of in Bethel.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not on my own anymore.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given me
a life full of real meaning, purpose,

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:00.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so much happiness.

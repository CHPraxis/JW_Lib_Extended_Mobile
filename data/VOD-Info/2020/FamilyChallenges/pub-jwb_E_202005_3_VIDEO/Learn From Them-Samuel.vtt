Samuel was only my age

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah spoke to him.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He respected Eli,
but he had to stand up for what was right.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that I’d have
to do something similar.

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved my brother,
and I always wanted to be like him.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those pictures of him partying with kids

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from school showed
he was living a double life.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to get him in trouble.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I had to say something.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him he had to tell Mom and Dad.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He warned me not to tell.

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:43.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Samuel was courageous

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “did not hide anything,”

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Jehovah himself was with him.”

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t hide this.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talking to my parents wasn’t easy,

00:02:14.238 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I knew it was the right thing to do.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we were proud of Danny.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:29.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But . . .

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . at the time,
we were a little distracted.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, somehow it
was all just a misunderstanding.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to know what was going on.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just wanted to help him.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t help but blame ourselves
for what was happening.

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we thought back to Samuel’s example.

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel, you need to listen to us.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re getting old, Samuel,
and your sons are not like you.

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:46.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cheat, and they take bribes.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They bend Jehovah’s rules

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any way they please.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:56.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even faithful Samuel had sons
who deviated from Jehovah’s standards.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to help our son.

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Samuel didn’t alter his course

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah stood by him,

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we knew that if we did things His way,

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d stand by us.

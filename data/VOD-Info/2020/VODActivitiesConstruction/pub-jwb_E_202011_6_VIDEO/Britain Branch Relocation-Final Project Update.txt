00:00:02 How will you feel when all we came here to do
00:00:06 is finally completed?
00:00:09 No doubt, we will find a moment to reflect
00:00:11 on the words of Philippians 2:13.
00:00:15 Yes, Jehovah energized us
00:00:18 and gave each and every one of us “both the desire
00:00:21 and the power to act.”
00:00:24 How has sharing on this project affected your life?
00:00:29 It all started over seven years ago.
00:00:47 Can you imagine how excited you’re going to be
00:00:51 when we hear that the new branch facility at Chelmsford
00:00:54 has been approved by the City Council?
00:00:57 Well, guess what?
00:00:59 Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.
00:03:32 Whilst the buildings are beautiful,
00:03:35 at the end of the day, they are just buildings.
00:03:38 The really special part of this project
00:03:40 has been the people;
00:03:43 even non-Witnesses saw that something special
00:03:47 was taking place on our site.
00:03:49 It’s a very friendly site to work on.
00:03:51 It’s just how friendly everyone is.
00:03:53 You walk in, and it just— I find it mind-blowing.
00:03:57 In a negative (sometimes) society,
00:03:59 when you come here, it just puts a smile on your face.
00:04:02 A truly unexpected success
00:04:05 was the visitors’ center.
00:04:07 How we underestimated the appreciation
00:04:09 Jehovah’s people have
00:04:12 for theocratic activities.
00:04:14 Visitors from all around the globe witnessed
00:04:17 the activities of Jehovah for themselves.
00:04:20 This is partly why
00:04:22 I’m actually studying the Bible to get baptized,
00:04:26 because when I came here, it just hit me somewhere, you know?
00:04:31 Me and Alicia can’t see,
00:04:34 so everyone has been so encouraging and thoughtful.
00:04:37 We really feel like Jehovah is with us and he’s supported us.
00:04:42 I really liked the ladies driving tractors.
00:04:48 Everyone wanted to have a part in the project.
00:04:52 Every single contribution warmed our hearts
00:04:55 and sometimes our heads too.
00:04:59 Another beautiful project highlight
00:05:02 was the day-volunteer program.
00:05:04 The effort and expense brothers and sisters
00:05:07 sacrificed reminded all of us
00:05:09 of what a privilege it is to work for Jehovah.
00:05:13 And how about the commuters who helped on the project?
00:05:16 Would the BRD family have had
00:05:19 the same spirit without our commuters?
00:05:24 Don’t you just love being a part of this amazing family?
00:05:32 We were regularly reminded that spirituality
00:05:35 is of the utmost importance.
00:05:38 Did you ever say that a monthly meeting
00:05:40 was the best one yet?
00:05:43 What lies outside the comfort zone
00:05:47 is the faith zone.
00:05:49 Don’t cry because it’s over;
00:05:51 smile because it happened.
00:05:55 What is your story?
00:05:59 The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.
00:06:02 He is the one who energized us;
00:06:05 he is the one who gave us both the desire
00:06:08 and the power to act.
00:06:10 He is the one we can thank
00:06:12 for the lifelong friendships we have formed,
00:06:14 the training we have received,
00:06:16 and the challenges we have been able to overcome.
00:06:19 Remember your story.
00:06:22 Really, it’s only just beginning.

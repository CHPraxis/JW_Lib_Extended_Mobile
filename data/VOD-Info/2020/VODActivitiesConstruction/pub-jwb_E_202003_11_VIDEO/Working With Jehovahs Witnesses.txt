00:00:03 We’ve been working on the project
00:00:04 almost 12 months now.
00:00:06 I had a limited knowledge
00:00:08 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:09 Occasionally, they knock on the door.
00:00:11 We only see one small part of you
00:00:12 when you’re coming around the streets
00:00:14 and you’re knocking on doors.
00:00:16 I didn’t even know they did
00:00:17 these sorts of projects.
00:00:18 Then I’ve learned that they’ve been
00:00:20 all over the world doing these, the same sort of thing.
00:00:23 I’ve never been on a site that’s as well-run as this one.
00:00:26 The cleanliness of the actual site
00:00:28 is, you know, impeccable.
00:00:30 It seems a very, very well-organized site.
00:00:33 The planning of the whole thing . . .
00:00:35 Yes.
00:00:35 . . . the walkways, the routes in and out
00:00:36 —it’s all been exemplary.
00:00:38 It’s been an experience
00:00:40 —a good one, I might add.
00:00:42 It’s opened my eyes to a lot of different ways of working.
00:00:48 When I found out that most of the people on this site
00:00:50 were volunteers, I was quite amazed.
00:00:52 It was very clear that Watchtower
00:00:54 put so much time into their people
00:00:57 in terms of bringing them on, putting the skills in,
00:01:00 and making them capable of doing the job that they wanted to do.
00:01:04 And that training and that time,
00:01:07 it was just superb to see.
00:01:09 This fellow sitting next to me,
00:01:11 when I explained to him, you know,
00:01:12 that volunteers were working here,
00:01:13 he didn’t believe me.
00:01:15 And everyone we speak to, there’s just no chance they would believe us
00:01:19 as to what we see and what we experience —which has been good.
00:01:21 You’ve got ladies driving
00:01:23 diggers and big dumpers.
00:01:24 And it’s not very often you see that.
00:01:27 Construction is still a male-dominated environment,
00:01:30 but to actually come on-site and see the number of women
00:01:32 that are actually operating the plant and actually involved
00:01:35 in the cold-face construction, it’s fantastic.
00:01:38 It proves that they’re able to do as good a job and—walking around this site
00:01:42 (I’m going to be honest with you) —probably a better job in many instances.
00:01:47 It’s amazing how everyone
00:01:50 is just really nice
00:01:51 and just seems so relaxed
00:01:53 and are just genuinely really, really, nice people.
00:01:55 You always got a “Hello.”
00:01:56 You always got a “Goodbye.”
00:01:58 You always were asked how you were doing.
00:02:00 When you go back home, you feel different.
00:02:02 You don’t have that feeling
00:02:04 —that stress—on top of you.
00:02:06 We came here the first time,
00:02:08 and it was almost (to my mind) like a film set.
00:02:10 Everyone seemed happy all the time,
00:02:11 and it didn’t seem possible that it could happen.
00:02:13 Yeah, and it’s just continued for the last
00:02:16 —what?—eight months, nine months since I have been here.
00:02:18 And it’s always happy, and no one can fake that.
00:02:21 It’s great to see people that are just really positive about everything,
00:02:26 which in a sometimes negative society
00:02:29 when you pick up the papers and look at the news—
00:02:31 It’s just when you come here —it’s just—it puts a smile on your face.
00:02:34 It’s just been a warmer,
00:02:35 friendlier experience.
00:02:37 All the health and safety
00:02:38 and the briefings—they’re all still done.
00:02:39 How can you build so fast and so accurately with such quality, though?
00:02:42 And that’s what’s blown our minds.
00:02:44 Most of the people on-site don’t have the skills when they first come here,
00:02:47 and they’re doing work as good
00:02:49 as some of our guys who’ve probably been employed six or seven years.
00:02:51 The communication has been fantastic.
00:02:53 It’s a two-way conversation when problems arise;
00:02:56 it’s not always a fight over money.
00:02:59 It’s just working with each other.
00:03:01 There’s not an argument over everything.
00:03:03 If something is not right, you work together to get over the problem.
00:03:07 To see everyone here together
00:03:09 all striving for the same goal is fantastic.
00:03:12 I think what’s made it great for us, working with Watchtower,
00:03:15 is that everything they want to do, they want to do it right.
00:03:18 And they do everything with passion and energy,
00:03:20 and it’s something that we like to do ourselves, as well.
00:03:23 I’ve built The Gherkin in the city; I’ve built Wembley Stadium
00:03:26 —big projects, big status—
00:03:28 and we’ve pretty much seen the cusp of other professionals out there.
00:03:33 You would not know the difference.
00:03:34 And being volunteer and nonprofit (I would say),
00:03:38 it’s been absolutely incredible to see, really.
00:03:45 We’ve learned how to work together with other people on-site;
00:03:48 we’ve learned how to work with people that haven’t been in construction before.
00:03:52 Just keeping it honest and straightforward sort of solves a lot of problems.
00:03:56 We wish it would be like that everywhere else,
00:03:58 because, you know, it’s unheard of, really.
00:04:01 We’ve learned more on this site than we’ve learned on any site
00:04:04 about working with each other, probably in 23 years.
00:04:07 I’ve had an enjoyable experience working with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:10 If there was a chance
00:04:11 to come up with another project,
00:04:12 I’d definitely be more than willing
00:04:13 to want to get involved.
00:04:15 I wish all sites could be like this because my life would be a lot easier.
00:04:18 You need to get people to come to this site;
00:04:20 there would be a definite difference
00:04:23 in the way people perceive Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:26 It’s certainly opened and broadened my mind
00:04:28 to what Jehovah’s Witnesses do.
00:04:31 And what’s changed my opinion of your organization most
00:04:34 is that you do exactly what you preach, and I mean exactly:
00:04:38 you’re friendly, you’re forthright, you’re very truthful.
00:04:42 I’ve never been on any other project like this,
00:04:46 not at all.
00:04:48 I just wish all construction sites were like that.
00:04:52 It would be a nicer place to live and work.

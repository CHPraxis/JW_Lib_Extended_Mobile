“Serve Jehovah with rejoicing,”

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says Psalm 100:2.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah wants us to be joyful.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s given us
many reasons to rejoice.

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us life with its many joys.

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us the Bible
to teach us how to enjoy life.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he guides us
into countless joyful experiences.

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the God who gives joy.

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:33.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan, however, does not want us

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find joy in serving Jehovah.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing,
he knows that joy helps us

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on preaching and teaching

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very work he wants to stop.

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he tries to destroy our joy,

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes through official opposition

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at other times
through family and community pressure.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan also wants us

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cut back our service to Jehovah

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to obtain
unnecessary material things.

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to think that getting
more and more material things

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring us lasting joy.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s tactics are not new.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we now read portions of the books

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah,

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for lessons that can help us

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “serve Jehovah with rejoicing” today.

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what brought
Jehovah’s people joy back then

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what robbed them of their joy.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And consider why and how
<i>we</i>  can experience

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the joy of Jehovah” today,

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under trying circumstances.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra, a priest and a copyist
of the Law of Moses,

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the writer of the book
that bears his name.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Ezra
picks up the history of Israel

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the end of 2 Chronicles,

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which likely Ezra also wrote.

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s 537 B.C.E.,

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many Jews
are about to return to Judah.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The nation has spent 70 years
in captivity to Babylon

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for practicing idol worship.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve learned a hard lesson,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never again does the entire nation

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:32.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fall back into idolatry.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the time has come to get pure worship

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back on its feet in Jerusalem.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account spans the reigns

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of several Persian kings,

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with King Cyrus,

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has a joyful beginning.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Ezra 1:1-6, and follow along.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia,

Just imagine!

Jehovah returns the Jews to their land

to rebuild the temple.

Many Jews joyfully take up this assignment.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, those who
for various reasons cannot return

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give financial support to those who can.

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:53.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely in the early spring of 537 B.C.E.,

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nearly 50,000 Israelites depart Babylon.

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

also called Joshua,

whom Cyrus appointed,

Zerubbabel.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the early autumn,
they arrive in Judah,

and they are joyful!

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:16.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can they sustain that joy?

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what they do
as soon as they get settled.

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:24.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Ezra 3:1-6:

“You will become nothing but joyful”!

and joyfully lay
the foundation for the temple.

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:17.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about that at Ezra 3:10-13:

and the heads of the paternal houses

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—the old men who had seen the former house—

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:11.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wept with a loud voice when they saw
the foundation of this house being laid,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while many others shouted joyfully
at the top of their voice.

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:18.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the people could not distinguish

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sound of the joyful shouts
from the sound of the weeping,

00:08:21.563 --> 00:08:24.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the people were shouting so loudly

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the sound was heard
from a great distance.”

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:31.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, some of the oldest members of the nation

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:36.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot imagine
how this temple could possibly match

00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:38.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glory of Solomon’s temple.

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:42.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the others’ joyful shouting
overpowers their weeping.

00:08:43.794 --> 00:08:46.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people of the surrounding lands, however,

00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:48.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not rejoice.

00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:52.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, they cunningly target Israel’s joy.

00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:58.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how in Ezra chapter 4:1-3:

00:08:58.183 --> 00:09:01.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the enemies
of Judah and Benjamin heard

00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:06.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the returned exiles were building
a temple to Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:10.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they immediately approached Zerubbabel
and the heads of the paternal houses

00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said to them:”

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us build along with you;

00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:18.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for like you, we worship your God

00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:20.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we have been sacrificing to him

00:09:20.872 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since the days
of King Esar-haddon of Assyria,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who brought us here.”

00:09:25.502 --> 00:09:28.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Zerubbabel and Jeshua

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the rest of the heads
of the paternal houses of Israel

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said to them:”

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:36.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have no share with us
in building a house to our God,

00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:39.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for we alone will build it
to Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:43.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as King Cyrus
the king of Persia has commanded us.”

00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:49.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zerubbabel discerns
that behind their enemies’ offer to help

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:51.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lurk bad motives.

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:53.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he rejects their offer,

00:09:53.238 --> 00:09:57.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they try to prevent the Jews
from working on the temple.

00:09:57.409 --> 00:10:01.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how verses 4 to 7 continue:

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the people of the land

00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:07.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were continually discouraging
the people of Judah

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and disheartening them from building.

00:10:09.337 --> 00:10:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They hired advisers against them
to frustrate their plans

00:10:13.008 --> 00:10:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the days of King Cyrus of Persia
until the reign of King Darius of Persia.

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:20.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus,

00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:22.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they wrote an accusation

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:25.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.

00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:28.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And in the days
of King Artaxerxes of Persia,

“Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel,
and the rest of his colleagues

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:35.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wrote to Artaxerxes the king;

00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:37.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they translated the letter into Aramaic,

00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:40.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
writing it with Aramaic characters.”

00:10:42.913 --> 00:10:45.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what Rehum,
the chief government official,

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:49.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others of Israel’s enemies
write to the king.

00:10:49.377 --> 00:10:52.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what kind
of false accusations they make,

00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:57.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Ezra 4:11-16:

00:10:57.802 --> 00:11:02.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is a copy
of the letter that they sent him.”

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To King Artaxerxes from your servants,

00:11:05.727 --> 00:11:08.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the men of the region Beyond the River:

00:11:08.688 --> 00:11:12.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And now let it be known to the king

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the Jews who came up here
from you to us have arrived at Jerusalem.

00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:21.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are rebuilding
the rebellious and wicked city,

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:25.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they are finishing the walls
and repairing the foundations.

00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:27.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now let it be known to the king

00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:31.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that if this city should be rebuilt
and its walls finished,

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:35.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will not give tax, tribute, or toll,

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:40.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will result in a loss
to the treasuries of the kings.

00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:43.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since we eat the salt of the palace

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:47.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it is not proper for us
to see the king’s interests harmed,

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:52.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have therefore sent
to make this known to the king,

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:54.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that there may be an investigation

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:57.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the book of records of your ancestors.

00:11:57.904 --> 00:12:00.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will find in the book of records

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and learn that this city
is a rebellious city,

00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:07.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“injurious to kings and provinces,

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:10.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and within it have been those
stirring up sedition

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:13.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from ancient times.

00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:16.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why this city was destroyed.

00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:19.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are making known to the king

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:23.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that if this city is rebuilt
and its walls are finished,

00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:28.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will have no control
of the region Beyond the River.”

00:12:28.268 --> 00:12:31.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do those false accusations sound familiar?

00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:36.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are the same ones
our enemies sometimes hurl against us today:

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:38.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They don’t pay taxes.

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:41.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They work
against the government’s interests.

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They are rebellious and seditious.

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:46.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re uncontrollable.”

00:12:46.953 --> 00:12:48.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All false charges, of course!

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:53.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And back then, they had their effect.

00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:56.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king orders the work halted,

00:12:56.004 --> 00:12:59.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and temple rebuilding comes to a standstill.

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:00.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad!

00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:02.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Jews first returned,

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:05.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t let fear of man

00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:08.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stop them from doing Jehovah’s work.

00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:10.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now they do.

00:13:10.435 --> 00:13:12.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us today

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:15.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face increasing opposition to Jehovah’s work.

00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:18.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But compromising or giving up

00:13:18.276 --> 00:13:21.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has never brought anyone joy

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:23.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just the opposite.

00:13:23.615 --> 00:13:26.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remaining faithful brings joy,

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:29.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the face of violent persecution.

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how is that possible?

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:34.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a true-life example.

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:37.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture a mother and daughter

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:40.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surrounded by a mob of angry men

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding that they
buy political party cards.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would the sisters do?

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they compromised and bought the cards,

00:13:48.723 --> 00:13:50.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their persecutors would rejoice.

00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:54.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But afterward the sisters would be miserable,

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:57.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing they had denied
their heavenly Father.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters did not give in.

00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:04.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they didn’t enjoy
being ridiculed and mistreated.

00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, however,
their consciences were clean.

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they felt deep joy,

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing they had remained
faithful to Jehovah.

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the Jews of Ezra’s day?

00:14:18.294 --> 00:14:21.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many may have left a stable life in Babylon

00:14:21.548 --> 00:14:24.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the arduous trek to Judah.

00:14:24.551 --> 00:14:28.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after about 14 years
of constant opposition,

00:14:28.763 --> 00:14:32.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the laying
of the temple’s foundation up to the ban,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews have lost
their zeal for Jehovah’s work.

00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They go through the motions
of offering sacrifices,

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:45.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they are not doing
what Jehovah <i>told</i>  them to do

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:47.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—finish rebuilding the temple!

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:49.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they meet resistance,

00:14:49.868 --> 00:14:52.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they rationalize that it must not be

00:14:52.412 --> 00:14:55.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s time to finish the work.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, even Governor Zerubbabel

00:14:57.417 --> 00:15:00.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and high priest Jeshua need encouragement.

00:15:00.962 --> 00:15:05.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide it,
Jehovah sends the prophet Haggai.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn now
to the book of Haggai, chapter 1.

00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:11.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai’s clear and powerful messages,

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivered during a period
of about four months,

00:15:14.642 --> 00:15:17.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get right to the heart of the matter,

00:15:17.103 --> 00:15:22.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read at Haggai 1:2-11:

00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:25.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:15:25.153 --> 00:15:27.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘These people say,

00:15:27.197 --> 00:15:31.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The time has not yet come
for the house of Jehovah to be built.”’

00:15:31.034 --> 00:15:35.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the word of Jehovah again came
through Haggai the prophet, saying:

00:15:35.622 --> 00:15:40.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Is it the time for you to dwell
in your paneled houses,

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘while this house lies in ruins?

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now this is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:49.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Set your heart on your ways.

00:15:49.427 --> 00:15:53.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah compares the results
of the Jews’ self-centered efforts

00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:12.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of a hired worker who puts

00:17:12.677 --> 00:17:14.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wages into a moth-eaten sack.

00:17:16.097 --> 00:17:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the Jews
are neglecting the house of Jehovah,

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he holds back his blessing.

00:17:21.811 --> 00:17:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the Jews’ labor are limited,

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lives lack joy.

00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:30.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, some try to fill that void

00:17:30.862 --> 00:17:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by beautifying their own homes.

00:17:34.073 --> 00:17:38.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But <i>material</i>  things
cannot satisfy spiritual needs.

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:41.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we see the warning here for us?

00:17:41.748 --> 00:17:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not wrong to enjoy nice things.

00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But material things
cannot bring us true and lasting joy,

00:17:50.006 --> 00:17:54.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if we neglect
Jehovah’s work to obtain them.

00:17:55.762 --> 00:17:58.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the lesson of Psalm 127:1:

00:17:58.389 --> 00:18:00.892 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:18:00.892 --> 00:18:02.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“it is in vain

00:18:02.894 --> 00:18:05.313 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that its builders work hard on it.”

00:18:05.647 --> 00:18:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
when we unselfishly ‘seek first

00:18:09.108 --> 00:18:12.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom and his righteousness,’ 

00:18:12.153 --> 00:18:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>he</i>  provides what we really need

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at just the right time.

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 10:22 tells us:

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.333 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“It is the blessing of Jehovah

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:27.335 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“that makes one rich,

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:30.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and He adds no <i>pain </i> with it.”

00:18:30.546 --> 00:18:34.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, will this rebuilt temple
really not attain to its former glory,

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:36.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as some believe?

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through Haggai, Jehovah guarantees

00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the future glory of this house

00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:44.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be even greater.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading at Haggai 2:3-9.

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:54.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Who is left among you

“‘The silver is mine,

“‘The future glory of this house

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be greater than the former,’
says Jehovah of armies.”

00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:08.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when the Creator and Owner
of the entire universe declares his purpose,

00:20:08.394 --> 00:20:13.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who or what could possibly prevent
him from carrying it out?

00:20:13.274 --> 00:20:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing and no one!

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s straightforward message
is unmistakable.

00:20:20.031 --> 00:20:23.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, the returnees
need more encouragement.

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:25.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sends his angel

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to another prophet, Zechariah.

00:20:29.207 --> 00:20:34.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Zechariah 1:12-16,

00:20:34.128 --> 00:20:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together
the angel’s reassuring words for Israel.

00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Zechariah 1:12-16.

00:20:45.014 --> 00:20:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the angel of Jehovah said:”

“O Jehovah of armies,

with whom you have been

To emphasize
just how protective Jehovah will be,

the angel continues,
at chapter 2, verses 7-9:

“Come, Zion!

And you will certainly know

Of course not!

Then, in Zechariah 3:1, 2,

“And he showed me Joshua the high priest

Israel’s confidence in themselves?

On the contrary!

They need to remember
that only with Jehovah’s help

can they accomplish anything.

Predictably, Israel’s enemy neighbors,

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led by Tattenai and Shethar-bozenai,

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:15.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also spring into action.

00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Returning to the book of Ezra,

00:24:18.227 --> 00:24:21.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read at chapter 5, verses 3-5:

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time Tattenai the governor
of the region Beyond the River

00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:30.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues
came to them and asked them:”

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:34.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who issued an order to you
to build this house

00:24:34.368 --> 00:24:36.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to finish this structure?”

00:24:36.454 --> 00:24:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then they asked them:”

00:24:38.581 --> 00:24:42.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What are the names of the men
who are working on this building?”

00:24:42.168 --> 00:24:45.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God was watching
over the elders of the Jews,

00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:49.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they did not stop them
until the report could be sent to Darius

00:24:49.008 --> 00:24:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an official document
could be sent back concerning this.”

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is another lesson for us today:

00:24:55.973 --> 00:25:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we courageously do
Jehovah’s work despite opposition,

00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses our efforts

00:25:02.772 --> 00:25:06.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enables us to keep on serving him.

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:09.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, though,
the Jews must continue their work

00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:11.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the temple under ban.

00:25:11.989 --> 00:25:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king who <i>issued</i>  the ban, however,

00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was assassinated
after reigning only seven months.

00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:20.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Tattenai and his accomplices

00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are dealing with a <i>new</i>  king, Darius I.

00:25:26.087 --> 00:25:28.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In denouncing the Jews,

00:25:28.172 --> 00:25:32.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they try to use
Zerubbabel’s own words against him,

00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:34.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his statement that King Cyrus

00:25:34.929 --> 00:25:37.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
issued the order to rebuild the temple.

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:42.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They ask King Darius
to investigate whether that’s really so.

00:25:43.521 --> 00:25:46.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius orders the investigation.

00:25:46.023 --> 00:25:48.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will King Darius decide?

00:25:49.318 --> 00:25:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the Jews’ renewed faith
and determination bring them joy?

00:25:52.988 --> 00:25:55.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just more trouble?

00:25:55.032 --> 00:25:59.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius learns that Cyrus
did indeed order that the temple be rebuilt.

00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:05.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ezra 6:6-12, we read

00:26:05.292 --> 00:26:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius’ stinging reply.

00:26:08.671 --> 00:26:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So now Tattenai the governor
of the region Beyond the River,

00:26:13.342 --> 00:26:16.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the lesser governors
of the region Beyond the River

00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:21.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—stay away from there.

00:26:21.225 --> 00:26:24.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not interfere with the work
on that house of God.

00:26:24.478 --> 00:26:27.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The governor of the Jews
and the elders of the Jews

00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:31.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will rebuild that house of God
in its former place.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Furthermore, I am issuing an order

00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:36.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as to what you are to do
for these elders of the Jews

00:26:36.991 --> 00:26:39.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for rebuilding that house of God:

in the region Beyond the River,

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the expenses
are to be promptly given to these men

00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:49.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to continue without interruption.

00:26:49.962 --> 00:26:52.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And whatever is needed

00:26:52.006 --> 00:26:54.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—young bulls as well as rams and lambs

00:26:54.758 --> 00:26:57.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“just as the priests
who are in Jerusalem say—

00:27:03.851 --> 00:27:06.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is to be given them continually

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“day by day without fail,

00:27:09.315 --> 00:27:12.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they
may continually present offerings

“that please the God of the heavens

00:27:14.278 --> 00:27:18.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pray for the life
of the king and his sons.

00:27:18.782 --> 00:27:23.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have also issued an order
that if anyone violates this decree,

00:27:23.787 --> 00:27:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a timber will be pulled out of his house

00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:29.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will be lifted up and fastened to it,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his house will be turned
into a public latrine for this offense.

00:27:34.465 --> 00:27:37.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And may the God
who has caused his name to reside there

00:27:37.968 --> 00:27:41.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“overthrow any king
and people who lift a hand

00:27:41.555 --> 00:27:45.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to violate this order
and destroy that house of God,

00:27:45.184 --> 00:27:47.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which is in Jerusalem.

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:50.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Darius, issue this order.

00:27:50.439 --> 00:27:52.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let it be done promptly.”

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:59.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Upon receiving the king’s command,
Tattenai and his colleagues have no choice.

00:27:59.114 --> 00:28:03.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only must they stop interfering
with the work on the temple,

00:28:03.244 --> 00:28:06.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they must help finance it!

00:28:06.372 --> 00:28:10.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful outcome for the faithful Jews.

00:28:10.084 --> 00:28:12.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 515 B.C.E.,

00:28:12.753 --> 00:28:17.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they hold the inauguration
of the house of God with joy,

00:28:17.466 --> 00:28:20.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as we read at verse 22:

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They also joyfully held

00:28:23.264 --> 00:28:25.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Festival of Unleavened Bread
for seven days,

00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah caused them to rejoice

00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:32.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had made the heart
of the king of Assyria favorable toward them,

00:28:32.481 --> 00:28:36.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that he supported them
in the work of the house of the true God,

00:28:36.235 --> 00:28:38.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of Israel.”

00:28:40.155 --> 00:28:45.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, when wise and just officials
similarly intervene in our behalf,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re very grateful to them.

00:28:47.621 --> 00:28:51.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re most grateful
to Jehovah for directing matters.

00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:54.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 21:1 says:

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“A king’s heart is like streams of water

00:28:57.715 --> 00:28:59.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“in Jehovah’s hand.

00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:02.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He directs it wherever He pleases.”

00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:06.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do not put
our ultimate hope in any ruler

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:09.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or institution of this world.

00:29:09.393 --> 00:29:13.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of them
can bring us permanent salvation.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
before the end of Satan’s system,

00:29:16.025 --> 00:29:20.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the nations
will turn against Jehovah’s people.

00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:25.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they’ll experience an outcome
worse than that of Tattenai’s.

00:29:25.451 --> 00:29:27.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can <i>we</i>  draw

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:32.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from these portions
of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah?

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:35.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jehovah blesses our determined efforts

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep on doing his work despite challenges,

00:29:39.548 --> 00:29:42.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he frustrates
the efforts of our opposers.

00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:46.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, when we put Jehovah’s work
ahead of material comforts,

00:29:46.639 --> 00:29:49.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gives us true joy.

00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:54.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the work Jesus
commissioned us to do today?

00:29:54.229 --> 00:29:58.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made it very clear
in his parting words to his followers:

00:29:58.484 --> 00:30:02.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:30:02.613 --> 00:30:04.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of people of all the nations.”

00:30:05.908 --> 00:30:09.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we, with our hearts and hands,

00:30:09.036 --> 00:30:12.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting this assignment
ahead of material goals?

00:30:12.164 --> 00:30:15.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai foretold that one day,

00:30:15.751 --> 00:30:19.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s temple
would become far more glorious

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the one Solomon built.

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:25.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:30:25.886 --> 00:30:30.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is using our preaching
to shake the nations.

00:30:30.891 --> 00:30:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of “precious things”
—new worshippers—

00:30:34.937 --> 00:30:37.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are coming to him.

00:30:37.064 --> 00:30:41.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are joyfully flocking
to the great spiritual temple

00:30:41.443 --> 00:30:44.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s arrangement for worshipping him

00:30:44.154 --> 00:30:48.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:30:48.283 --> 00:30:52.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is not the time to focus our attention

00:30:52.663 --> 00:30:54.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on “paneled houses”

00:30:54.665 --> 00:30:58.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on any other unnecessary pursuit.

00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very soon, on a day we do not expect,

00:31:02.798 --> 00:31:05.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s world will end,

00:31:05.134 --> 00:31:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will enter Jehovah’s new world.

00:31:08.804 --> 00:31:12.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no matter how Satan tries to discourage

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:14.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or distract us now,

00:31:14.727 --> 00:31:17.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we never let him rob us

00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:19.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our joy in Jehovah!

00:31:19.982 --> 00:31:22.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we, rather, walk with Jehovah

00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:25.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right into his peaceful new world,

00:31:25.988 --> 00:31:29.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we will serve
him forever with rejoicing.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zerubbabel,

00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:32.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeshua,

00:31:32.911 --> 00:31:34.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haggai,

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:37.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zechariah have done much

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:40.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Israel regain Jehovah’s favor.

00:31:41.503 --> 00:31:43.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, in 468 B.C.E.,

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra himself comes to Jerusalem
to support true worship.

00:31:47.968 --> 00:31:50.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the nation needs still more direction.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah sends them another brave leader.

00:31:56.685 --> 00:31:59.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the next two days of this convention,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn
about that faithful and powerful man

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:05.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah.

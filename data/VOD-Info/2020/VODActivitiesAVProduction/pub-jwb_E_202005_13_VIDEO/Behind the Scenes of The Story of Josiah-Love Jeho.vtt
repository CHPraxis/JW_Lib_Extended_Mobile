Where do you begin an important project

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like <i>The Story of Josiah:</i>
<i>Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad? </i>

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You begin with prayerful consideration.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a serious responsibility
—part of being loyal to Jehovah and his Word.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, many hours
of careful research goes into the first step:

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
writing a script.

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The script is then visualized
through a step called storyboarding.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:45.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not just
the script and storyboarding

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that requires attention to accuracy.

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Costumes must be thoroughly
researched so that their components,

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
styles, colors, and even the types of fabric

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appear as historically accurate as possible.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production must also
accurately depict the times

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being represented while making
the best use of donated funds.

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this be done?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For <i>The Story of Josiah, </i>

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the solution was to film at Bethel locations,

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the studio spaces at Mount Ebo.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Set construction began early in 2018.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production team designed
and built three flexible sets

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that with easy prop adjustments,

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could be in multiple locations.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were filmed indoors.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
from local congregations

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served as extras for the crowd scenes.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With an eye to Biblical
and historical accuracy,

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the makeup team transformed the actors

00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into characters from King Josiah’s time. 

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many details to get right.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a large portion of the drama,
filming in front of a green screen

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enabled the visual effects team
to construct accurate environments digitally.

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many layers of character action,
called plates, were assembled

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:48.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with digital environments
to produce complex visuals.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the closing festival scene,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which required 14,000 Israelites

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many sheep,

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
3D models were made
and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:34.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2018, the production packed up

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved to an outdoor location

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Watchtower Farms in Wallkill, New York.

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And action!

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In August, the last scene was filmed

00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back at the Mount Ebo studio.

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 45 days of filming

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with over 4 terabytes
of footage captured,

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the team had finished production.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:14.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project moved to the editing
facilities at Patterson, New York.

00:04:18.487 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what more could be done
so that the account portrayed 

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could touch our hearts?

00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A colorist applied a look to the overall film

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enhance the picture’s quality and mood.

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to get better.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m afraid of being alone.

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:36.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additional sound effects, such as footsteps

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sound of dry grass being rustled,

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:43.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were recorded to make the on-screen
action more natural and compelling.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed,

00:04:46.598 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded, and added to the movie
to enhance the appeal to our hearts.

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work on <i>The Story of Josiah:</i>
<i>Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad</i>

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:01.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was done to strengthen
Jehovah’s people worldwide.

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:11.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This powerful story also assists parents
as they teach their children

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of God’s Word and promise.

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:18.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These words that I am commanding you today

00:05:18.964 --> 00:05:21.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must be on your heart,

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:23.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you must inculcate them in your sons

00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and speak of them when you sit in your house

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:28.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and when you walk on the road

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you lie down and when you get up.”

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So that it may always go well with you

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your sons after you,

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you are doing what is good

00:05:40.402 --> 00:05:43.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”

00:05:45.532 --> 00:05:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Story of Josiah </i>has proven
to be yet another example

00:05:49.953 --> 00:05:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how Jehovah continues to provide
abundant spiritual food and support

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his people worldwide.

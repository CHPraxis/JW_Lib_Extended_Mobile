00:00:02 If you were asked to think of two men
00:00:04 in the first century who were zealous disciple-makers,
00:00:08 who would come to your mind?
00:00:10 You may be thinking of Paul and Barnabas.
00:00:13 Together, they traveled extensively,
00:00:15 preaching the good news and helping many
00:00:18 to learn the wonderful truth about Jehovah.
00:00:21 This work brought joy not only to them but others too.
00:00:26 Acts 15:3 states:
00:00:28 “So after being escorted
00:00:30 “partway by the congregation,
00:00:33 “these men continued on
00:00:35 “through both Phoenicia and Samaria,
00:00:37 “relating in detail the conversion
00:00:40 “of people of the nations
00:00:42 and bringing great joy to all the brothers.”
00:00:46 Their shared experiences
00:00:48 were a great source of joy to the brotherhood.
00:00:50 They all felt encouraged
00:00:53 and united as one spiritual family.
00:00:57 So, too, today, we have many like Paul and Barnabas,
00:01:01 who are actively working to find honesthearted ones.
00:01:05 Let’s quickly review the numbers
00:01:08 and see what our spiritual family’s united efforts
00:01:11 have accomplished during the 2019 service year.
00:01:15 The good news was preached in 240 lands.
00:01:19 The average number of publishers
00:01:21 each month reached over 8.4 million!
00:01:25 More than two billion hours
00:01:27 were spent in the field.
00:01:29 Also, you’ll be pleased to know
00:01:32 that the number baptized
00:01:34 surpassed 300,000
00:01:37 for the first time in 20 years!
00:01:39 That’s, on average, 5,843 people
00:01:44 symbolizing their dedication
00:01:47 to Jehovah every weekend.
00:01:49 And there’s great potential
00:01:51 for millions more to embrace the truth.
00:01:54 On average, 9.6 million Bible studies
00:01:58 were conducted each month,
00:02:00 and almost 21 million attended the Memorial.
00:02:03 We praise Jehovah for this growth
00:02:06 and thank you for your share in this great increase.
00:02:11 The Governing Body received
00:02:13 some beautiful experiences and reports this past service year,
00:02:18 and they wanted to share that joy with all of you now.
00:02:22 Would you like to hear some of these reports
00:02:25 and meet some of our hardworking brothers and sisters?
00:02:28 Well, then, let’s go!
00:02:31 We’ll meet publishers from six regions of the earth
00:02:34 and hear in their own words the effect
00:02:37 that the disciple-making work has on them.
00:02:40 Here’s a quick peek.
00:02:44 We’ll see some of their unique challenges.
00:02:47 When it rains,
00:02:49 there is so much mud everywhere
00:02:51 that we need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.
00:02:56 We’ll meet ones who made personal sacrifices.
00:03:00 When I turned 60 and retired,
00:03:02 my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.
00:03:07 This brother can see, but he cannot walk,
00:03:10 and me, I can walk but cannot see.
00:03:15 We’ll see the impact the truth can have on new ones.
00:03:19 It made me happy.
00:03:21 Yet, can I really dare believe that?
00:03:24 I was actually sort of in shock,
00:03:27 and it really put a spotlight on who I really was.
00:03:32 What bad habits did some have at first?
00:03:37 What pressures did they face?
00:03:40 And how did they overcome them?
00:03:45 One day she asked her to choose
00:03:48 between family and Jehovah.
00:03:51 Hopefully that whets your appetite for what’s to come.
00:03:55 Now, as we take you around the world,
00:03:59 enjoy the stories of your brothers and sisters
00:04:03 and watch for clues to what contributed to their joy.
00:04:07 Let’s begin with Africa.
00:04:11 It stretches from the Mediterranean
00:04:14 past the golden Sahara
00:04:17 through mountains and savannas
00:04:19 to the Cape of Good Hope.
00:04:21 This continent is known for the enormous diversity
00:04:25 and richness of its wildlife.
00:04:28 Africa’s population, about 1.3 billion people,
00:04:33 is growing faster than any other part of the world.
00:04:38 More than 1,500 languages are spoken here.
00:04:43 The first Christian from Africa,
00:04:46 the Ethiopian eunuch mentioned in Acts chapter 8,
00:04:49 likely brought the good news back with him
00:04:52 to Ethiopia when he returned home.
00:04:55 Today, over 1.7 million publishers
00:05:00 are making disciples throughout this vast continent.
00:05:04 Let’s visit our brothers and sisters in Africa’s most populous country:
00:05:08 Nigeria.
00:05:10 More than 360,000 publishers
00:05:14 are sharing the good news with Nigeria’s over 200 million people.
00:05:19 The territory is highly diverse
00:05:22 —more than 500 languages and 250 ethnic groups.
00:05:28 It’s so encouraging to see the response to the good news!
00:05:32 Some 870,000 Bible studies
00:05:35 are being conducted and, on average,
00:05:38 273 are baptized each week.
00:05:43 This is the Utonkon Congregation in Benue state.
00:05:48 Here, 51 publishers and 4 regular pioneers
00:05:52 are having good results despite a challenging territory.
00:05:58 Preaching in the Utonkon territory
00:06:01 is enjoyable.
00:06:02 It is just that it is accompanied
00:06:04 by some problems.
00:06:06 One is that the territories are very far apart,
00:06:11 and two, the roads are not good.
00:06:14 It takes us three hours to get to some territories.
00:06:17 When it rains, there is so much mud everywhere
00:06:21 that we need to remove our shoes and hold them in our hands.
00:06:25 Whether householders are church-goers, Muslims,
00:06:28 or traditional healers, they listen.
00:06:31 Many even accept our invitation to attend the meetings
00:06:34 despite the travel challenges.
00:06:37 So it makes us very happy to see
00:06:41 that in spite of far territories and bad roads,
00:06:44 we see good results.
00:06:48 I am enjoying my life now,
00:06:51 but when I lost my sight,
00:06:53 I thought it was all over.
00:06:55 As a carpenter, I wondered how I would be able
00:06:58 to do my carpentry.
00:06:59 The thought of it worried me so much.
00:07:03 But as I began to learn about Jehovah from the Bible,
00:07:05 I came to realize that there was hope.
00:07:08 That negative thinking (that my life was over)
00:07:11 disappeared from my mind.
00:07:13 So I am very happy now.
00:07:14 I am joyful.
00:07:17 There is a brother named Joseph.
00:07:19 This brother can see, but he cannot walk,
00:07:22 and me, I can walk but cannot see.
00:07:25 I hold his wheelchair
00:07:27 and push while he directs it.
00:07:29 This has helped us to meet many of our Bible students.
00:07:33 Before now, we were few that went out in the field as pioneers,
00:07:37 but now we are many.
00:07:40 This shows that the example has helped other people,
00:07:43 because when they see someone who cannot walk
00:07:46 and someone who cannot see are pioneering,
00:07:49 they conclude that they can pioneer too.
00:07:54 This is the experience of one of my relatives.
00:07:58 His name is Cletus.
00:08:00 He was very kind to me.
00:08:03 He would hold my hand and assist me to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.
00:08:07 When he got to the Kingdom Hall, he would leave for his church.
00:08:10 But as he noticed how I preached and attended meetings,
00:08:15 the joy I radiated,
00:08:17 the way we treated other people,
00:08:19 and our knowledge of the Scriptures,
00:08:22 he was impressed
00:08:24 and began asking many questions.
00:08:28 The answers he got were quite different from what he had learned,
00:08:32 what they told him in church.
00:08:36 They continued telling him to “get out of there”
00:08:39 and that he should not talk to me again.
00:08:46 He studied the Bible, concluded his study, and got baptized.
00:08:50 Now he serves as a ministerial servant.
00:08:54 Sometimes they used to assign talks to both
00:08:57 of us to handle as a symposium,
00:08:59 and this made me see Cletus as a spiritual brother
00:09:02 in the organization and the congregation.
00:09:07 This gives me joy and makes me very happy.
00:09:13 When people notice our activities,
00:09:15 they usually praise Jehovah and encourage us
00:09:18 to do more since they know that the work we do
00:09:21 is not by our power,
00:09:23 but it is Jehovah who empowers us.
00:09:26 It is true that I am blind,
00:09:29 but I can see Jehovah.
00:09:32 I am helping other people see Jehovah’s hand in our lives.
00:09:36 Even people who are disabled
00:09:38 can bring praise to Jehovah.
00:09:42 I have nothing to do other than to be joyful
00:09:47 and praise Jehovah for my life.
00:09:51 We share your joy, Brother Igbo!
00:09:54 Doesn’t it touch our hearts to see Gabriel and Joseph
00:09:58 helping each other in the pioneer work?
00:10:01 Their example encourages others to ask,
00:10:05 ‘What prevents me from pioneering?’
00:10:08 Perhaps we’re moved to ask that question too.
00:10:11 And did you notice what spurred Cletus to action?
00:10:15 He observed the conduct of Gabriel
00:10:17 and other Witnesses in the congregation.
00:10:20 What do we learn?
00:10:22 That our Christian conduct often speaks louder
00:10:25 than even the most eloquent words.
00:10:29 Now we go to the largest continent in the world: Asia.
00:10:35 Asia is home to three fifths of the world’s people,
00:10:39 including some 760,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:10:43 The geography of Asia ranges
00:10:47 from tundra
00:10:49 to coral reefs
00:10:52 —from Earth’s tallest peak, Mt. Everest,
00:10:55 to its lowest land surface, the Dead Sea.
00:11:00 Asia’s cultural diversity is greater than any other continent.
00:11:03 The two most populated countries in the world
00:11:06 —China and India—
00:11:09 are here in Asia.
00:11:11 Let’s visit our brothers in India.
00:11:15 With a growing population of about 1.3 billion people,
00:11:19 India is on track to become the world’s most populous country
00:11:24 within a decade.
00:11:26 Imagine the potential for growth in India!
00:11:30 With 90 percent of the population
00:11:33 having not yet received a witness,
00:11:35 our 50,000 brothers and sisters have plenty of work to do.
00:11:40 The good news is being preached
00:11:42 in territory that includes mountain ranges, plains and plateaus,
00:11:47 villages, and some of the world’s largest cities.
00:11:52 Hyderabad is in south-central India.
00:11:56 This is the Hyderabad RTC Cross Roads Congregation
00:12:01 in the heart of the city.
00:12:02 Here, 94 publishers,
00:12:05 including 17 regular pioneers,
00:12:08 are conducting 95 Bible studies.
00:12:11 They were delighted to have 252 attend last year’s Memorial.
00:12:17 Let’s meet Sangram.
00:12:21 His story actually begins in another part of India,
00:12:25 where he learned the truth with the help of Alex and Anne Das.
00:12:33 My wife and I serve in the Pandharpur Sign-Language Group.
00:12:38 Currently, there are only three publishers
00:12:41 —me, my wife,
00:12:43 and another brother who is deaf.
00:12:46 We have contact with around 100 deaf ones in our territory.
00:12:52 Each week, 50 to 60 deaf ones attend the meetings.
00:12:57 When they come, they bring their deaf friends with them.
00:13:00 They also bring their relatives.
00:13:03 We are so happy to see them come regularly for the meetings
00:13:07 in spite of the opposition from their families
00:13:09 —sometimes even severe opposition.
00:13:15 They are progressing well spiritually.
00:13:19 We are really happy to see their spiritual advancement.
00:13:25 When I turned 60 and retired,
00:13:27 my wife and I decided to serve where the need is greater.
00:13:32 To our surprise, we were asked to support the sign-language field.
00:13:36 At that time,
00:13:37 we did not have any experience in sign language.
00:13:41 Then our circuit overseer asked us
00:13:43 if we were ready to move to where the need is greater.
00:13:46 He asked if we would move to Latur,
00:13:49 a city that was 521 miles (838 km) from our home.
00:13:54 Once we reached the city,
00:13:56 we were overjoyed to see the interest of the deaf ones.
00:14:01 So we decided to stay there.
00:14:05 Not long after we arrived there,
00:14:08 we met a priest whose name is Sangram.
00:14:11 He was the leader of a deaf association,
00:14:14 and he was short-tempered.
00:14:19 Since we wanted to meet him often,
00:14:21 we invited him to our home to discuss the daily text.
00:14:25 He came regularly at seven o’clock for daily text discussions.
00:14:30 When we moved here, we did not know how to sign very well;
00:14:35 both my wife and I knew almost nothing.
00:14:38 But after we met Sangram
00:14:40 and started to teach him the Bible, we, in turn,
00:14:44 started to learn sign language from him.
00:14:46 We were very happy.
00:14:48 We were really very happy.
00:14:51 As soon as we started studying the Bible with Sangram,
00:14:55 he made changes in his life in line with the Bible principles.
00:15:00 He changed his hairstyle.
00:15:02 He left the deaf association of which he was the leader.
00:15:07 And even his personality changed.
00:15:09 He stopped responding angrily to those who provoked him.
00:15:13 We are so happy
00:15:15 about the Bible discussions we had with him,
00:15:18 because with these his life changed completely.
00:15:21 Soon he broke almost all of his bad habits.
00:15:25 However,
00:15:27 he was still unable to stop his habit of chewing tobacco.
00:15:31 Now, since we loved him,
00:15:33 we took him to a dentist and had his teeth cleaned.
00:15:37 After that visit to the dentist, he completely stopped using tobacco.
00:15:44 Within six months from starting the Bible study,
00:15:47 Sangram became a qualified publisher,
00:15:50 and after that, he continued to progress well.
00:15:57 Latur now has a sign-language congregation.
00:16:00 My wife and I then moved to another group.
00:16:02 We are now serving in Pandharpur.
00:16:06 When we meet our old studies at the conventions
00:16:09 and see their progress, we are overjoyed.
00:16:14 The very thought that Jehovah has extended to us this privilege to serve him
00:16:19 makes us overwhelmed with happiness.
00:16:22 There are no words to express how we feel.
00:16:31 When Sangram showed us his big smile,
00:16:35 did a smile come to your face too?
00:16:37 That’s how the truth affects us.
00:16:40 And don’t we appreciate the sacrifices that Alex and Anne made
00:16:45 in order to serve where the need was greater?
00:16:47 They had to learn sign language and move far away from their home.
00:16:52 But how did it turn out?
00:16:54 Alex says they are “overwhelmed with happiness.”
00:16:58 Imagine that.
00:17:00 They were certainly rewarded for their sacrificing spirit.
00:17:06 We now move west to Europe.
00:17:09 Europe gave birth to the Greek and Roman Empires,
00:17:12 the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance.
00:17:15 With 160 culturally distinct groups,
00:17:20 Europe is immensely varied and densely populated.
00:17:25 Almost 1.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:17:28 are actively making disciples on this continent.
00:17:32 In southeastern Europe,
00:17:35 you’ll find Romania
00:17:38 —a country of nearly 20 million people.
00:17:41 Today, over 39,000 publishers
00:17:45 are conducting almost 22,000 Bible studies.
00:17:50 Eight out of ten people belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church.
00:17:54 The ratio of publishers to the population varies greatly,
00:17:59 from 1 to 4,000 in the southeast
00:18:02 to 1 to 7 in Transylvania in the northwest.
00:18:08 Last year, special preaching campaigns
00:18:11 were organized to reach those in unassigned territories.
00:18:15 As a result, 85 percent of these territories
00:18:19 have been given a witness.
00:18:23 Here are the 112 publishers and 4 regular pioneers
00:18:28 of the Jibou Centru Congregation.
00:18:32 They serve a territory that includes a small city, rural areas,
00:18:37 and large communities of Hungarians and Roma.
00:18:40 Let’s see what it’s like to make disciples there.
00:18:47 One of the challenges we face in our town
00:18:49 is that we have a small territory
00:18:51 compared to the number of brothers
00:18:53 —a ratio of 1 publisher to about 40 inhabitants.
00:18:58 So we put great emphasis on preaching in the villages around Jibou.
00:19:02 Jehovah blessed our efforts,
00:19:04 and we have more Bible studies who make good progress.
00:19:12 When I was still in elementary school,
00:19:14 not yet baptized myself,
00:19:16 I used to speak about Jehovah
00:19:18 to one of my classmates.
00:19:20 Her name was Oana.
00:19:22 She was very interested and even asked many questions.
00:19:26 We were both 12 at that time.
00:19:28 A little while later, after I got baptized,
00:19:31 Oana became my first Bible student.
00:19:39 I was able to show her how to prepare well for the study.
00:19:44 In the evening, we used to read the Bible together,
00:19:47 and we even wrote down in a notebook our favorite Bible texts.
00:19:50 At the same time, by means of different study projects,
00:19:55 I tried to help her see Jehovah as a real Person.
00:19:58 For example, we wrote down on a big sheet of paper
00:20:02 all of Jehovah’s qualities and the way we could imitate them.
00:20:08 Oana made good progress, attended the meetings,
00:20:11 and even started to participate.
00:20:15 I was so happy to see
00:20:17 how much joy Oana had in learning about the truth.
00:20:23 Not surprisingly, difficulties arose on the way.
00:20:27 Oana’s mother was not happy at all that I was studying with her daughter.
00:20:35 She forbade her to study, and one day she asked her
00:20:38 to choose between family and Jehovah
00:20:42 and put her out of the house.
00:20:44 Oana was 16 years old.
00:20:48 I encouraged Oana with the scripture
00:20:52 from Isaiah 41:10, 13,
00:20:55 which says that Jehovah is ‘grasping our hand’
00:20:58 and that he will ‘help us.’
00:21:02 We talked a lot together, and we prayed together.
00:21:05 And after only one week, Jehovah answered our prayers.
00:21:10 Oana’s mother calmed down and not only allowed her to return home
00:21:14 but also to attend meetings and to continue studying together.
00:21:18 I was so happy!
00:21:23 On the 21st of July, 2018,
00:21:26 Oana got baptized.
00:21:28 Now I can finally preach together with my spiritual sister.
00:21:34 Jehovah always gave me the joy I needed.
00:21:37 In fact, I can’t find
00:21:39 the words to describe the joy I experience now.
00:21:48 Did you notice where and when
00:21:50 Beatrice started talking to Oana about Jehovah?
00:21:53 In elementary school.
00:21:56 What a wonderful reminder
00:21:58 that you young ones can experience joy
00:22:00 by making school your personal territory!
00:22:04 If you haven’t tried it already,
00:22:06 look for someone with whom you can share the good news.
00:22:09 You may be surprised at the results.
00:22:13 Let’s go next to North America.
00:22:16 Now, this continent extends from the tiny islands near the Arctic
00:22:20 to the Isthmus of Panama in the south.
00:22:25 North America is home to almost
2.6 million Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:22:31 The United States is by far the most populous country in North America,
00:22:36 with over 325 million people.
00:22:39 Here you can find metropolitan cities
00:22:43 as well as vast areas that are sparsely populated.
00:22:48 This territory is cared for
00:22:50 by more than 1.2 million publishers
00:22:53 and over 180,000 pioneers.
00:22:58 Meet the brothers and sisters
00:23:00 of the Juniata River Pennsylvania German Congregation
00:23:04 in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.
00:23:07 As we’ll see in the following report,
00:23:10 their unique territory is rich with people
00:23:13 who sincerely respect God’s Word.
00:23:27 The challenge is our territory being so vast.
00:23:30 Sometimes you may drive an hour and a half to two hours
00:23:33 just to get to the territory.
00:23:35 One of my favorite joys
00:23:37 is getting to use the Bible constantly in this field.
00:23:40 They respect the Bible.
00:23:42 They all have one in their house.
00:23:46 Starting this language almost three years ago, from a pregroup
00:23:49 to now a congregation with four groups in the area, you can see the growth
00:23:53 and the excitement of everyone.
00:23:57 Honestly, I can say it’s been the happiest time in my life
00:24:00 since I started working in this field.
00:24:11 Out in service one day, just working from door to door,
00:24:13 I met a lady, and she accepted the Greatest Man  book.
00:24:16 Eventually, Memorial season came around.
00:24:19 I went and left an invitation with Jane.
00:24:22 We went back the day before the Memorial
00:24:24 and were surprised when Jane said,
00:24:26 “Yes, we’d love to come.”
00:24:28 So we talked about a Bible study,
00:24:31 and eventually Jerry agreed
00:24:33 to having one as a family.
00:24:37 But there was a contrast from what I’d been taught,
00:24:40 so I was willing to dig for more knowledge
00:24:44 to try and figure out what was going on here.
00:24:48 He read a scripture in Psalms
00:24:50 about the earth, and I said:
00:24:53 “Wow! Yes, all the things I pictured myself doing in heaven
00:24:58 are the things I enjoy on earth.”
00:25:02 It made me happy.
00:25:04 Yet, can I really dare believe that?
00:25:08 The more I studied about the Bible and looked up the scriptures,
00:25:11 the more I realized I never really knew a whole lot about the Bible.
00:25:16 I was actually sort of in shock,
00:25:18 and it really put a spotlight on who I really was.
00:25:24 At one point, Ben and I went over to make a return visit.
00:25:27 We had planned what we wanted to do with the family,
00:25:31 and it just did not lend to that at all,
00:25:35 and we ended up playing cards instead.
00:25:37 We didn’t get to share anything from the Bible.
00:25:40 The family was like, ‘Oh.’
00:25:42 It dawned on them; we’re real people too.
00:25:47 In the Pennsylvania German culture, people teach pretty strongly
00:25:51 obedience to parents to make God happy.
00:25:54 One day, Jerry let me know that his dad wanted to talk to me.
00:25:57 Although my dad meant well, he tried to stop the study.
00:26:02 But the information that he was  bringing to me about the Witnesses
00:26:06 was not what I saw.
00:26:08 What we were being taught
00:26:11 was directly from my Bible that I had in my house.
00:26:14 How could it be wrong?
00:26:17 You could tell that they were just distraught as a family with what was going on.
00:26:21 They wanted to do the right thing, but they could feel all the pressure to stop.
00:26:28 We eventually had to cut ties
00:26:30 in order to continue spiritual growth.
00:26:36 After that, Jerry and Jane just progressed very fast.
00:26:39 They were making changes in their life,
00:26:41 and they got to really see the freedom that serving Jehovah gives you.
00:26:45 Seeing their joy grow
00:26:47 was irreplaceable; it was fantastic.
00:26:56 We have gained a hundredfold of what we could have ever lost.
00:27:02 And so as we share good news
00:27:04 with individuals and as they make progress,
00:27:07 we are very excited and happy.
00:27:10 I would just love for everyone to have
00:27:13 that opportunity to have that same joy.
00:27:17 What happened when Jerry and Jane
00:27:20 read for themselves the truths contained in the Bible?
00:27:24 It deeply affected their thoughts and emotions
00:27:28 and revealed who they really were on the inside.
00:27:31 As a result, they now joyfully serve Jehovah
00:27:35 along with their children.
00:27:37 Ben and Joanna used the Bible skillfully.
00:27:41 They let God’s Word speak for itself.
00:27:44 And the joy this experience brought them is,
00:27:48 as Ben said,  “irreplaceable; . . . fantastic.”
00:27:52 That kind of joy is contagious.
00:27:55 We feel it too just watching them.
00:27:58 Next we go to Oceania.
00:28:02 This is the collective name for Australia
00:28:05 and for the more than 10,000 islands
00:28:08 in the Pacific Ocean between Asia and the Americas.
00:28:14 Some of Oceania’s islands,
00:28:16 are known as “high islands” because they were developed
00:28:20 as volcanic eruptions built up land over time.
00:28:24 “Low islands,” such as the country of Kiribati,
00:28:28 are made of coral and sometimes barely reach above sea level.
00:28:33 Over 100,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses are hard at work
00:28:37 in this beautiful territory.
00:28:41 Fiji is an archipelago of some 300 islands
00:28:46 scattered over 3 million square kilometers,
00:28:49 or about 1 million square miles.
00:28:52 This territory is cared for
00:28:55 by some 3,000 publishers and over 500 pioneers.
00:29:01 In the last service year,
00:29:03 they conducted over 4,700 Bible studies.
00:29:08 These brothers and sisters
00:29:10 are in the South Suva English Congregation.
00:29:13 Let’s see what unique challenges our brothers face there.
00:29:20 Many, if not all, in our territory know about God’s Word, the Bible.
00:29:24 However, they are taught false teachings.
00:29:27 The challenge arises
00:29:29 when customs and traditions
00:29:32 conflict with Bible teachings.
00:29:34 As they study and progress,
00:29:37 they face opposition from their family
00:29:39 and, of course, there’s the social pressure
00:29:41 that comes from their community.
00:29:44 Added to this are the materialistic goals that are put before them.
00:29:47 So all of this combined really poses a challenge with these ones progressing.
00:29:52 Despite these challenges,
00:29:53 some of them eventually do study the Bible with us.
00:29:58 Some have become Jehovah’s friend and made the truth their own.
00:30:01 So to be able to show these ones from God’s Word,
00:30:05 the Bible, that Jehovah is a God of love
00:30:08 and to see their reaction —that in itself is a wonderful blessing.
00:30:14 I used to study with this young girl.
00:30:16 She wanted to make progress in the truth.
00:30:19 But in order for her to do that,
00:30:22 she had to overcome these two big obstacles:
00:30:25 One was the career that she had,
00:30:28 and the other was the obstacle of her unbelieving family.
00:30:34 I really didn’t want to impose the truth on her,
00:30:37 so my goal was to help her understand what the Bible teaches,
00:30:41 help her see the big picture,
00:30:43 and let her draw her own conclusion.
00:30:48 I try to be a good example to her by enjoying
00:30:52 the ministry myself, you know,
00:30:55 and helping her to understand that as I’m out in the ministry,
00:30:58 I know I’m working along with Jehovah.
00:31:01 Although she had a high-paying job,
00:31:04 she wasn’t happy.
00:31:07 She was always stressed.
00:31:09 Then she sees Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:31:12 Despite being out there in the ministry
00:31:14 on hot, sunny days or rainy days,
00:31:17 they’re happy.
00:31:19 She knew and was convinced
00:31:21 that she would be really happy
00:31:24 if she put Jehovah first in her life.
00:31:27 So eventually she had to tell her mother-in-law
00:31:29 that she had resigned from her employment.
00:31:32 So her mother-in-law said:
00:31:35 “And now you’ve resigned?
00:31:37 “So, what are you going to do?
00:31:38 Are you going to go preaching?”
00:31:39 And then she said:
00:31:41 “The decision that I have made is going to make me happy.
00:31:45 It’s going to make Jehovah happy as well.”
00:31:48 In seeing the big picture,
00:31:50 she was able to take a stand for true worship
00:31:53 and be on Jehovah’s side of universal sovereignty.
00:31:57 I attended the Pioneer Service School with her.
00:32:01 You know, what really made me happy
00:32:04 was seeing ones like her
00:32:07 being happy in doing the same work
00:32:10 of helping others come to serve Jehovah
00:32:12 and knowing the fact that Jehovah had actually used me
00:32:17 in helping others
00:32:19 find the truth and serve Jehovah as well.
00:32:28 To some, Fiji may seem like paradise.
00:32:31 But, as we learned, the people of that beautiful land
00:32:35 face the same issues as people everywhere
00:32:37 —stress, pressure-filled jobs, and an uncertain future.
00:32:42 As Makereta’s student learned, putting Jehovah first
00:32:47 is the only guarantee for true, lasting happiness.
00:32:53 Our final destination is South America.
00:32:57 South America is home to earth’s largest river, the Amazon,
00:33:01 as well as the driest place, the Atacama Desert.
00:33:06 Animal life on this continent is rich and diverse,
00:33:10 particularly its bird population.
00:33:14 With some 3,000 species of birds,
00:33:17 South America is sometimes called the bird continent.
00:33:21 More than 400 million people live here,
00:33:26 including over 1.7 million Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:33:32 There is tremendous language diversity
00:33:35 in South America.
00:33:39 Let’s visit Bolivia,
00:33:41 a country of more than 11 million people
00:33:44 and a wide range of indigenous cultures.
00:33:48 Bolivia presents unique challenges
00:33:51 to our about 28,000 brothers and sisters who live here.
00:33:57 Their territory includes the towering Andes Mountains in the west
00:34:01 and rain forests in the north.
00:34:04 The publishers endure weather
00:34:07 that ranges from burning heat  and tropical humidity
00:34:10 to freezing winds.
00:34:13 To reach remote territories,
00:34:15 they may have to cross rivers and drive for hours
00:34:19 on poorly maintained mountain roads
00:34:22 —sometimes just a few millimeters, or inches, from the precipice!
00:34:27 How Jehovah is blessing their courageous efforts!
00:34:31 In the last service year alone,
00:34:34 more than 42,000 Bible studies were conducted.
00:34:39 Here are the 35 publishers and 8 regular pioneers
00:34:44 of the Norte Quechua Congregation.
00:34:47 To reach and seek out those who speak Quechua,
00:34:50 the publishers travel long distances.
00:34:53 Sadly, many of the Quechua-speaking community
00:34:57 have been victims of prejudice
00:35:00 and do not receive basic education in their language.
00:35:03 Our brothers and sisters spend hours
00:35:07 helping interested ones learn to read
00:35:10 so they can comprehend basic Bible truths.
00:35:13 The response to the good news in Bolivia is very positive.
00:35:18 But, as we’ll learn in the following report,
00:35:21 Bible students frequently face opposition,
00:35:24 often from those closest to them.
00:35:29 When an interested person begins to learn
00:35:32 the truth from the Bible,
00:35:34 at first the family is happy for them,
00:35:36 and their friends are happy too.
00:35:39 But when the teachings of the Bible are in opposition to popular customs,
00:35:44 those family members and friends may become their main source of opposition.
00:35:50 However, we have also seen many, many blessings from Jehovah.
00:35:54 For example, although the challenges may be great,
00:35:57 we see Jehovah’s hand
00:35:59 working in the lives of each of these individuals,
00:36:02 because they make huge  changes.
00:36:05 They take hold of Jehovah, they see him as their God,
00:36:08 and they leave behind popular customs and start to make progress.
00:36:12 It is a beautiful blessing to see a Bible student
00:36:15 get baptized, filled with joy.
00:36:19 Lydia was a young woman
00:36:22 who was very interested in spiritual things.
00:36:26 But just like anyone who does not study the Bible,
00:36:30 she had habits that were not pleasing to Jehovah.
00:36:34 She liked to socialize with her workmates,
00:36:37 and at times, she went out drinking with her friends
00:36:41 —sometimes drinking a little too much.
00:36:46 However, despite that, she was very humble.
00:36:51 You could see that she was very sincere;
00:36:54 she appreciated good things.
00:36:58 After seeing these beautiful qualities in her,
00:37:01 I said, “Jehovah can make
00:37:05 other good qualities grow in her heart.”
00:37:09 So we set the date to start the study.
00:37:12 We always tried to be consistent
00:37:15 and to not miss a study.
00:37:18 When a publisher does not miss the day and time for the study,
00:37:22 the Devil is not given the opportunity to disrupt it.
00:37:28 Some teachings Lydia accepted immediately,
00:37:33 but others took more time.
00:37:37 Her manner of dress was not appropriate;
00:37:40 she wore tight clothing and very short skirts.
00:37:44 How did we correct that?
00:37:47 By showing her in the Bible
00:37:49 that women should dress “with modesty and soundness of mind.”
00:37:54 It was not easy, but she did it.
00:37:57 After that, when she attended meetings, she looked like one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:38:04 When you plant a literal plant, you start to water it
00:38:07 and it keeps growing.
00:38:10 While you are sleeping, you don’t know how those changes happen.
00:38:14 It happens exactly the same way with a Bible student.
00:38:21 As time passed, Lydia expressed the desire to be baptized.
00:38:25 After that, she just kept making progress
00:38:29 and started to serve as a regular pioneer.
00:38:32 Later, she was invited to serve at Bethel.
00:38:36 She has been serving at Bethel for 16 years.
00:38:43 I am one of the 70 persons
00:38:45 who learned the truth from Edith.
00:38:48 Her example helped me
00:38:51 to be considerate, to be insightful,
00:38:56 and also to be consistent
00:38:58 in making disciples.
00:39:02 Over the years,
00:39:04 I have learned so much about disciple-making,
00:39:08 especially that this work is not ours.
00:39:14 When Bible students make progress,
00:39:16 it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,
00:39:20 because He sees their hearts.
00:39:23 So we’re not working for a man;
00:39:25 we’re working for the Most High God.
00:39:32 How encouraging to see ones like Lydia learn the truth
00:39:37 and with God’s help make the needed changes!
00:39:41 And what joy it continues to bring to her teacher, Edith,
00:39:45 to see her serving Jehovah today!
00:39:49 As Edith says, “When Bible students make progress,
00:39:52 “it is thanks to the blessing of Jehovah,
00:39:55 because He sees their hearts.”
00:39:59 Well, in our time together,
00:40:02 we’ve circled the earth to bring you these experiences.
00:40:06 Did you notice any patterns for joyful disciple-making?
00:40:11 Here are just four patterns that stood out to me.
00:40:14 We saw that the first step
00:40:17 is to seek out all those with the right heart condition.
00:40:23 Our brothers in Nigeria,
00:40:25 Fiji, and Bolivia
00:40:28 spread the good news despite the great distances,
00:40:32 poor roads, and extreme weather.
00:40:36 Gabriel and Joseph teamed up
00:40:39 to overcome their disabilities,
00:40:42 and their example inspires us to do more.
00:40:47 Alex and Anne Das learned sign language
00:40:50 and moved more than 500 miles
00:40:53 to serve where the need was greater.
00:40:57 Then we saw a second vital element
00:40:59 in disciple-making: the “art of teaching.”
00:41:03 We know, for example, that helping students
00:41:07 to reason on the Scriptures is very effective.
00:41:10 That was the case with Makereta.
00:41:14 Using the Scriptures, she helped her student
00:41:17 draw her own conclusions about the truth.
00:41:22 Benjamin and Joanna skillfully used the Bible
00:41:26 with Jerry and Jane.
00:41:28 The power of the Scriptures touched their hearts.
00:41:32 And when opposition came, they stood firm
00:41:36 because they were convinced that they were learning the truth
00:41:40 from God’s inspired Word.
00:41:44 A third element of disciple-making involves helping our students
00:41:48 to develop good study habits and a regular spiritual routine.
00:41:54 Edith and Lydia made it a goal never to miss a study.
00:42:00 Beatrice showed creativity, developing projects
00:42:05 like that big sheet of paper to help Oana know Jehovah as a real Person.
00:42:10 And fourth: In every experience,
00:42:13 we saw that disciple-making involves love
00:42:17 —showing genuine love.
00:42:20 Alex and Anne took Sangram to the dentist because they love him.
00:42:26 What motivated Cletus to study the Bible?
00:42:30 The joy radiated by Jehovah’s people
00:42:33 and the loving way we treat others.
00:42:38 Angeline gave up her stressful job and put Jehovah first.
00:42:43 Why?
00:42:44 Because she observed Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:42:47 who out of self-sacrificing love
00:42:50 were motivated to preach the good news
00:42:53 on hot days and rainy days,
00:42:55 and she especially noted the joy it brought them.
00:43:01 As you can see, the joy of Jehovah
00:43:04 comes from sincere efforts to help people
00:43:08 and Jehovah’s blessing on those efforts.
00:43:11 When you see and hear your brothers’ and sisters’ heartfelt expressions,
00:43:15 how does it make you feel?
00:43:18 Like Paul and Barnabas,
00:43:20 we too may have challenges along the way, even some setbacks.
00:43:24 But nothing compares with the deep joy and happiness
00:43:29 that results from helping others come to know and love Jehovah.
00:43:34 There are still honesthearted ones out there,
00:43:37 and they desperately need the truth.
00:43:40 It’s experiences like the ones we’ve just listened to
00:43:44 that help us to see that Jehovah is truly speeding up the work.
00:43:49 The next time you go out in service,
00:43:52 picture yourself working side by side
00:43:56 with your brothers and sisters around the world.
00:44:00 Just as in a search and rescue effort,
00:44:03 we may feel we’re not finding survivors in our area.
00:44:07 But just one report of a rescue victim
00:44:11 being pulled out alive spurs on all the volunteers
00:44:15 to double their efforts.
00:44:17 Imagine the joy Jehovah feels
00:44:20 when he looks down and sees us
00:44:24 across the globe working “shoulder to shoulder”
00:44:28 in the greatest rescue mission of all time!
00:44:32 So keep calling out;
00:44:34 keep searching through the rubble of this dying system
00:44:38 to find those crying out for help.
00:44:41 And may your joy abound as you do so.

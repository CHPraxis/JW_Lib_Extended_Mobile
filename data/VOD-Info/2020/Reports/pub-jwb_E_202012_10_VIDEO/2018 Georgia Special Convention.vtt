This past summer,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Noumairs and Susan and I

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had the privilege to attend

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the special convention in Tbilisi, Georgia.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had delegates from 18 different countries.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our total attendance,
including those tied in,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:25.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was 21,914

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 208 baptized.

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unity of our brotherhood

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was on display
as you will see in this brief video.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Teaching Committee informed
us that we had been approved to hold

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special convention in Georgia,
we were thrilled.

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They provided detailed direction,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and responsible brothers were appointed

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to oversee the daunting task

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of caring for nearly 2,500 delegates
from more than ten countries.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Local brothers and sisters
from all over the country

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eagerly volunteered to assist.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many volunteers were willing to travel
several hours each way for training.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed the unity

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and willing spirit of those who were

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.474 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘courageous and strong and went to work.’

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These hardworking brothers and sisters were

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often willing to use
their own material resources

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support
the special convention preparations.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of their willing spirit,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was ready on time.

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother told me when we got on the plane

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re taught to love,
but when you get there,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be shown how to love
—and that happened.

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We landed at midnight,
and they were there ready to hug us.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was awesome!

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help, I can fight!

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help, I can win!

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are the victors.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We win.

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We courageously stay
with Jehovah God and his people.

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s absolutely amazing
to have brothers from Azerbaijan, Armenia,

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turkmenistan, Poland, United States,

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spain, and many others countries.

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:50.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s like we’ve known
our brothers all our life,

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but yet we’re just now meeting them.

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our united brotherhood gives us yet

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:59.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
another reason for confidence

00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:02.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that there are more with us than against us.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where you go,
the friends are there.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll take you home; they’ll feed you;

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll go out in service with you.

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:15.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The purpose of the evening-gathering program 

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not only
to give a taste of the local culture

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:19.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but was also an opportunity

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for local publishers
who worked on the program for months

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to demonstrate their love
toward their visiting brothers and sisters.

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing!

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to go back home.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:44.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:46.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love of the brothers and the way

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re an international, complete family

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s not separate;
it’s not segregated; it is a family.

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that experience is like nothing ever.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very touching.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept hearing that this experience
is a little taste of what the new world

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be like when everyone
on the planet Earth

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be of the same family,

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will truly love each other,
have the same Father

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:21.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that’s absolutely
what makes us brothers and sisters.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have the same Father
—our Father, Jehovah.

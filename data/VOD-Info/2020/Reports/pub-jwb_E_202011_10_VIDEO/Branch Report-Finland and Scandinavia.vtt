At Psalm 133:1, we read:

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! How good
and how pleasant it is

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture was vividly seen when visiting

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Scandinavia and Finland branches.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege of serving
these two branches

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a headquarters representative

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the month of May 2018
along with my wife, Susan.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that these branches
had undergone major changes

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their territory assignments
in recent years.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both were merged with other branches
that have different languages and cultures.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very anxious to see firsthand

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the brothers were handling
these challenges.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former branches in Denmark,

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Iceland,

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Norway,

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sweden

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were merged to form the Scandinavia branch.

00:00:54.658 --> 00:00:57.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The branch facilities are located in Holbæk,

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:00.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which is about an hour outside of Copenhagen.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is beautifully situated
in a suburban community,

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the grounds of the branch
form a lovely garden.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our visit, the weather
was exceptionally fine,

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is not typical for Scandinavia.

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all took advantage
of the sunshine and warm weather.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the warmth of the sunshine
could not outdo

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love shown
by our brothers at the branch.

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family totals
92 full-time members.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty-seven are Danish-speaking,

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
17 speak Norwegian,

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 28 speak Swedish.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered how they carried out their work

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially their spiritual programs.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it turns out, they use a mixture

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all three languages.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, at morning worship,
the chairman might speak in Danish,

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the opening prayer might be in Norwegian,

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the commentors
might give their comments in Swedish.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every week,
there are prerecorded comments

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one of the Remote Translation Offices,

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,
the branch alternates conducting

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Monday night <i>Watchtower</i>  Study
between Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish,

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers are free to comment
in their mother tongue.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though all these languages
are different from each other,

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:22.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are similarities
and, so for the most part,

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they all can understand each other.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:26.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to help the brothers communicate
with each other,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers came up with a language manual

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that contains lists of common words
and their meanings in each language.

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, the manual contains
“Five commandments” such as:

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not speak fast,” 

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use good articulation,”

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:46.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Smile while you speak.”

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:50.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This greatly helps
in smoothing over any miscommunications.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, the Danish word for “kind”

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the Norwegian word for “peculiar.”

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:00.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by following these commandments,

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Norwegian brother would not feel bad

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:04.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if his Danish brother were to tell him,

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are a peculiar person.”

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:10.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation work for these languages

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes place at Remote Translation Offices,
or RTOs.

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:19.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each language RTO is located
in their respective countries.

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:22.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The RTOs function
much like a Bethel facility.

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the most part, meals are provided,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but each cares for their own laundry
and transportation.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were grateful for the opportunity
to visit the RTO in Malmo, Sweden,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is a short car ride from Denmark.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the Swedish RTO, the workers live

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a nearby apartment complex.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a busy place,
since they not only translate into Swedish

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also translate into Swedish Sign Language

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:50.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and produce audio recordings.

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The facilities are well used
and a bit cramped for space.

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless, there is
a joyful spirit at the RTO,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers there
enjoy working with one another.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The use of technology plays a major role
in caring for the work at Bethel

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:09.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in communicating

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the branch territory.

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was well-illustrated
when giving a special talk

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all congregations in Scandinavia.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk was streamed
to congregations as far away

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:23.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the north of Norway,
to the south and the Faroe Islands,

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:25.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as to Greenland.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All throughout Scandinavia,
the brothers came together

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear and see the talk

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sing Out Joyfully to Jehovah.”

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:35.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise in Finland,

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when visiting that country,
I gave the same talk.

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It too was streamed to Kingdom Halls
all throughout their territory,

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the former branch territories
of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:50.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These three branches had been merged
with Finland in recent times.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The former branch facilities
in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:58.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being well used as RTOs

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hold classes
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the School for Circuit Overseers
and Their Wives.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both branch facilities underwent
some renovations to convert

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their former printeries into office space

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a comfortable family lounge.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This space also provides a place
for historical museums

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where tours can visit
and learn about the history

00:05:19.464 --> 00:05:22.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Kingdom work in these lands.

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While visiting these branches,

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered how those who had served
for a number of years

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:30.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their respective Branch Committees
felt about the mergers.

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:34.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The comments I received
showed a tremendous depth

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of spirituality and faith in Jehovah

00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the direction he provides
through his organization.

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:43.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider Brother Lars-Erik Eriksson.

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:47.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He served on the Branch Committee
in Sweden for 14 years.

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he feel when the Governing Body
informed the branch about the merger?

00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:55.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In one way, it came as a surprise for us.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.419 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in another way, it was not

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—because the merging of branches

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:03.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had already started
in other parts of the world.

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:07.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember that we brothers

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:11.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the former Swedish Branch Committee joked

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that if something
will take place in Scandinavia,

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new branch office
will be located in Sweden.

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:20.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also thought

00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only Norway and Sweden

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be merged
—but not so.

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother
from the former Norwegian Branch Committee

00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called me,
and he couldn’t understand

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:38.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why the new branch
should be located in Denmark.

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:42.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that you already have
the needed space in Sweden

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—rooms and other things—

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Denmark is small in comparison.

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to admit, I was surprised too.

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:54.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned an important lesson

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:58.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘Jehovah’s ways are not our ways,

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:01.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his ways are higher than our ways.’

00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:05.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything turned out very well.

00:07:05.612 --> 00:07:07.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right from the beginning,

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:11.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has been
a wonderful cooperation in the family.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we work together in peace and unity.

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:19.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few times, especially in the beginning,

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:24.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we reminded each other
that it is not a Danish branch,

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is not a Norwegian branch
or a Swedish branch,

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is a Scandinavian branch office.

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar vein,
consider what Brother Jouni Palmu,

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:39.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Finland Branch Committee,
noted about their merger:

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:44.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Combining different countries,

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:46.194 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
cultures, and languages

under one branch office

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:53.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seemed impossible five years ago
when this project started.

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:56.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we were confident

00:07:56.955 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if the Governing Body
had started such a project,

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our task was to figure out

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:03.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to make it work well.

00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started working,
and we can see that Jehovah

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has blessed this project.

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can now see how Jehovah’s people

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:15.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a united group
and how we are like a big family

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a territory that covers several countries.

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has also made us confident of the fact

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:27.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we are already a united, fine people,

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:30.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the new world comes,

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:34.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are prepared to live there
and receive more blessings.

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:37.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This project has clearly shown us

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Kingdom rules

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Governing Body
is under Christ’s direction.

00:08:47.923 --> 00:08:51.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During my visit, it was common
to hear comments from Bethelites

00:08:51.593 --> 00:08:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those working hard in the field

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the mergers were the best thing
that could have happened.

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been
a spiritually enriching experience for all.

00:08:59.976 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has strengthened their faith in Jehovah

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:05.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has increased their love
for their brothers.

00:09:05.357 --> 00:09:08.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along this line,
consider what Brother Teemu Konsti,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member 
of the Finland Branch Committee, said:

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:14.366 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, a great spiritual blessing

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:16.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been that this merger

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:18.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has brought us closer as a brotherhood.

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:20.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter once asked Jesus

00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:24.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the reward would be
for following Jesus Christ,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus answered: “everlasting life.”

00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:31.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in this period of time,
the reward is ‘brothers and sisters

00:09:31.383 --> 00:09:34.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fathers and mothers,’
spiritually speaking.

00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:36.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after this merger,

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:41.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have gained so many brothers and sisters
and fathers and mothers.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have been richly rewarded.

00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:48.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our trip to these branches
was truly faith-strengthening.

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a joy to see
that despite the challenges

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:54.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from a human standpoint
are insurmountable,

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:57.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s help
our brothers joyfully overcame them

00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:59.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are united in doing God’s will.

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:03.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of such unity,
Jehovah has opened the door

00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for large numbers of immigrants and refugees

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that speak a variety of languages.

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, the brotherhood
in both Scandinavia and Finland

00:10:12.132 --> 00:10:15.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has become quite diverse
in languages as well as cultures.

00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:19.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it was truly a delight

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:22.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see our brothers
“dwelling together in unity.”

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:26.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where we went,
all the brothers

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:30.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted you to be sure
of their warm love and brotherly affection.

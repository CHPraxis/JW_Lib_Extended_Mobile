My mother always said,

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah did not intend
for all of us to look alike.”

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those early days,

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would work every house in the county

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—black families, white families, any color.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At school, there was pressure there

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be involved with the racial activity.

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would hear
about the problems and the issues.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be in the news,
and you would know

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was going on in the South.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.619 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some may wonder,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘How is it that our people,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that is, Jehovah’s Witnesses,
black and white,

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘could maintain such unity

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the world around them
was falling apart?’

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:15.846 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I grew up in central New York

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.848 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—Utica, New York.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
in the <i>Kingdom Ministry</i><i> </i><i> </i>back in 1956,

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were articles
about serving where the need is great.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed some of the black friends
to serve in the South.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I married my husband, Earl McGee, 

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:35.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on June 2, 1956.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were married,
Brother T. J. Sullivan gave a talk

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:44.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Hallandale convention
on serving where the need is greater.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged not only families but,

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, newly married couples.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we planned for it,
and he wrote the branch.

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned to Florida,

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in 1962,
we started in the circuit work.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our first circuit was in Alabama,

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was not integrated.

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.776 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We served together, Edna and I did,

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the pioneer work by assignment.

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last assignment was
the Society assigning us

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to North Carolina and then
from there to the circuit work.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the first circuit,
which was in the Carolinas and Georgia,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were assigned to Gilead.

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:37.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I got married on April 23, 1949.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been in full-time service

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 years with my wife.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Circuit 18 in Alabama.

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first circuit assignment
was in Mississippi.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had the reputation

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the worst state
in the Union for race relations.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after we got there,
there were three civil rights workers

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was our circuit.

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:13.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those were the things we had to deal with.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were busy in our ministry,

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it didn’t bother us very much.

00:03:21.263 --> 00:03:24.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The black worked the black,
and the white worked the white.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:31.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we just obeyed the customary law
of staying segregated.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lots of movements were happening,
and people were, you know, very hostile.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When there was a march or any tension

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we were serving there in Alabama,

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t go
to the town on Saturday afternoon

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do street witnessing
because if there was a rally

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something going on,
we would just stay in the neighborhood.

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:58.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot were what they
used to call back then Freedom Riders,

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people getting on buses going south,

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people coming in to register voters.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is,
some of the civil rights organizations

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:09.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were set up in Mississippi
and going pretty strong.

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as a result, they would think

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that because we were active
in going door to door,

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could just incorporate civil rights issues

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that into our work.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our classmates in the 27th class

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a black brother, a fellow student,

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:29.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we became very close friends there.

00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we left Gilead,
we were going to our assignments

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:36.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we stopped at a convention in Alabama.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the convention was segregated

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one race on one side
and one race on another.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was very difficult
—painful—

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us not to be able
to closely associate with our dear friend.

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had this talk show on the television.

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer and I went
and also a Catholic priest

00:04:58.527 --> 00:05:00.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an Episcopal minister.

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Episcopal minister, a young minister,

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:06.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked what were we doing
about the marching.

00:05:06.243 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told him that we weren’t doing
anything about the marching.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that showed a contrast.

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m black, and he’s white.

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:17.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t stopping
their marching to help us preach

00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:20.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good news of the Kingdom,
so we weren’t going to stop

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching the good news
of the Kingdom to help them march.

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:29.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers always
were interested in each other.

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:34.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if there was a black congregation
and a white congregation,

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had interest and fellow feeling for both.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rule was we were not to meet together,
and we couldn’t meet together.

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we could talk to one another,
and we could visit one another.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I think there was
great support on both sides,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
black and white brothers, back in those days.

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had a problem
getting a facility, for example,

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:59.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d have contacts
and they could get certain things done.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, basically, we worked together.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation started integrating

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after certain civil rights laws were passed.

00:06:10.265 --> 00:06:14.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a big meeting of all the elders,

00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we worked out the territory assignments

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whatever else was necessary

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have integrated congregations.

00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:25.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some friends would feel,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe rightly so at the time,

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:32.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
some violence if we integrated.

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:35.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There probably were
some Kingdom Halls damaged

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that as a result.

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:39.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is,

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:42.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was integration
going on in other places

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in the schools and things like that
and in the universities and colleges.

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:50.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it was obvious that if they
could do it, then we even more so.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The process of integration

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:55.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was successful

00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was under Jehovah’s direction.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both black and white,

00:07:01.817 --> 00:07:04.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had the same thing in common:

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Jehovah.

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite us,

00:07:09.658 --> 00:07:14.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah got it done for us
and brought us together.

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:18.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have been unified ever since.

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone could see that we were united.

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother was working from door to door,

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
black and white, and a lady
came to the door (white),

00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:32.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said she was happy

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:36.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see this unity take place.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had looked forward to it for a long time.

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:43.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have formed, with Jehovah’s help

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his holy spirit,

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:48.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a worldwide brotherhood.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Granted, they have their imperfections,

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is a brotherhood

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something to be truly marveled at.

00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers began to feel

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we knew was true:

00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all one organization.

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:07.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began to feel it.

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:09.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began to experience it.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Jehovah,
and we loved our brothers,

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so there you have it.

00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:19.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could you fail to have unity

00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:23.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah had drawn you together?

00:08:24.983 --> 00:08:28.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is the prime one to divide people.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for the whole world of mankind,

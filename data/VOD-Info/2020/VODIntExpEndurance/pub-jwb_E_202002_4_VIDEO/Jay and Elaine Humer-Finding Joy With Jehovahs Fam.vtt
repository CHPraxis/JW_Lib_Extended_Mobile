Full-time service
is a special way to serve Jehovah

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:07.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a joyful heart.

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happens to your joy
when you suddenly face a serious trial?

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jay and Elaine Humer,
you have been through this.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being here today

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:21.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share your personal experience with us.

00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve enjoyed
full-time service for over 40 years,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of those years in the traveling work.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’ve had
the wonderful privilege of both pioneering

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serving
in the traveling work for 30 years now.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we really feel that Jehovah has been
very kind to allow us to serve him this way.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember
when I first filled out my application

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for regular pioneering back in 1972,

00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought this was my gift
to Jehovah—my sacrifice.

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after the many years

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blessings and the privileges

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah helped us
through some very difficult times,

00:00:56.106 --> 00:01:00.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I thought was my gift to Jehovah
turned out to be his gift to me.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is very encouraging.
Thank you.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you mentioned “difficult times.”

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there anything
in particular you can think of?

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the hardest things
that we faced was about 20 years ago

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:15.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we experienced
seven deaths in just a six-month period.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:20.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really was difficult because five
of those seven were family members.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jay’s father died,

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:26.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my aunt Alma (who brought me
into the truth) died, and my father died.

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:30.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it just seemed
like one layer on top of another.

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hardly imagine how you must have felt.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after such a Job-like experience,

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you do in order
to regain your joy and happiness?

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it didn’t occur automatically.

00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept focused, of course,
on serving the friends

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and working with them,
and that kept our thoughts

00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from constantly circling around our losses.

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:52.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also thought about the resurrection.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We focused on the resurrection hope

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as we did,
it became like “the helmet of salvation,”

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protecting our hearts and our thoughts
from the grief that we were going through.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course,
we shared our hope with others,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped us to have it more
deeply engraved on our own hearts as well.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:09.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, may we learn
from you what you did in practical terms?

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most difficult of all
was about four years after that

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when our beloved nephew Christopher

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was killed
in an auto accident at the age of 17.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:28.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his parents
had lived with us in the same house

00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a number of years
before we went on the road.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:32.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we always looked
at Christopher like the son

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would never
have on this side of Armageddon.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his death was particularly tragic.

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was excruciating for all of our
family members, especially his parents.

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christopher was on his way
to the Kingdom Hall

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet his papa
and his grandmother for field service,

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his car hit a patch of ice
and slid into an oncoming car.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died instantly.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was so difficult for us.

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts were broken,
and our spirits were nearly crushed.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It actually rendered me speechless,

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to beg for the “groanings
unuttered” became very difficult.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t speak to Jehovah for three days,

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was listening.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean by “listening”?

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:20.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when we were
all together as a family,

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sister just happened to say
that Christopher had been cremated.

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were there
making arrangements for the funeral,

00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:30.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just hit me so hard.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just—it just hit hard enough

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I fell down, and I just cried.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid there on the floor, and I thought,

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps, maybe Mary
felt this way when she said:

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Lord, if you’d only been here
this wouldn’t have happened.’

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I laid there,
I could hear my sister say:

00:03:50.113 --> 00:03:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go get her Bible.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read her her favorite scripture.”

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:54.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jay did.

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:59.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned to Psalm 91,
a psalm that I had already memorized,

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I began to hear Jehovah’s voice.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was this listening
to Jehovah a onetime occurrence?

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, by no means.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really had to now do my research.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I searched
for every article on the resurrection,

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I searched for every scripture on comfort,

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I meditated on the artwork
—the pictures in the publications.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one particular scripture
that really touched my heart.

00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was from Psalm 56:8.

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there it said:
“You keep track of my wandering.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they not recorded in your book?”

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:43.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about Jehovah
taking such notice of us

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—keeping track, watching over,
even collecting every tear

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and recording each of them.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly made me draw close to Jehovah.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you continued to listen to Jehovah

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by looking at comforting material
from the publications.

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there any
specific article you thought of?

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:05.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was an article.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about a delicate flower

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:10.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been bent over after a rainstorm

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the kind of cloudburst that would
send humans and animals running for shelter,

00:05:15.164 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not this flower.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it was intact,

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bent over but unbroken and still rooted.

00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about us in that same way.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article said that we can no more
avoid losing a loved one

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than this flower could
uproot itself and run for cover.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to endure.

00:05:35.852 --> 00:05:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the article spoke
a great deal about hope and about faith.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is our anchor, and hope
is our preserver of our spirituality.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:49.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And faith
—James 1:3 stated there that faith—

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it succeeds, we’re able to endure.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s exactly what happened.

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It softened the grief.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:00.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so like this flower,
we too would stand up and smile one day.

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:02.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we did.

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember the first time I smiled inside,
and I thought,

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, Jehovah,
you truly are a healer of hearts.’

00:06:10.686 --> 00:06:12.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you do something else?

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:17.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I started looking
for some of the artwork in the publications.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one particular picture
I found was of a shepherd

00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had gone into
a bramble bush and rescued a lamb.

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:26.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was lost.

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pulled him out, threw him
over his shoulders, and held onto him.

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:34.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought, ‘What a safe place to be
—such security!’

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to take the picture

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to print it out
and just enlarge it a little bit.

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I didn’t see
on the publication page,

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw when I enlarged it, and there
were scratches on the shepherd’s face.

00:06:49.225 --> 00:06:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about what
that shepherd had gone through

00:06:51.794 --> 00:06:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go in the bramble bush and pull him out.

00:06:54.363 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, I thought about Jehovah
as our Great Shepherd

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lengths that he
went through to rescue us,

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:04.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even at the cost of pain for himself.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I was listening and drawing close,
back to Jehovah.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what did you do
with these articles and the pictures?

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now I decided to print them all out

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:20.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the articles, the pictures,
and the scriptures—

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I displayed them
on my desk for quite some time.

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I put them
in a big envelope (or like a file),

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought that was
Jehovah’s sympathy card to me.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that we had to do something
so as not to be swept away by our grief.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that grief is an arduous
journey, but one that we cannot avoid.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a place where we live
but a passage, as it were.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that even though grief
never goes away, it does change over time.

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:50.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s because Jehovah
made our hearts to heal.

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, in time, that’s what we did.

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we sure did.

00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about the lack of faith;
it’s simply the price of love.

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:00.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Christopher, and we miss him.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t like we were leaving him behind.

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes that’s how you feel
when you lose a loved one.

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:09.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, we know
that Christopher is in Jehovah’s memory.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the righteous God,
Jehovah never forgets his loyal ones.

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christopher was one of them.

00:08:14.477 --> 00:08:17.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re confident
that we’re going to see him again.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what
helps us not to be, as it were,

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always looking in the rearview mirror

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but looking ahead to the time
when we will be with him in Paradise.

00:08:27.323 --> 00:08:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Jehovah truly kept his promises,
and he carried us through that storm.

00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gathered up the pieces
of our broken hearts and sealed them.

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though this happened 17 years ago,

00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sure, we still have cracks in our hearts.

00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:46.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know for a certainty
that those one day will disappear as well

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Paradise
when we welcome him back home.

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, Jehovah
truly proved to be my stronghold,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Father, and my Friend in a profound way.

00:08:57.753 --> 00:09:02.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that Jehovah truly does
love us, cares for us, and protects us.

00:09:02.758 --> 00:09:05.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because he is such a good Father,

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy has come back
and we have had such a rich life.

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:13.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in all the years that we’ve had
the privilege of serving our God,

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:15.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve always found
that no matter what we give Jehovah,

00:09:15.371 --> 00:09:19.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what sacrifices
we make for him, he always gives us more.

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cannot out generous
the most generous Person in the universe.

00:09:23.613 --> 00:09:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, just as he has
blessed us all these many years,

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are confident
that he will continue to bless us

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we transition to our next assignment.

00:09:32.388 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for sharing
your personal experiences with us.

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah
continue to be with the two of you

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you now continue
your full-time service as special pioneers.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may you be able to apply
the principles that you have just mentioned

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Jehovah
can continue to “guard your hearts.”

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

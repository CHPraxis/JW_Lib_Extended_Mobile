For  the last 45 years,
I’ve been in the pioneer work,

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveling work,

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Bethel here
for a number of years.

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My health was very good

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never had any problems at all.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I had a headache.

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was severe.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really couldn’t see clearly—anything.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We went to the Bethel doctor,
and he referred us to a specialist,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the specialist
gave us the diagnosis

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a very aggressive brain tumor
called glioblastoma.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, after surgery, he had radiation

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and chemotherapy at the same time.

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A year later, he had to have another surgery.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now he is on his fourth type

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of chemotherapy treatment.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first time that he got sick,
the hardest thing

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to see my husband
become increasingly dependent

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:28.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon me and upon other people.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want this

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to define who we are.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers played a pivotal role

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tried to help us.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother found out
that I had to go in for surgery.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me a scripture,

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we prayed together.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll always remember that.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a beautiful example.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also get a lot
of encouragement from Sara,

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we go out in service,
I’ve gotten the opportunity

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:13.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help people

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:15.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just talk to them
and encourage them.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my Bethel assignment

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Service Department,
I have a brother or two

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:29.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will come over and review a case

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re considering,
and I get a lot of joy in that way.

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very thankful that I
can still do a little something

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:41.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me,

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:48.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’s been humble
through this whole thing, it’s been easier.

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My hope is strong, and I’m going to keep

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on going this way
and serve Jehovah

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on into the new world
or whatever comes.

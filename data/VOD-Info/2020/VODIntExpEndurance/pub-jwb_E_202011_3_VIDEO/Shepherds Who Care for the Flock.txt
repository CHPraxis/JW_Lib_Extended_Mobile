00:00:01 Everything was going fine in my marriage
00:00:04 —or so I thought.
00:00:06 My ex-husband was disfellowshipped,
00:00:10 left home
00:00:12 and, in less than a month, we divorced.
00:00:19 Right after the divorce, I had to figure out
00:00:21 how I would provide for the girls,
00:00:28 so I began working as a cleaner.
00:00:32 I also had to provide for them spiritually.
00:00:38 But many times, because of discouragement and tiredness,
00:00:42 I couldn’t be there for them as much as they needed me to be.
00:00:48 Besides all of this,
00:00:50 I also had to deal with very negative feelings.
00:00:54 It was a very difficult time in my life.
00:01:06 I had never been so sick.
00:01:08 I couldn’t even get up to go to the hospital.
00:01:14 To cope with this problem, I just kept praying.
00:01:18 I was not able to walk, and I was not able to get to the meetings.
00:01:25 The elders realized that I was missing from the meetings.
00:01:34 The elders quickly came to my aid.
00:01:39 I remember that one of the things
00:01:42 that touched me the most
00:01:44 was when the elders read a scripture.
00:01:48 Psalm 139:3:
00:01:52 “You observe me when I travel and when I lie down;
00:01:56 you are familiar with all my ways.”
00:01:59 I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.
00:02:03 It was as if Jehovah was healing me.
00:02:06 I now knew that Jehovah was interested in me
00:02:10 and that he was looking after me.
00:02:12 He was making sure that I knew it.
00:02:15 Something else that I remember fondly
00:02:18 was after a meeting at the Kingdom Hall.
00:02:21 One of the elders gave me some scriptures to read at home
00:02:25 and said that if we needed any help,
00:02:28 the elders were there for us.
00:02:33 Two elders lovingly came to see me,
00:02:36 because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.
00:02:41 I live very far from the Kingdom Hall.
00:02:44 But the brothers made the sacrifice to get public transport,
00:02:47 get off at the main road,
00:02:49 and from there they walked 40 minutes
00:02:52 to reach my house.
00:02:54 I don’t know what I would have done.
00:02:58 When the elders arrived, they listened to me,
00:03:02 they cried with me, and they read the Bible with me.
00:03:08 Jehovah loves me.
00:03:11 When I started to feel better,
00:03:14 I went back to the group.
00:03:17 I was really happy to be back with my brothers.
00:03:25 Now, after all the help we have received, we are doing well.
00:03:31 The congregation is our second home, and we feel very good there.
00:03:37 Everything I have today, I owe to the brothers and sisters,
00:03:41 especially the elders.
00:03:44 I see shepherding calls as a very evident way
00:03:48 in which Jehovah demonstrates his full love for us.
00:03:53 I understand that at times
00:03:55 these visits might be a challenge for the elders,
00:03:59 but the results are really good.
00:04:01 Without a doubt, they can see that all the work
00:04:04 and all the effort is worthwhile.
00:04:07 I will never forget the help that I received from the elders.
00:04:11 This situation taught me that Jehovah will not let his sheep get lost,
00:04:15 not even one.
00:04:17 Jeremiah 23:4 says:
00:04:20 “‘And I will raise up over them shepherds
00:04:22 “‘who will really shepherd them.
00:04:24 “‘They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,
00:04:28 and none will be missing,’ declares Jehovah.”

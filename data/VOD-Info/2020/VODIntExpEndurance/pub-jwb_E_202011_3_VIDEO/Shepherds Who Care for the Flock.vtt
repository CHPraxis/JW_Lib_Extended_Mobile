Everything was going fine in my marriage

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—or so I thought.

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My ex-husband was disfellowshipped,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
left home

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in less than a month,
we divorced.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after the divorce,
I had to figure out

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would provide for the girls,

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I began working as a cleaner.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to provide for them spiritually.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many times,
because of discouragement and tiredness,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t be there for them
as much as they needed me to be.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides all of this,

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to deal
with very negative feelings.

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very difficult time in my life.

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:08.380 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had never been so sick.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even get up to go to the hospital.

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To cope with this problem,
I just kept praying.

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not able to walk,
and I was not able to get to the meetings.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders realized
that I was missing from the meetings.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders quickly came to my aid.

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:42.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that one of the things

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched me the most

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when the elders read a scripture.

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:51.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 139:3:

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You observe me when I travel
and when I lie down;

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are familiar with all my ways.”

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah was healing me.

00:02:06.647 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now knew that Jehovah
was interested in me

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was looking after me.

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was making sure that I knew it.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else that I remember fondly

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was after a meeting at the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the elders gave me
some scriptures to read at home

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that if we needed any help,

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders were there for us.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two elders lovingly came to see me,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live very far from the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers made the sacrifice
to get public transport,

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get off at the main road,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from there they walked 40 minutes

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach my house.

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what I would have done.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the elders arrived,
they listened to me,

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they cried with me,
and they read the Bible with me.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves me.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started to feel better,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back to the group.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy
to be back with my brothers.

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:29.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after all the help we have received,
we are doing well.

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation is our second home,
and we feel very good there.

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I have today,
I owe to the brothers and sisters,

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the elders.

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see shepherding calls
as a very evident way

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:52.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which Jehovah demonstrates
his full love for us.

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that at times

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these visits might be
a challenge for the elders,

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the results are really good.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt,
they can see that all the work

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the effort is worthwhile.

00:04:07.643 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will never forget the help
that I received from the elders.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This situation taught me that Jehovah
will not let his sheep get lost,

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even one.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:20.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 23:4 says:

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will raise up over them shepherds

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who will really shepherd them.

00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and none will be missing,’ declares Jehovah.”

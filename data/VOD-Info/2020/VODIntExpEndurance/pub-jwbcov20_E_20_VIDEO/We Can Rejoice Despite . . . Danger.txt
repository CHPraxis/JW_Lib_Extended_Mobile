00:00:14 I was born in Caracas and live
00:00:16 in an area of the city called Petare.
00:00:18 In Petare, I have to live
00:00:20 with violence and delinquency.
00:00:23 A few years ago, we lost a pioneer sister who,
00:00:26 sadly, was hit by a bullet.
00:00:29 Well, something like that also happened to my son.
00:00:34 There was a confrontation
00:00:36 in the neighborhood, and a stray bullet hit my son
00:00:39 and killed him instantly.
00:00:47 That left such a void.
00:00:50 It hurt me to go into his room and see his empty bed.
00:00:53 And then to see his things:
00:00:55 his shoes, his favorite clothes.
00:00:58 To see them in the wardrobe—
00:01:00 Crying was inevitable.
00:01:04 These situations were very difficult  to deal with at the time.
00:01:12 But as soon as the congregation
00:01:13 found out about the situation,
00:01:16 right away they gave me support.
00:01:19 They were there to help care for all the things you need to do
00:01:22 when you lose a loved one.
00:01:27 After going through all that, I was very afraid
00:01:30 to continue going out in field service.
00:01:32 I feared for my life
00:01:34 and for the life of my family.
00:01:38 I prayed to Jehovah,
00:01:39 and Jehovah gave me practical wisdom to continue.
00:01:46 Sometimes when I’m alone meditating and thinking about my son,
00:01:51 those memories return and, of course, I have a setback,
00:01:56 so to speak,
00:01:58 and I begin to cry again.
00:02:01 But keeping clearly in mind the promise of the resurrection
00:02:04 is what motivates me to keep going.
00:02:11 An account that I really like
00:02:13 and that I always keep in mind is the account about Lazarus.
00:02:17 There, Martha uses an expression.
00:02:20 She says, ‘I know he’ll rise on the last day.’
00:02:24 And that is the same confidence that I have in Jehovah.
00:02:27 I know that my son will rise.
00:02:29 Jehovah will give him to me.
00:02:35 At the time that this terrible thing happened,
00:02:39 it’s true that I lost my joy for a time.
00:02:46 But later after the mourning passes,
00:02:48 the resurrection hope gives us joy.
00:02:50 It’s as if
00:02:52 Jehovah speaks to me, saying, ‘Keep calm.’
00:02:54 It’s as if he gives me a gentle pat,
00:02:57 telling me to ‘keep going and that’s what will happen to you.
00:03:00 Keep faithful, and continue loyal, and I will give him back to you.’

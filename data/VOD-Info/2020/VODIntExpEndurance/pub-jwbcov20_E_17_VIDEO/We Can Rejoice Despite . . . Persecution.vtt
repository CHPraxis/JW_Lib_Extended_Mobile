Early one morning,
armed Russian special forces

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broke into my home.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They handcuffed me
and searched my place.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.211 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They took me

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two days later, the court sentenced
me to pretrial detention.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared because I didn’t know

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would be treated in prison.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:43.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Threatening that things would get
worse for me, the officer demanded

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I incriminate myself, admit guilt,
and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so hard without her.

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For two months, I didn’t have

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any spiritual food or a Bible,

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided to make one.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife sent me a notebook,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every day I wrote down verses

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was able to remember.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I had written about 500 verses,

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was given a Bible.

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:17.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so spiritually hungry,
I read it through in four months.

00:01:17.348 --> 00:01:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this time,
I wrote letters

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my wife and friends
and shared interesting things

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I learned from my reading.

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the letters I received

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from my friends and my dear wife
gave me the feeling

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers and sisters
were so close to me,

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t lonely.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if my friends
were right there with me.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pretrial detention
isolates a person from society.

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s impossible to isolate
someone from Jehovah.

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the day,
I prayed to Jehovah many times,

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I especially waited for bedtime.

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When everyone was in bed
and only the night-light was on,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:04.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when I was all alone

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the cell and, of course,
I took advantage of the situation.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would get down on my knees
and would literally cry

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to write my requests to God

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:22.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a sheet of paper and then mark off
the ones that he answered.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced that Jehovah
was very close to me.

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also quietly sang our songs

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the day.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I was all alone,
I sang at the top of my voice.

00:02:35.884 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to give
a witness whenever possible.

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discussed a variety of topics

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything from tattoos
to “the king of the north.”

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All my fears
and anxieties were for nothing.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in detention 343 days,

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “not even a hair” fell from my head.

00:02:56.321 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the most interesting
year of my life

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an excellent school
to help refine my spiritual qualities.

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a great honor
to uphold God’s sovereignty in this way!

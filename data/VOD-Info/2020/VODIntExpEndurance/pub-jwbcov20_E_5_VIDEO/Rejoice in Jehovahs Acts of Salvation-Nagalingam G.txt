00:00:01 Because of the civil war,
00:00:03 we had to take refuge
00:00:04 in a safer part of the country.
00:00:06 When we arrived,
00:00:08 soldiers took us to internment camps to hold us
00:00:11 until they could confirm our identities.
00:00:13 In the camps, we lived in tents,
00:00:16 and it was unbearably hot in them.
00:00:19 It was a struggle even to get water.
00:00:23 We needed to wait in a queue for four to five hours every day.
00:00:29 During the war, our eldest son was killed.
00:00:32 It was a big loss for our family.
00:00:36 All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah
00:00:39 and find comfort in the Bible.
00:00:43 One day, the brothers from the relief committee came
00:00:46 and informed us that a regional convention would be held.
00:00:49 They had spoken to the camp officials, requesting permission for us to go.
00:00:55 For four days, morning and evening,
00:00:58 we went to the officials to ask for permission.
00:01:00 But they would not tell us if we would be released for the convention.
00:01:05 Suddenly one afternoon, much to our surprise,
00:01:08 we were approved to leave the camp for five days.
00:01:11 At that time, we had been in the internment camp for months.
00:01:14 We had not been allowed to go anywhere.
00:01:18 We were so happy that we got the permission to attend the convention.
00:01:21 We never expected it!
00:01:25 At the time, we had some clothes.
00:01:27 But we had nothing for the three-day convention.
00:01:31 However, the brothers outside the camp helped us enormously.
00:01:35 They were with us and cared for all our needs
00:01:39 so we could be ready for the convention.
00:01:43 We still wondered where we were going to stay
00:01:46 and how we would get our accommodations.
00:01:50 However, when we arrived,
00:01:52 the brothers hugged us and warmly welcomed us.
00:01:55 We were really encouraged.
00:01:59 Even though we faced many challenges and difficulties
00:02:02 in the internment camp,
00:02:04 that convention was like a nourishing meal for us.
00:02:06 It was a real joy eating at Jehovah’s table.
00:02:11 We can never forget those moments.
00:02:15 After the convention, a brother from the Governing Body
00:02:18 gave a special talk to those from the internment camps.
00:02:21 That talk really strengthened us.
00:02:26 The convention helped us to be courageous,
00:02:28 especially after we returned to the camp.
00:02:31 Although we faced many losses,
00:02:34 the convention not only gave us comfort
00:02:36 but also helped us to face the challenges ahead.
00:02:41 Now my youngest son and I are serving as ministerial servants,
00:02:45 and my wife has been serving as a regular pioneer
00:02:48 for the past 17 years.
00:02:50 She continued pioneering even while we were in the internment camp.
00:02:54 We realized that Jehovah is always there,
00:02:58 caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

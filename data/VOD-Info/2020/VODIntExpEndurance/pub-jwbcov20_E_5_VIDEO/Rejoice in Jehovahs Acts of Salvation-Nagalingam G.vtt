Because of the civil war,

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:04.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to take refuge

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a safer part of the country.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we arrived,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soldiers took us
to internment camps to hold us

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they could confirm our identities.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the camps, we lived in tents,

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was unbearably hot in them.

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle even to get water.

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to wait in a queue
for four to five hours every day.

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the war, our eldest son was killed.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big loss for our family.

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we could do to cope was pray to Jehovah

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find comfort in the Bible.

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, the brothers
from the relief committee came

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and informed us
that a regional convention would be held.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had spoken to the camp officials,
requesting permission for us to go.

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For four days, morning and evening,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we went to the officials
to ask for permission.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they would not tell us if we
would be released for the convention.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly one afternoon,
much to our surprise,

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were approved
to leave the camp for five days.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, we had been
in the internment camp for months.

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had not been allowed to go anywhere.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so happy that we got the permission
to attend the convention.

00:01:21.644 --> 00:01:23.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never expected it!

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time, we had some clothes.

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we had nothing
for the three-day convention.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the brothers outside the camp
helped us enormously.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were with us
and cared for all our needs

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could be ready for the convention.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still wondered
where we were going to stay

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we would get
our accommodations.

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when we arrived,

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers hugged us
and warmly welcomed us.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really encouraged.

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:02.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though we faced
many challenges and difficulties

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the internment camp,

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that convention
was like a nourishing meal for us.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real joy eating at Jehovah’s table.

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can never forget those moments.

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the convention,
a brother from the Governing Body

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave a special talk to those
from the internment camps.

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That talk really strengthened us.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention helped us to be courageous,

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after we returned to the camp.

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we faced many losses,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the convention not only gave us comfort

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also helped us to face
the challenges ahead.

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now my youngest son and I
are serving as ministerial servants,

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife has been serving
as a regular pioneer

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the past 17 years.

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She continued pioneering even while
we were in the internment camp.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that Jehovah is always there,

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for us and sustaining us continuously.

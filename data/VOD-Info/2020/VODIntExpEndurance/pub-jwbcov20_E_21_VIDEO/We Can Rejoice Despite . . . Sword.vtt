When everything falls apart

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when everything
around you is chaotic,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Baite Michael Dugbe.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1980.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in Monrovia

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the war was an amazing time.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:37.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had wonderful parents.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up in a nice house,
and we went to a great school.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
everything changed overnight.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were reports of rebels

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to take over the government.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:56.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those reports alone

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made people panic.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Businesses started to close down.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Services were shut down

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lights, the power, the water—
everything stopped.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next few years were really unstable.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

00:01:17.473 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was all-out war.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the rebels were in the city.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of looting going on.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a lot of shooting.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rebels—they were known for torture

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if people would not agree to fight with them.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a situation like that,

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a lot of fear;
there’s a lot of panic.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when your fear level rises,

00:01:49.505 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best way to deal with it is prayer
—prayer to Jehovah,

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him specifically for direction

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what to do next.

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the fighting escalated

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it got closer to where we lived,
it was no longer safe.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to flee,
and we ended up at the branch office.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers were very loving;
they took really good care of us.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual activities

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they made sure we kept up with that.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back,
I’m very grateful to have survived.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things helped us get through.

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the only thing that keeps you stable.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, also, we were able to survive

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the help
from the brothers and sisters.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those moments of trial
—that’s when you really realize

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much you need the brotherhood.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot of joy
in my assignment at Bethel

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Audio/Video Services.

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the brothers and sisters
that I work with.

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all thanks to Jehovah

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I am alive and that I get
to serve him every day.

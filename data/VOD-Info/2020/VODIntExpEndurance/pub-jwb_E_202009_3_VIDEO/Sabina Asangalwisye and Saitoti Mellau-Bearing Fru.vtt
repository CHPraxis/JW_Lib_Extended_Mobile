00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:03.941 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to help the deaf

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:06.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that they too can know Jehovah.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to move
to a sign-language territory:

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sign-language group in Dar es Salaam.

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to travel by bus,
and sometimes we traveled far

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(stuck in a traffic jam
for two to three hours),

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was expensive.

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still remember my early days in service

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the sign-language group.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very inexperienced with the language,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one day, my service partner
asked me to conduct her Bible study.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I tried to talk
to the student, argh, she didn’t understand.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I kept trying, she became
more and more frustrated with me,

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started to feel discouraged.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to help, but I was powerless.

00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt bad.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told myself: ‘I still don’t know the deaf.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I still don’t know sign language.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why has Jehovah brought me into this field

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which I am not able to help the deaf?’

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was invited
to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2014, from September to November.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After graduating, I received
an assignment in sign language again.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah truly helped me so much.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was exactly
the encouragement I needed to persevere

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in learning the language
and becoming more effective in my assignment.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to conduct my own Bible studies,

00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they could really understand me now.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we started,
there were two baptized deaf publishers,

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now there are over ten.

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the opportunity to help
three deaf people to make progress,

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate themselves to Jehovah,
and to get baptized.

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:58.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The training I received at the school
is still helping me now

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my new assignment
at the translation office,

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I serve together with my husband.

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are joyful because we know
that through this work,

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many deaf people
will receive publications in their language

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this will bring about
an increase in this territory.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.368 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I graduated from the School

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:22.955 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was a privilege
to receive the assignment

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go help the Maasai
to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Traveling is difficult.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I travel by vehicle,

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes there are areas
in which there are no vehicles,

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’m forced to walk.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach many more people.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still, transportation
is a difficult part of it:

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are valleys, there are mountains,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are uphills, there are downhills.

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:03.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So transportation is difficult.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally reached the territory,

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to find the Maasai.

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was apprehensive about their reaction

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I know their culture;

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t know Jehovah.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wondered what would happen
when I reached their territory.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that stressful time,

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah;

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read his Word, the Bible;

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I meditated on accounts of our brothers
and sisters mentioned in the Bible;

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to return to them,

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make return visits, and start Bible studies.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:45.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the results have been good.

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:47.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am happy

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:50.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that after starting studies,

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some started taking steps
and attending meetings.

00:03:53.462 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They later made good progress,

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now some of them
are our brothers and sisters.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:03.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They dedicated themselves and were baptized.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel so much joy.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:08.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given me
the strength and the ability

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be used to further the preaching
of the good news

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help the Maasai spiritually.

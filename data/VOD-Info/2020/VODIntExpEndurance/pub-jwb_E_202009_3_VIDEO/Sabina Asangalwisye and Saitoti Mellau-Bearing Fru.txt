00:00:01 I wanted to help the deaf
00:00:03 so that they too can know Jehovah.
00:00:06 So I decided to move to a sign-language territory:
00:00:10 the sign-language group in Dar es Salaam.
00:00:14 We had to travel by bus, and sometimes we traveled far
00:00:18 (stuck in a traffic jam for two to three hours),
00:00:21 and it was expensive.
00:00:25 I still remember my early days in service
00:00:28 with the sign-language group.
00:00:30 I was very inexperienced with the language,
00:00:32 and one day, my service partner asked me to conduct her Bible study.
00:00:38 Every time I tried to talk to the student, argh, she didn’t understand.
00:00:44 As I kept trying, she became more and more frustrated with me,
00:00:48 and I started to feel discouraged.
00:00:50 I wanted to help, but I was powerless.
00:00:56 I felt bad.
00:00:58 I told myself: ‘I still don’t know the deaf.
00:01:01 ‘I still don’t know sign language.
00:01:03 ‘Why has Jehovah brought me into this field
00:01:06 in which I am not able to help the deaf?’
00:01:11 I was invited to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers
00:01:15 in 2014, from September to November.
00:01:18 After graduating, I received an assignment in sign language again.
00:01:23 Jehovah truly helped me so much.
00:01:26 That was exactly the encouragement I needed to persevere
00:01:30 in learning the language and becoming more effective in my assignment.
00:01:34 I was able to conduct my own Bible studies,
00:01:37 and they could really understand me now.
00:01:40 When we started, there were two baptized deaf publishers,
00:01:44 but now there are over ten.
00:01:46 I’ve had the opportunity to help three deaf people to make progress,
00:01:50 to dedicate themselves to Jehovah, and to get baptized.
00:01:54 The training I received at the school is still helping me now
00:01:58 in my new assignment at the translation office,
00:02:01 where I serve together with my husband.
00:02:04 We are joyful because we know that through this work,
00:02:07 many deaf people will receive publications in their language
00:02:10 and this will bring about an increase in this territory.
00:02:17 I graduated from the School
00:02:19 for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015.
00:02:22 And it was a privilege to receive the assignment
00:02:25 to go help the Maasai to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.
00:02:32 Traveling is difficult.
00:02:35 Sometimes I travel by vehicle,
00:02:37 but sometimes there are areas in which there are no vehicles,
00:02:41 so I’m forced to walk.
00:02:44 Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle
00:02:47 to reach many more people.
00:02:51 But still, transportation is a difficult part of it:
00:02:54 there are valleys, there are mountains,
00:02:57 there are uphills, there are downhills.
00:03:00 So transportation is difficult.
00:03:03 When I finally reached the territory,
00:03:06 I was able to find the Maasai.
00:03:09 I was apprehensive about their reaction
00:03:12 because I know their culture;
00:03:14 they don’t know Jehovah.
00:03:16 So I wondered what would happen when I reached their territory.
00:03:20 During that stressful time,
00:03:23 I prayed to Jehovah;
00:03:25 I read his Word, the Bible;
00:03:29 I meditated on accounts of our brothers and sisters mentioned in the Bible;
00:03:33 and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.
00:03:37 I was able to return to them,
00:03:39 make return visits, and start Bible studies.
00:03:42 So the results have been good.
00:03:45 I am happy
00:03:47 that after starting studies,
00:03:50 some started taking steps and attending meetings.
00:03:53 They later made good progress,
00:03:55 and now some of them are our brothers and sisters.
00:03:58 They dedicated themselves and were baptized.
00:04:03 I feel so much joy.
00:04:05 Jehovah has given me the strength and the ability
00:04:08 to be used to further the preaching of the good news
00:04:11 and to help the Maasai spiritually.

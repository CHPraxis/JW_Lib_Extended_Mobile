00:00:06 I thought happiness was all about money
00:00:10 and getting to buy whatever I wanted.
00:00:19 I was really into fashion.
00:00:21 I was always thinking about what I was going to get next,
00:00:24 and I didn’t mind putting in extra overtime to get it.
00:00:32 My day ended with me taking the last train home, eating,
00:00:36 and then going to bed at one or two o’clock in the morning.
00:00:41 But this affected me mentally and physically.
00:00:44 I’d wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks.
00:00:50 I felt so lost and confused.
00:00:53 Everything I’d worked for was for nothing.
00:01:02 My motto for shopping was,
00:01:04 “When in doubt, buy!”
00:01:08 I bought a lot of things: powerful motorcycles, a house, cars.
00:01:15 I was totally absorbed in work and sometimes worked all night.
00:01:21 I somehow made it to meetings,
00:01:24 but after they ended, I’d leave right away.
00:01:28 I didn’t show interest in anyone, not even my wife.
00:01:32 All I ever talked about was work,
00:01:35 and I showed a real lack of consideration for my wife.
00:01:38 I was really blunt with her,
00:01:40 and there was a constant back and forth between us.
00:01:44 And we had a strained relationship.
00:01:48 We weren’t happy.
00:01:50 We just felt stress, stress, and more stress.
00:01:53 Everything seemed pointless.
00:02:06 I realized that I hadn’t been caring
00:02:09 for myself on the inside,
00:02:12 so I decided to read the Bible all over again.
00:02:16 I was especially moved
00:02:18 by how Jehovah repeatedly tried  to help the Israelites
00:02:23 despite all their failures.
00:02:25 This reminded me that Jehovah had been expressing
00:02:29 his love for me all along.
00:02:34 I couldn’t hold back my tears.
00:02:37 I decided that I’d live the rest of my life for him.
00:02:45 I adjusted my work
00:02:48 and made the ministry the focal point in my life.
00:02:51 When I get to share a Bible scripture
00:02:54 with someone and see it make an impact on them,
00:02:56 I feel truly happy.
00:03:06 I saw some brothers from the congregation
00:03:09 playing soccer with a young boy who had just lost his father.
00:03:14 They were trying to comfort him by spending time with him.
00:03:20 When I saw them showing personal interest in someone
00:03:22 and considering others’ feelings,
00:03:25 it really impressed me and I thought,
00:03:28 ‘I want to use my time like that as well.’
00:03:31 A scripture in the Bible says:
00:03:34 “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”
00:03:37 The more I practiced it, the happier I became.
00:03:40 I became convinced that this really is the truth.
00:03:45 Now when my wife and I spend time together,
00:03:47 I’m better able to really understand her,
00:03:51 and I’ve come to realize how much she means to me.
00:03:54 I am so thankful that Jehovah has taught me the truth.

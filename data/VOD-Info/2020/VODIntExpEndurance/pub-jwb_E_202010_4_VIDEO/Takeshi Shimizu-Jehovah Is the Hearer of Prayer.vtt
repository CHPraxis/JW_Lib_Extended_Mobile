00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray for my brothers and sisters every day

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:16.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I know Jehovah
is the Hearer of prayer.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since our baptism,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as a family
were fully engaged in Christian activities.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a busy yet fulfilling life.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really loved preaching.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed conducting Bible studies

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talking to others about the truth.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point,
I was the only elder in the congregation.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:01:01.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to make
shepherding calls on everyone,

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I just did not have the time,

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I developed the habit

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of praying for them
many times during the day.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would mention them individually by name.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted Jehovah to protect

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his precious sheep from Satan’s attacks.

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time later,

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife fell seriously ill.

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being hospitalized for a while,

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to take care of her at home.

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to step down from pioneering.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kuniko served Jehovah faithfully
until her death.

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, I became sick as well.

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One morning,
I felt especially bad and couldn’t move.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fortunately, I managed to survive somehow,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I’m confined to a wheelchair.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can no longer walk
in the ministry as I used to

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or handle congregation responsibilities.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:32.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help
to change clothes and take a shower.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:34.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get really depressed

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:39.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I think of the times
when I was able to move around freely.

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
never forgets the love we’ve shown.

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is pleased to see us doing our very best

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever circumstances we are in.

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am limited in what I can do,
but I can still pray.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my prayers,
I mention

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the names of those in my congregation

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my personal friends.

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I make a list of their names
so as not to forget anyone.

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through jw.org®,

00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read about the brothers
in Russia being arrested

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:28.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the situation in Eritrea,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I make sure to include them in my prayers.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:37.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body and its helpers
and those in full-time service

00:03:37.237 --> 00:03:40.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also need Jehovah’s support.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is without a doubt
the Hearer of prayer.

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was the only elder in the congregation

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when my wife was sick in bed,

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:57.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he listened to my prayers.

00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I am confident
that the prayers that I offer

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help my fellow friends.

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I do what I can in service,

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as witnessing to caregivers.

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I meet those
whom I have not seen for a long time

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell them “I’ve been praying for you,”

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they often tell me
how it has really helped them.

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even shed tears out of gratitude.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel happy too.

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I’m getting
physically weaker every day,

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my prayers are becoming

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more and more meaningful.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:45.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to cherish
this precious gift of prayer

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given us

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as I live.

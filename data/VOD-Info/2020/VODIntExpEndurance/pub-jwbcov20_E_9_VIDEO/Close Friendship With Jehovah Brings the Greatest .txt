00:00:02 I’ve had a lifelong struggle with a negative attitude.
00:00:06 My negative disposition
00:00:09 made me a very impatient,
00:00:11 sarcastic, and demanding person.
00:00:14 One day, out in field service, I had insulted a partner of mine,
00:00:19 and the entire day was ruined.
00:00:22 My mother was in the car.
00:00:25 She was very upset with the situation.
00:00:28 She told me that I had a negative attitude
00:00:31 and that I was not allowed inside the house until that sister forgave me.
00:00:36 So I asked the sister to lunch.
00:00:39 It was one of the most difficult and uncomfortable situations I have been in.
00:00:44 I realized that I needed to make a self-examination.
00:00:49 Why was I negative? Why was I so unhappy?
00:00:53 It was because I stopped pioneering
00:00:55 and my friends continued in their full-time service to Jehovah.
00:00:59 And that made me very frustrated,
00:01:01 to see them continue this while I was stuck.
00:01:04 When I acknowledged that I had this negative attitude,
00:01:08 that prompted me to beg Jehovah to help me to make changes.
00:01:12 The friends in the congregation who I spent a lot of time with were not bad people.
00:01:17 Their imperfection fueled my negative attitude,
00:01:21 and I really had to put that fire out.
00:01:25 Personal study was a major help, along with my prayers to Jehovah,
00:01:29 to make these changes.
00:01:31 One of the things that I meditated on was how Jesus acted with his disciples.
00:01:36 When he was hungry and he was tired,
00:01:39 he was still very loving and kind.
00:01:42 So I saw for myself that when I was spiritually hungry,
00:01:45 that affected my words and my actions toward the brothers and sisters.
00:01:49 The keys to maintaining Jesus’ mental disposition are prayer,
00:01:54 gratitude, and contentment.
00:01:56 My goal is to show
00:01:58 a grateful attitude for the blessings that I receive
00:02:02 every day and also to look
00:02:04 for the good in people —to show them that I care and I love them.
00:02:07 And I’ve learned that the more that I give to the friends
00:02:10 and to my family, the happier that makes Jehovah,
00:02:14 as Acts 20:35 and Hebrews 13:16 mention.
00:02:17 And when Jehovah is happy, that really makes me happy.

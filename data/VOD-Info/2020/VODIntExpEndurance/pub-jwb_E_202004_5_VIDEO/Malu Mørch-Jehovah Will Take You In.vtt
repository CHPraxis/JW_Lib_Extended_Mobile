My name is Malu Mørch.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can imagine

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much Jehovah has helped me.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised in Sisimiut in Greenland.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My childhood was wonderful.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very often out in nature.

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the summer, we sailed.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the winter, we rode dog sledge

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we went hunting and fishing.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a child,
I was very close to my parents.

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a “daddy’s girl.”

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He called me “My Beloved,”

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so “Beloved” became my nickname.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been so wonderful
to be raised in the truth.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest gift that I could get

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to know Jehovah through them.

00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
my parents got divorced.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was terrible.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw how my siblings were hurt.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It cannot be explained how—
I mean, we were very wounded in our hearts.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my parents divorced,
my father was disfellowshipped.

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very hard to be separated like that.

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I missed my dad a lot.

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my mom started to drink,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also felt abandoned.

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I knew what she had been doing,
I was not surprised when, 

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after some time, she was disfellowshipped.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, I felt very hurt and sad.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I supplicated Jehovah
to help me stay in the truth.

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pioneer sister who studied
with me helped me a lot.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She studied with me and sometimes took me

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry and invited me to dinner.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was about 12 years old,

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:09.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my father came back into the truth.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very happy that it finally happened.

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to have
a good relationship with him again.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sailed a lot,
drove snowmobiles, and rode dog sledge,

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father and I
watched movies in the evening.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that when my dad
heard that I was going to be baptized,

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he shed a tear,
and I could see that he was proud.

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:45.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 15 years old,

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:48.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my world fell to pieces.

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father committed suicide.

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult to describe
that my father was suddenly gone.

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:00.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t understand

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he would do such a selfish thing.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I missed him a lot.

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:14.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like my heart was stabbed.

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also very angry at him.

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote a lot.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I wrote many letters to my father

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:35.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about things that I wanted to tell him.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love Psalm 34:18

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah being close
to “those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was how I felt.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the thought that Jehovah is close to them

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comforts me a lot.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also did all I could
to go to all the meetings,

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when I didn’t want to see anyone.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if I had cried before the meeting,

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went anyway.

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One month after my father’s death,
I got baptized.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
I had promised Jehovah

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:23.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve him for the rest of my life.

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with my mother
is much better now.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:34.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is great to serve Jehovah
together with her now.

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:38.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We preach together every Sunday,

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I always look forward to going
in the ministry together with her.

00:04:44.513 --> 00:04:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 18 years old,

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to help
in the remote translation office.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, I started pioneering.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have always learned a lot from King David.

00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what circumstances he faced,

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether bad or good,
he used them to draw close to Jehovah.

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped me to overcome 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenges through the congregation,

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:18.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving me “power beyond what is normal”

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:22.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking me in as his daughter.

00:00:13 My name is Malu Mørch.
00:00:15 No one can imagine
00:00:18 how much Jehovah has helped me.
00:00:26 I was raised in Sisimiut in Greenland.
00:00:29 My childhood was wonderful.
00:00:32 We were very often out in nature.
00:00:34 In the summer, we sailed.
00:00:36 And in the winter, we rode dog sledge
00:00:38 and we went hunting and fishing.
00:00:43 When I was a child, I was very close to my parents.
00:00:45 I was a “daddy’s girl.”
00:00:47 He called me “My Beloved,”
00:00:50 so “Beloved” became my nickname.
00:00:53 It has been so wonderful to be raised in the truth.
00:00:57 The greatest gift that I could get
00:00:59 is to know Jehovah through them.
00:01:05 When I was nine years old, my parents got divorced.
00:01:09 It was terrible.
00:01:10 I saw how my siblings were hurt.
00:01:13 It cannot be explained how— I mean, we were very wounded in our hearts.
00:01:18 When my parents divorced, my father was disfellowshipped.
00:01:21 It was very hard to be separated like that.
00:01:24 I missed my dad a lot.
00:01:27 When my mom started to drink,
00:01:30 I also felt abandoned.
00:01:34 Because I knew what she had been doing, I was not surprised when,
00:01:37 after some time, she was disfellowshipped.
00:01:40 But, of course, I felt very hurt and sad.
00:01:46 I supplicated Jehovah to help me stay in the truth.
00:01:51 The pioneer sister who studied with me helped me a lot.
00:01:57 She studied with me and sometimes took me
00:02:00 in the ministry and invited me to dinner.
00:02:04 When I was about 12 years old,
00:02:06 my father came back into the truth.
00:02:09 I was very happy that it finally happened.
00:02:14 I began to have a good relationship with him again.
00:02:17 We sailed a lot, drove snowmobiles, and rode dog sledge,
00:02:21 and my father and I watched movies in the evening.
00:02:25 I remember that when my dad heard that I was going to be baptized,
00:02:29 he shed a tear, and I could see that he was proud.
00:02:43 When I was 15 years old,
00:02:45 my world fell to pieces.
00:02:49 My father committed suicide.
00:02:54 It’s difficult to describe that my father was suddenly gone.
00:02:58 I can’t understand
00:03:00 why he would do such a selfish thing.
00:03:06 I missed him a lot.
00:03:11 It was like my heart was stabbed.
00:03:20 I was also very angry at him.
00:03:27 I wrote a lot.
00:03:29 And I wrote many letters to my father
00:03:31 about things that I wanted to tell him.
00:03:35 I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers.
00:03:40 I love Psalm 34:18
00:03:43 about Jehovah being close to “those who are crushed in spirit.”
00:03:46 That was how I felt.
00:03:49 And the thought that Jehovah is close to them
00:03:52 comforts me a lot.
00:03:54 I also did all I could to go to all the meetings,
00:03:57 even when I didn’t want to see anyone.
00:04:02 Even if I had cried before the meeting,
00:04:05 I went anyway.
00:04:09 One month after my father’s death, I got baptized.
00:04:13 I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.
00:04:19 When I was nine years old, I had promised Jehovah
00:04:21 to serve him for the rest of my life.
00:04:25 My relationship with my mother is much better now.
00:04:31 It is great to serve Jehovah together with her now.
00:04:36 We preach together every Sunday,
00:04:38 and I always look forward to going in the ministry together with her.
00:04:44 When I was 18 years old,
00:04:46 I began to help in the remote translation office.
00:04:50 Later, I started pioneering.
00:04:54 I have always learned a lot from King David.
00:04:57 No matter what circumstances he faced,
00:05:00 whether bad or good, he used them to draw close to Jehovah.
00:05:10 Jehovah has helped me to overcome
00:05:12 challenges through the congregation,
00:05:14 giving me “power beyond what is normal”
00:05:18 and taking me in as his daughter.

00:00:01 Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge.
00:00:05 To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.
00:00:10 Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories
00:00:14 that are as different as night and day.
00:00:17 Recently, they visited our studio.
00:00:20 Listen as they tell us how they have learned
00:00:22 to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.
00:00:28 Takanori and Yumi,
00:00:30 welcome to our studio!
00:00:32 Thank you for inviting us.
00:00:34 And we’re very happy to have you here.
00:00:36 Takanori, you and I go back a long way.
00:00:40 I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977,
00:00:44 and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.
00:00:49 But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life.
00:00:53 Would you like to tell us what happened?
00:00:55 Yes, my twin brother,
00:00:57 Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.
00:01:01 To our surprise, we were assigned
00:01:04 to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.
00:01:06 That was a big change!
00:01:09 And here you are working in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.
00:01:13 During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,
00:01:16 I understand that you served in the missionary field,
00:01:18 in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.
00:01:21 So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?
00:01:24 Takanori and I were married in September 1993,
00:01:28 and I joined him in the missionary work.
00:01:32 Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.
00:01:37 So in order to bear thorough witness,
00:01:39 what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?
00:01:43 The people of Papua New Guinea are very friendly.
00:01:46 They have a deep respect for the Bible.
00:01:49 It was easy to relax,
00:01:52 speak to them face-to-face,
00:01:54 to read the Scriptures together, and reason with them.
00:01:58 Those don’t sound like challenges.
00:02:01 Did you face any obstacles?
00:02:03 When we preached in the villages,
00:02:06 the response of the local people
00:02:08 often depended on the response of the village chief.
00:02:13 If he listened, almost the whole village listened.
00:02:17 But if his response was negative,
00:02:20 the people would walk away and hide in the bush.
00:02:24 So we would always show respect
00:02:28 and approach the village chief first.
00:02:31 This often moved him to view our visit with favor.
00:02:35 The challenge in the cities was mainly security.
00:02:40 It wasn’t safe for us to go into some areas alone
00:02:44 or to visit homes regularly.
00:02:46 So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall
00:02:50 for their study before the meeting.
00:02:54 That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.
00:02:58 Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papua New Guinea.
00:03:02 But now you’re serving as special pioneers in the Maihama Congregation
00:03:06 just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.
00:03:10 So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible
00:03:14 to a land where less than 1 percent of the people claim to be Christian.
00:03:19 So, what other kind of differences did you find
00:03:22 between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?
00:03:27 Oh, it’s very different.
00:03:30 Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,
00:03:33 and 70 percent of the homes
00:03:35 are in high-security apartment buildings.
00:03:39 We have to stand in the lobby in front of the doorman,
00:03:43 push a button, and speak to a camera.
00:03:47 Coming from Papua New Guinea,
00:03:49 we found it challenging to work this territory.
00:03:53 We were used to friendly discussions face-to-face.
00:03:57 Now we see only the lens of a camera.
00:04:00 But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.
00:04:05 As your friend?
00:04:06 I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera.
00:04:10 So how do you overcome this challenge?
00:04:13 We know that as soon as we push the button,
00:04:16 our face shows up on a screen inside of the apartment.
00:04:20 We stand an arm’s length from the camera
00:04:24 so that our face is framed nicely.
00:04:27 And we adjust our volume accordingly,
00:04:29 taking into consideration the doorman and others who may be listening.
00:04:35 We say our greeting
00:04:37 about two seconds after we push the button,
00:04:41 just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.
00:04:45 Our friendly greeting and warm smile
00:04:48 makes them feel like we can actually see their face.
00:04:53 We prepare a specific appealing introduction
00:04:57 and show them respect and consideration.
00:05:01 The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful,
00:05:06 not as people who have problems.
00:05:09 So we try to focus on positive subjects.
00:05:13 We prepare a variety of subjects
00:05:15 so that they don’t hear the same message over and over.
00:05:20 Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on the spot.
00:05:25 So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer,
00:05:30 we use the teaching method of our tracts
00:05:34 and give three possible answers for them to choose from.
00:05:37 Well, have you had positive results from this intercom preaching?
00:05:42 Since we started to use this method,
00:05:45 the number of not-at-homes has decreased.
00:05:48 And also, when we meet people on the street,
00:05:52 sometimes they say they know us
00:05:55 because they saw us on their intercom.
00:05:58 That was excellent!
00:06:00 And thank you, Takanori and Yumi, for sharing with us
00:06:04 how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness
00:06:07 in a variety of territories.

Sometimes just getting to talk to people
can be a challenge.

00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:10.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To overcome this obstacle,
we need to be flexible.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi
have served in territories

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are as different as night and day.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, they visited our studio.

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as they tell us how they have learned

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet the challenges
of bearing thorough witness.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and Yumi,

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
welcome to our studio!

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.217 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for inviting us.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re very happy to have you here.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still remember when you came
into Japan Bethel back in 1977,

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we served in the same congregation
for a number of years.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:53.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in 1990, you had
a big change in your life.

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my twin brother,

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:01.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To our surprise, we were assigned

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a big change!

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you are working
in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that you served
in the missionary field,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and I were married
in September 1993,

00:01:28.938 --> 00:01:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:36.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adapting to remote territories such as this
was a challenge.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in order to bear thorough witness,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:43.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of challenges
did you have to overcome?

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:46.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people of Papua New Guinea
are very friendly.

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was easy to relax,

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:54.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak to them face-to-face,

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Scriptures together,
and reason with them.

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those don’t sound like challenges.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you face any obstacles?

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we preached in the villages,

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the response of the local people

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often depended on the response
of the village chief.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he listened,
almost the whole village listened.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if his response was negative,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people would walk away
and hide in the bush.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:28.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we would always show respect

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:30.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approach the village chief first.

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:35.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This often moved him
to view our visit with favor.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge in the cities
was mainly security.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t safe for us to go
into some areas alone

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to visit homes regularly.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we would ask our Bible students
to come to the Kingdom Hall

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their study before the meeting.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a good way to encourage them
to attend meetings.

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed
your service in Papua New Guinea.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:06.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now you’re serving as special pioneers
in the Maihama Congregation

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you went from a territory
where people have deep respect for the Bible

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:19.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a land where less than 1 percent
of the people claim to be Christian.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what other kind of differences
did you find

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:27.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between your territory in Japan now
and your missionary territory?

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s very different.

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 70 percent of the homes

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:39.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in high-security apartment buildings.

00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to stand in the lobby
in front of the doorman,

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
push a button, and speak to a camera.

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:49.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming from Papua New Guinea,

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we found it challenging
to work this territory.

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were used to friendly discussions
face-to-face.

00:03:57.186 --> 00:04:00.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have learned
to view the camera as our friend.

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your friend?

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think most of us find it challenging
to speak to a camera.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:16.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that as soon as we push the button,

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:20.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our face shows up on a screen
inside of the apartment.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stand an arm’s length from the camera

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:27.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our face is framed nicely.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we adjust our volume accordingly,

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking into consideration the doorman
and others who may be listening.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We say our greeting

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two seconds after we push the button,

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just when we know
that they are looking at the monitor.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friendly greeting and warm smile

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:51.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes them feel like we
can actually see their face.

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:57.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prepare a specific appealing introduction

00:04:57.447 --> 00:05:01.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show them respect and consideration.

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people in our territory
like to be viewed as successful,

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as people who have problems.

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prepare a variety of subjects

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they don’t hear
the same message over and over.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many people, Japanese do not like
to be put on the spot.

00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of asking a question
and waiting for them to answer,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we use the teaching method of our tracts

00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:37.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give three possible answers
for them to choose from.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, have you had positive results
from this intercom preaching?

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we started to use this method,

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:48.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of not-at-homes has decreased.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, when we meet people on the street,

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes they say they know us

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they saw us on their intercom.

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was excellent!

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thank you, Takanori and Yumi,
for sharing with us

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:07.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you have met the challenge
of bearing thorough witness

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a variety of territories.

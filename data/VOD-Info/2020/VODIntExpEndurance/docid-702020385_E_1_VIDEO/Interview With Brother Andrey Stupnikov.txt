00:00:01 The Krasnoyarsk Zheleznodorozhny District Court
00:00:05 has begun consideration of the criminal case
00:00:08 against Andrey Stupnikov, a peaceful believer
00:00:10 accused of extremism.
00:00:14 He is accused of a crime
00:00:15 under Article 282.2(1)
00:00:18 of the Criminal Code
00:00:19 —namely, organizing the activity of an organization
00:00:23 that has been liquidated by a court decision
00:00:26 for carrying out so-called extremist activity.
00:00:29 Andrey Stupnikov was not one of the founding members of such organizations
00:00:34 and was never a member of any of their agencies.
00:00:38 The religion was not banned.
00:00:40 This was specifically pointed out by the court
00:00:43 that ruled to liquidate the legal entities.
00:00:46 But the indictment states:
00:00:49 “Andrey Stupnikov took steps to maintain
00:00:51 “and increase the number of followers
00:00:54 of the said religious teaching.”
00:00:56 But a religion cannot exist without followers
00:01:00 who profess certain beliefs.
00:01:02 Andrey and Olga
00:01:04 have been married for 27 years.
00:01:06 They say that Bible knowledge makes their life strong and happy.
00:01:09 But on July 3, 2018,
00:01:12 their happy family life was disrupted
00:01:15 when Andrey was detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB).
00:01:20 My wife and I arrived at the airport
00:01:22 at four o’clock in the morning.
00:01:26 When we were at the check-in counter, the FSB officers
00:01:30 approached us
00:01:31 and said that I was under investigation.
00:01:35 Andrey was interrogated
00:01:37 by the FSB, appeared in court,
00:01:38 and then spent eight months in pretrial detention.
00:01:41 He was prevented from seeing his wife.
00:01:43 Officials tried to coerce him
00:01:45 into incriminating himself.
00:01:48 The authorities shouted and threatened
00:01:50 that they could, for example, increase the charges against me to include terrorism.
00:01:55 Then a difficult situation arose.
00:01:59 For some time, I stopped receiving letters from my wife
00:02:03 but I received letters from others.
00:02:05 Then a man came
00:02:07 and asked me:
00:02:09 “So, what happened to your wife? Do you know?”
00:02:11 Later, I realized why this was happening.
00:02:15 They told me that I could return to my wife very soon
00:02:18 if I agreed to cooperate or plead guilty.
00:02:21 Andrey acknowledges that the presence
00:02:24 of hundreds of fellow believers who came to court to encourage him
00:02:28 was a great support.
00:02:32 To the discerning mind,
00:02:35 it is obvious that law-enforcement agencies
00:02:38 have crossed all boundaries by labeling peaceful,
00:02:41 law-abiding citizens as “extremists.”
00:02:45 It’s clear that Andrey Stupnikov did not engage in any extremist activities.
00:02:50 He did not incite anyone to violence or discrimination,
00:02:54 much less employ violent means himself.
00:02:57 All he did was meet with fellow worshippers, participate in religious services,
00:03:02 and share his religious views with others.
00:03:06 Why are such peaceable individuals
00:03:08 being framed as criminals and imprisoned for six years?
00:03:12 There are many opinions on that question,
00:03:15 one of which is that they are an easy target for law-enforcement officers
00:03:20 who have quotas to meet in their battle against extremism.
00:03:24 At present, Andrey is home.
00:03:27 His current pretrial restrictions
00:03:29 prohibit certain activities.
00:03:31 And although Andrey’s life has changed a lot in the past year, he says
00:03:36 that persecution will not force him
00:03:37 to renounce his faith in God.
00:03:42 Reflecting on my life
00:03:45 since I dedicated myself to God,
00:03:48 I wouldn’t change anything.
00:03:51 Not one person can say
00:03:53 that I have ruined his life or done anything bad to him.
00:03:57 I’m proud to know Jehovah
00:04:01 and to have him by my side.
00:04:03 The judicial proceedings
00:04:04 against Andrey Stupnikov are well underway,
00:04:07 and we will likely find out very soon
00:04:10 if the judge will render a fair and independent decision
00:04:14 by acquitting a person who simply believes in God.

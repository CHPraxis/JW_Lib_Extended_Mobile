00:00:13 Well, here in Venezuela, long before the crisis,
00:00:16 there weren’t so many financial problems like we have today.
00:00:23 We could go to the stores, we could buy
00:00:26 the amount of food we wanted,
00:00:28 and life was peaceful.
00:00:36 For us, the situation started to get really bad
00:00:40 five years ago.
00:00:42 It was hard to get any food at all,
00:00:45 even basic items.
00:00:47 When it came time to buy something, well, it was all gone.
00:00:53 There were two elders that,
00:00:55 I can say, were checking on me almost daily
00:00:57 —always asking how much food I needed.
00:01:03 When I prepared it and served it, my main concern
00:01:05 was that my children would get enough.
00:01:11 I always gave them more food.
00:01:15 Even though my youngest boy would ask,
00:01:17 “Mommy, is that what you’re going to eat?”
00:01:21 I would tell him, “Yes, dear, I’m fine with this.”
00:01:25 Then he would say, “I don’t think so.”
00:01:31 I would think, ‘I can handle this,’
00:01:34 but the amount that I was eating just wasn’t enough for my body.
00:01:45 One Sunday morning, during the meeting, I wasn’t feeling very well but,
00:01:49 thanks to Jehovah, my daughter was nearby.
00:01:52 When I came to, she said,
00:01:54 “Mom, you fainted three times!”
00:01:56 I said, “That can’t be!”
00:01:59 So the brothers immediately took me to the doctor.
00:02:03 I was diagnosed as having severe malnutrition.
00:02:09 The brothers began a plan of action:
00:02:11 They brought food that was already prepared
00:02:14 and, in fact, they would sit by me until I finished my food.
00:02:19 I have not yet
00:02:20 fully recovered my body weight, because I was a little heavier.
00:02:24 But healthwise, I have felt very well.
00:02:30 The elders were always looking after me,
00:02:32 and that boosted my energy.
00:02:35 And definitely, I never lost my joy.
00:02:42 And it’s all thanks to Jehovah!
00:02:44 Thanks to him because he is the One who sustains me.
00:02:47 He clothes me, he feeds me, and he gives me great friends.
00:02:51 That is what Jehovah gives me.

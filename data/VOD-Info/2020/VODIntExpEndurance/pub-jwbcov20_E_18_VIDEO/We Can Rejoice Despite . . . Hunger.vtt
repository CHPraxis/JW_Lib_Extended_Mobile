Well, here in Venezuela,
long before the crisis,

00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there weren’t so many financial problems
like we have today.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:26.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could go to the stores, we could buy

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of food we wanted,

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:30.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and life was peaceful.

00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:40.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us,
the situation started to get really bad

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five years ago.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:45.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to get any food at all,

00:00:45.937 --> 00:00:47.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even basic items.

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it came time to buy something,
well, it was all gone.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were two elders that,

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say,
were checking on me almost daily

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:00.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—always asking
how much food I needed.

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I prepared it and served it,
my main concern

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that my children would get enough.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always gave them more food.

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though
my youngest boy would ask,

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:21.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mommy, is that
what you’re going to eat?”

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell him,
“Yes, dear, I’m fine with this.”

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he would say,
“I don’t think so.”

00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:34.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would think, ‘I can handle this,’

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the amount that I was eating
just wasn’t enough for my body.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Sunday morning, during the meeting,
I wasn’t feeling very well but,

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks to Jehovah,
my daughter was nearby.

00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came to, she said,

00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:56.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, you fainted three times!”

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “That can’t be!”

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the brothers
immediately took me to the doctor.

00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:06.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was diagnosed
as having severe malnutrition.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers began a plan of action:

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They brought food
that was already prepared

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in fact, they would sit
by me until I finished my food.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have not yet

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fully recovered my body weight,
because I was a little heavier.

00:02:24.437 --> 00:02:28.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But healthwise,
I have felt very well.

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders were always looking after me,

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:35.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that boosted my energy.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And definitely,
I never lost my joy.

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s all thanks to Jehovah!

00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:47.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to him because he
is the One who sustains me.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He clothes me, he feeds me,
and he gives me great friends.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what Jehovah gives me.

00:00:10 Well, one thing you have to understand about living in New York City
00:00:13 is that it’s a very fast-paced life.
00:00:17 So you’ve got to keep up with that lifestyle.
00:00:21 We were doing pretty fine,
00:00:22 and we were happy pioneering, working
00:00:26 —just trying to survive in New York.
00:00:28 One of the things that you usually have to worry about
00:00:31 is your safety —being careful of your surroundings.
00:00:35 But hurricanes are just something we never considered;
00:00:39 it’s something we never had to worry about.
00:00:47 The day when we first heard the warning,
00:00:49 it was raining outside and kind of windy.
00:00:52 We saw the water coming into the parking lot where our apartment was
00:00:57 and that’s when I realized something was about to happen.
00:01:04 We got out with the clothes on our back.
00:01:08 It was just total devastation.
00:01:11 You lose everything
00:01:14 —one single night.
00:01:17 I never had any thought that water
00:01:20 would come into our place and destroy everything from our material possessions
00:01:23 to our clothes.
00:01:25 And I truly felt what it was like to be destitute.
00:01:28 It just broke my heart.
00:01:30 And all I could do
00:01:31 was wonder, ‘Where do my wife and I go from here?’
00:01:37 Our assembly was scheduled for that weekend.
00:01:40 I didn’t even have
00:01:42 a suit jacket or a tie.
00:01:43 I think I probably took for granted something as simple as clothing.
00:01:48 I always had it.
00:01:52 But the brothers and sisters stepped in to assist in so many different ways.
00:01:56 I heard a knock on the door that Friday
00:02:00 —three suits
00:02:03 and shoes!
00:02:05 They purchased clothing for us.
00:02:08 It was a most unbelievable experience.
00:02:11 These friends gave us big hugs and gave us envelopes.
00:02:14 We are fully convinced
00:02:15 we were clothed by Jehovah’s love.
00:02:17 We were able to go to our assembly and enjoy taking in spiritual food,
00:02:22 even though we were in that situation.
00:02:25 Even though we lost everything physically,
00:02:28 we were still able to keep on pioneering, which we have been doing up to this day.
00:02:33 Jehovah made a promise.
00:02:36 If we keep seeking first his Kingdom,
00:02:39 everything else he will take care of.
00:02:42 And that’s where my joy comes from.
00:02:46 No matter what type of tribulation you go through in your life,
00:02:49 and even if it’s to the point of nakedness,
00:02:52 it will never ever be able to stop
00:02:55 or cut off the relationship that we have with our God, Jehovah.

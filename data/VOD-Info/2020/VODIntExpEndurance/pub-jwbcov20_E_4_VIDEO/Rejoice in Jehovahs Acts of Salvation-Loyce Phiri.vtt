I was born in Malawi in 1962.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my eyesight at two years of age
because of an eye disease.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:23.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to rely on the rains
for the food we eat and sell,

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it is our only source of income.

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also look after both my parents.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father is 99 years old,

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mother is 92 years old.

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poverty is very time-consuming.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a lot of household chores to do

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep things clean and neat,

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like fetching water for our daily needs.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the evening, after we have eaten,
this is the time for reading.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,
Father took the lead in our family worship,

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which he still does.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now because of his failing eyesight,

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:05.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read to them.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read with my fingers,

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so nighttime is no problem.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My fingers are my eyes.

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:17.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One scripture that really touches my heart

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is James 5:11, which says:

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:21.560 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.103 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“We consider happy

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:25.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
those who have endured.”

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:27.149 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Job endured his trials,

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and at the end,

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw all the good that Jehovah
had blessed him with.

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convinces me

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will act in the near future,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blessing us with all the things
that we are lacking,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling all his promises.

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I’m happy to endure.

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:50.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom and his sovereignty
are first in my life.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is only God’s Kingdom that will solve
all these problems.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel privileged that I’ve been able
to serve as a regular pioneer

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 36 years now and have been blessed

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help 64 persons to know Jehovah.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy with song 76.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t see myself as poor.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:28.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have the Bible and many 
different publications in Chichewa Braille.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:33.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the congregation, the ministry,
and our brothers and sisters.

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:37.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these things make me very happy!

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not worried
about our current situation

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are spiritually rich.

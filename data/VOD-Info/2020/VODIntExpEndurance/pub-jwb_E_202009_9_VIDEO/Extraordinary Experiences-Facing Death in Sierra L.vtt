Welcome to this edition
of Extraordinary Experiences.

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:07.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy to have
with us today Laddie and Cecelia Sandy

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as special pioneers
in the country of Sierra Leone.

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You attended the 144th class of Gilead.

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, it’s very nice to have you with us.

00:00:14.743 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On March 23, 1991,

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the civil war in Liberia
spilled across the borders 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Sierra Leone,
and this ignited an 11-year civil war.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laddie, could you tell us,

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what were the conditions like
as war came to Freetown,

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the branch was located?

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was total chaos

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no law and order.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lawlessness was at its highest peak,

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was terrible.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your interview on <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you related how the branch
at one point was attacked.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you explain to us, Laddie,
what happened after that?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do after that attack?

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to leave the branch

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was not safe.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were just shouting that

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rebels were coming and amputating people,

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we decided to head

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for another missionary home
on the other side of town.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just went along with the crowd,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we met a military roadblock

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that asked us
not to go beyond that roadblock.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to spend the night
sleeping on the streets.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to persist,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they refused and warned
that if I continued asking them,

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would shoot at me.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia, what were you thinking at this time?

00:01:40.704 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like my whole body
was numb out of fear.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was just praying inside—

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was praying for a resurrection,

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not protection, to Jehovah

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because all I could see
in front of us was death.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I would just pray
that Jehovah should please

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember us in the resurrection.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we just left everything
in Jehovah’s hand.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when the morning came,

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you do in the morning?

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to return
because it was quiet and a little bit safe,

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we returned to secure the branch.

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To go back to the branch was a big—

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a big decision for us

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we didn’t feel safe any longer

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay either at the branch
or the missionary home.

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we left everything in Jehovah’s hands,

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we did what the brothers told us: 

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t worry.
Jehovah will keep protecting us.”

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we went back to the branch,
and we continued to stay there.

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say
really helped the brothers and sisters

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this time period
of war in Sierra Leone?

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s love for Jehovah and the brotherhood.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They remained active

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with theocratic-routine activities,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending Christian meetings,
having family worship,

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:09.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting together as a brotherhood.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was what really kept them going.

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:14.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So meeting attendance
was important then, would you say, Cecelia?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very much, very important.

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before any problem,
we have to develop love for meetings

00:03:21.055 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if we have
the habit of missing meetings,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be challenging in times of trouble.

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen if somebody
who usually came to the meetings

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t come to the meeting?

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to go in search of him

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:38.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(of the family) if the family was not there,

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:40.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because during the war,

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not have access to mobile phones.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The telephone system was terrible,

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we had to take the risk

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:53.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make sure they were OK and return.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during this time,

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:58.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if somebody who regularly came
to the meetings wasn’t there,

00:03:58.258 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers would go out and risk their life

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find them, to make sure they were OK?

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a really powerful reminder, thank you.

00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:10.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Laddie, did you have anything else
you’d like to add or to share with us?

00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in times of difficulties,
we need to pray

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah for courage

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face challenges in life

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah, indeed, will help us.

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:26.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the collective prayers

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our behalf from the brotherhood

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah does listen to such prayers.

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:36.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what, really, I learned personally
during the war period in Sierra Leone.

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know where the courage came from.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s later on
that Jehovah gives the courage,

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the collective prayers
of our brothers also help.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.
We thank both of you very much,

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thank you, too,
friends, for being with us,

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look forward
to being together again for another edition

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Extraordinary Experiences.

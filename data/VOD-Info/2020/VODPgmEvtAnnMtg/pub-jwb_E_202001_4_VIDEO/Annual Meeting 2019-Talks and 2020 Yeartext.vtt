00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris’ thoughts

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented in his talk entitled

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Have Work to Do!”

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:18.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great pleasure
to hear all of the excitement

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Ramapo project
was announced to all of you here,

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure that was true
for the other thousands that are tied in.

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you saw with these videos

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the construction projects

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going on all over
—all over the earth.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s quite interesting,

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:42.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you think about it
from an imperfect, human perspective

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(frankly, not thinking spiritually),

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d say:
“Well, we just dedicated the Warwick property

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with Wallkill recently.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here we go down the road.”

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the preaching work
obviously is premier.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what this is really about
—the preaching work.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To support the preaching work

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to continue to feed
Jehovah’s precious sheep

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:19.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way he wants them fed
involves all this construction.

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So God wants us to have it clear.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants you to spread this and,
of course, it’ll come up in January.

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:32.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind, we have work to do.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Period.

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:34.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So get over it.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get me going on vacation.

00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:42.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll just tell you—

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know my friends on the Governing Body,

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know that you need your time.

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not trying to put you on a guilt trip,
but we have a whole lot of days.

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you do it
with the work that’s going on?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You try to rest up when you can;
Jehovah wants us to.

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:03.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have so much work to do.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thank God for it.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:08.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just to give us
a little Scriptural reminder

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the proper attitude about work,

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find John chapter 5.

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are
very familiar verses to all of you,

00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly the audience here in Newburgh

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:23.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all these decades of faithful service.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We treasure your service

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course,
Jehovah certainly does.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ve worked hard for decades

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a lot of you to whom
I was talking to earlier

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:36.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have decades in the traveling work—

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so many wonderful,
hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here he is, Jesus, (in John chapter 5)

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:47.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
facing these judgmental religious leaders

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecuting him over curing on the Sabbath.

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what we’re after here
is something he reveals to us in verse 17,

00:02:55.558 --> 00:02:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he’s answering them:

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My Father has kept working until now,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I keep working.”

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the hardest worker
in the universe is Jehovah God,

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Christ Jesus is right there with him.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a worker.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His people have to be workers.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he expects,
and it’s such a pleasure

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve the true God and work.

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another familiar verse
in 1 Corinthians chapter 15

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows the proper spirit
when it comes to this matter

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being workers,
with all the work we have to do.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is seeing to it
that we have all this work

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:43.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very familiar,
verse 58 of 1 Corinthians 15:

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, my beloved brothers,

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be steadfast, immovable,

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[notice] <i>always </i> having plenty to do

00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:55.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the work of the Lord,

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that your labor
is not in vain in connection with the Lord”

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—plenty of work “in the work of the Lord.”

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when we’re doing the work

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and this is crucial),
as we engage in it

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:12.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’s the preaching work
or other work assignments,

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you’re in a Bethel assignment
or a construction assignment—

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a proper spirit.

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And find here Romans chapter 12.

00:04:21.277 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this we see in God’s people,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we want to individually apply the counsel

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make sure we keep this spirit

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:34.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or talk to God about it
if it’s lacking at the moment.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 12

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:40.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and here’s what Christians are all about

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to working for Jehovah,

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 11:
“Be industrious, not lazy.”

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah does not approve of being lazy.

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:56.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be aglow with the spirit.”

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re just absorbed with it.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s this zeal
—just alive with it—

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we slave for Jehovah.

00:05:04.087 --> 00:05:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he appreciates

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:10.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an industrious, hardworking spirit,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what he wants from his people.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:16.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with all of the announcements

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the videos
with construction going on,

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just thought I’d share this with you.

00:05:21.304 --> 00:05:24.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very special item of mine,

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:29.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it came up recently.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see here the best you can.

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:33.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The camera can pick it up,

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up here it says “Building Permit.”

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a special memory for me, personally,

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:42.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as we had in some of the videos

00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were involved with the construction

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or before construction started
with the Warwick project,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:54.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d be at Tuxedo,
and a lot of work was going on

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—preparatory—
looking for that day

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they could get started.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Governing Body
would do their best to get up

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be encouraging
(always wearing the high-vis outfits)

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then give a spiritual talk.

00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s the only time
I’ve given a talk in high vis.

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this particular day was special

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because things
were moving along with the community.

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They liked us,
but I noticed Zeny (in the one video),

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he mentioned “shovel to the ground,”

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s OK.

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:31.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re different.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m calling it “shovel in the ground.”

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zeny is not from America,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it means the same thing, Zeny,

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:43.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so forgive me.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciate all your hard work.

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But any who
have been involved with construction

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and you have a lot of folks I know here
from the former Regional Building Committee

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the hardworking construction),

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s always been special
to work on these spiritual projects.

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:06.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this particular day,
there were a lot of things going on.

00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m up there; it’s July 26,

00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that date is up here in the corner.

00:07:13.082 --> 00:07:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a Friday,

00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the year 2013 (quite a while ago).

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I have a talk to give to them
at 1:30 p.m. after visiting some.

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two hours before

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(so it must have been around 11:30),

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they got the building permit.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Construction Project Committee

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and how much we love 
those men and their wives)—

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re there, and they said,

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, would you mind
making this announcement?”

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought:
‘Boy, that timing worked out good.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:52.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s quite an honor,
the construction, you know,

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the shovel-in-the-ground” announcement.’

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I gave them a little spiritual side.

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, a little glory is all right
for a human sometimes, you know.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was very exciting.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the memory is clear
to those who were there.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the operation of holy spirit

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers
being “aglow with the spirit,” industrious,

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they made the announcement,

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m telling you (those who were there),

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:28.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was joy
—the thunderous applause.

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t anything to do with me.

00:08:30.293 --> 00:08:32.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was that they got
“the shovel in the ground.”

00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:34.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the excitement!

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was able to easily walk out of there,
and they were all busy

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—thrilled
over the “shovel-in-the-ground” approval.

00:08:43.873 --> 00:08:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the day is coming, God willing,

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Ramapo project
to have the “shovel in the ground.”

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You heard when they hope that happens.

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s that beautiful spirit
that glorifies Jehovah

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:01.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they work so hard.

00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we have to keep that spirit.

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some could say

00:09:07.063 --> 00:09:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(well, it happens on occasion,

00:09:09.098 --> 00:09:13.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not with a lot
of God’s spiritually-minded folks):

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe the end is coming?

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, what are you doing all this for?

00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the end is really close,

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are you doing?”

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the end is going to come

00:09:25.615 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah is satisfied
with the preaching work.

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:32.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is also a reminder here
in Revelation chapter 7;

00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is always something you can forget.

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed Brother Butler

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touched on it in his opening prayer

00:09:41.597 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(which, of course, we don’t record

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prayers for the presentation in January),

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Bob touched on it.

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:53.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gives us
enough to keep us focused on:

00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You just stay busy and do my will.’

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:59.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, this is quite fascinating

00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:02.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at chapter 7 verses 1-3:

00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:08.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After this I saw four angels standing
on the four corners of the earth,

00:10:08.824 --> 00:10:10.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“holding tight the four winds of the earth,

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that no wind could blow on the earth

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:16.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or on the sea or on any tree.

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:19.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I saw another angel
ascending from the sunrise,

00:10:19.502 --> 00:10:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“having a seal of the living God;

00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:25.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he called
with a loud voice to the four angels

00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to whom it was granted
to harm the earth and the sea,

00:10:28.511 --> 00:10:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying: [and it’s loud]

00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:34.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not harm the earth
or the sea or the trees,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘until after we have sealed

00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:41.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the slaves of our God in their foreheads.’”

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some individual anointed
have to have a final seal

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they die,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve had a number of them
die during the last days.

00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:58.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is talking
about right before Jehovah starts,

00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or has put it in the hearts
of the governments to destroy Babylon,

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:04.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of those who are left on the earth,

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the remnant
—genuine, anointed disciples of Christ—

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:11.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get the final seal.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what’s going to take place.

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after that,
the great tribulation breaks out.

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you keep an eye
on the news to some degree

00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(if you can stomach it,
to at least know what’s happening),

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the end is definitely close.

00:11:28.904 --> 00:11:31.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s just no denying it.

00:11:31.006 --> 00:11:34.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We eagerly look forward to it taking place.

00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:38.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great tribulation
—it’s close.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as we eagerly await it,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to have Jehovah’s mind
on the matter and wait patiently.

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think about all of those

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Newburgh

00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:53.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with so many years in the truth,

00:11:53.162 --> 00:11:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially corporate members
and their mates (if they’re married).

00:11:57.066 --> 00:12:01.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This <i>Watchtower,</i>
we want to share it with you from 1976

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—profound statements.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:09.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To this day, they ring true
about this matter of the end.

00:12:09.612 --> 00:12:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows you where
we are in the stream of time.

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s spirit was on them

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:19.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(not inspired,
but he captured it with them, helping them),

00:12:19.054 --> 00:12:23.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was just ringing,
and it still rings to this day.

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:27.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice what
that 1976, November 15, <i>Watchtower </i> said,

00:12:27.963 --> 00:12:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 688-689.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the 17th paragraph,
notice, I’m quoting it:

00:12:34.403 --> 00:12:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The end does not come

00:12:36.405 --> 00:12:39.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just because we might think
it is the due date,

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or because we feel that our territory
has been well worked.

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:46.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It comes when Jehovah has carried through

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:51.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great work of Kingdom preaching
to the extent he wants,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he will bring
the ‘great tribulation.’”

00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now listen, back in 1976:

00:12:58.427 --> 00:13:02.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Until that time there is work to do!

00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And we as Jehovah’s Witnesses
are the ones assigned to do it!

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The arrival of the ‘great tribulation’

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should find the preaching work
at the height of its forward movement,

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:21.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the very peak
of its momentum throughout the earth.

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The arrival of the Lord Jesus

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to execute judgment
will come as a complete surprise

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—even to Jehovah’s people,

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for it will no doubt find them

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at their busiest time of activity!”

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:13:41.103 --> 00:13:45.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been busier
since you’ve been in the truth

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than you’ve been recently?

00:13:47.843 --> 00:13:52.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re the busiest we’ve been

00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:55.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—hands down.

00:13:55.484 --> 00:13:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s amazing how the slave

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
captured that right attitude in 1976.

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, some in the truth then,
at least in certain parts of the earth,

00:14:04.527 --> 00:14:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were thinking the end is coming in 1975.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at all the growth since the 1970’s.

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had about two million back in the 1970’s

00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:15.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were Witnesses of the true God.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re approaching nine million.

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion, as closing thoughts,

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is priceless
from that same <i>Watchtower:</i>

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s advancing theocratic society

00:14:29.018 --> 00:14:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be a going concern,
a go-forward organization,

00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right down to
and through the ‘great tribulation.’”

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:41.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like I’ve told brothers for a long time,

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the recent changes from RBC to now—

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is all new world construction
going on here.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re taking this over.

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Armageddon,
you’re going to just keep on working,

00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:54.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others will be trained.

00:14:54.543 --> 00:14:56.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then further:

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The worship of God,”
<i>The Watchtower</i><i> </i><i> </i>said,

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with spirit and truth is positive,

00:15:02.851 --> 00:15:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enthusiastic, spirited and progressive.”

00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this is profound:

00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More and more sections of the earth,

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:14.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in Western lands,
in the Orient and elsewhere,

00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are now receiving a thorough witness,

00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:20.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and who knows how much farther
the ‘glorious good news’

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be sounded . . . before the end!”

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:24.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, God knows.

00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at the sound of the good news

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being all over the earth

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:32.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘the most distant parts of the earth.’

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may all of us beg Jehovah

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to empower us

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep worshipping him
“with spirit and truth”

00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enthusiasm and zeal

00:15:43.892 --> 00:15:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have work to do!

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:57.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Morris.

00:15:57.439 --> 00:16:01.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the words of 1 Chronicles 28:10,

00:16:01.176 --> 00:16:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will “be courageous and go to work.”

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this time, we ask the question,

00:16:07.783 --> 00:16:10.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Do We Have to Fear?”

00:16:10.152 --> 00:16:14.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson
will address that question now for us.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Revelation 12:17,

00:16:20.429 --> 00:16:24.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible makes clear
that all of God’s people,

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:28.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every one of you here in this room

00:16:28.537 --> 00:16:31.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every servant of God around this earth

00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:35.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who support Jehovah’s anointed ones,

00:16:35.477 --> 00:16:38.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in a war.

00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:40.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now read this thought with me

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 12:17.

00:16:44.286 --> 00:16:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:50.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the dragon
became enraged at the woman

00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and went off to wage war
with the remaining ones of her offspring,

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:58.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who observe the commandments of God

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:01.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and have the work of bearing witness

00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:04.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning Jesus.”

00:17:04.873 --> 00:17:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does it mean?

00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our dear Brother Morris would say:

00:17:09.478 --> 00:17:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cheer up!
Things are only going to get worse.”

00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we are in this spiritual war,

00:17:19.988 --> 00:17:22.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we expect?

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With every war

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes intense, intense hatred.

00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:32.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not surprisingly,
Jesus made it clear

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his servants
would not just be disliked,

00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what did Jesus say?

00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:43.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together at Matthew 24:9

00:17:45.714 --> 00:17:50.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 24:9.

00:17:50.285 --> 00:17:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:17:52.287 --> 00:17:55.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then people
will hand you over to tribulation

00:17:55.924 --> 00:17:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and will kill you,

00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will be hated by all the nations

00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:05.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on account of my name.”

00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:09.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, what do we expect?

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect the hatred of all,

00:18:14.143 --> 00:18:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus said, “all the nations”

00:18:16.879 --> 00:18:20.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just Eritrea, not just Russia,

00:18:20.949 --> 00:18:23.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “all the nations.”

00:18:23.552 --> 00:18:28.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is something else
that we also must expect in a war.

00:18:28.223 --> 00:18:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a very famous quote that says,

00:18:30.826 --> 00:18:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In war, the first casualty is truth.”

00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:40.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is exactly what Jesus warned
would happen to God’s people.

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:45.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Matthew chapter 5,

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:11, he said:

00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are you when people
reproach you and persecute you

00:18:55.017 --> 00:18:57.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then notice this]

00:18:57.152 --> 00:19:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:19:02.157 --> 00:19:05.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against you for my sake.”

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, what’s the point?

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:12.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are in a war.

00:19:13.468 --> 00:19:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we expect
to “be hated by all the nations.”

00:19:18.373 --> 00:19:21.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we expect that people

00:19:21.777 --> 00:19:26.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will “say every sort of wicked thing”

00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:28.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against us.

00:19:28.517 --> 00:19:30.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with that in mind,

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good for us to ask this question:

00:19:33.856 --> 00:19:37.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we have to fear?

00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:41.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well-known statesman Franklin Roosevelt said,

00:19:41.196 --> 00:19:46.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The only thing
that we have to fear is fear itself.”

00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he’s not completely correct,

00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:52.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there’s certainly
a note of truth in what he said.

00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:55.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, fear is a powerful weapon

00:19:55.177 --> 00:19:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hand
of our great adversary, Satan the Devil.

00:19:59.348 --> 00:20:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will use that weapon against us.

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:06.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the danger?

00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:11.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, brothers,
when we are afraid, or we are terrified,

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:16.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can then be controlled by our enemies.

00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul made this very clear

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:21.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what he said here
in Hebrews the second chapter.

00:20:21.036 --> 00:20:22.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you read this with me, please?

00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:26.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in Hebrews chapter 2;

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:29.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look in verse 14.

00:20:29.511 --> 00:20:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Therefore, since the ‘young children’

00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are sharers of blood and flesh,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he also similarly shared in the same things,

00:20:38.553 --> 00:20:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that through his death

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:43.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice this, through his death]

00:20:43.692 --> 00:20:45.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he might bring to nothing

00:20:45.694 --> 00:20:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one having
the means to cause death, 

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is, the Devil,

00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he might
[do what? that he might]

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“set free all those who were held in slavery

00:20:58.774 --> 00:21:03.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all their lives by their fear of death.”

00:21:05.147 --> 00:21:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the apostle Paul
praised Jehovah for the gift of Christ Jesus.

00:21:09.785 --> 00:21:11.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why?

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he knew that all of those

00:21:14.122 --> 00:21:17.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would put faith
in the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus

00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be set free.

00:21:19.995 --> 00:21:22.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But set free from what?

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:26.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says that it’s from the slavery

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the “fear of death.”

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:32.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that significant?

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:36.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
people who are in fear of death

00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are constantly afraid.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as a result,
they can be manipulated and controlled.

00:21:43.452 --> 00:21:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, take, for example,
the Nuremberg trials

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that occurred at the end
of the second world war.

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Various Nazis who
had committed horrible, terrible atrocities

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were brought to justice.

00:21:56.665 --> 00:21:58.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when these individuals,
both men and women,

00:21:58.934 --> 00:22:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were asked the simple question,

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:05.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How could you do these terrible things?”

00:22:05.107 --> 00:22:07.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did they say?

00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:09.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We had no choice.

00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:11.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we didn’t obey,

00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would put us to death.”

00:22:14.483 --> 00:22:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those people could be manipulated;

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could be controlled;

00:22:19.654 --> 00:22:23.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could even get them
to do the most wicked things

00:22:23.492 --> 00:22:26.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were afraid.

00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have complete confidence

00:22:29.498 --> 00:22:32.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we have put our full confidence

00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:40.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ransom sacrifice
of his Son, Jesus Christ,

00:22:40.876 --> 00:22:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can do
what the apostle Paul says here

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Philippians chapter 1.

00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:48.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you read it with me?

00:22:48.216 --> 00:22:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Philippians 1:28,

00:22:54.489 --> 00:22:56.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says:

00:22:56.491 --> 00:23:00.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And in no way being frightened

00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:03.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by your opponents.

00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:08.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This very thing
is a proof of destruction for them,

00:23:08.003 --> 00:23:11.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but of salvation for you;

00:23:11.139 --> 00:23:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is from God.”

00:23:15.077 --> 00:23:18.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, brothers,
that confidence in Jehovah

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the ransom sacrifice
of Christ can set us free,

00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we are not afraid
of our opponents.

00:23:27.089 --> 00:23:29.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But another thing that can help us

00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:32.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome the fear of persecution

00:23:32.994 --> 00:23:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is realizing something very important,

00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is that Jehovah will allow

00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:43.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our enemies to go only so far.

00:23:43.238 --> 00:23:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember the text
in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.

00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s read this,

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Corinthians 10:13.

00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:56.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul says:

00:23:56.651 --> 00:24:00.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No temptation has come upon you
except what is common to men.

00:24:00.755 --> 00:24:03.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God is faithful,

00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:05.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will not let you be tempted

00:24:05.327 --> 00:24:07.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beyond what you can bear,

00:24:07.395 --> 00:24:09.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but along with the temptation

00:24:09.931 --> 00:24:13.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will also make the way out

00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:17.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may be able to endure it.”

00:24:17.072 --> 00:24:20.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a promise from our God, Jehovah.

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will only allow our enemies to go so far.

00:24:26.982 --> 00:24:29.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a well-known illustration from a book

00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:32.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was written in the 1600’s,

00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:37.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it shows a path
that leads off to the final goal,

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:42.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on either side of the path,
there are lions.

00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:45.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The caption to the illustration says:

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:48.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The lions were chained,

00:24:48.537 --> 00:24:52.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t see the chains.”

00:24:52.774 --> 00:24:54.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the point?

00:24:54.809 --> 00:24:59.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
we may encounter lions along our path

00:24:59.381 --> 00:25:03.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our journey to the new world.

00:25:03.552 --> 00:25:06.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do we need to remember?

00:25:06.655 --> 00:25:11.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every one of those lions is chained.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we must look,

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not at the lions, brothers,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at the chains.

00:25:20.302 --> 00:25:24.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we concentrate
on the fact that Jehovah loves us,

00:25:24.673 --> 00:25:26.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he loves his people,

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will never allow
Satan or his agents to do anything

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:34.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will permanently harm us,

00:25:34.382 --> 00:25:37.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fear of our persecutors

00:25:37.586 --> 00:25:40.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begins to dwindle away.

00:25:40.388 --> 00:25:45.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see the lion,
remember, don’t stare at the lion.

00:25:45.327 --> 00:25:47.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stare at the chain.

00:25:48.997 --> 00:25:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, brothers,
I come back to the question,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What then do we have to fear?

00:25:54.836 --> 00:25:56.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible tells us.

00:25:56.671 --> 00:25:59.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here in Psalm 111

00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:04.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 111:10.

00:26:07.616 --> 00:26:12.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The fear of Jehovah
is the beginning of wisdom.

00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:17.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those observing his orders
show good insight.

00:26:17.559 --> 00:26:21.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His praise endures forever.”

00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:23.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what we do have to fear.

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to have a wholesome fear

00:26:26.468 --> 00:26:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:26:28.637 --> 00:26:32.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That wholesome fear of displeasing
the Almighty God of the universe

00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our compass.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows us the way;

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:40.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us what we need to do.

00:26:40.382 --> 00:26:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how much opposition
may come upon us,

00:26:44.252 --> 00:26:48.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what form
that opposition may take,

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we are God-fearing men and women,

00:26:52.661 --> 00:26:56.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will know exactly what we need to do.

00:26:56.097 --> 00:26:57.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you agree?

00:27:03.772 --> 00:27:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, brothers, this is not theory.

00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:08.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters around the world

00:27:08.276 --> 00:27:12.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are living examples of the truths
that we have just discussed.

00:27:12.981 --> 00:27:15.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video

00:27:15.684 --> 00:27:18.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that contains heartfelt comments

00:27:18.186 --> 00:27:22.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from persecuted brothers
and sisters in Russia,

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:27.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see why we have
no reason to fear persecution.

00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was horrified when several masked officers
broke down two doors

00:27:35.337 --> 00:27:38.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and burst into the home
where the meeting was being held.

00:27:38.773 --> 00:27:41.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything happened at once

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:44.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—loud sounds, noise, the order:

00:27:44.446 --> 00:27:46.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone sit on the floor!”

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:54.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was overcome with fear
when they put me in handcuffs,

00:27:54.522 --> 00:27:57.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
placed me in the police van,
and took me to jail.

00:27:57.292 --> 00:28:00.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid because I didn’t know

00:28:00.161 --> 00:28:03.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how long I would be there
and what was awaiting me.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was being interrogated,

00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid that I might be unfaithful
to Jehovah and let my brothers down.

00:28:12.006 --> 00:28:16.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being detained, I was mostly afraid
about what I would face in prison

00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:19.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whom I would encounter, how to act,

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how others would treat me—the unknown.

00:28:28.623 --> 00:28:33.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When one of the officers began
to describe how bad life is behind bars,

00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I imagined that behind
the officer stood an angel

00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:39.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like the one who
supported Daniel in the illustration.

00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:43.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helped me to calm down
and not to panic or be afraid.

00:28:43.037 --> 00:28:45.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Jehovah supported me.

00:28:48.576 --> 00:28:51.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the first court appearance,
when I was brought out,

00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:55.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers’ feelings impelled them
to show support somehow,

00:28:55.049 --> 00:28:56.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they began applauding.

00:28:56.684 --> 00:29:00.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How that encouraged me
that they were with me!

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fervent and sincere prayers to Jehovah

00:29:04.692 --> 00:29:06.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to cope with these fears.

00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:11.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:15 gave me much support.

00:29:11.266 --> 00:29:13.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that tranquility and trust

00:29:13.701 --> 00:29:16.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah are now the most important things.

00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:19.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understanding this made things
much easier for me.

00:29:20.775 --> 00:29:25.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We took the elevator down
to the first floor, the doors opened,

00:29:25.547 --> 00:29:29.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there stood a large crowd
of our brothers and sisters

00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and they all began clapping.

00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:36.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that, my emotions just welled up,

00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:39.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got a lump in my throat.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if I had wings;

00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:45.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt the “great cloud of witnesses.”

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:51.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
for calmness, courage, and wisdom

00:29:51.773 --> 00:29:55.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he help me
not to bring reproach on his holy name.

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost immediately, “the peace of God”

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came over me, and I was calm.

00:30:01.282 --> 00:30:04.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unpleasant sensations did not go away,

00:30:04.219 --> 00:30:06.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was no longer afraid.

00:30:09.757 --> 00:30:14.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While overcoming our fear, my wife and I
tried to go out in service every day.

00:30:14.762 --> 00:30:16.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you don’t concentrate on yourself

00:30:16.998 --> 00:30:20.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but focus on helping others, fear disappears.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that helped me
to cope with my fears

00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:27.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is hope,

00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:30.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at the situation
through Jehovah’s eyes,

00:30:30.678 --> 00:30:33.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing what will happen next,

00:30:33.348 --> 00:30:36.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is not the end of the situation,

00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:39.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only a difficult phase
through which you can pass.

00:30:41.523 --> 00:30:45.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was helped to cope
with my fear by the words of the song:

00:30:45.193 --> 00:30:47.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take one day at a time;

00:30:47.195 --> 00:30:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“leave tomorrow until tomorrow;

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:51.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace is what I find.”

00:30:51.966 --> 00:30:56.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that it was important
to solve problems as they came up 

00:30:56.504 --> 00:30:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to be troubled
by what might never happen.

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:02.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear is interesting;

00:31:02.577 --> 00:31:05.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, in principle, fear can be 

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:10.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside a person, and if someone
is afraid, that is not shameful.

00:31:10.018 --> 00:31:12.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you overcome this fear?

00:31:13.588 --> 00:31:16.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you get the fear under your control?

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you overcome this surge of negativity?

00:31:21.429 --> 00:31:24.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when my heart persuaded me to get scared,

00:31:24.332 --> 00:31:26.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then I started to pray.

00:31:26.768 --> 00:31:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah to give me courage

00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:33.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not be afraid of anyone or anything.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still say to myself,

00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:39.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Feliks, do not fear anybody
or anything except Jehovah!’

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
I really appreciate your support.

00:31:46.554 --> 00:31:49.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very happy for all your letters,

00:31:49.524 --> 00:31:52.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all your thoughts, for all your prayers.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciate it a lot.

00:31:54.395 --> 00:31:56.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to do my best,

00:31:56.531 --> 00:31:59.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to serve Jehovah
in the best way that I can.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will do that forever!

00:32:39.807 --> 00:32:43.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we know that persecution

00:32:43.144 --> 00:32:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is coming to us too.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we trust in Jehovah

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overcome any fear
that we have of our opposers.

00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:57.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we be confident
that any lions on our path are chained.

00:32:57.892 --> 00:33:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the chains, not the lions.

00:33:02.797 --> 00:33:07.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may we be ever guided
by our wholesome fear of Jehovah God.

00:33:07.802 --> 00:33:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you determined to fear nothing

00:33:11.105 --> 00:33:14.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except our wonderful God, Jehovah?

00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:23.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I ask you,
What do we have to fear?

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:32.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for answering
this question about fear so eloquently.

00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:36.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we are looking forward to the discussion

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:40.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Jackson on the interesting theme

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:44.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Completely Sober?”

00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:47.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess so, looking at the time.

00:33:50.645 --> 00:33:54.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you completely sober?

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:57.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know what you’re thinking: ‘Really?

00:33:57.285 --> 00:33:59.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Seriously?

00:33:59.353 --> 00:34:01.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The answer is obvious, isn’t it?

00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:03.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’ve been in this Assembly Hall for hours,

00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s no opportunity to drink.’

00:34:07.195 --> 00:34:11.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the answer to the question
seems rather obvious, doesn’t it?

00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:15.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before you dismiss
this question completely,

00:34:15.737 --> 00:34:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could there be
some other meaning to this question,

00:34:19.874 --> 00:34:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual meaning?

00:34:21.876 --> 00:34:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer, of course, is yes.

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:27.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when we look at the Greek text

00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:29.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon which the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:31.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were translated from,

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:36.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we notice that literally
the term “to be sober”

00:34:36.257 --> 00:34:39.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs a number of times.

00:34:39.327 --> 00:34:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, the Christian Greek Scriptures
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:45.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not actually use the words “to be sober.”

00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:47.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me, if you will,

00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:54.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 1 Peter 1:13.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have a device,
you can also quickly look

00:34:58.279 --> 00:35:00.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the <i>Kingdom Interlinear</i><i> </i>

00:35:00.314 --> 00:35:02.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you wish to verify this.

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:05.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But 1 Peter 1:13

00:35:05.653 --> 00:35:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and just the beginning of this verse),

00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:11.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“So brace up your minds for activity;

00:35:11.893 --> 00:35:15.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep your senses completely.”

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:19.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greek expression here could be translated

00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:23.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “being sober perfectly.”

00:35:23.504 --> 00:35:26.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice that we have
the expression translated

00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:30.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “keep your senses completely.”

00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:33.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that raises the interesting question,

00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why didn’t
the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:39.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say “to be sober”

00:35:39.954 --> 00:35:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “to be completely sober”?

00:35:42.623 --> 00:35:44.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer to that question

00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:48.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
goes back to your initial reaction
when you heard the title of this talk.

00:35:48.696 --> 00:35:52.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be honest, when you heard
“Are You Completely Sober?”

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you think of immediately?

00:35:54.936 --> 00:35:57.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Drinking alcohol or avoiding it.

00:35:57.872 --> 00:36:00.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the majority of times

00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:03.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this expression
occurs in the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it does not specifically refer
to avoiding alcohol

00:36:07.982 --> 00:36:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or becoming intoxicated with alcohol.

00:36:11.285 --> 00:36:16.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it has a larger figurative meaning.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for us to follow
the admonition “to be sober,”

00:36:21.295 --> 00:36:25.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to know, really,
what the Bible means by that expression.

00:36:25.399 --> 00:36:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is included in that?

00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:29.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we’re going to briefly do

00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:32.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is look at four different ways

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:36:34.642 --> 00:36:38.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has covered this expression.

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:41.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by looking
at the different ways in English

00:36:41.582 --> 00:36:43.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this has been translated,

00:36:43.584 --> 00:36:46.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what really is involved

00:36:46.254 --> 00:36:49.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this expression “to be sober.”

00:36:49.223 --> 00:36:50.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s start.

00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn with me, please,
to 1 Timothy chapter 3—

00:36:55.897 --> 00:36:57.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And immediately we remember

00:36:57.899 --> 00:36:59.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that 1 Timothy chapter 3

00:36:59.934 --> 00:37:01.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is talking about the qualifications

00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:04.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for overseers, and also it mentions

00:37:04.372 --> 00:37:06.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sisters should do.

00:37:06.407 --> 00:37:08.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 2 and verse 11

00:37:08.676 --> 00:37:11.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we won’t read it but glancing at it),

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:13.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Greek,

00:37:13.648 --> 00:37:17.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word “to be sober” literally is there,

00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:19.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can see it
in the <i>Kingdom Interlinear.</i>

00:37:19.854 --> 00:37:21.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how is it translated?

00:37:21.222 --> 00:37:23.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t see the word “sober,” do we?

00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:25.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression there is

00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:28.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be “moderate in habits.”

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:29.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why did the brothers

00:37:29.997 --> 00:37:31.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translate it this way?

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because although it could refer

00:37:34.068 --> 00:37:37.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoiding being intoxicated,

00:37:37.438 --> 00:37:41.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has this wider meaning
of having good sense

00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:44.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to things
like conduct and speech

00:37:44.812 --> 00:37:48.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the choice of entertainment or recreation.

00:37:48.249 --> 00:37:51.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means not going to foolish extremes

00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:54.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or being erratic in our thinking

00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:57.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unbalanced in our opinions.

00:37:57.024 --> 00:38:01.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of that is involved
in this figurative meaning

00:38:01.462 --> 00:38:04.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the expression
to be “moderate in habits.”

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:07.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example
by looking at another verse

00:38:07.835 --> 00:38:12.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible as to what is involved
in not being extreme.

00:38:12.073 --> 00:38:16.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to 1 Corinthians this time

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 7:31.

00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:24.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this doesn’t use
the term in Greek “to be sober,”

00:38:24.652 --> 00:38:26.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it gives us further information

00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to what’s involved
with being moderate in habits.

00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:33.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So verse 31 says:

00:38:33.094 --> 00:38:35.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those making use of the world

00:38:35.162 --> 00:38:39.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as those not using it to the full.”

00:38:40.334 --> 00:38:42.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe we could use
this illustration to highlight it.

00:38:46.073 --> 00:38:49.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a hungry person

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:51.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wants to pick fruit from a tree.

00:38:51.746 --> 00:38:54.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a person who’s not unbalanced

00:38:54.782 --> 00:38:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doesn’t go to extremes perhaps would be

00:38:57.351 --> 00:38:59.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happy just to get enough fruit

00:38:59.353 --> 00:39:01.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to satisfy his hunger

00:39:01.389 --> 00:39:04.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe to get a few extra pieces of fruit

00:39:04.992 --> 00:39:06.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he could take some home.

00:39:06.994 --> 00:39:11.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a person who was to ‘use it to the full’

00:39:11.532 --> 00:39:13.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that type of person

00:39:13.534 --> 00:39:15.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who after they’ve collected everything

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can get (more than they could ever use),

00:39:18.873 --> 00:39:22.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they see the one piece
of fruit right up at the top

00:39:22.143 --> 00:39:24.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have to have it,

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:27.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it involves a certain risk.

00:39:27.982 --> 00:39:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the apostle Paul

00:39:30.217 --> 00:39:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said under inspiration

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we
‘shouldn’t use the world to the full,’

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:38.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symbolically,
we could say, it’s just like this

00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:43.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not trying to get
<i>everything </i> out of this world.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what sort of symbolic fruit

00:39:45.566 --> 00:39:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might we be tempted with?

00:39:47.568 --> 00:39:50.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are so many opportunities today

00:39:50.337 --> 00:39:53.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for education, recreation, entertainment,

00:39:53.474 --> 00:39:57.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
travel, vacations, employment, and business.

00:39:57.778 --> 00:40:02.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we truly sober
when it comes to those things,

00:40:02.249 --> 00:40:07.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are we like the person
who is trying to grab every opportunity

00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:09.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use the world to the full?

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at a second example
of this Greek word being used

00:40:14.895 --> 00:40:19.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 4:7.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 4:7 says:

00:40:23.304 --> 00:40:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the end of all things
has drawn close.

00:40:26.273 --> 00:40:28.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, be sound in mind,

00:40:28.709 --> 00:40:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be vigilant.”

00:40:30.744 --> 00:40:32.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice the footnote says,

00:40:32.746 --> 00:40:35.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or ‘alert; awake.’”

00:40:35.683 --> 00:40:38.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you look at the <i>Kingdom Interlinear,</i>

00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:41.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Be you sober.”

00:40:41.122 --> 00:40:43.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this case,

00:40:43.157 --> 00:40:45.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers translated

00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:47.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the literal term in Greek, “sober,”

00:40:47.294 --> 00:40:50.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be “vigilant,” or “alert” and “awake.”

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:52.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With regard to what?

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With regard to our prayers.

00:40:54.902 --> 00:40:58.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that the apostle Peter
was inspired to say these words.

00:40:58.839 --> 00:41:00.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt he remembered the time

00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:03.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wasn’t 
‘vigilant with regard to prayers,’

00:41:03.344 --> 00:41:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus said “keep praying” constantly

00:41:06.747 --> 00:41:08.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:41:08.749 --> 00:41:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
Peter would have remembered what resulted

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:16.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of that lack
of being sober in a spiritual sense.

00:41:16.123 --> 00:41:18.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what about us?

00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we vigilant with regard to prayers?

00:41:21.529 --> 00:41:24.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we pray to Jehovah constantly,

00:41:24.198 --> 00:41:27.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we have an opportunity
right through the day?

00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:30.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we only just pray
when we wake up in the morning,

00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:34.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we eat,
and before we go to bed at night?

00:41:34.241 --> 00:41:38.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for us
to ‘be vigilant with regard to prayers,’

00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:41.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we constantly have Jehovah in our minds,

00:41:41.448 --> 00:41:43.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can truly say that we are,

00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:46.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a symbolic sense, sober.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a third example

00:41:48.856 --> 00:41:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,

00:41:53.894 --> 00:41:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us remember very clearly

00:41:55.529 --> 00:41:59.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the words in verse 33 about bad associations,

00:41:59.433 --> 00:42:02.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this verse is verse 34

00:42:02.403 --> 00:42:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the same context.

00:42:04.438 --> 00:42:05.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does it start?

00:42:05.806 --> 00:42:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Come to your senses

00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:11.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a righteous way.”

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:13.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, if we look at the literal rendering

00:42:13.414 --> 00:42:14.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Greek, it says:

00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sober you up.”

00:42:17.484 --> 00:42:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is this talking about?

00:42:20.187 --> 00:42:22.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the study note of our Bible

00:42:22.556 --> 00:42:26.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and of course, you can only get this
in the electronic form at the moment),

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Come to your senses:

00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:31.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul here uses a Greek word

00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:34.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that literally means ‘to sober up.’

00:42:34.168 --> 00:42:36.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because some of the Corinthian Christians

00:42:36.737 --> 00:42:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave ear to apostate teachings,

00:42:39.373 --> 00:42:42.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as the denial of the resurrection,

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:45.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they were in a spiritual stupor of sorts,

00:42:45.512 --> 00:42:49.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“confused and disoriented as if drunk.

00:42:49.049 --> 00:42:51.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul thus urges them to wake up,

00:42:51.652 --> 00:42:53.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to shake off their confusion

00:42:53.787 --> 00:42:57.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by getting a clear understanding
of the teaching of the resurrection.

00:42:57.858 --> 00:43:00.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They needed to do so before their stupor

00:43:00.961 --> 00:43:05.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led them to spiritual sickness
and even death.”

00:43:05.566 --> 00:43:09.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do we see why the brothers
translated it this way?

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come to your senses” is not just talking

00:43:12.573 --> 00:43:14.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about drinking wine or beer,

00:43:14.742 --> 00:43:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s talking
about avoiding bad associates

00:43:19.613 --> 00:43:22.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who give wrong ideas.

00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:27.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So could it be that we may be affected
by the opinions of some,

00:43:27.087 --> 00:43:29.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even within the congregation,

00:43:29.089 --> 00:43:32.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who say,
“Is the end really so close?”

00:43:32.359 --> 00:43:36.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “Is what the world offers
really that bad?”

00:43:36.797 --> 00:43:40.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if we were to be tempted to believe

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every account or report on the Internet

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:46.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to those taking
the lead in the organization,

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we just quickly believe those things?

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or worse still, do we search the Internet

00:43:52.813 --> 00:43:57.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking for juicy stories
about other Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:43:57.785 --> 00:44:01.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to remember
that Satan is “the father of the lie.”

00:44:01.088 --> 00:44:03.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s an expert at lying,

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:07.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he makes sure there are
plenty of lies for us to come across.

00:44:07.294 --> 00:44:10.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we are sober spiritually,

00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this means we won’t get fooled

00:44:13.767 --> 00:44:16.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or tricked by false stories.

00:44:16.403 --> 00:44:19.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fourth and final example

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:23.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to share with you
is in 1 Thessalonians

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians 5:6.

00:44:27.548 --> 00:44:29.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here again in the Greek text,

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the word “sober,”

00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:34.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it’s literally translated into English.

00:44:34.955 --> 00:44:36.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 6 says: “So, then,

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:39.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us not sleep on as the rest do,

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but let us stay awake

00:44:41.495 --> 00:44:43.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [notice, this is the expression]

00:44:43.497 --> 00:44:46.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep our senses.”

00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:49.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the context of this verse?

00:44:49.803 --> 00:44:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s talking
about ‘Jehovah’s day coming as a thief.’

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s talking about those saying
“Peace and security!”

00:44:56.844 --> 00:44:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this sense,
to “be sober” means

00:44:59.246 --> 00:45:01.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know the time we’re living in.

00:45:01.281 --> 00:45:04.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not only spiritually awake,
but we’re alert.

00:45:04.485 --> 00:45:06.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of this illustration:

00:45:06.487 --> 00:45:08.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There could be a guard,

00:45:08.489 --> 00:45:11.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that guard is totally awake,

00:45:11.225 --> 00:45:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’s watching

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the tournament on the television

00:45:15.396 --> 00:45:19.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe it’s football,
something he’s excited about.

00:45:19.099 --> 00:45:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not alert to the dangers

00:45:21.435 --> 00:45:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are lurking.

00:45:23.437 --> 00:45:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a similar way,

00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:28.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to be totally awake spiritually

00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:30.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and alert to what is happening

00:45:30.844 --> 00:45:33.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the dangers that present themselves,

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as getting involved
with the political issues

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we see in the world today.

00:45:39.052 --> 00:45:41.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do so would make us part of the world.

00:45:41.789 --> 00:45:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have to focus on God’s Kingdom

00:45:45.259 --> 00:45:47.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only true solution.

00:45:47.528 --> 00:45:50.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what it means to be sober.

00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:55.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve seen
those four aspects of this literal word

00:45:55.903 --> 00:45:59.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it’s translated
into English as “being sober.”

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why is that so important?

00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:46:03.644 --> 00:46:06.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it’s been already presented
on this program,

00:46:06.647 --> 00:46:11.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know challenging times
are in front of us.

00:46:11.218 --> 00:46:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to be completely sober

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:18.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we face those challenges.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year is a special year;

00:46:20.661 --> 00:46:22.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it marks 100 years

00:46:22.963 --> 00:46:27.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the appointment
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:30.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That slave, when we look back
over the 100 years,

00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:34.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has remained awake, spiritually speaking,

00:46:34.274 --> 00:46:38.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and alert and has kept on reminding us
of the need to do that.

00:46:38.912 --> 00:46:40.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true.

00:46:40.047 --> 00:46:41.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some might say: “Well, yes.

00:46:41.415 --> 00:46:43.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But at times,
we look back over 100 years,

00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:47.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there were times they got
excited about a certain year or time,

00:46:47.287 --> 00:46:49.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the end didn’t come at that time.”

00:46:49.756 --> 00:46:53.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just imagine if you had a watchdog

00:46:53.026 --> 00:46:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that dog barks
in the middle of the night

00:46:56.196 --> 00:46:58.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you get up and there’s nothing there,

00:46:58.198 --> 00:47:00.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you shoot the dog?

00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It only proves that the dog

00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:07.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is doing what you want it to do.

00:47:07.608 --> 00:47:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a similar way,
realize the faithful slave,

00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, in their enthusiasm,
sometimes we have said things

00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe disappointed others.

00:47:18.151 --> 00:47:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember,
the role of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:47:21.822 --> 00:47:26.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to feed us and to keep us
awake spiritually and keep us alert.

00:47:26.159 --> 00:47:30.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thinking about it,
when that day comes

00:47:30.163 --> 00:47:35.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus brings destruction
on this wicked system of things,

00:47:35.168 --> 00:47:37.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where do you want to be?

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:39.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a beach drinking a martini?

00:47:41.241 --> 00:47:46.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
climbing a symbolic tree
to get the last bit of fruit from this world?

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you want to be
busy in Jehovah’s service,

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:52.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s building and preaching
and all the things we need to do?

00:47:52.553 --> 00:47:54.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know the answer.

00:47:54.054 --> 00:47:59.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, but to do that,
we have to remain sober spiritually.

00:47:59.026 --> 00:48:03.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one final point,
if we look in the <i>Insight </i> volume

00:48:03.363 --> 00:48:05.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the heading “Soberness,”

00:48:05.399 --> 00:48:07.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a very interesting point,

00:48:07.734 --> 00:48:10.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Peter and Paul

00:48:10.504 --> 00:48:13.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used this expression in Greek.

00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the <i>Insight </i> volume
makes this very interesting comment.

00:48:16.944 --> 00:48:20.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “In keeping his senses,

00:48:20.213 --> 00:48:22.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Timothy was to realize that Paul

00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:25.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not be on the scene much longer.”

00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it says about Peter:

00:48:27.621 --> 00:48:31.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Peter likewise knew
that he and his fellow apostles

00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:33.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not be on hand much longer.’

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it goes on to say:

00:48:35.562 --> 00:48:37.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Knowing the seriousness of the times,

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:40.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with growing persecution from the world,

00:48:40.767 --> 00:48:45.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they should be 
sound in mind, watchful, vigilant,

00:48:45.005 --> 00:48:47.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and should not neglect serious prayer,

00:48:47.608 --> 00:48:52.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obtain the strength
they would need for endurance.”

00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:55.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the faithful slave has been serving us

00:48:55.482 --> 00:48:58.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with spiritual food for 100 years.

00:48:58.418 --> 00:49:00.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, friends, remember,

00:49:00.587 --> 00:49:04.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faithful slave will not always be here.

00:49:04.191 --> 00:49:07.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon will come the time
when the remaining ones of the anointed

00:49:07.928 --> 00:49:10.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be taken to have their reward.

00:49:10.864 --> 00:49:14.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
Jehovah will continue to care for us.

00:49:14.234 --> 00:49:17.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always has a provision
in place to care for us.

00:49:17.838 --> 00:49:19.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is the important thing?

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it that the faithful slave
wants to convey to us?

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just the same as Paul and Peter

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to convey
to those to whom they wrote,

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:34.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to convey to you
the importance of each one of us

00:49:34.354 --> 00:49:36.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being moderate in habits,

00:49:36.456 --> 00:49:38.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vigilant with regard to prayers,

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:42.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeping our senses,
not being distracted by false stories,

00:49:42.529 --> 00:49:45.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being alert to the time
in which we’re living.

00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:48.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we leave you with that question,

00:49:48.168 --> 00:49:50.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sober?

00:49:50.203 --> 00:49:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you <i>completely </i> sober?

00:50:01.281 --> 00:50:05.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we certainly appreciate
this sobering talk.

00:50:05.852 --> 00:50:09.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will now be interested
to hear what Brother Kenneth Cook

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:12.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to say on the topic

00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:14.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will You Care for It?”

00:50:14.828 --> 00:50:16.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Cook, please.

00:50:16.997 --> 00:50:21.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We care for the things
that are important to us, don’t we?

00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:24.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are many of such things.

00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:26.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
we care for our families,

00:50:26.973 --> 00:50:31.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we care for our friends,
we care for our ministry,

00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:35.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and above all,
we care for our worship of Jehovah.

00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:40.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do this faithfully to the very end.

00:50:40.253 --> 00:50:44.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others need us,
we’re there for them, as we’ve seen today.

00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:48.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During times
of natural disasters, civil unrest,

00:50:48.061 --> 00:50:53.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and severe opposition to our work,
we are there for one another.

00:50:53.066 --> 00:50:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to all of that,
our love must also, though,

00:50:57.604 --> 00:51:00.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be great enough to care for those

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom we try to reach in our public ministry.

00:51:03.977 --> 00:51:08.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this, Jesus set the example for us.

00:51:08.815 --> 00:51:12.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can feel
his caring attitude in what he said

00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 9:36-38.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please follow along at Matthew 9:36.

00:51:23.296 --> 00:51:25.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“On seeing the crowds,

00:51:25.766 --> 00:51:28.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he felt pity for them,

00:51:28.201 --> 00:51:30.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they were
skinned and thrown about

00:51:30.604 --> 00:51:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“like sheep without a shepherd.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he said to his disciples:

00:51:35.876 --> 00:51:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, the harvest is great,
but the workers are few.

00:51:40.213 --> 00:51:42.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest

00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:46.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to send out workers into his harvest.’”

00:51:46.553 --> 00:51:50.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus felt pity for the people, didn’t he?

00:51:50.557 --> 00:51:53.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does pity mean in this case?

00:51:53.994 --> 00:51:58.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pity mentioned here
stems from heartfelt love.

00:51:58.932 --> 00:52:02.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved the people.
We love people.

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:04.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a tender feeling toward persons

00:52:04.971 --> 00:52:08.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a state of need or suffering.

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:10.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, our love for others

00:52:10.911 --> 00:52:15.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must include genuine care for them
—even pity for them—

00:52:15.682 --> 00:52:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re moved to help them,

00:52:18.151 --> 00:52:21.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hoping that they respond to God’s Word

00:52:21.521 --> 00:52:25.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will desire to do Jehovah’s will.

00:52:25.125 --> 00:52:28.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we must do this
because caring for others

00:52:28.361 --> 00:52:32.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an important part
of following the Christ, right?

00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:36.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a few minutes,
we will look at how we can remain focused

00:52:36.436 --> 00:52:40.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on compassionately carrying out our ministry

00:52:40.273 --> 00:52:44.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping people
to dedicate their lives to God.

00:52:44.444 --> 00:52:49.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will include revealing
what our yeartext is for 2020.

00:52:49.416 --> 00:52:52.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Brother Lett said earlier,
“Stay tuned.”

00:52:52.986 --> 00:52:54.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we get to that, though,

00:52:54.988 --> 00:52:58.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll draw out
some Bible principles from long ago

00:52:58.225 --> 00:53:02.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us today
in caring for the people

00:53:02.028 --> 00:53:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must yet reach
in this important ministry, or work.

00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since ancient times,

00:53:08.735 --> 00:53:13.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has taught his people
how to care for others.

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:16.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Israelites
were told to show consideration

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:20.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for the animals under their care.

00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:23.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
when they were about to leave Egypt,

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:26.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave them this command

00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:29.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Exodus 12:5, 6.

00:53:29.923 --> 00:53:31.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along.

00:53:31.925 --> 00:53:35.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here is the setting:

00:53:35.428 --> 00:53:40.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives instructions
about selecting the Passover sacrifice.

00:53:40.433 --> 00:53:43.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 3 tells us that the Israelites

00:53:43.169 --> 00:53:47.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were to select the sheep
on the tenth of the month.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind,
notice what verse 5 states:

00:53:51.611 --> 00:53:55.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your sheep should be
a sound, one-year-old male.

00:53:55.615 --> 00:53:59.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You may choose
from the young rams or from the goats.

00:53:59.319 --> 00:54:02.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must care for it

00:54:02.255 --> 00:54:05.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the 14th day of this month,

00:54:05.025 --> 00:54:08.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the whole congregation
of the assembly of Israel

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:11.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must slaughter it at twilight.”

00:54:11.398 --> 00:54:14.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it important for them

00:54:14.968 --> 00:54:17.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not only select the sheep

00:54:17.137 --> 00:54:21.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to “care for it until the 14th”?

00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:24.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,
let’s draw out two principles

00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:27.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will then apply to our ministry

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and they do apply.

00:54:29.082 --> 00:54:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we know that the sacrificial sheep

00:54:32.919 --> 00:54:36.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needed to remain unblemished

00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:39.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be acceptable to Jehovah.

00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:44.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5 said: “Your sheep should be
a sound, one-year-old male.”

00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:47.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an Israelite selected a sound sheep

00:54:47.734 --> 00:54:52.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then neglected it
and the sheep was injured in some way,

00:54:52.005 --> 00:54:54.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sheep would no longer be

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
acceptable to Jehovah for sacrifice.

00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:59.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle:

00:54:59.412 --> 00:55:03.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep the sacrifice acceptable.

00:55:03.149 --> 00:55:07.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t neglect it
just because the end is close,

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can apply
that principle to our ministry.

00:55:12.158 --> 00:55:14.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, principle number two:

00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:18.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also be certain
that a measure of compassion

00:55:18.064 --> 00:55:21.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was involved in what Jehovah told them there.

00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:26.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case,
the sacrificial sheep was no less important

00:55:26.439 --> 00:55:30.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because its time,
so to speak, was short.

00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:34.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, as we’ll see in this discussion,

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this too can apply to our ministry.

00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:40.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re wise to remember these principles.

00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:44.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fittingly, it is Jehovah
who sets the example for us

00:55:44.724 --> 00:55:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in showing compassion

00:55:46.726 --> 00:55:51.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring for what is important
to the very end.

00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:56.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Foremost in this
is how Jehovah cared for Jesus

00:55:56.036 --> 00:55:59.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up to the end of his earthly ministry.

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:03.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
Jehovah showed his support for Jesus

00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by answering Jesus’ prayers.

00:56:05.945 --> 00:56:08.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, Jesus even said:

00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:13.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Father, I thank you that you have heard me.”

00:56:13.353 --> 00:56:17.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Jehovah voiced his support for Jesus.

00:56:17.857 --> 00:56:22.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At his baptism,
Jesus heard Jehovah speak from heaven,

00:56:22.128 --> 00:56:25.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating:
“This is my Son, the beloved,

00:56:25.999 --> 00:56:28.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom I have approved.”

00:56:28.935 --> 00:56:31.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how that encouraged him!

00:56:31.838 --> 00:56:34.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then later, as Jesus was in agony

00:56:34.908 --> 00:56:37.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the hours before his death,

00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:40.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an angel of God comforted Jesus,

00:56:40.547 --> 00:56:45.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt that angel
was a friend whom Jesus knew well.

00:56:45.552 --> 00:56:49.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, from the beginning to the very end,

00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:54.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cared for Jesus,
the sacrificial “Lamb of God.”

00:56:54.794 --> 00:56:58.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We benefit when we apply such principles

00:56:58.765 --> 00:57:02.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what we have been given to do today.

00:57:02.435 --> 00:57:06.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, the time is short, yes.

00:57:06.539 --> 00:57:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, our public ministry
is no less important now

00:57:11.311 --> 00:57:14.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because the end is close.

00:57:14.447 --> 00:57:16.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it’s even more important

00:57:16.616 --> 00:57:19.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we continue caring for this ministry

00:57:19.452 --> 00:57:21.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the end approaches.

00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:25.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must care for this “sacrifice of praise”

00:57:25.892 --> 00:57:28.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our heavenly Father right up to the end

00:57:28.761 --> 00:57:32.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, right up to the time
when Jehovah makes it clear

00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:37.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this part of our service to him
has come to an end.

00:57:37.237 --> 00:57:39.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until that time,

00:57:39.239 --> 00:57:43.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should be the focus
of our public ministry?

00:57:43.943 --> 00:57:46.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus stated what it should be

00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:50.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:18-20,

00:57:50.416 --> 00:57:53.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so please go to those verses.

00:57:53.119 --> 00:57:57.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, starting at Matthew 28:18,

00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:59.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:58:07.534 --> 00:58:11.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus approached
and spoke to them, saying:

00:58:11.404 --> 00:58:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘All authority has been given me
in heaven and on the earth.

00:58:15.542 --> 00:58:19.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go, therefore, and make disciples
of people of all the nations,

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:23.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:58:23.683 --> 00:58:26.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:58:26.953 --> 00:58:31.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘teaching them to observe
all the things I have commanded you.

00:58:31.858 --> 00:58:35.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And look!
I am with you all the days

00:58:35.528 --> 00:58:39.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the conclusion
of the system of things.’”

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:43.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now,
with these words of Jesus in mind,

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:47.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should be
the focus of our public ministry?

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the focus must be
to ‘make disciples of Christ

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:53.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘among people of all the nations,

00:58:53.513 --> 00:58:58.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaching them and baptizing them,’
as Jesus stated.

00:58:58.518 --> 00:59:03.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that Jesus’ statement
was more than just a command.

00:59:03.022 --> 00:59:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t start off saying:
“I command you! Go!”—right?

00:59:07.827 --> 00:59:09.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Jesus said:

00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:14.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All authority has been given me . . .
Go, therefore.”

00:59:14.968 --> 00:59:19.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ true disciples
would see beyond the command

00:59:19.872 --> 00:59:24.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
embedded in those words
and go forth with conviction.

00:59:24.244 --> 00:59:25.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:59:25.578 --> 00:59:29.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they would know
that Jesus was empowered, authorized,

00:59:29.949 --> 00:59:32.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oversee this great work

00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:35.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were now commissioned to do.

00:59:35.555 --> 00:59:39.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would be with them,
and he is with us today.

00:59:39.425 --> 00:59:42.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re absolutely confident of that fact.

00:59:42.462 --> 00:59:47.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In view of that,
how can we help our Bible students

00:59:47.267 --> 00:59:52.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that even more of them
become baptized disciples,

00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:54.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus there directed?

00:59:54.707 --> 00:59:57.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is important to consider because,

00:59:57.844 --> 01:00:01.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while many get baptized each year,

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our yearly baptism figures have remained

01:00:03.783 --> 01:00:06.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at about the same level for some time.

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:08.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, are these good figures?

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:10.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they are.

01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:11.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

01:00:11.924 --> 01:00:15.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we do
to help even more people

01:00:15.228 --> 01:00:19.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take this vital step
before the end comes?

01:00:19.732 --> 01:00:21.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,

01:00:21.734 --> 01:00:25.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s briefly consider
four ways to reach the heart.

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:29.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s much that we can do,
but we’ll just consider four ways here.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:33.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do it through what we
emphasize about Jehovah,

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:37.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we teach our students about prayer,

01:00:37.116 --> 01:00:40.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we help them get to meetings,

01:00:40.253 --> 01:00:43.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we help them handle problems.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider that first way:

01:00:46.659 --> 01:00:51.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach the heart
through what we emphasize about Jehovah.

01:00:51.664 --> 01:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal is to help our students see

01:00:54.867 --> 01:00:57.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah cares for them.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:00.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cares about them.
He loves them deeply.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we use our publications 

01:01:03.276 --> 01:01:05.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(such as the <i>Teach Us </i> book)
with our students,

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should prepare well

01:01:07.947 --> 01:01:11.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and highlight the Scriptural answers
to questions such as:

01:01:11.718 --> 01:01:14.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God care about us?

01:01:14.354 --> 01:01:17.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does God feel when people suffer?

01:01:17.323 --> 01:01:21.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it possible to be Jehovah’s friend?

01:01:21.828 --> 01:01:23.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discuss the answers,

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:27.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw out the meaning that brings us joy

01:01:27.467 --> 01:01:31.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and identify the principles
that improve our life,

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help the student
to grow ever closer to Jehovah.

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:37.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the second way:

01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:41.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach the heart through what we
teach our students about prayer.

01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:45.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show him or her how to pray properly,

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with meaning and from the heart,

01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:51.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we pray with them at each study session.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Explain that in our private prayers

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can really open up to Jehovah

01:01:56.562 --> 01:02:01.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and express feelings that we
might not share with other humans.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can also ask for God’s help

01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:07.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love only what he loves.

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we do this with confidence?

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:12.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah cares for us,

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we should make that very clear
as we teach our Bible students.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, the third way:

01:02:20.186 --> 01:02:25.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach the heart through how we
help our students get to meetings.

01:02:25.191 --> 01:02:29.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Invite your Bible student
to attend meetings as soon as possible.

01:02:29.595 --> 01:02:31.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a student sees at our meetings

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:34.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may touch his heart
and help him to progress.

01:02:34.467 --> 01:02:37.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very early on, show the video

01:02:37.403 --> 01:02:40.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</i><i> </i>

01:02:40.706 --> 01:02:45.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then warmly invite him to attend with you;
appeal to him.

01:02:45.478 --> 01:02:48.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, offer transportation if it is needed.

01:02:48.948 --> 01:02:52.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciated getting a ride
to the first meeting that I attended,

01:02:52.885 --> 01:02:54.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I still remember it.

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:57.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the fourth way:

01:02:57.089 --> 01:03:01.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach the heart through how we
help our students handle problems,

01:03:01.327 --> 01:03:03.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including problems that may develop

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:07.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone offends him or her.

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:09.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is all part of reaching the heart

01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:12.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preparing and helping them.

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:16.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bible students
need to experience Jehovah’s love

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:19.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they benefit
from applying Bible principles.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, this helps them
to know Jehovah better.

01:03:22.782 --> 01:03:26.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help them,
show your students how to use tools

01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:29.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the <i>JW Library</i>® app,

01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:33.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses, </i>

01:03:33.025 --> 01:03:35.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and jw.org®.

01:03:36.529 --> 01:03:41.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our students are trained
to search for answers before baptism,

01:03:41.467 --> 01:03:44.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will be better prepared
to handle problems

01:03:44.504 --> 01:03:46.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get along with others.

01:03:46.639 --> 01:03:50.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do these things
for our Bible students,

01:03:50.276 --> 01:03:52.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show that we are really caring

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:56.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what Jehovah has entrusted to us.

01:03:56.983 --> 01:04:00.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both Jehovah and his Son desire

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:05.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we help as many people
to the point of dedication and baptism

01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:08.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while there’s still time.

01:04:08.194 --> 01:04:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To succeed,

01:04:10.229 --> 01:04:14.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t spend time
conducting an unproductive study.

01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:19.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, focus on “those who [are]
rightly disposed for everlasting life,”

01:04:19.672 --> 01:04:24.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and care for them
with Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts.

01:04:25.811 --> 01:04:30.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, with all of this in mind,
what is our yeartext for 2020?

01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:34.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is taken from Matthew 28:19:

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples . . . ,
baptizing them.”

01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:51.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for those of you who listened
to Alexa earlier in the program

01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:53.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or read your daily text for today,

01:04:53.673 --> 01:04:56.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that this is also
the Scripture text for today,

01:04:56.509 --> 01:04:59.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
October 5, 2019.

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:01.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just a coincidence.

01:05:02.915 --> 01:05:05.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t expect it next year.

01:05:07.086 --> 01:05:09.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that text in mind,

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:12.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep putting your heart into your ministry

01:05:12.758 --> 01:05:14.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and into helping people,

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:17.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be certain to take care of this ministry

01:05:17.597 --> 01:05:19.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with those principles we considered

01:05:19.966 --> 01:05:22.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the very end.

01:05:29.775 --> 01:05:33.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much,
Brother Cook, for your presentation.

01:05:35.147 --> 01:05:38.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back on the program
that we were able to enjoy,

01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:42.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we certainly felt encouraged
by being reminded

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:45.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have no human leader

01:05:45.891 --> 01:05:48.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that it is Jesus who is our Leader.

01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:52.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what it says at Matthew 23:10:

01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:54.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Neither be called leaders,

01:05:54.967 --> 01:05:57.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your Leader is one, the Christ.”

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:02.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed also listening
to Brother Stephen Lett,

01:06:02.308 --> 01:06:05.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who emphasized that our relief ministry

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:07.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is overseen and directed by Jehovah.

01:06:09.582 --> 01:06:13.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that you also
enjoyed the four videos.

01:06:13.486 --> 01:06:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one was entitled

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:19.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘The Good Hand of Our God Is Upon Us . . .</i>
<i>Let Us Get Up and Build.’ </i>

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next video provided a historical look

01:06:22.995 --> 01:06:25.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at property acquisitions,

01:06:25.431 --> 01:06:27.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
followed by another video related

01:06:27.767 --> 01:06:32.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the new construction project
that is being planned.

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:35.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fourth video was
about the new application

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for processing applications,

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:40.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
followed by a presentation

01:06:40.212 --> 01:06:42.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a new way to access

01:06:42.515 --> 01:06:45.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jw.org® audio files.

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:49.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, we enjoyed
the Scriptural discussion,

01:06:49.522 --> 01:06:51.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“An Attack Coming From the North,”

01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:55.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented by Brother David Splane
of the Governing Body.

01:06:55.961 --> 01:06:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Samuel Herd next encouraged us

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:02.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with a <i>Study Bible. </i>

01:07:02.368 --> 01:07:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we appreciate the <i>Study Bible!</i>

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:09.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After singing a song together
and listening to greetings

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:12.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from brothers in other places and countries,

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Anthony Morris reminded us

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have work to do.

01:07:18.818 --> 01:07:23.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As indicated in the news media,
there are increasing problems in the world.

01:07:23.522 --> 01:07:25.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In certain areas, we can also see

01:07:25.524 --> 01:07:29.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
increasing hostility against God’s people.

01:07:29.662 --> 01:07:32.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed that we do not have to be fearful

01:07:35.334 --> 01:07:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Almighty is on our side.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we heard the talk

01:07:41.974 --> 01:07:46.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Geoffrey Jackson,

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Completely Sober?”

01:07:48.714 --> 01:07:51.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are if we keep our senses.

01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:57.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, Brother Kenneth Cook

01:07:57.089 --> 01:07:59.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body raised the question

01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:01.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will You Care for It?”

01:08:01.894 --> 01:08:05.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Cook reviewed
how Jehovah cared for Jesus,

01:08:05.297 --> 01:08:08.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sacrificial Lamb of God,

01:08:08.134 --> 01:08:10.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the very end of his life on earth.

01:08:10.369 --> 01:08:15.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, in harmony
with the 2020 yeartext

01:08:15.374 --> 01:08:18.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s taken from Matthew 28:19,

01:08:18.144 --> 01:08:21.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he highlighted how
we must care for our ministry

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:26.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our “sacrifice of praise”
until the very end.

01:08:26.118 --> 01:08:31.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes our efforts to help
‘those who are rightly disposed’

01:08:31.123 --> 01:08:36.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dedicate their life to Jehovah
and to get baptized.

01:08:38.264 --> 01:08:41.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have had
an encouraging time together, haven’t we?

01:08:49.675 --> 01:08:54.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we enjoyed the various videos
and also the video presentations,

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we all benefited
from the Scriptural talks

01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:00.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivered by members of the Governing Body.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we also appreciate the discussion

01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:07.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the yeartext for the coming year:

01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:11.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples . . . ,
baptizing them.”

00:00:01 We look forward to
00:00:03 Brother Anthony Morris’ thoughts
00:00:06 presented in his talk entitled
00:00:09 “We Have Work to Do!”
00:00:14 It was a great pleasure to hear all of the excitement
00:00:18 when the Ramapo project was announced to all of you here,
00:00:22 and I’m sure that was true for the other thousands that are tied in.
00:00:27 And then you saw with these videos
00:00:30 all the construction projects
00:00:32 going on all over —all over the earth.
00:00:36 So it’s quite interesting,
00:00:38 if you think about it from an imperfect, human perspective
00:00:42 (frankly, not thinking spiritually),
00:00:45 you’d say: “Well, we just dedicated the Warwick property
00:00:50 “along with Wallkill recently.
00:00:54 Now here we go down the road.”
00:01:00 Well, the preaching work obviously is premier.
00:01:05 And that’s what this is really about —the preaching work.
00:01:09 To support the preaching work
00:01:11 and to continue to feed Jehovah’s precious sheep
00:01:15 the way he wants them fed involves all this construction.
00:01:19 So God wants us to have it clear.
00:01:24 He wants you to spread this and, of course, it’ll come up in January.
00:01:28 Keep in mind, we have work to do.
00:01:32 Period.
00:01:33 So get over it.
00:01:39 Don’t get me going on vacation.
00:01:41 I’ll just tell you—
00:01:42 And I know my friends on the Governing Body,
00:01:45 and I know that you need your time.
00:01:48 I’m not trying to put you on a guilt trip, but we have a whole lot of days.
00:01:54 How do you do it with the work that’s going on?
00:01:57 You try to rest up when you can; Jehovah wants us to.
00:02:00 But we have so much work to do.
00:02:03 And we thank God for it.
00:02:04 So just to give us a little Scriptural reminder
00:02:08 of the proper attitude about work,
00:02:11 find John chapter 5.
00:02:13 And these are very familiar verses to all of you,
00:02:16 particularly the audience here in Newburgh
00:02:19 with all these decades of faithful service.
00:02:23 We treasure your service
00:02:26 and, of course, Jehovah certainly does.
00:02:29 And you’ve worked hard for decades
00:02:31 —a lot of you to whom I was talking to earlier
00:02:34 have decades in the traveling work—
00:02:36 so many wonderful, hardworking brothers and sisters.
00:02:39 So here he is, Jesus, (in John chapter 5)
00:02:42 facing these judgmental religious leaders
00:02:47 persecuting him over curing on the Sabbath.
00:02:50 Well, what we’re after here is something he reveals to us in verse 17,
00:02:55 when he’s answering them:
00:02:58 “My Father has kept working until now,
00:03:02 and I keep working.”
00:03:05 So the hardest worker in the universe is Jehovah God,
00:03:07 and Christ Jesus is right there with him.
00:03:10 Jehovah is a worker.
00:03:13 His people have to be workers.
00:03:15 That’s what he expects, and it’s such a pleasure
00:03:19 to serve the true God and work.
00:03:22 And another familiar verse in 1 Corinthians chapter 15
00:03:26 shows the proper spirit when it comes to this matter
00:03:30 of being workers, with all the work we have to do.
00:03:34 And Jehovah is seeing to it that we have all this work
00:03:38 —very familiar, verse 58 of 1 Corinthians 15:
00:03:43 “Therefore, my beloved brothers,
00:03:46 “be steadfast, immovable,
00:03:49 “[notice] always  having plenty to do
00:03:52 “in the work of the Lord,
00:03:55 knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord”
00:03:58 —plenty of work “in the work of the Lord.”
00:04:03 And then when we’re doing the work
00:04:05 (and this is crucial), as we engage in it
00:04:08 —whether it’s the preaching work or other work assignments,
00:04:12 if you’re in a Bethel assignment or a construction assignment—
00:04:15 there’s a proper spirit.
00:04:17 And find here Romans chapter 12.
00:04:21 And this we see in God’s people,
00:04:24 but we want to individually apply the counsel
00:04:27 and make sure we keep this spirit
00:04:30 or talk to God about it if it’s lacking at the moment.
00:04:34 Romans chapter 12
00:04:36 —and here’s what Christians are all about
00:04:40 when it comes to working for Jehovah,
00:04:43 verse 11: “Be industrious, not lazy.”
00:04:48 See, Jehovah does not approve of being lazy.
00:04:53 “Be aglow with the spirit.”
00:04:56 So you’re just absorbed with it.
00:04:57 There’s this zeal —just alive with it—
00:05:00 as we slave for Jehovah.
00:05:04 So he appreciates
00:05:06 an industrious, hardworking spirit,
00:05:10 and that’s what he wants from his people.
00:05:13 Now, with all of the announcements
00:05:16 and the videos with construction going on,
00:05:19 I just thought I’d share this with you.
00:05:21 It’s a very special item of mine,
00:05:24 and it came up recently.
00:05:29 You can see here the best you can.
00:05:31 The camera can pick it up,
00:05:33 and up here it says “Building Permit.”
00:05:36 And it’s a special memory for me, personally,
00:05:39 because as we had in some of the videos
00:05:42 when we were involved with the construction
00:05:45 or before construction started with the Warwick project,
00:05:50 we’d be at Tuxedo, and a lot of work was going on
00:05:54 —preparatory— looking for that day
00:05:58 when they could get started.
00:06:00 So the Governing Body would do their best to get up
00:06:03 and be encouraging (always wearing the high-vis outfits)
00:06:08 and then give a spiritual talk.
00:06:10 I think it’s the only time I’ve given a talk in high vis.
00:06:16 So this particular day was special
00:06:19 because things were moving along with the community.
00:06:22 They liked us, but I noticed Zeny (in the one video),
00:06:27 he mentioned “shovel to the ground,”
00:06:29 and that’s OK.
00:06:30 We’re different.
00:06:31 I’m calling it “shovel in the ground.”
00:06:34 Zeny is not from America,
00:06:37 so it means the same thing, Zeny,
00:06:41 so forgive me.
00:06:43 I appreciate all your hard work.
00:06:46 But any who have been involved with construction
00:06:50 (and you have a lot of folks I know here from the former Regional Building Committee
00:06:54 —all the hardworking construction),
00:06:57 it’s always been special to work on these spiritual projects.
00:07:02 Well, this particular day, there were a lot of things going on.
00:07:06 So I’m up there; it’s July 26,
00:07:09 and that date is up here in the corner.
00:07:13 It’s a Friday,
00:07:15 and it’s the year 2013 (quite a while ago).
00:07:19 So I have a talk to give to them at 1:30 p.m. after visiting some.
00:07:25 Two hours before
00:07:29 (so it must have been around 11:30),
00:07:31 they got the building permit.
00:07:34 So the Construction Project Committee
00:07:37 (and how much we love  those men and their wives)—
00:07:41 They’re there, and they said,
00:07:43 “Well, would you mind making this announcement?”
00:07:46 And I thought: ‘Boy, that timing worked out good.
00:07:49 ‘That’s quite an honor, the construction, you know,
00:07:52 and “the shovel-in-the-ground” announcement.’
00:07:55 So I gave them a little spiritual side.
00:07:58 You know, a little glory is all right for a human sometimes, you know.
00:08:05 So it was very exciting.
00:08:07 But the memory is clear to those who were there.
00:08:10 Because of the operation of holy spirit
00:08:14 and the brothers being “aglow with the spirit,” industrious,
00:08:18 when they made the announcement,
00:08:21 I’m telling you (those who were there),
00:08:24 there was joy —the thunderous applause.
00:08:28 It wasn’t anything to do with me.
00:08:30 It was that they got “the shovel in the ground.”
00:08:32 And the excitement!
00:08:34 So I was able to easily walk out of there, and they were all busy
00:08:38 —thrilled over the “shovel-in-the-ground” approval.
00:08:43 Now, the day is coming, God willing,
00:08:48 for the Ramapo project to have the “shovel in the ground.”
00:08:52 You heard when they hope that happens.
00:08:55 But it’s that beautiful spirit that glorifies Jehovah
00:08:59 when they work so hard.
00:09:01 And so we have to keep that spirit.
00:09:04 And some could say
00:09:07 (well, it happens on occasion,
00:09:09 not with a lot of God’s spiritually-minded folks):
00:09:13 “Do you believe the end is coming?
00:09:15 “So, what are you doing all this for?
00:09:18 “If the end is really close,
00:09:21 what are you doing?”
00:09:23 Well, the end is going to come
00:09:25 when Jehovah is satisfied with the preaching work.
00:09:28 But there is also a reminder here in Revelation chapter 7;
00:09:32 this is always something you can forget.
00:09:36 I noticed Brother Butler
00:09:38 touched on it in his opening prayer
00:09:41 (which, of course, we don’t record
00:09:44 the prayers for the presentation in January),
00:09:47 but Bob touched on it.
00:09:50 And Jehovah gives us enough to keep us focused on:
00:09:53 ‘You just stay busy and do my will.’
00:09:56 However, this is quite fascinating
00:09:59 at chapter 7 verses 1-3:
00:10:04 “After this I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth,
00:10:08 “holding tight the four winds of the earth,
00:10:10 “so that no wind could blow on the earth
00:10:13 “or on the sea or on any tree.
00:10:16 “And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrise,
00:10:19 “having a seal of the living God;
00:10:21 “and he called with a loud voice to the four angels
00:10:25 “to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea,
00:10:28 “saying: [and it’s loud]
00:10:30 “‘Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees,
00:10:34 “‘until after we have sealed
00:10:38 the slaves of our God in their foreheads.’”
00:10:43 Now, some individual anointed have to have a final seal
00:10:48 before they die,
00:10:50 and we’ve had a number of them die during the last days.
00:10:54 But this is talking about right before Jehovah starts,
00:10:58 or has put it in the hearts of the governments to destroy Babylon,
00:11:02 that all of those who are left on the earth,
00:11:04 the remnant —genuine, anointed disciples of Christ—
00:11:08 get the final seal.
00:11:11 And this is what’s going to take place.
00:11:13 And then after that, the great tribulation breaks out.
00:11:18 And if you keep an eye on the news to some degree
00:11:22 (if you can stomach it, to at least know what’s happening),
00:11:26 the end is definitely close.
00:11:28 There’s just no denying it.
00:11:31 We eagerly look forward to it taking place.
00:11:34 The great tribulation —it’s close.
00:11:38 However, as we eagerly await it,
00:11:41 we want to have Jehovah’s mind on the matter and wait patiently.
00:11:45 And I think about all of those
00:11:47 here in Newburgh
00:11:50 with so many years in the truth,
00:11:53 especially corporate members and their mates (if they’re married).
00:11:57 This Watchtower, we want to share it with you from 1976
00:12:01 —profound statements.
00:12:04 To this day, they ring true about this matter of the end.
00:12:09 It shows you where we are in the stream of time.
00:12:13 And Jehovah’s spirit was on them
00:12:15 (not inspired, but he captured it with them, helping them),
00:12:19 and it was just ringing, and it still rings to this day.
00:12:23 Now notice what that 1976, November 15, Watchtower  said,
00:12:27 pages 688-689.
00:12:31 And in the 17th paragraph, notice, I’m quoting it:
00:12:34 “The end does not come
00:12:36 “just because we might think it is the due date,
00:12:39 “or because we feel that our territory has been well worked.
00:12:44 “It comes when Jehovah has carried through
00:12:46 “the great work of Kingdom preaching to the extent he wants,
00:12:51 and then he will bring the ‘great tribulation.’”
00:12:55 Now listen, back in 1976:
00:12:58 “Until that time there is work to do!
00:13:04 “And we as Jehovah’s Witnesses are the ones assigned to do it!
00:13:09 “The arrival of the ‘great tribulation’
00:13:11 “should find the preaching work at the height of its forward movement,
00:13:16 “at the very peak of its momentum throughout the earth.
00:13:21 “The arrival of the Lord Jesus
00:13:23 “to execute judgment will come as a complete surprise
00:13:27 “—even to Jehovah’s people,
00:13:30 “for it will no doubt find them
00:13:34 at their busiest time of activity!”
00:13:39 Think about it.
00:13:41 Have you been busier since you’ve been in the truth
00:13:45 than you’ve been recently?
00:13:47 So we’re the busiest we’ve been
00:13:52 —hands down.
00:13:55 So it’s amazing how the slave
00:13:57 captured that right attitude in 1976.
00:14:01 And, of course, some in the truth then, at least in certain parts of the earth,
00:14:04 they were thinking the end is coming in 1975.
00:14:07 And look at all the growth since the 1970’s.
00:14:10 You had about two million back in the 1970’s
00:14:13 who were Witnesses of the true God.
00:14:15 Now we’re approaching nine million.
00:14:20 So in conclusion, as closing thoughts,
00:14:23 and this is priceless from that same Watchtower:
00:14:26 “Jehovah’s advancing theocratic society
00:14:29 “will be a going concern, a go-forward organization,
00:14:33 right down to and through the ‘great tribulation.’”
00:14:38 So like I’ve told brothers for a long time,
00:14:41 the recent changes from RBC to now—
00:14:44 This is all new world construction going on here.
00:14:47 You’re taking this over.
00:14:49 After Armageddon, you’re going to just keep on working,
00:14:52 and others will be trained.
00:14:54 And then further:
00:14:56 “The worship of God,” The Watchtower  said,
00:14:59 “with spirit and truth is positive,
00:15:02 enthusiastic, spirited and progressive.”
00:15:07 And then this is profound:
00:15:09 “More and more sections of the earth,
00:15:11 “in Western lands, in the Orient and elsewhere,
00:15:14 “are now receiving a thorough witness,
00:15:16 “and who knows how much farther the ‘glorious good news’
00:15:20 will be sounded . . . before the end!”
00:15:22 Well, God knows.
00:15:24 And look at the sound of the good news
00:15:27 being all over the earth
00:15:29 —‘the most distant parts of the earth.’
00:15:32 So may all of us beg Jehovah
00:15:35 to continue to empower us
00:15:37 to keep worshipping him “with spirit and truth”
00:15:41 and enthusiasm and zeal
00:15:43 because we have work to do!
00:15:55 Thank you, Brother Morris.
00:15:57 In the words of 1 Chronicles 28:10,
00:16:01 we will “be courageous and go to work.”
00:16:05 At this time, we ask the question,
00:16:07 “What Do We Have to Fear?”
00:16:10 Brother Mark Sanderson will address that question now for us.
00:16:16 At Revelation 12:17,
00:16:20 the Bible makes clear that all of God’s people,
00:16:24 every one of you here in this room
00:16:28 and every servant of God around this earth
00:16:31 who support Jehovah’s anointed ones,
00:16:35 are in a war.
00:16:38 Now read this thought with me
00:16:40 at Revelation 12:17.
00:16:44 It says:
00:16:46 “So the dragon became enraged at the woman
00:16:50 “and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her offspring,
00:16:55 “who observe the commandments of God
00:16:58 “and have the work of bearing witness
00:17:01 concerning Jesus.”
00:17:04 Well, what does it mean?
00:17:06 As our dear Brother Morris would say:
00:17:09 “Cheer up! Things are only going to get worse.”
00:17:15 Well, if we are in this spiritual war,
00:17:19 what do we expect?
00:17:22 With every war
00:17:24 comes intense, intense hatred.
00:17:29 Not surprisingly, Jesus made it clear
00:17:32 that his servants would not just be disliked,
00:17:36 but what did Jesus say?
00:17:38 Let’s read it together at Matthew 24:9
00:17:45 —Matthew 24:9.
00:17:50 He said:
00:17:52 “Then people will hand you over to tribulation
00:17:55 “and will kill you,
00:17:58 “and you will be hated by all the nations
00:18:03 on account of my name.”
00:18:07 So, brothers, what do we expect?
00:18:09 We expect the hatred of all,
00:18:14 as Jesus said, “all the nations”
00:18:16 —not just Eritrea, not just Russia,
00:18:20 but “all the nations.”
00:18:23 But there is something else that we also must expect in a war.
00:18:28 There is a very famous quote that says,
00:18:30 “In war, the first casualty is truth.”
00:18:35 And that is exactly what Jesus warned would happen to God’s people.
00:18:40 Let’s read it.
00:18:42 In Matthew chapter 5,
00:18:45 Matthew 5:11, he said:
00:18:50 “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you
00:18:55 “[and then notice this]
00:18:57 “and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing
00:19:02 against you for my sake.”
00:19:06 Brothers, what’s the point?
00:19:09 We are in a war.
00:19:13 And we expect to “be hated by all the nations.”
00:19:18 And we expect that people
00:19:21 will “say every sort of wicked thing”
00:19:26 against us.
00:19:28 Well, with that in mind,
00:19:30 it’s good for us to ask this question:
00:19:33 What do we have to fear?
00:19:37 Well-known statesman Franklin Roosevelt said,
00:19:41 “The only thing that we have to fear is fear itself.”
00:19:46 Well, he’s not completely correct,
00:19:48 but there’s certainly a note of truth in what he said.
00:19:52 You see, fear is a powerful weapon
00:19:55 in the hand of our great adversary, Satan the Devil.
00:19:59 He will use that weapon against us.
00:20:03 And what is the danger?
00:20:06 You see, brothers, when we are afraid, or we are terrified,
00:20:11 we can then be controlled by our enemies.
00:20:16 The apostle Paul made this very clear
00:20:18 in what he said here in Hebrews the second chapter.
00:20:21 Will you read this with me, please?
00:20:22 Let’s look in Hebrews chapter 2;
00:20:26 let’s look in verse 14.
00:20:29 He says: “Therefore, since the ‘young children’
00:20:32 “are sharers of blood and flesh,
00:20:35 “he also similarly shared in the same things,
00:20:38 “so that through his death
00:20:40 “[now notice this, through his death]
00:20:43 “he might bring to nothing
00:20:45 “the one having the means to cause death,
00:20:48 “that is, the Devil,
00:20:50 “and that he might [do what? that he might]
00:20:54 “set free all those who were held in slavery
00:20:58 all their lives by their fear of death.”
00:21:05 You see, the apostle Paul praised Jehovah for the gift of Christ Jesus.
00:21:09 And why?
00:21:11 Because he knew that all of those
00:21:14 who would put faith in the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus
00:21:17 would be set free.
00:21:19 But set free from what?
00:21:22 Paul says that it’s from the slavery
00:21:26 to the “fear of death.”
00:21:29 Now, why is that significant?
00:21:32 You see, people who are in fear of death
00:21:36 are constantly afraid.
00:21:39 And, as a result, they can be manipulated and controlled.
00:21:43 Now, take, for example, the Nuremberg trials
00:21:46 that occurred at the end of the second world war.
00:21:49 Various Nazis who had committed horrible, terrible atrocities
00:21:54 were brought to justice.
00:21:56 And when these individuals, both men and women,
00:21:58 were asked the simple question,
00:22:00 “How could you do these terrible things?”
00:22:05 what did they say?
00:22:07 “We had no choice.
00:22:09 “If we didn’t obey,
00:22:11 they would put us to death.”
00:22:14 Those people could be manipulated;
00:22:17 they could be controlled;
00:22:19 they could even get them to do the most wicked things
00:22:23 because they were afraid.
00:22:26 When we have complete confidence
00:22:29 in our amazing God, Jehovah,
00:22:32 when we have put our full confidence
00:22:35 in the ransom sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ,
00:22:40 we can do what the apostle Paul says here
00:22:43 in Philippians chapter 1.
00:22:45 Will you read it with me?
00:22:48 At Philippians 1:28,
00:22:54 Paul says:
00:22:56 “And in no way being frightened
00:23:00 “by your opponents.
00:23:03 “This very thing is a proof of destruction for them,
00:23:08 “but of salvation for you;
00:23:11 and this is from God.”
00:23:15 You see, brothers, that confidence in Jehovah
00:23:18 and in the ransom sacrifice of Christ can set us free,
00:23:22 so that we are not afraid of our opponents.
00:23:27 But another thing that can help us
00:23:29 to overcome the fear of persecution
00:23:32 is realizing something very important,
00:23:35 and that is that Jehovah will allow
00:23:38 our enemies to go only so far.
00:23:43 Now, you remember the text in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.
00:23:46 Now, let’s read this,
00:23:48 1 Corinthians 10:13.
00:23:54 The apostle Paul says:
00:23:56 “No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.
00:24:00 “But God is faithful,
00:24:03 “and he will not let you be tempted
00:24:05 “beyond what you can bear,
00:24:07 “but along with the temptation
00:24:09 “he will also make the way out
00:24:13 so that you may be able to endure it.”
00:24:17 That’s a promise from our God, Jehovah.
00:24:20 He will only allow our enemies to go so far.
00:24:26 In a well-known illustration from a book
00:24:29 that was written in the 1600’s,
00:24:32 it shows a path that leads off to the final goal,
00:24:37 and on either side of the path, there are lions.
00:24:42 The caption to the illustration says:
00:24:45 “The lions were chained,
00:24:48 but he didn’t see the chains.”
00:24:52 Now, what’s the point?
00:24:54 You see, we may encounter lions along our path
00:24:59 on our journey to the new world.
00:25:03 But what do we need to remember?
00:25:06 Every one of those lions is chained.
00:25:11 And so we must look,
00:25:14 not at the lions, brothers,
00:25:18 but at the chains.
00:25:20 And as we concentrate on the fact that Jehovah loves us,
00:25:24 that he loves his people,
00:25:26 and that he will never allow Satan or his agents to do anything
00:25:31 that will permanently harm us,
00:25:34 our fear of our persecutors
00:25:37 begins to dwindle away.
00:25:40 When you see the lion, remember, don’t stare at the lion.
00:25:45 Stare at the chain.
00:25:48 So then, brothers, I come back to the question,
00:25:52 What then do we have to fear?
00:25:54 Well, the Bible tells us.
00:25:56 It’s here in Psalm 111
00:25:59 —Psalm 111:10.
00:26:07 It says: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.
00:26:12 “All those observing his orders show good insight.
00:26:17 His praise endures forever.”
00:26:21 Well, that’s what we do have to fear.
00:26:23 We have to have a wholesome fear
00:26:26 of our wonderful God, Jehovah.
00:26:28 That wholesome fear of displeasing the Almighty God of the universe
00:26:32 is our compass.
00:26:35 It shows us the way;
00:26:37 it tells us what we need to do.
00:26:40 No matter how much opposition may come upon us,
00:26:44 no matter what form that opposition may take,
00:26:48 if we are God-fearing men and women,
00:26:52 we will know exactly what we need to do.
00:26:56 Do you agree?
00:27:03 Now, brothers, this is not theory.
00:27:06 Our brothers and sisters around the world
00:27:08 are living examples of the truths that we have just discussed.
00:27:12 Please watch the following video
00:27:15 that contains heartfelt comments
00:27:18 from persecuted brothers and sisters in Russia,
00:27:22 and see why we have no reason to fear persecution.
00:27:31 I was horrified when several masked officers broke down two doors
00:27:35 and burst into the home where the meeting was being held.
00:27:38 Everything happened at once
00:27:41 —loud sounds, noise, the order:
00:27:44 “Everyone sit on the floor!”
00:27:51 I was overcome with fear when they put me in handcuffs,
00:27:54 placed me in the police van, and took me to jail.
00:27:57 I was afraid because I didn’t know
00:28:00 how long I would be there and what was awaiting me.
00:28:04 When I was being interrogated,
00:28:06 I was afraid that I might be unfaithful to Jehovah and let my brothers down.
00:28:12 After being detained, I was mostly afraid about what I would face in prison
00:28:16 —whom I would encounter, how to act,
00:28:19 how others would treat me—the unknown.
00:28:28 When one of the officers began to describe how bad life is behind bars,
00:28:33 I imagined that behind the officer stood an angel
00:28:36 just like the one who supported Daniel in the illustration.
00:28:39 This helped me to calm down and not to panic or be afraid.
00:28:43 That’s how Jehovah supported me.
00:28:48 At the first court appearance, when I was brought out,
00:28:51 the brothers’ feelings impelled them to show support somehow,
00:28:55 and they began applauding.
00:28:56 How that encouraged me that they were with me!
00:29:02 Fervent and sincere prayers to Jehovah
00:29:04 helped me to cope with these fears.
00:29:08 Isaiah 30:15 gave me much support.
00:29:11 I realized that tranquility and trust
00:29:13 in Jehovah are now the most important things.
00:29:16 Understanding this made things much easier for me.
00:29:20 We took the elevator down to the first floor, the doors opened,
00:29:25 and there stood a large crowd of our brothers and sisters
00:29:29 —and they all began clapping.
00:29:33 When I saw that, my emotions just welled up,
00:29:36 and I got a lump in my throat.
00:29:39 I felt as if I had wings;
00:29:42 I felt the “great cloud of witnesses.”
00:29:47 I prayed to Jehovah for calmness, courage, and wisdom
00:29:51 and that he help me not to bring reproach on his holy name.
00:29:55 Almost immediately, “the peace of God”
00:29:58 came over me, and I was calm.
00:30:01 The unpleasant sensations did not go away,
00:30:04 but I was no longer afraid.
00:30:09 While overcoming our fear, my wife and I tried to go out in service every day.
00:30:14 When you don’t concentrate on yourself
00:30:16 but focus on helping others, fear disappears.
00:30:22 Something that helped me to cope with my fears
00:30:24 is hope,
00:30:27 looking at the situation through Jehovah’s eyes,
00:30:30 seeing what will happen next,
00:30:33 that this is not the end of the situation,
00:30:36 but only a difficult phase through which you can pass.
00:30:41 I was helped to cope with my fear by the words of the song:
00:30:45 “Take one day at a time;
00:30:47 “leave tomorrow until tomorrow;
00:30:49 peace is what I find.”
00:30:51 I understood that it was important to solve problems as they came up
00:30:56 and not to be troubled by what might never happen.
00:30:59 Fear is interesting;
00:31:02 that is, in principle, fear can be
00:31:05 inside a person, and if someone is afraid, that is not shameful.
00:31:10 But the question is,
00:31:12 Can you overcome this fear?
00:31:13 Can you get the fear under your control?
00:31:16 Can you overcome this surge of negativity?
00:31:21 And when my heart persuaded me to get scared,
00:31:24 then I started to pray.
00:31:26 I prayed to Jehovah to give me courage
00:31:29 and not be afraid of anyone or anything.
00:31:33 I still say to myself,
00:31:35 ‘Feliks, do not fear anybody or anything except Jehovah!’
00:31:42 Dear brothers and sisters, I really appreciate your support.
00:31:46 I’m very happy for all your letters,
00:31:49 for all your thoughts, for all your prayers.
00:31:52 I really appreciate it a lot.
00:31:54 I try to do my best,
00:31:56 and I try to serve Jehovah in the best way that I can.
00:31:59 I will do that forever!
00:32:39 Brothers and sisters, we know that persecution
00:32:43 is coming to us too.
00:32:46 May we trust in Jehovah
00:32:48 and overcome any fear that we have of our opposers.
00:32:52 May we be confident that any lions on our path are chained.
00:32:57 Look at the chains, not the lions.
00:33:02 And may we be ever guided by our wholesome fear of Jehovah God.
00:33:07 Are you determined to fear nothing
00:33:11 except our wonderful God, Jehovah?
00:33:19 Then I ask you, What do we have to fear?
00:33:27 Thank you for answering this question about fear so eloquently.
00:33:32 Now we are looking forward to the discussion
00:33:36 by Brother Jackson on the interesting theme
00:33:40 “Are You Completely Sober?”
00:33:44 I guess so, looking at the time.
00:33:50 Are you completely sober?
00:33:54 I know what you’re thinking: ‘Really?
00:33:57 ‘Seriously?
00:33:59 ‘The answer is obvious, isn’t it?
00:34:01 ‘We’ve been in this Assembly Hall for hours,
00:34:03 and there’s no opportunity to drink.’
00:34:07 So the answer to the question seems rather obvious, doesn’t it?
00:34:11 But before you dismiss this question completely,
00:34:15 could there be some other meaning to this question,
00:34:19 a spiritual meaning?
00:34:21 The answer, of course, is yes.
00:34:24 Because when we look at the Greek text
00:34:27 upon which the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:34:29 were translated from,
00:34:31 we notice that literally the term “to be sober”
00:34:36 occurs a number of times.
00:34:39 And yet, the Christian Greek Scriptures of the New World Translation
00:34:42 do not actually use the words “to be sober.”
00:34:45 Let’s take an example.
00:34:47 Please turn with me, if you will,
00:34:49 to 1 Peter 1:13.
00:34:55 Now, if you have a device, you can also quickly look
00:34:58 at the Kingdom Interlinear
00:35:00 if you wish to verify this.
00:35:02 But 1 Peter 1:13
00:35:05 (and just the beginning of this verse),
00:35:08 it says: “So brace up your minds for activity;
00:35:11 keep your senses completely.”
00:35:16 The Greek expression here could be translated
00:35:19 as “being sober perfectly.”
00:35:23 But notice that we have the expression translated
00:35:26 as “keep your senses completely.”
00:35:30 So that raises the interesting question,
00:35:33 Why didn’t the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:35:37 say “to be sober”
00:35:39 or “to be completely sober”?
00:35:42 Well, the answer to that question
00:35:44 goes back to your initial reaction when you heard the title of this talk.
00:35:48 Let’s be honest, when you heard “Are You Completely Sober?”
00:35:52 what did you think of immediately?
00:35:54 Drinking alcohol or avoiding it.
00:35:57 But the majority of times
00:36:00 that this expression occurs in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:36:03 it does not specifically refer to avoiding alcohol
00:36:07 or becoming intoxicated with alcohol.
00:36:11 Rather, it has a larger figurative meaning.
00:36:16 So for us to follow the admonition “to be sober,”
00:36:21 we need to know, really, what the Bible means by that expression.
00:36:25 What is included in that?
00:36:27 So, what we’re going to briefly do
00:36:29 is look at four different ways
00:36:32 that the New World Translation
00:36:34 has covered this expression.
00:36:38 And by looking at the different ways in English
00:36:41 that this has been translated,
00:36:43 we’ll see what really is involved
00:36:46 with this expression “to be sober.”
00:36:49 So let’s start.
00:36:50 If you turn with me, please, to 1 Timothy chapter 3—
00:36:55 And immediately we remember
00:36:57 that 1 Timothy chapter 3
00:36:59 is talking about the qualifications
00:37:01 for overseers, and also it mentions
00:37:04 what sisters should do.
00:37:06 Now, in verse 2 and verse 11
00:37:08 (we won’t read it but glancing at it),
00:37:11 in Greek,
00:37:13 the word “to be sober” literally is there,
00:37:17 and you can see it in the Kingdom Interlinear.
00:37:19 But how is it translated?
00:37:21 We don’t see the word “sober,” do we?
00:37:23 The expression there is
00:37:25 to be “moderate in habits.”
00:37:28 Now, why did the brothers
00:37:29 translate it this way?
00:37:31 Because although it could refer
00:37:34 to avoiding being intoxicated,
00:37:37 it has this wider meaning of having good sense
00:37:41 when it comes to things like conduct and speech
00:37:44 or the choice of entertainment or recreation.
00:37:48 It means not going to foolish extremes
00:37:51 or being erratic in our thinking
00:37:54 or unbalanced in our opinions.
00:37:57 So all of that is involved in this figurative meaning
00:38:01 of the expression to be “moderate in habits.”
00:38:04 Let’s take an example by looking at another verse
00:38:07 in the Bible as to what is involved in not being extreme.
00:38:12 Let’s turn to 1 Corinthians this time
00:38:16 —1 Corinthians 7:31.
00:38:21 Now, this doesn’t use the term in Greek “to be sober,”
00:38:24 but it gives us further information
00:38:26 as to what’s involved with being moderate in habits.
00:38:30 So verse 31 says:
00:38:33 “Those making use of the world
00:38:35 as those not using it to the full.”
00:38:40 Now, what does that mean?
00:38:42 Well, maybe we could use this illustration to highlight it.
00:38:46 Imagine a hungry person
00:38:49 who wants to pick fruit from a tree.
00:38:51 Now, a person who’s not unbalanced
00:38:54 and doesn’t go to extremes perhaps would be
00:38:57 happy just to get enough fruit
00:38:59 to satisfy his hunger
00:39:01 or maybe to get a few extra pieces of fruit
00:39:04 so that he could take some home.
00:39:06 But a person who was to ‘use it to the full’
00:39:11 is that type of person
00:39:13 who after they’ve collected everything
00:39:15 they can get (more than they could ever use),
00:39:18 they see the one piece of fruit right up at the top
00:39:22 and they have to have it,
00:39:24 even if it involves a certain risk.
00:39:27 So when the apostle Paul
00:39:30 said under inspiration
00:39:32 that we ‘shouldn’t use the world to the full,’
00:39:35 symbolically, we could say, it’s just like this
00:39:38 —not trying to get everything  out of this world.
00:39:43 Now, what sort of symbolic fruit
00:39:45 might we be tempted with?
00:39:47 Well, there are so many opportunities today
00:39:50 for education, recreation, entertainment,
00:39:53 travel, vacations, employment, and business.
00:39:57 Are we truly sober when it comes to those things,
00:40:02 or are we like the person who is trying to grab every opportunity
00:40:07 and use the world to the full?
00:40:09 Well, let’s look at a second example of this Greek word being used
00:40:14 —1 Peter 4:7.
00:40:19 First Peter 4:7 says:
00:40:23 “But the end of all things has drawn close.
00:40:26 “Therefore, be sound in mind,
00:40:28 and be vigilant.”
00:40:30 Now, notice the footnote says,
00:40:32 “Or ‘alert; awake.’”
00:40:35 But if you look at the Kingdom Interlinear,
00:40:38 it says: “Be you sober.”
00:40:41 So in this case,
00:40:43 the brothers translated
00:40:45 the literal term in Greek, “sober,”
00:40:47 to be “vigilant,” or “alert” and “awake.”
00:40:50 With regard to what?
00:40:52 With regard to our prayers.
00:40:54 It’s interesting that the apostle Peter was inspired to say these words.
00:40:58 No doubt he remembered the time
00:41:00 when he wasn’t  ‘vigilant with regard to prayers,’
00:41:03 when Jesus said “keep praying” constantly
00:41:06 in the garden of Gethsemane.
00:41:08 And, of course, Peter would have remembered what resulted
00:41:11 because of that lack of being sober in a spiritual sense.
00:41:16 So, what about us?
00:41:18 Are we vigilant with regard to prayers?
00:41:21 Do we pray to Jehovah constantly,
00:41:24 whenever we have an opportunity right through the day?
00:41:27 Or do we only just pray when we wake up in the morning,
00:41:30 when we eat, and before we go to bed at night?
00:41:34 Well, for us to ‘be vigilant with regard to prayers,’
00:41:38 if we constantly have Jehovah in our minds,
00:41:41 then we can truly say that we are,
00:41:43 in a symbolic sense, sober.
00:41:46 Now, a third example
00:41:48 —1 Corinthians chapter 15.
00:41:52 Of course,
00:41:53 all of us remember very clearly
00:41:55 the words in verse 33 about bad associations,
00:41:59 but this verse is verse 34
00:42:02 in the same context.
00:42:04 And how does it start?
00:42:05 It says: “Come to your senses
00:42:09 in a righteous way.”
00:42:11 Again, if we look at the literal rendering
00:42:13 of the Greek, it says:
00:42:14 “Sober you up.”
00:42:17 Now, what is this talking about?
00:42:20 Well, the study note of our Bible
00:42:22 (and of course, you can only get this in the electronic form at the moment),
00:42:26 it says: “Come to your senses:
00:42:29 “Paul here uses a Greek word
00:42:31 “that literally means ‘to sober up.’
00:42:34 “Because some of the Corinthian Christians
00:42:36 “gave ear to apostate teachings,
00:42:39 “such as the denial of the resurrection,
00:42:42 “they were in a spiritual stupor of sorts,
00:42:45 “confused and disoriented as if drunk.
00:42:49 “Paul thus urges them to wake up,
00:42:51 “to shake off their confusion
00:42:53 “by getting a clear understanding of the teaching of the resurrection.
00:42:57 “They needed to do so before their stupor
00:43:00 led them to spiritual sickness and even death.”
00:43:05 So do we see why the brothers translated it this way?
00:43:09 “Come to your senses” is not just talking
00:43:12 about drinking wine or beer,
00:43:14 but it’s talking about avoiding bad associates
00:43:19 and those who give wrong ideas.
00:43:22 So could it be that we may be affected by the opinions of some,
00:43:27 maybe even within the congregation,
00:43:29 who say, “Is the end really so close?”
00:43:32 or “Is what the world offers really that bad?”
00:43:36 Or if we were to be tempted to believe
00:43:40 every account or report on the Internet
00:43:43 with regard to those taking the lead in the organization,
00:43:46 do we just quickly believe those things?
00:43:49 Or worse still, do we search the Internet
00:43:52 looking for juicy stories about other Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:43:57 We need to remember that Satan is “the father of the lie.”
00:44:01 He’s an expert at lying,
00:44:03 and he makes sure there are plenty of lies for us to come across.
00:44:07 But if we are sober spiritually,
00:44:10 this means we won’t get fooled
00:44:13 or tricked by false stories.
00:44:16 Now, the fourth and final example
00:44:19 we want to share with you is in 1 Thessalonians
00:44:23 —1 Thessalonians 5:6.
00:44:27 And here again in the Greek text,
00:44:29 we see the word “sober,”
00:44:31 if it’s literally translated into English.
00:44:34 Verse 6 says: “So, then,
00:44:36 “let us not sleep on as the rest do,
00:44:39 “but let us stay awake
00:44:41 “and [notice, this is the expression]
00:44:43 keep our senses.”
00:44:46 So, what is the context of this verse?
00:44:49 It’s talking about ‘Jehovah’s day coming as a thief.’
00:44:52 It’s talking about those saying “Peace and security!”
00:44:56 So in this sense, to “be sober” means
00:44:59 we know the time we’re living in.
00:45:01 We’re not only spiritually awake, but we’re alert.
00:45:04 Think of this illustration:
00:45:06 There could be a guard,
00:45:08 and that guard is totally awake,
00:45:11 but he’s watching
00:45:13 the tournament on the television
00:45:15 —maybe it’s football, something he’s excited about.
00:45:19 He’s not alert to the dangers
00:45:21 that are lurking.
00:45:23 So in a similar way,
00:45:25 we need to be totally awake spiritually
00:45:28 and alert to what is happening
00:45:30 and to the dangers that present themselves,
00:45:33 such as getting involved with the political issues
00:45:36 that we see in the world today.
00:45:39 To do so would make us part of the world.
00:45:41 Yes, we have to focus on God’s Kingdom
00:45:45 as the only true solution.
00:45:47 That’s what it means to be sober.
00:45:50 So we’ve seen those four aspects of this literal word
00:45:55 when it’s translated into English as “being sober.”
00:45:59 But why is that so important?
00:46:01 Brothers and sisters,
00:46:03 as it’s been already presented on this program,
00:46:06 we know challenging times are in front of us.
00:46:11 Yes, we need to be completely sober
00:46:15 when we face those challenges.
00:46:18 This year is a special year;
00:46:20 it marks 100 years
00:46:22 since the appointment of “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:46:27 That slave, when we look back over the 100 years,
00:46:30 has remained awake, spiritually speaking,
00:46:34 and alert and has kept on reminding us of the need to do that.
00:46:38 Now, it’s true.
00:46:40 Some might say: “Well, yes.
00:46:41 “But at times, we look back over 100 years,
00:46:43 “and there were times they got excited about a certain year or time,
00:46:47 and the end didn’t come at that time.”
00:46:49 But just imagine if you had a watchdog
00:46:53 and that dog barks in the middle of the night
00:46:56 and you get up and there’s nothing there,
00:46:58 do you shoot the dog?
00:47:02 It only proves that the dog
00:47:04 is doing what you want it to do.
00:47:07 So in a similar way, realize the faithful slave,
00:47:11 yes, in their enthusiasm, sometimes we have said things
00:47:15 that maybe disappointed others.
00:47:18 But remember, the role of “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:47:21 is to feed us and to keep us awake spiritually and keep us alert.
00:47:26 And thinking about it, when that day comes
00:47:30 when Jesus brings destruction on this wicked system of things,
00:47:35 where do you want to be?
00:47:37 on a beach drinking a martini?
00:47:41 climbing a symbolic tree to get the last bit of fruit from this world?
00:47:46 Or do you want to be busy in Jehovah’s service,
00:47:48 whether it’s building and preaching and all the things we need to do?
00:47:52 We know the answer.
00:47:54 Yes, but to do that, we have to remain sober spiritually.
00:47:59 And one final point, if we look in the Insight  volume
00:48:03 under the heading “Soberness,”
00:48:05 there’s a very interesting point,
00:48:07 because Peter and Paul
00:48:10 used this expression in Greek.
00:48:13 And the Insight  volume makes this very interesting comment.
00:48:16 It says: “In keeping his senses,
00:48:20 “Timothy was to realize that Paul
00:48:22 would not be on the scene much longer.”
00:48:25 Then it says about Peter:
00:48:27 ‘Peter likewise knew that he and his fellow apostles
00:48:31 would not be on hand much longer.’
00:48:33 Then it goes on to say:
00:48:35 “Knowing the seriousness of the times,
00:48:37 “with growing persecution from the world,
00:48:40 “they should be  sound in mind, watchful, vigilant,
00:48:45 “and should not neglect serious prayer,
00:48:47 to obtain the strength they would need for endurance.”
00:48:52 Yes, the faithful slave has been serving us
00:48:55 with spiritual food for 100 years.
00:48:58 But, friends, remember,
00:49:00 the faithful slave will not always be here.
00:49:04 Soon will come the time when the remaining ones of the anointed
00:49:07 will be taken to have their reward.
00:49:10 Of course, Jehovah will continue to care for us.
00:49:14 He always has a provision in place to care for us.
00:49:17 But what is the important thing?
00:49:19 What is it that the faithful slave wants to convey to us?
00:49:23 Just the same as Paul and Peter
00:49:26 wanted to convey to those to whom they wrote,
00:49:29 we want to convey to you the importance of each one of us
00:49:34 being moderate in habits,
00:49:36 vigilant with regard to prayers,
00:49:38 keeping our senses, not being distracted by false stories,
00:49:42 and being alert to the time in which we’re living.
00:49:45 So we leave you with that question,
00:49:48 Are you sober?
00:49:50 Are you completely  sober?
00:50:01 Well, we certainly appreciate this sobering talk.
00:50:05 You will now be interested to hear what Brother Kenneth Cook
00:50:09 has to say on the topic
00:50:12 “Will You Care for It?”
00:50:14 Brother Cook, please.
00:50:16 We care for the things that are important to us, don’t we?
00:50:21 And there are many of such things.
00:50:24 For example, we care for our families,
00:50:26 we care for our friends, we care for our ministry,
00:50:31 and above all, we care for our worship of Jehovah.
00:50:35 And we do this faithfully to the very end.
00:50:40 When others need us, we’re there for them, as we’ve seen today.
00:50:44 During times of natural disasters, civil unrest,
00:50:48 and severe opposition to our work, we are there for one another.
00:50:53 In addition to all of that, our love must also, though,
00:50:57 be great enough to care for those
00:51:00 whom we try to reach in our public ministry.
00:51:03 In this, Jesus set the example for us.
00:51:08 We can feel his caring attitude in what he said
00:51:12 at Matthew 9:36-38.
00:51:17 So please follow along at Matthew 9:36.
00:51:23 It says: “On seeing the crowds,
00:51:25 “he felt pity for them,
00:51:28 “because they were skinned and thrown about
00:51:30 “like sheep without a shepherd.
00:51:33 “Then he said to his disciples:
00:51:35 “‘Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.
00:51:40 “‘Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest
00:51:42 to send out workers into his harvest.’”
00:51:46 Jesus felt pity for the people, didn’t he?
00:51:50 What does pity mean in this case?
00:51:53 The pity mentioned here stems from heartfelt love.
00:51:58 He loved the people. We love people.
00:52:02 It’s a tender feeling toward persons
00:52:04 in a state of need or suffering.
00:52:08 Like Jesus, our love for others
00:52:10 must include genuine care for them —even pity for them—
00:52:15 so that we’re moved to help them,
00:52:18 hoping that they respond to God’s Word
00:52:21 and will desire to do Jehovah’s will.
00:52:25 And we must do this because caring for others
00:52:28 is an important part of following the Christ, right?
00:52:32 In a few minutes, we will look at how we can remain focused
00:52:36 on compassionately carrying out our ministry
00:52:40 and helping people to dedicate their lives to God.
00:52:44 And this will include revealing what our yeartext is for 2020.
00:52:49 So as Brother Lett said earlier, “Stay tuned.”
00:52:52 Before we get to that, though,
00:52:54 we’ll draw out some Bible principles from long ago
00:52:58 that will help us today in caring for the people
00:53:02 that we must yet reach in this important ministry, or work.
00:53:06 Since ancient times,
00:53:08 Jehovah has taught his people how to care for others.
00:53:13 In fact, the Israelites were told to show consideration
00:53:16 even for the animals under their care.
00:53:20 For instance, when they were about to leave Egypt,
00:53:23 Jehovah gave them this command
00:53:26 at Exodus 12:5, 6.
00:53:29 Please follow along.
00:53:31 Now, here is the setting:
00:53:35 Jehovah gives instructions about selecting the Passover sacrifice.
00:53:40 Verse 3 tells us that the Israelites
00:53:43 were to select the sheep on the tenth of the month.
00:53:47 With this in mind, notice what verse 5 states:
00:53:51 “Your sheep should be a sound, one-year-old male.
00:53:55 “You may choose from the young rams or from the goats.
00:53:59 “You must care for it
00:54:02 “until the 14th day of this month,
00:54:05 “and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel
00:54:08 must slaughter it at twilight.”
00:54:11 Why was it important for them
00:54:14 to not only select the sheep
00:54:17 but to “care for it until the 14th”?
00:54:21 To answer that question, let’s draw out two principles
00:54:24 that we will then apply to our ministry
00:54:27 —and they do apply.
00:54:29 First, we know that the sacrificial sheep
00:54:32 needed to remain unblemished
00:54:36 to be acceptable to Jehovah.
00:54:39 Verse 5 said: “Your sheep should be a sound, one-year-old male.”
00:54:44 If an Israelite selected a sound sheep
00:54:47 but then neglected it and the sheep was injured in some way,
00:54:52 that sheep would no longer be
00:54:54 acceptable to Jehovah for sacrifice.
00:54:57 The principle:
00:54:59 Keep the sacrifice acceptable.
00:55:03 Don’t neglect it just because the end is close,
00:55:07 and we can apply that principle to our ministry.
00:55:12 Now, principle number two:
00:55:14 We can also be certain that a measure of compassion
00:55:18 was involved in what Jehovah told them there.
00:55:21 In this case, the sacrificial sheep was no less important
00:55:26 just because its time, so to speak, was short.
00:55:30 See, as we’ll see in this discussion,
00:55:34 this too can apply to our ministry.
00:55:37 And we’re wise to remember these principles.
00:55:40 Fittingly, it is Jehovah who sets the example for us
00:55:44 in showing compassion
00:55:46 and caring for what is important to the very end.
00:55:51 Foremost in this is how Jehovah cared for Jesus
00:55:56 right up to the end of his earthly ministry.
00:55:59 For instance, Jehovah showed his support for Jesus
00:56:03 by answering Jesus’ prayers.
00:56:05 At one point, Jesus even said:
00:56:08 “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.”
00:56:13 Also, Jehovah voiced his support for Jesus.
00:56:17 At his baptism, Jesus heard Jehovah speak from heaven,
00:56:22 stating: “This is my Son, the beloved,
00:56:25 whom I have approved.”
00:56:28 Imagine how that encouraged him!
00:56:31 And then later, as Jesus was in agony
00:56:34 during the hours before his death,
00:56:37 an angel of God comforted Jesus,
00:56:40 and no doubt that angel was a friend whom Jesus knew well.
00:56:45 Yes, from the beginning to the very end,
00:56:49 Jehovah cared for Jesus, the sacrificial “Lamb of God.”
00:56:54 We benefit when we apply such principles
00:56:58 to what we have been given to do today.
00:57:02 For instance, the time is short, yes.
00:57:06 Yet, our public ministry is no less important now
00:57:11 just because the end is close.
00:57:14 In fact, it’s even more important
00:57:16 that we continue caring for this ministry
00:57:19 as the end approaches.
00:57:21 We must care for this “sacrifice of praise”
00:57:25 to our heavenly Father right up to the end
00:57:28 —that is, right up to the time when Jehovah makes it clear
00:57:32 that this part of our service to him has come to an end.
00:57:37 Until that time,
00:57:39 what should be the focus of our public ministry?
00:57:43 Jesus stated what it should be
00:57:46 at Matthew 28:18-20,
00:57:50 so please go to those verses.
00:57:53 Now, starting at Matthew 28:18,
00:57:57 it says:
00:58:07 “Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying:
00:58:11 “‘All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.
00:58:15 “‘Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations,
00:58:19 “‘baptizing them in the name of the Father
00:58:23 “‘and of the Son and of the holy spirit,
00:58:26 “‘teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.
00:58:31 “‘And look! I am with you all the days
00:58:35 until the conclusion of the system of things.’”
00:58:39 So now, with these words of Jesus in mind,
00:58:43 what should be the focus of our public ministry?
00:58:47 Well, the focus must be to ‘make disciples of Christ
00:58:51 ‘among people of all the nations,
00:58:53 teaching them and baptizing them,’ as Jesus stated.
00:58:58 Notice that Jesus’ statement was more than just a command.
00:59:03 He didn’t start off saying: “I command you! Go!”—right?
00:59:07 Rather, Jesus said:
00:59:09 “All authority has been given me . . . Go, therefore.”
00:59:14 Jesus’ true disciples would see beyond the command
00:59:19 embedded in those words and go forth with conviction.
00:59:24 Why?
00:59:25 Because they would know that Jesus was empowered, authorized,
00:59:29 to oversee this great work
00:59:32 that they were now commissioned to do.
00:59:35 He would be with them, and he is with us today.
00:59:39 We’re absolutely confident of that fact.
00:59:42 In view of that, how can we help our Bible students
00:59:47 so that even more of them become baptized disciples,
00:59:52 as Jesus there directed?
00:59:54 This is important to consider because,
00:59:57 while many get baptized each year,
01:00:01 our yearly baptism figures have remained
01:00:03 at about the same level for some time.
01:00:06 Now, are these good figures?
01:00:08 Yes, they are.
01:00:10 Absolutely!
01:00:11 But what can we do to help even more people
01:00:15 take this vital step before the end comes?
01:00:19 To answer that question,
01:00:21 let’s briefly consider four ways to reach the heart.
01:00:25 There’s much that we can do, but we’ll just consider four ways here.
01:00:29 We do it through what we emphasize about Jehovah,
01:00:33 what we teach our students about prayer,
01:00:37 how we help them get to meetings,
01:00:40 and how we help them handle problems.
01:00:43 Let’s consider that first way:
01:00:46 We reach the heart through what we emphasize about Jehovah.
01:00:51 Our goal is to help our students see
01:00:54 that Jehovah cares for them.
01:00:57 He cares about them. He loves them deeply.
01:01:00 As we use our publications
01:01:03 (such as the Teach Us  book) with our students,
01:01:05 we should prepare well
01:01:07 and highlight the Scriptural answers to questions such as:
01:01:11 Does God care about us?
01:01:14 How does God feel when people suffer?
01:01:17 Is it possible to be Jehovah’s friend?
01:01:21 Discuss the answers,
01:01:23 draw out the meaning that brings us joy
01:01:27 and identify the principles that improve our life,
01:01:31 and help the student to grow ever closer to Jehovah.
01:01:35 Now the second way:
01:01:37 We reach the heart through what we teach our students about prayer.
01:01:41 Show him or her how to pray properly,
01:01:45 with meaning and from the heart,
01:01:47 as we pray with them at each study session.
01:01:51 Explain that in our private prayers
01:01:53 we can really open up to Jehovah
01:01:56 and express feelings that we might not share with other humans.
01:02:01 We can also ask for God’s help
01:02:03 to love only what he loves.
01:02:07 Why can we do this with confidence?
01:02:10 Because Jehovah cares for us,
01:02:12 and we should make that very clear as we teach our Bible students.
01:02:17 Next, the third way:
01:02:20 We reach the heart through how we help our students get to meetings.
01:02:25 Invite your Bible student to attend meetings as soon as possible.
01:02:29 What a student sees at our meetings
01:02:31 may touch his heart and help him to progress.
01:02:34 Very early on, show the video
01:02:37 What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?
01:02:40 Then warmly invite him to attend with you; appeal to him.
01:02:45 Also, offer transportation if it is needed.
01:02:48 I really appreciated getting a ride to the first meeting that I attended,
01:02:52 and I still remember it.
01:02:54 Finally, the fourth way:
01:02:57 We reach the heart through how we help our students handle problems,
01:03:01 including problems that may develop
01:03:03 if someone offends him or her.
01:03:07 This is all part of reaching the heart
01:03:09 and preparing and helping them.
01:03:12 Our Bible students need to experience Jehovah’s love
01:03:16 as they benefit from applying Bible principles.
01:03:19 See, this helps them to know Jehovah better.
01:03:22 To help them, show your students how to use tools
01:03:26 such as the JW Library® app,
01:03:29 the Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:03:33 and jw.org®.
01:03:36 When our students are trained to search for answers before baptism,
01:03:41 they will be better prepared to handle problems
01:03:44 and get along with others.
01:03:46 When we do these things for our Bible students,
01:03:50 we show that we are really caring
01:03:52 for what Jehovah has entrusted to us.
01:03:56 Both Jehovah and his Son desire
01:04:00 that we help as many people to the point of dedication and baptism
01:04:05 while there’s still time.
01:04:08 To succeed,
01:04:10 don’t spend time conducting an unproductive study.
01:04:14 Rather, focus on “those who [are] rightly disposed for everlasting life,”
01:04:19 and care for them with Jehovah’s blessing on your efforts.
01:04:25 So, then, with all of this in mind, what is our yeartext for 2020?
01:04:31 It is taken from Matthew 28:19:
01:04:34 “Go, therefore, and make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”
01:04:47 Now, for those of you who listened to Alexa earlier in the program
01:04:51 or read your daily text for today,
01:04:53 you know that this is also the Scripture text for today,
01:04:56 October 5, 2019.
01:04:59 That’s just a coincidence.
01:05:02 Don’t expect it next year.
01:05:07 Now, with that text in mind,
01:05:09 keep putting your heart into your ministry
01:05:12 and into helping people,
01:05:14 and be certain to take care of this ministry
01:05:17 with those principles we considered
01:05:19 to the very end.
01:05:29 Thank you very much, Brother Cook, for your presentation.
01:05:35 Looking back on the program that we were able to enjoy,
01:05:38 we certainly felt encouraged by being reminded
01:05:42 that we have no human leader
01:05:45 but that it is Jesus who is our Leader.
01:05:48 Remember what it says at Matthew 23:10:
01:05:52 “Neither be called leaders,
01:05:54 for your Leader is one, the Christ.”
01:05:59 We enjoyed also listening to Brother Stephen Lett,
01:06:02 who emphasized that our relief ministry
01:06:05 is overseen and directed by Jehovah.
01:06:09 I’m sure that you also enjoyed the four videos.
01:06:13 The first one was entitled
01:06:14 ‘The Good Hand of Our God Is Upon Us . . . Let Us Get Up and Build.’
01:06:20 The next video provided a historical look
01:06:22 at property acquisitions,
01:06:25 followed by another video related
01:06:27 to the new construction project that is being planned.
01:06:32 The fourth video was about the new application
01:06:35 for processing applications,
01:06:37 followed by a presentation
01:06:40 on a new way to access
01:06:42 jw.org® audio files.
01:06:46 After that, we enjoyed the Scriptural discussion,
01:06:49 “An Attack Coming From the North,”
01:06:51 presented by Brother David Splane of the Governing Body.
01:06:55 And Brother Samuel Herd next encouraged us
01:06:59 to study the Bible with a Study Bible.
01:07:02 And how we appreciate the Study Bible!
01:07:06 After singing a song together and listening to greetings
01:07:09 from brothers in other places and countries,
01:07:12 Brother Anthony Morris reminded us
01:07:14 that we have work to do.
01:07:18 As indicated in the news media, there are increasing problems in the world.
01:07:23 In certain areas, we can also see
01:07:25 increasing hostility against God’s people.
01:07:29 Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body
01:07:32 showed that we do not have to be fearful
01:07:35 because the Almighty is on our side.
01:07:39 Next, we heard the talk
01:07:41 by Brother Geoffrey Jackson,
01:07:46 “Are You Completely Sober?”
01:07:48 We are if we keep our senses.
01:07:53 And finally, Brother Kenneth Cook
01:07:57 of the Governing Body raised the question
01:07:59 “Will You Care for It?”
01:08:01 Brother Cook reviewed how Jehovah cared for Jesus,
01:08:05 the sacrificial Lamb of God,
01:08:08 until the very end of his life on earth.
01:08:10 Likewise, in harmony with the 2020 yeartext
01:08:15 that’s taken from Matthew 28:19,
01:08:18 he highlighted how we must care for our ministry
01:08:21 and our “sacrifice of praise” until the very end.
01:08:26 This includes our efforts to help ‘those who are rightly disposed’
01:08:31 to dedicate their life to Jehovah and to get baptized.

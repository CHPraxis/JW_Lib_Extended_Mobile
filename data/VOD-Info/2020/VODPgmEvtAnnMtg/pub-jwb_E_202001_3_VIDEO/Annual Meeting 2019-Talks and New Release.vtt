Big projects require thousands of volunteers

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a period of several years.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On our program thus far,
we have also considered disaster relief work

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and branch renovation projects.

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these initiatives require

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that volunteers fill out an application

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be used in these capacities.

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are so many avenues of service

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that require the submittal of an application.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that thought in mind,

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please carefully watch
the next video entitled

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>A New Application</i>
<i>for Processing Applications.</i>

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever submitted
an application to expand your ministry?

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the early 1900’s, 

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our organization has used paper applications

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many forms of service

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faithful workers have responded.

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This growth is in fulfillment
of Jesus’ words at Matthew 9:37:

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The harvest is great.”

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the needs are greater than ever before.

00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can more workers make themselves available?

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can applying for different avenues
of service be simplified?

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to announce

00:01:33.977 --> 00:01:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
online applications on jw.org®!

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publishers will be able to apply <i>online</i>
to expand their ministry!

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders will review
and approve applications online.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When needed, circuit overseers will review

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approve applications online.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your willing spirit
to expand your theocratic service

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
supports the need
for more workers in many ways.

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah inspired King David to write:

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:18.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your people
will offer themselves willingly.”

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:23.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s people
have always wholeheartedly responded.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope this new online tool

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you support the Kingdom

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever way you can,
all to Jehovah’s praise.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you noted,
this provision will be available

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those applying
for various privileges of service

00:02:55.358 --> 00:03:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning January 2020.

00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Technology continues to make advancements.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a way to harness such advances

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the benefit of Jehovah’s people?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Clive Martin,

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who oversees
the MEPS Department at Warwick,

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will discuss a new way

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to access jw.org® audio files.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Brother Martin.

00:03:26.322 --> 00:03:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just love the rich supply
of spiritual food on our website and app.

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:35.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, some have asked
if there’s an easier way to find

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:39.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen
to the audio publications and programs.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would be particularly helpful

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many of our dear publishers
who have limited vision

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who depend on these audio programs.

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind,
we’re happy to introduce

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:55.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jw.org® for Amazon Alexa

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Google Voice Assistant.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:03.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have bought

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of these voice assistants

00:04:04.794 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to music,

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
check the news and the weather,

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:11.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps to control your home appliances.

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:13.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can use it to listen

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the content that we need

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:17.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our regular spiritual routine.

00:04:17.273 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try it out.

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:24.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Alexa, read the daily text from jw.org.”

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading the daily text.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saturday, October 5:

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make disciples of people
of all the nations, baptizing them.”

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:40.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Alexa, play the Bible reading
for this week from jw.org.”

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Playing this week’s Bible reading.

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The letter of James.

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 1.

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Google devices,
the command is just a little different.

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s ask for a specific chapter.

00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hey, Google,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask jw.org to play Matthew 24.”

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Playing the Bible
starting at Matthew chapter 24.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:08.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 24:

“Now as Jesus was departing from . . . ”

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you learning another language?

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a feature that can help.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Alexa,

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
play the <i>Watchtower </i> study

<i>Watchtower</i><i> </i> study article in Russian.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just remember, though,

00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your newfound friend
does have some limitations.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Alexa, what do you think
of that new point in <i>The Watchtower?”</i>

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:43.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have an opinion on that.

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s probably just as well.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to listen
to the audio track of the monthly broadcast?

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

You can also ask for the broadcast
for a specific month or year.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how about some theocratic music?

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Alexa, play original songs from jw.org.”

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:44.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can also listen to our collection
of Kingdom songs in the same way.

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you want to practice

These features will be available

So look on jw.org

on how to enable these features

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah and his organization

that they make it
ever easier for us to benefit

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our rich library of spiritual content.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now look forward
to Scriptural talks to be presented

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by various members of the Governing Body.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, please give your attention
to Brother David Splane.

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His subject is intriguing:

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:03.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“An Attack Coming From the North.”

00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alexa!

00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you when I need you?

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, an attack coming from the north—

00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we talking about?

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:47.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we talking
about the attack of Gog of Magog?

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re talking about an attack

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a plague of locusts

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming from the north.

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can read  
about that plague in Joel chapter 2.

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to follow 
and leave your Bibles open, please,

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Joel because we’re going to be considering

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few verses in this prophecy.

00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:18.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Joel 2:7-9

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an attack by a plague,

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a swarm, of locusts.

00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joel 2:7:

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They charge like warriors,

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they scale a wall like soldiers,

00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:36.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each keeps to his own course,

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they do not swerve from their paths.

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They do not shove one another;

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each man advances in his course.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the weapons cause some to fall,
the others do not break ranks.

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Into the city they rush,
on the wall they run.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Onto the houses they climb,

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:58.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the windows they enter like a thief.”

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:03.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I think you can see
that we’re not talking about insects here.

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in verse 8:

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:08.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each <i>man </i> advances in his course.”

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re talking about people

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are likened to locusts,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have the characteristics of locusts.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the question is,

00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:23.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these good people,
or are they bad people?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for many years,

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including in the April 15, 2009, <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:35.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our understanding was
that these were good people.

00:10:35.117 --> 00:10:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, these were Jehovah’s people.

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the idea was that they
were just like locusts because,

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:48.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all,
you couldn’t stop them from preaching

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would go to any length
to keep preaching the good news

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—probably not go
into people’s windows like thieves,

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but otherwise, they’d stop short of that.

00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:00.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they would do other things.

00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preaching the good news

00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:05.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it didn’t matter what wall of opposition
was erected against them;

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would scale that wall
and keep preaching.

00:11:09.785 --> 00:11:14.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we were to confine ourselves
to a reading of just these three verses,

00:11:14.623 --> 00:11:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could make a case for that explanation.

00:11:18.194 --> 00:11:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, prophecy is best understood

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we consider it in context.

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look
at the context of Joel chapter 2,

00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are forced to come
to a different conclusion.

00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
a couple of reasons why this is so.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we talk about context,

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so let’s look at verse 20
in the same chapter,

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joel chapter 2.

00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here in verse 20,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re talking about the locusts
that come from the north,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to see
how Jehovah views these locusts.

00:11:55.364 --> 00:11:58.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these good people,
or are they bad people?

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 20:

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:04.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will drive the northerner
far away from you;

00:12:04.073 --> 00:12:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will disperse him
to a dry and desolate wasteland,

00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his vanguard toward the eastern sea.”

00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:16.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is talking
about the locusts here,

00:12:16.585 --> 00:12:18.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he says he’s going
to drive them away.

00:12:18.721 --> 00:12:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If these were Kingdom publishers
who are declaring the good news,

00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:24.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why would Jehovah want to drive them away?

00:12:24.927 --> 00:12:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then how does Jehovah view these locusts?

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:31.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the last part of verse 20:

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:34.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The foul smell from him will ascend,

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:38.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stench from him will keep ascending.”

00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not good.

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s looking like these locusts
are not good people.

00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:49.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is Jehovah talking about here?

00:12:49.318 --> 00:12:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pest control.

00:12:52.288 --> 00:12:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t like the locusts.

00:12:55.224 --> 00:12:57.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now look at verse 25.

00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says:

00:12:59.595 --> 00:13:04.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will make compensation
to you for the years

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the swarming locust,
the unwinged locust,

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the voracious locust,
and the devouring locust have eaten,

00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my great army that I sent among you.”

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, if the locusts
were ministers of the Kingdom,

00:13:19.415 --> 00:13:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why would Jehovah say
that he had to “make compensation”

00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the damage that the locusts have done?

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:27.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The locusts,
if they were Kingdom publishers,

00:13:27.022 --> 00:13:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would just be helping people
to save their lives.

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why would Jehovah call that damage?

00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:36.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would he say
they would have to “make compensation”?

00:13:36.932 --> 00:13:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s one aspect of this
that we considered.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s another one,
and that is the sequence of events.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 28,

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read
just the first part of verse 28.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And keep in mind, at this point,

00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has driven the locusts away.

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have done all the damage they could.

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:00.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have devastated the land.

00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:03.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have destroyed all of the vegetation,

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now Jehovah God has driven

00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:08.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the northerner,” the locust, away.

00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, what does he say in verse 28?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that

00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:18.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[after the locusts
have been driven away]

00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will pour out my spirit
on every sort of flesh.”

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s think about that.

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:29.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the locusts were really carrying out
the preaching work

00:14:29.385 --> 00:14:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t get the holy spirit
until after they finish the preaching work,

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does that mean
that we’ve been preaching all this time

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the help
of Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ll all agree,
we couldn’t possibly keep preaching

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:47.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the help
of Jehovah’s powerful holy spirit.

00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:53.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s obvious that we have
some thinking to do about this prophecy.

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, someone might bring up
Revelation chapter 9,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in Revelation chapter 9,

00:14:59.882 --> 00:15:02.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read of locusts with “human faces”

00:15:02.918 --> 00:15:06.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what “seemed to be crowns of gold”
on their heads,

00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they torment the wicked.

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:10.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And someone will say,

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, don’t those locusts represent

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s anointed servants
and their preaching work?”

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:18.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer is yes.

00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s true
that there are some similarities

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:24.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Revelation chapter 9
and Joel chapter 2,

00:15:24.473 --> 00:15:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there are
significant differences as well.

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:29.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in Joel’s prophecy,

00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the locusts come from the north,

00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:35.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they devastate the vegetation,
and they’re driven away.

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Revelation?

00:15:37.753 --> 00:15:40.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those locusts come out of an abyss,

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:44.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “they [are] told
not to harm the vegetation,”

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they stay on until their work is done.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are similarities,
but there are also differences.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:53.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we saying?

00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are saying that the locusts in Revelation

00:15:57.072 --> 00:16:01.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not the same as the locusts in Joel.

00:16:01.076 --> 00:16:04.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s not unusual for a symbol
to mean one thing in one Bible book

00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:07.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something quite different in another

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation 5:5, Jesus,
“the Lion of the tribe of Judah”;

00:16:12.955 --> 00:16:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter 5:8, Satan the Devil,
“a roaring lion”

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—same symbol but quite different meanings.

00:16:22.798 --> 00:16:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if the locusts are bad people,

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they are not Jehovah’s faithful servants,

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:35.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to look for a different explanation.

00:16:35.544 --> 00:16:38.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could it be?

00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a simple one.

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:46.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joel is predicting a military attack.

00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use Babylonian soldiers
who are just like locusts

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“my great army,” he calls them—

00:16:53.462 --> 00:16:56.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring his people into captivity.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the army is called “the northerner”

00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Babylonians will come up
and invade Israel from the north.

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:05.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we read Joel 2:8, 9

00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:09.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the idea of Babylonian soldiers,
it all makes sense.

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just read those verses again,
verse 8 and verse 9:

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They do not shove one another;

00:17:17.052 --> 00:17:19.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each man advances in his course.

00:17:19.888 --> 00:17:24.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the weapons cause some to fall,
the others do not break ranks.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Into the city they rush, 
on the wall they run.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Onto the houses they climb,
through the windows they enter like a thief.”

00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture the scene?

00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are soldiers everywhere.

00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:41.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can escape
the sword of the Babylonians.

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:44.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this concords
with what the prophet Isaiah wrote.

00:17:44.513 --> 00:17:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was looking into the future,

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:51.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was looking at this event
and the outcome of this event.

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he says:
“All who were found were taken prisoner,

00:17:55.591 --> 00:17:59.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they had fled far away.”

00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:04.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the prophet Jeremiah
foretold something similar

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 16:16.

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:13.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that; then we’ll go back to Joel.

00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:20.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 16:16:

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here I am sending
for many fishermen,’

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:29.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah,
‘and they will fish for them.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘After that I will send
for many hunters,

00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they will hunt them down

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘on every mountain and every hill

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and out of the clefts of the crags.’”

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we used to think
that the hunters and fishers

00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:48.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were hunting and fishing
for righthearted ones

00:18:48.177 --> 00:18:50.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sort of a marking work, I guess,

00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were looking
for righthearted ones.

00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:55.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, the revised <i>New World Translation</i><i> </i>

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:57.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to get
the right understanding of this.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what it says?

00:18:58.787 --> 00:19:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will <i>hunt them down.</i>”

00:19:01.223 --> 00:19:06.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the wicked who are being hunted,
not the righthearted ones.

00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just to confirm that, look at verse 17:

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:12.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For my eyes are on everything they do.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They have not been hidden from before me,

00:19:14.703 --> 00:19:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor has their error
been hidden from my eyes.”

00:19:17.806 --> 00:19:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 18, he says he is going

00:19:19.875 --> 00:19:23.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘repay the full amount of their error.’

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these are not righthearted ones.

00:19:25.814 --> 00:19:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are people
who might try to hide in the forest.

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:30.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll be hunted down.

00:19:30.819 --> 00:19:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they go out and try to hide in the sea,
they’ll be fished out of the water.

00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:40.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will not get away
from the Babylonian soldiers.

00:19:40.462 --> 00:19:43.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Joel has some good news for us,

00:19:43.232 --> 00:19:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want some good news after this,
don’t we?

00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the news is restoration.

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:54.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Joel is saying that at some point
an ample supply of spiritual food

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:56.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to become available for the people.

00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:58.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to Joel

00:19:58.747 --> 00:20:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time
read entirely verses 28 and 29.

00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:07.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joel 2
—Joel 2:28, 29:

00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:11.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that

00:20:11.593 --> 00:20:15.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[so the Babylonians
have done what they were going to do]

00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:20.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will pour out my spirit
on every sort of flesh,

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your sons
and your daughters will prophesy,

00:20:23.005 --> 00:20:26.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your old men will dream dreams,
and your young men will see visions.

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And even on my male slaves
and female slaves

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will pour out my spirit in those days.”

00:20:35.284 --> 00:20:37.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when was the prophecy fulfilled?

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:39.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, certainly.

00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:41.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter tells us

00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was first fulfilled
at Pentecost 33 C.E.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah poured out his spirit,
and at the end of that day,

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:54.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 3,000 publishers of the Kingdom.

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did Jehovah bless their zealous activity?

00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:04.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly did,
because by the end of the century,

00:21:04.212 --> 00:21:09.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands had become obedient to the word.

00:21:10.485 --> 00:21:12.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many thousands?

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:14.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible doesn’t say.

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do know that it would have to be

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:22.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot less than 144,000

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:25.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the search for Kingdom heirs
was going on in the first century,

00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:28.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it wasn’t nearly complete
by the end of the first century.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, the zealous activity of those 3,000

00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:35.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who began preaching the good news,

00:21:35.177 --> 00:21:39.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that zealous activity,
was blessed by Jehovah God,

00:21:39.314 --> 00:21:43.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thousands became obedient to the word.

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:47.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, can we see
a little bit of a parallel here?

00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:51.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year 1919.

00:21:51.927 --> 00:21:55.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1919,
according to official records,

00:21:55.063 --> 00:21:58.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were fewer than 6,000 publishers

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:01.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the good news.

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:04.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But has Jehovah blessed the efforts

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:06.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those 6,000 publishers?

00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:09.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the century,

00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he certainly had shown that he’d blessed
the efforts of the brothers.

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know that every year

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:19.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since 1983,

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:22.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 144,000

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:25.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been baptized each year?

00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:28.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our brothers today
don’t have the gifts of the spirit.

00:22:28.964 --> 00:22:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does this indicate?

00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:33.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It indicates that Jehovah has made

00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:36.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a mighty outpouring of his spirit

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in these last days.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a marvelous thing to behold.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you think of it,

00:22:43.145 --> 00:22:46.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we sort of had our explanation
backward in the past.

00:22:46.548 --> 00:22:49.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because in the past,
the idea was that the spirit

00:22:49.418 --> 00:22:52.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was poured out in 1919
and then the locusts went to work,

00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:54.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the locusts were Jehovah’s people.

00:22:54.723 --> 00:22:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not what the Bible says, is it?

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says
that the locusts finish their work,

00:22:59.361 --> 00:23:02.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after that, the spirit is poured out.

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:07.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today, thousands upon thousands
are getting baptized,

00:23:07.102 --> 00:23:10.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can expect that more
are going to get baptized in the future,

00:23:10.672 --> 00:23:12.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the new instructions we’ve received:

00:23:12.674 --> 00:23:15.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concentrate more on conversations;

00:23:15.343 --> 00:23:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concentrate more on starting Bible studies.

00:23:17.913 --> 00:23:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with those instructions in mind,

00:23:19.915 --> 00:23:24.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt we’re going to have
a tremendous increase in baptisms.

00:23:24.052 --> 00:23:26.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s a little word of caution:

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:30.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By all means, have conversations;

00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:34.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all means, read the Bible to people;

00:23:34.129 --> 00:23:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all means, offer Bible studies.

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t forget to offer literature.

00:23:43.705 --> 00:23:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you say,

00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I deliberately didn’t offer
one piece of literature all month,”

00:23:49.778 --> 00:23:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not bragging.

00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:55.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we print it for?

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:57.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers, let’s be realistic about it:

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:00.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a lovely conversation with someone,

00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:03.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you don’t find the person
for another three weeks.

00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:05.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave the person some literature

00:24:05.927 --> 00:24:10.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he can read
so that he can further his interest.

00:24:10.165 --> 00:24:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we might think
of this explanation and say:

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, that’s obvious.
This explanation is obvious.

00:24:19.141 --> 00:24:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why didn’t we see it before?”

00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer is, yes, it’s obvious

00:24:25.981 --> 00:24:30.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah’s time for us
to understand it comes along.

00:24:30.318 --> 00:24:33.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before Jehovah’s time
for us to understand it comes along,

00:24:33.688 --> 00:24:36.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it isn’t always so obvious.

00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:40.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we always look to Jehovah God
for clarification in matters.

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what has changed?

00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:46.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that in a few lands (but not many)

00:24:46.301 --> 00:24:49.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people do seem to be everywhere,

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as numerous as locusts,

00:24:51.306 --> 00:24:54.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s true
that in every land we won’t allow

00:24:54.276 --> 00:24:58.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any wall of opposition
to prevent us from doing our work;

00:24:58.213 --> 00:25:00.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re just not doing it

00:25:00.215 --> 00:25:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in fulfillment of Joel chapter 2
and Jeremiah chapter 16.

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s continue having a zealous share

00:25:07.489 --> 00:25:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in proclaiming the life-giving message
that God has given us,

00:25:11.026 --> 00:25:14.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that he won’t drive us away.

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:17.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will sustain us until the work is done.

00:25:26.575 --> 00:25:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was certainly
very encouraging and interesting.

00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane.

00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:35.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Herd
has something to share with us.

00:25:35.417 --> 00:25:40.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His title is
“Study the Bible With the <i>Study Bible.”</i>

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:47.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is the most important
person that you know?

00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:52.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as dedicated Witnesses of Jehovah,
I’m sure you would say, “Jehovah.”

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, who is the second
most important person that you know?

00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:02.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked my wife that once,
and she said, “You.”

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:06.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she said, “I’m just joking.”

00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:10.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s Jesus Christ, and we all know that.

00:26:12.254 --> 00:26:15.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, how important is it for us to know

00:26:15.857 --> 00:26:20.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just Jehovah but also his Son?

00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:22.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at something in the Bible.

00:26:22.364 --> 00:26:24.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles, if you please,

00:26:24.366 --> 00:26:28.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to John 17:3,

00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:33.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the most familiar scriptures
that we learn when we come into the truth,

00:26:33.074 --> 00:26:36.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 17:3:

00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:39.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This means everlasting life,
their coming to know you,

00:26:39.547 --> 00:26:44.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only true God,
and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, let’s think about it.

00:26:47.422 --> 00:26:49.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means our salvation
—doesn’t it?—

00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to know Jehovah God
and his Son, Jesus.

00:26:54.996 --> 00:26:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come to know them
—it means everlasting life.

00:26:59.668 --> 00:27:03.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our salvation rests on our knowledge

00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:06.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus.

00:27:06.941 --> 00:27:09.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means our life.

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:14.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But “coming to know,” what does this mean?

00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:21.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be what
the study note on this verse says?

00:27:22.424 --> 00:27:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The verb is used in the present tense
to express continuous action.”

00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:30.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!
That’s the correct answer.

00:27:30.932 --> 00:27:34.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So coming to know Jehovah

00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:39.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or someone else is an ongoing process.

00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:46.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to become
acquainted with that person.

00:27:47.315 --> 00:27:51.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if I should ask you,
How many of you know me?

00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raise your hands, please.

00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:55.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get them down because you
don’t really know me.

00:27:57.459 --> 00:28:00.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, in a sense,
you were right in raising your hand.

00:28:00.462 --> 00:28:02.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know who I am;
you know the position I have.

00:28:02.831 --> 00:28:06.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got my name, you’ve heard me
give some talks, and so forth.

00:28:06.368 --> 00:28:10.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have some knowledge of me,
but there are so many things

00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:12.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about me that you don’t know.

00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:18.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you did know these things,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it wouldn’t help you.

00:28:22.384 --> 00:28:24.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, coming to know Jehovah
is altogether different.

00:28:24.986 --> 00:28:28.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming to know Jesus is altogether different.

00:28:28.423 --> 00:28:31.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we know about them, why, then

00:28:31.426 --> 00:28:35.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the better we have a relationship with them.

00:28:35.263 --> 00:28:40.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re going to benefit
from that knowledge in ever so many ways.

00:28:40.268 --> 00:28:44.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want to come to know Jehovah.

00:28:44.005 --> 00:28:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how long we’ve been in the truth

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:49.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and some of you
have been there for decades),

00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:54.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must keep working
at coming to know Jehovah God

00:28:54.315 --> 00:28:57.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Son, Jesus.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is, 

00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:03.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we come to know
Jehovah better and better?

00:29:05.059 --> 00:29:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can learn much through creation.

00:29:08.963 --> 00:29:13.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look around us,
and it draws us ever closer to Jehovah.

00:29:13.902 --> 00:29:18.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see the animal creation,
as we have earlier today

00:29:18.907 --> 00:29:23.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the zebra and various birds
and other animals),

00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think of Jehovah and his great wisdom

00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:30.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the blessings
that he has showered upon us

00:29:30.185 --> 00:29:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of the creation around us.

00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:37.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how many of us enjoy going
to the beautiful parks a certain time of year

00:29:37.459 --> 00:29:41.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoying all the creation
—the greenery, the flowers, the trees?

00:29:41.062 --> 00:29:43.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, there’s just no end to it!

00:29:43.064 --> 00:29:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever we see fish
that we’ve never seen before

00:29:46.835 --> 00:29:49.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and there are so many fish
that are so new to us), 

00:29:49.471 --> 00:29:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their beauty—

00:29:51.473 --> 00:29:55.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all speaks of Jehovah
as the Creator, does it not?

00:29:55.477 --> 00:29:58.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we marvel at these wonderful things.

00:29:58.947 --> 00:30:03.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s another way that we benefit:

00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:05.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s through his Word.

00:30:05.587 --> 00:30:08.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s through the Bible that we’re able

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know the name of our God—Jehovah.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re able to appreciate
what that name stands for,

00:30:21.202 --> 00:30:23.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re drawn ever closer

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:26.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to him as a result of that knowledge.

00:30:26.608 --> 00:30:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re able to have
the knowledge of his purpose.

00:30:30.178 --> 00:30:32.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that he’s not responsible

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the wickedness
that goes on in the earth around us.

00:30:35.316 --> 00:30:39.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not of his making,
but yet people in the world feel that it is.

00:30:39.487 --> 00:30:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone dies, they blame God:
“Why did he take that beautiful little girl?

00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:44.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She was only two years old.

00:30:44.692 --> 00:30:46.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he do a thing like that?”

00:30:46.694 --> 00:30:50.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they have no knowledge,
but you have knowledge.

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:53.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person dies whom they love,

00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:57.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people in the world have no idea

00:30:57.338 --> 00:30:59.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the resurrection.

00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:01.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that two things can happen.

00:31:01.643 --> 00:31:03.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of them feel this way (not all),

00:31:03.645 --> 00:31:06.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that two things can happen
—either they go to heaven

00:31:06.347 --> 00:31:11.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become a flower in His garden
up there in some kind of a way

00:31:11.352 --> 00:31:14.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or else they go somewhere else

00:31:14.889 --> 00:31:17.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are tormented

00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:22.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
day and night forever and ever.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about God’s Son?

00:31:24.532 --> 00:31:27.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we come to know
him better and better.

00:31:27.235 --> 00:31:29.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s watch the following video, 

00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:33.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>How Can We Come to Know</i>
<i>the So</i><i>n </i><i>of God Better and Better?, </i>

00:31:33.608 --> 00:31:35.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven minutes.

00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:45.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was neither rich nor powerful
from the world’s point of view.

00:31:47.922 --> 00:31:51.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not even have a home
that he could call his own.

00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:54.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, his teachings
have changed the course of history.

00:31:55.897 --> 00:31:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have helped millions to gain

00:31:58.066 --> 00:32:01.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something more important
than material wealth.

00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:07.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man is Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:11.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to know his Son,

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:15.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love his Son, to be like his Son.

00:32:17.151 --> 00:32:20.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us know his Son,
Jehovah lovingly reserved

00:32:20.421 --> 00:32:23.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a portion of his Word, the four Gospels

00:32:23.324 --> 00:32:27.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—
and the book of Acts.

00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:31.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These Bible books
have helped true Christians to find

00:32:31.332 --> 00:32:35.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happiest, most meaningful life possible.

00:32:39.273 --> 00:32:42.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Gospels portray a man
of tender and deep feelings.

00:32:43.811 --> 00:32:47.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They show the wide range
of Jesus’ personality: 

00:32:47.315 --> 00:32:51.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compassion for a leper,

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indignation at self-righteous
religious leaders,

00:32:56.324 --> 00:32:59.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deep sadness
over the nation that rejected him.

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Gospels,

00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:07.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn of the many miracles
Jesus performed,

00:33:07.435 --> 00:33:10.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from healing the sick to raising the dead.

00:33:10.571 --> 00:33:13.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those miracles changed people’s lives,

00:33:13.808 --> 00:33:17.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet Jesus was not known
as Healer or a miracle worker.

00:33:17.612 --> 00:33:20.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he was called the Teacher.

00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a teacher he was!

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:27.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the wise sayings
of Jesus that have become 

00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:30.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
part of everyday speech

00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:32.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of years after he uttered them.

00:33:34.996 --> 00:33:37.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Gospels give
a fourfold historical account

00:33:37.865 --> 00:33:40.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the life and ministry of Jesus.

00:33:41.803 --> 00:33:45.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew, an apostle, evidently wrote 

00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:47.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Gospel for the Jews.

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 40 percent of its content is unique.

00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:58.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew gives us a far more extensive account
of the Sermon on the Mount.

00:33:58.753 --> 00:34:01.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this profound sermon,

00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:04.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus does not just tell us
the course of wisdom.

00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:06.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He does much more.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He shows us by explaining,
reasoning, and offering proof.

00:34:13.334 --> 00:34:17.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we marvel at the simplicity, clarity,

00:34:17.004 --> 00:34:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unparalleled wisdom
in the teachings of Jesus!

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:25.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark’s vigorous, fast-moving account

00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was seemingly written for non-Jewish readers.

00:34:29.717 --> 00:34:33.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions 19 miracles of Jesus,

00:34:33.654 --> 00:34:37.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the only account
of the deaf man whose hearing Jesus restored.

00:34:39.694 --> 00:34:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Considerately, Jesus takes
the man away from the crowd

00:34:44.132 --> 00:34:46.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heals him in a private place.

00:34:48.236 --> 00:34:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring to learn
that Jesus uses his power

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:55.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a considerate and thoughtful way!

00:34:57.445 --> 00:35:00.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke, the beloved physician,

00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:03.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote for both Jews and non-Jews.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 60 percent of this Gospel is unique,

00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:11.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the account of the resurrection

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:14.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the only child of the widow of Nain.

00:35:15.463 --> 00:35:18.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is “moved with pity” for this widow.

00:35:18.299 --> 00:35:20.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After resurrecting her son,

00:35:20.501 --> 00:35:23.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gives him to his mother.

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Death has torn the family apart,

00:35:26.607 --> 00:35:30.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jesus makes them a family again.

00:35:30.845 --> 00:35:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautifully this account reveals
a very tender side of the Son of God!

00:35:37.885 --> 00:35:42.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, the apostle who
was especially close to Jesus,

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote his Gospel last.

00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:47.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some 90 percent contains information

00:35:47.929 --> 00:35:50.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not found in the other three Gospels.

00:35:52.033 --> 00:35:55.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only John mentions
the resurrection of Lazarus.

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:57.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this touching account,

00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus openly sheds tears.

00:36:01.209 --> 00:36:03.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting it is to know that Jesus

00:36:03.611 --> 00:36:06.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has such deep empathy!

00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:12.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together, the four Gospels
paint a detailed portrait of Jesus.

00:36:12.553 --> 00:36:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Acts

00:36:14.989 --> 00:36:17.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also helps us to come to know Jesus.

00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:20.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Written by the physician Luke,
Acts is a continuation 

00:36:20.862 --> 00:36:23.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Gospel of Luke.

00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:26.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the opening chapter,
we learn of Jesus’ final words

00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:30.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his disciples before ascending to heaven.

00:36:30.438 --> 00:36:35.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The resurrected Jesus leaves
no doubt as to what he expects his disciples,

00:36:35.443 --> 00:36:37.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including us, to do.

00:36:37.645 --> 00:36:40.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are to be witnesses of him

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:42.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:47.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Acts helps us to understand

00:36:47.655 --> 00:36:50.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what being a follower of Jesus is all about.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we benefit fully
from the four Gospels and the book of Acts?

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must do more than just read them.

00:37:01.068 --> 00:37:04.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must slow down and take the time

00:37:04.171 --> 00:37:09.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study them carefully
and meditate on them deeply.

00:37:10.011 --> 00:37:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to bring the accounts
to life by doing research,

00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:15.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observing details,

00:37:15.716 --> 00:37:18.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comparing parallel accounts,

00:37:18.486 --> 00:37:21.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using our imagination

00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:24.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see, hear, and feel the action.

00:37:27.194 --> 00:37:30.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, our organization
has published a number of books

00:37:30.531 --> 00:37:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
designed to help us to dig deeply.

00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:37.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the annual meeting in 2015,

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:39.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body announced

00:37:39.273 --> 00:37:42.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a new online
<i>Study Bible</i><i> </i><i> </i>would be released.

00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:49.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can the <i>Study Bible</i>
help us come to know Jesus better?

00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:55.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within the four Gospels alone,
there are about 2,300 study notes.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:01.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Added to that, the image gallery,
maps, and introduction videos

00:38:01.262 --> 00:38:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring the Bible accounts to life.

00:38:06.267 --> 00:38:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no question about it.

00:38:08.636 --> 00:38:10.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our organization
has given us the help we need 

00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:14.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dig deeper into the Gospels
and the book of Acts

00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:17.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to reflect appreciatively on them.

00:38:20.147 --> 00:38:25.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, we come to know
the Son of God better and better.

00:38:27.188 --> 00:38:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We agree with the sentiment
of the apostle Peter, 

00:38:30.424 --> 00:38:32.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who said of Jesus: 

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though you never saw him, you love him.”

00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:48.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you benefited from using
the online <i>Study Bible? </i>

00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you will agree
that it is a great tool to help us

00:38:58.152 --> 00:39:01.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to know God’s Son better and better.

00:39:01.956 --> 00:39:05.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if accessing the information online

00:39:05.626 --> 00:39:08.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not easy for you as an individual?

00:39:08.863 --> 00:39:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s face it, not everyone has easy access

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Internet
or finds it easy to navigate online.

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:20.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Governing Body

00:39:20.641 --> 00:39:24.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is pleased to announce
the release of a printed version

00:39:24.245 --> 00:39:26.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Study Bible </i>

00:39:26.247 --> 00:39:30.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
containing the five Bible books
we just discussed in the video

00:39:30.851 --> 00:39:34.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew through Acts.

00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are we releasing
a printed version of the <i>Study Bible? </i>

00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:50.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many prefer
a printed medium such as a book,

00:39:50.771 --> 00:39:55.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for doing
deeper reading and making notes.

00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:57.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easier to slow down

00:39:57.845 --> 00:40:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and absorb the information at hand.

00:40:01.749 --> 00:40:06.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of us find it easier
when we use a printed and bound book

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our study periods.

00:40:08.923 --> 00:40:11.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever gone back
and found something you read in a book

00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:16.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you recall
that it was either at the top

00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:18.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bottom of a page

00:40:18.399 --> 00:40:22.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on the left- or on the right-hand side
of a two-page spread?

00:40:24.138 --> 00:40:27.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see
what this new publication looks like?

00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:34.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s watch the next video.

00:40:57.671 --> 00:41:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the features
of the printed <i>Study Bible</i>

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:06.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make it an effective tool for studying
the four Gospels and the book of Acts?

00:41:07.848 --> 00:41:09.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see.

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each Bible book has
an introduction with noteworthy facts,

00:41:16.857 --> 00:41:18.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study notes about the title,

00:41:18.926 --> 00:41:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an overview of the book.

00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Subheadings within the sacred text help you

00:41:23.964 --> 00:41:26.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to locate specific accounts more easily.

00:41:28.002 --> 00:41:31.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wide margins offer
ample space for note-taking.

00:41:31.972 --> 00:41:34.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study notes are found below the scriptures.

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:40.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The image gallery
contains 153 illustrations and photographs

00:41:40.381 --> 00:41:42.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the books of Matthew through Acts.

00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:46.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The map gallery helps you to combine

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specific events with locations.

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:54.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The glossary gives definitions
of Biblical and non-Biblical words

00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:58.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are used in the main text
or in the study notes.

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:03.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to read
the entire Bible in one year?

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then use the Bible reading schedule
to keep track of your progress.

00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This <i>Study Bible</i>
<i> </i>is designed to help you study more deeply 

00:42:12.213 --> 00:42:15.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring Bible accounts to life.

00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:19.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take, for instance,
the account of the widow in the temple.

00:42:20.888 --> 00:42:22.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Verse 41 says that

00:42:22.923 --> 00:42:25.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus “sat down

00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:27.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the treasury chests in view.”

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the study note
say about treasury chests?

00:42:37.338 --> 00:42:41.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s interesting:
‘According to rabbinical sources,

00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:44.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 13 treasury chests’ for collecting

00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the contributions
of those entering the temple.

00:42:47.381 --> 00:42:50.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these chests were
“apparently located in the area

00:42:50.918 --> 00:42:53.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called the Court of the Women.”

00:42:53.187 --> 00:42:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wonder where that was in the temple.

00:42:55.923 --> 00:42:57.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:42:57.558 --> 00:43:01.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note directs us to Appendix B11.

00:43:02.196 --> 00:43:07.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, look at those
four giant golden lampstands!

00:43:08.469 --> 00:43:11.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The facade surrounding the front doors

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:13.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have been plated with gold.’

00:43:14.742 --> 00:43:17.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Impressive!

00:43:17.044 --> 00:43:19.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “light from the rising sun

00:43:19.747 --> 00:43:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have been reflected
with dazzling brilliance.”

00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:26.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go back to the account.

00:43:26.453 --> 00:43:31.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 42 says: “Now a poor widow came

00:43:31.091 --> 00:43:35.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dropped in two small coins
of very little value.”

00:43:35.496 --> 00:43:38.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the parallel account say?

00:43:38.732 --> 00:43:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke’s account calls her “a needy widow.”

00:43:42.803 --> 00:43:45.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note says:

00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:48.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Needy . . . may denote a person

00:43:48.075 --> 00:43:51.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who lacks the basic necessities of life

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:55.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or someone for whom life
is a great struggle.”

00:43:55.015 --> 00:43:57.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Might the widow have felt that her small gift

00:43:57.718 --> 00:44:00.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was too insignificant to matter?

00:44:01.588 --> 00:44:04.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve felt that way before.

00:44:04.591 --> 00:44:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus showed that the widow
and her contribution

00:44:08.362 --> 00:44:11.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were valuable to Jehovah.

00:44:11.632 --> 00:44:16.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This poor widow
put in more than all the others . . .

00:44:16.637 --> 00:44:19.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She . . . put in everything she had.”

00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:23.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave her best.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I give Jehovah my best,

00:44:27.281 --> 00:44:32.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how much it is,
it is precious to him.

00:44:34.188 --> 00:44:38.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the <i>Study Bible</i>
is designed to help us study

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible more deeply.

00:44:41.995 --> 00:44:44.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this printed edition
of Matthew through Acts

00:44:44.264 --> 00:44:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help you to come to know Jesus Christ, 

00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of God, better and better.

00:44:59.613 --> 00:45:01.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jehovah set aside

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:05.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a significant portion of his Word

00:45:05.886 --> 00:45:09.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

The Mozambique special convention

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is truly outstanding

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.460 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for so many different reasons.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing
that has made this convention unique

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that we have so many courageous brothers

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been in prison for their faith

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Angola, Korea, Malawi, Zimbabwe,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from some of the countries in Europe

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who had to really stand up
and set an example.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And to have them all here

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:42.646 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with our courageous

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:43.814 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Mozambican brothers

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has made this

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:46.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
 convention so special.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.278 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is very encouraging

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:50.988 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be at this special convention.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We have spent ten years

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:53.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the “reeducation camps”

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with our brothers from Malawi,
and we were at the same camp.

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today we are together
at this special convention.

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very encouraging.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1990, I was judged and condemned

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to 15 months of prison in Paris.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:10.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were about 100 brothers in prison.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.259 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They tried to shame us,

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but thanks to Jehovah, we had courage.

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:17.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And today this beautiful convention

00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:19.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fills us with even more courage.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:22.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was one of the brothers serving

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.813 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as a bicycle courier during the ban,

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivering literature long distances.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult work
because the police were searching for us.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed us with courage,
giving us a heart without fear.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because of our Christian neutrality,

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.746 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were in prison.

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:42.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Although it was a difficult time,

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us courage to endure,

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we are here together.

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really thank Jehovah for that.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.344 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was arrested and sentenced

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.471 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to six years in prison.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all these difficulties,

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today I feel very happy.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel very encouraged.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.735 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At this convention, we released 

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Greek Scriptures</i>  in Tshwa and Sena.

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:22.705 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Jehovah,

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for this wonderful provision.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I will surely use it

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:28.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
while speaking about

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:31.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s name in Tshwa.

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:33.048 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to have

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this Bible in the Tshwa language.

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easy to read,
and it will improve our family worship.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those were the first two local languages

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mozambique to receive
any part of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was a very exciting day!

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention was tied

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in to 18 locations in Mozambique.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A total of 1,685 were baptized.

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:07.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have faith in Jehovah

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:08.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and want to have

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a close relationship with him.

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have commented
on the fact that among the 981

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were baptized in Maputo,
there were many young ones.

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:21.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it just shows
that the families here in Mozambique

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are working very hard with their young ones 

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help them to know Jehovah and love Jehovah

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know what it means to be courageous.

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:33.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To organize

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:34.943 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a special convention

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:35.986 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Africa 

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires a lot of work and a lot of planning.

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can truly see
the blessing of Jehovah here

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because everything has gone so beautifully

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the delegates are so happy!

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can really feel
that Jehovah’s spirit is with us.

00:03:59.718 --> 00:04:00.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before the work

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:02.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was banned in Mozambique,

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.014 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we used to sing to Jehovah.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the camps, we continued to sing joyfully.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:11.105 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now with the special convention,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we continue to sing to our delegates.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the delegates
commented that their favorite part

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the convention was going out
in the ministry with the local brothers.

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the brothers
may have very limited resources,

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they showed them tremendous hospitality;

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made a huge impression.

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the delegates even said
that when they go back,

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is going to have
a life-changing effect on them.

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:45.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We want to assure

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these dear brothers and sisters

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body loves them.

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:53.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But greater than that,
Jehovah God knows about them;

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:56.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he loves them; he’s supporting them.

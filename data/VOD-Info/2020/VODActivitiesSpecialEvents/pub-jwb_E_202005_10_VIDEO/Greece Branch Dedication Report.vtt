The modern-day history
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Greece

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes a long record of legal battles 

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to establish the freedom
to preach the good news.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, today,
for the most part, opposition has subsided

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:21.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Greece branch continues to spearhead 

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work in Cyprus and in Greece.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What led up to this branch dedication?

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a ten-year search for a suitable site

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the new branch and with help

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Worldwide
Design/Construction Department,

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a location was found.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new branch office
is located on the outskirts of Athens,

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close to the busy port of Piraeus.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the new offices like?

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with the translation office,

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was dedicated in October 2016.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation office is located
on the second floor of this building

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just above the dotted line.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most members of the translation team
live in the apartments above the offices.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, the brothers translate into Greek,

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greek Sign Language,
and two Romany languages.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new branch office is located

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about three miles
from the translation office.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It occupies one half of this new building.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A commercial firm
put up the building’s structure,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:31.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a local
design construction team customized

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the inside for our needs.

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a look at the new branch.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is the lobby.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see the rooms,

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the offices,

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the dining room.

00:01:51.507 --> 00:01:54.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dedication of the beautiful new branch

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was scheduled for Saturday,
November 17, 2018.

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But things did not go as planned.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jamie and I left
for the airport on Thursday morning,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some light snow was expected,

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we arrived early.

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, much more snow fell

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:13.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than was forecast.

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our flight was delayed,
and eventually it was canceled.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after spending 14 hours at Newark airport,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we returned to Warwick.

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to wait until the next evening
to catch a flight.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day, the brothers in Greece
were gathering in the Bethel dining room

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the branch dedication,

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our late departure meant
that we would not arrive

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time for the program.

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kindly, the Teaching Committee

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adjusted the schedule
so that the dedication talk could be

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented on Sunday.

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what took place in Greece

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when all the brothers found out
that we wouldn’t make it in time

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the dedication talk on Saturday?

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to Brother Cook:
“You know, Brother Cook,

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there is anything you need help with,
please let me know.”

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t expect this.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother LaFranca gave
an encouraging service talk

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that enhanced the weekend program.

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We arrived at the branch

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
late Saturday afternoon
in time to greet the brothers there.

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Sunday morning,
we traveled to the Assembly Hall

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with 116 delegates

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 16 countries.

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The attendance
at the Assembly Hall was 1,680.

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the congregations in Greece and Cyprus

00:03:41.658 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were either tied in or watched
the recorded program,

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the total attendance 27,718.

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you desire to dedicate
this branch office

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God to be used

00:03:57.174 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exclusively for his praise and glory

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to promote his pure worship

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your branch territory?

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the program, in Greek style,

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all rejoiced in what Jehovah had done.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:23.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 84 Bethelites,

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
44 commuters,

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all in attendance at the Assembly Hall,

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enthusiastically sent
their love and greetings

to the Governing Body
and the Bethel family

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the United States.

Jesus said that the identifying mark

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of true Christians would be

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their love for one another.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was especially evident

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our 2019 “Love Never Fails”!
International Conventions.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never expected
the welcome that we received.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were over 200 brothers in the airport.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, it’s like I’m in Paradise already
because of the love I feel here.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever I turn, there’s love.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I walked around the corner,

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reception of the friends,
the way they embraced me,

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something
that I could not have expected.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:52.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one could’ve even described it to me.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mexico has a lot of different cultures.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:08.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here in this stadium,

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are one people united by love,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving Jehovah.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s unique, it’s wonderful,

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s all thanks to love.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter where we come from
or what language we speak.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The language here is love.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love of neighbor motivated us
to share in a global preaching campaign.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Foreign delegates
worked shoulder to shoulder

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with hosts from the local city

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite millions of people
from around the world

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one of the 24 international conventions.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:52.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gave our brothers and sisters
from different parts of the globe

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an opportunity to get to know each other,

00:01:55.678 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
united by the common goal of spreading
the good news to everyone they met.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked in field service with a sister

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who used to study the Bible
with a Brazilian woman.

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:11.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister had prayed to send
a Brazilian sister to accompany her.

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we visited the woman together,

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she could see the love we have between us

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the efforts we made to come so far

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the convention here in Denmark.

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:24.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over a million people attended

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the international conventions
in many different languages.

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both foreign and local delegates
as well as newly interested ones

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to learn firsthand
how love never fails.

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:41.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Clothe yourselves with love,

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for it is a perfect bond of union.”

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:47.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, love identifies us.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility
—that’s love in action.

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loyal love is a beautiful aspect

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:58.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s personality.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jesus made it simple, didn’t he?

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: ‘Look for the love.

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:09.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the love,
and you’ll find the right religion.’

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christian love has power.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can reach hearts in ways

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the spoken word cannot.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really,
what other group of persons on earth

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are interested in discussing
love that doesn’t fail?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When someone sees us,

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they should see a loving individual.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they see any one of us

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are servants of Jehovah,

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:41.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they should see love.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to spending time in the ministry,
activities were planned

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that delegates could get to know

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their brothers better.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gave delegates the opportunity
to learn about the culture

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:06.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our spiritual heritage
in the host country.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:11.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cities,
they visited exhibits and locations

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where previously our faith
and love had been tested.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, delegates in Berlin
had the opportunity to visit

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sachsenhausen concentration camp

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where many of our brothers were imprisoned

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during World War II.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was especially amazing,

00:04:29.373 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the circumstances
those brothers and sisters faced,

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even their persecutors

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to recognize
the true identifying mark of Christianity

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—of love.

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:45.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This visit showed the faithful endurance
our brothers and sisters

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:48.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrated under vicious persecution

00:04:48.058 --> 00:04:51.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love they had for Jehovah

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:55.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
–a fitting example of love that never fails.

00:04:56.108 --> 00:05:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate
Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he called them a brood.

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:07.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But instead,
Jehovah’s Witnesses are still here,

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proving that Christian love never fails.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:19.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example of faith and endurance
was seen in Seoul, Korea.

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 1953,
young Korean brothers had been imprisoned

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for refusing military service.

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:32.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Altogether,

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 19,000 brothers
who refused to compromise their faith

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:46.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Delegates were able to visit
a neutrality exhibition to learn more

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:49.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the strong faith and unwavering courage

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these young brothers displayed.

00:05:52.414 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On February 28, 2019,

00:05:56.543 --> 00:05:59.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last of our imprisoned brothers
was released.

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:06.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I received
a not-guilty verdict just two weeks ago,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to attend
this international convention.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am so grateful to Jehovah.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son receiving this acquittal
enabled him to attend this convention.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never imagined this would be possible.

00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:24.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it was
for these brothers to attend

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:29.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this historic international convention
alongside their families

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thousands of foreign delegates!

00:06:33.288 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just being able to sit
next to my son for the convention

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely fills my heart.

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:52.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite an ongoing economic crisis,

00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:54.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many delegates from Venezuela

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:57.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to attend
the international convention

00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:59.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming from Venezuela,

00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:05.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s difficult to earn
a living or save money.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:10.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to sell our electronic devices
and work long hours to be here.

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:12.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these sacrifices

00:07:12.202 --> 00:07:14.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will always be worth it.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:21.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love we show to our brothers is possible

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:25.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the love Jehovah shows us.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:30.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An expression of his love to us
comes in the form of his Word, the Bible.

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:32.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:37.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delegates from Iceland
were delighted to receive a special gift.

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:40.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are happy to announce the release

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Icelandic <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</i>

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,
at several 2019 international conventions,

00:07:56.955 --> 00:08:01.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers received
the revised <i>New World Translation </i>

00:08:01.293 --> 00:08:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:39.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can really feel the love from Jehovah.

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s given us this wonderful gift

00:08:42.042 --> 00:08:45.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he wants us to know
that the words in this book

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:47.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are from him.

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:51.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conventions also gave
thousands the opportunity

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express their love for Jehovah

00:08:53.595 --> 00:08:56.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by symbolizing their dedication to him

00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:59.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through baptism.

00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:06.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The love among our brothers
was evident to onlookers as well.

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:08.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police directing traffic

00:09:08.819 --> 00:09:12.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had less work than they normally do.

00:09:12.072 --> 00:09:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The atmosphere was so contagious
that they started greeting

00:09:15.992 --> 00:09:18.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign and local delegates.

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:20.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were so happy.

00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:24.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said:
“This country does not need more police.

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What it needs is more Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:09:28.588 --> 00:09:33.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our 2019 international conventions
have given us

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:36.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an opportunity to demonstrate
how Jehovah’s love

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivates us to love.

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:43.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we approach
the end of this system of things,

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:47.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to need love
more than ever before.

00:09:47.899 --> 00:09:50.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
we need loyalty;

00:09:50.193 --> 00:09:52.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 of course,
we need endurance;

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:56.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:00:04 Jesus said that the identifying mark
00:00:07 of true Christians would be
00:00:09 their love for one another.
00:00:11 This was especially evident
00:00:13 at our 2019 “Love Never Fails”! International Conventions.
00:00:26 I never expected the welcome that we received.
00:00:29 There were over 200 brothers in the airport.
00:00:34 For me, it’s like I’m in Paradise already because of the love I feel here.
00:00:39 Wherever I turn, there’s love.
00:00:42 As I walked around the corner,
00:00:45 the reception of the friends, the way they embraced me,
00:00:48 was something that I could not have expected.
00:00:50 No one could’ve even described it to me.
00:01:04 Mexico has a lot of different cultures.
00:01:06 But here in this stadium,
00:01:08 we are one people united by love,
00:01:11 serving Jehovah.
00:01:13 That’s unique, it’s wonderful,
00:01:16 and it’s all thanks to love.
00:01:19 It doesn’t matter where we come from or what language we speak.
00:01:23 The language here is love.
00:01:29 Our love of neighbor motivated us to share in a global preaching campaign.
00:01:35 Foreign delegates worked shoulder to shoulder
00:01:38 with hosts from the local city
00:01:40 to invite millions of people from around the world
00:01:43 to one of the 24 international conventions.
00:01:48 This gave our brothers and sisters from different parts of the globe
00:01:52 an opportunity to get to know each other,
00:01:55 united by the common goal of spreading the good news to everyone they met.
00:02:01 I worked in field service with a sister
00:02:03 who used to study the Bible with a Brazilian woman.
00:02:06 The sister had prayed to send a Brazilian sister to accompany her.
00:02:11 When we visited the woman together,
00:02:13 she could see the love we have between us
00:02:16 and the efforts we made to come so far
00:02:19 to attend the convention here in Denmark.
00:02:21 Over a million people attended
00:02:24 the international conventions in many different languages.
00:02:28 Both foreign and local delegates as well as newly interested ones
00:02:32 were able to learn firsthand how love never fails.
00:02:37 “Clothe yourselves with love,
00:02:41 for it is a perfect bond of union.”
00:02:44 First, love identifies us.
00:02:50 Humility —that’s love in action.
00:02:53 Loyal love is a beautiful aspect
00:02:56 of Jehovah’s personality.
00:02:58 Well, Jesus made it simple, didn’t he?
00:03:01 He said: ‘Look for the love.
00:03:05 Look for the love, and you’ll find the right religion.’
00:03:10 Christian love has power.
00:03:12 It can reach hearts in ways
00:03:15 that the spoken word cannot.
00:03:18 But, really, what other group of persons on earth
00:03:22 are interested in discussing love that doesn’t fail?
00:03:26 When someone sees us,
00:03:28 they should see a loving individual.
00:03:31 When they see any one of us
00:03:34 who are servants of Jehovah,
00:03:37 then they should see love.
00:03:43 In addition to spending time in the ministry, activities were planned
00:03:47 so that delegates could get to know
00:03:50 their brothers better.
00:03:57 This gave delegates the opportunity to learn about the culture
00:04:01 and our spiritual heritage in the host country.
00:04:07 In some cities, they visited exhibits and locations
00:04:11 where previously our faith and love had been tested.
00:04:15 For example, delegates in Berlin had the opportunity to visit
00:04:19 Sachsenhausen concentration camp
00:04:22 where many of our brothers were imprisoned
00:04:24 during World War II.
00:04:27 I thought it was especially amazing,
00:04:29 despite the circumstances those brothers and sisters faced,
00:04:32 that even their persecutors
00:04:34 had to recognize the true identifying mark of Christianity
00:04:37 —of love.
00:04:41 This visit showed the faithful endurance our brothers and sisters
00:04:45 demonstrated under vicious persecution
00:04:48 and the love they had for Jehovah
00:04:51 –a fitting example of love that never fails.
00:04:56 Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate Jehovah’s Witnesses;
00:05:00 he called them a brood.
00:05:03 But instead, Jehovah’s Witnesses are still here,
00:05:07 proving that Christian love never fails.
00:05:15 Another example of faith and endurance was seen in Seoul, Korea.
00:05:22 Since 1953, young Korean brothers had been imprisoned
00:05:27 for refusing military service.
00:05:30 Altogether,
00:05:32 over 19,000 brothers who refused to compromise their faith
00:05:37 spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.
00:05:41 Delegates were able to visit a neutrality exhibition to learn more
00:05:46 about the strong faith and unwavering courage
00:05:49 these young brothers displayed.
00:05:52 On February 28, 2019,
00:05:56 the last of our imprisoned brothers was released.
00:06:02 Because I received a not-guilty verdict just two weeks ago,
00:06:06 I was able to attend this international convention.
00:06:09 I am so grateful to Jehovah.
00:06:13 My son receiving this acquittal enabled him to attend this convention.
00:06:18 We never imagined this would be possible.
00:06:21 What a joy it was for these brothers to attend
00:06:24 this historic international convention alongside their families
00:06:29 and thousands of foreign delegates!
00:06:33 Just being able to sit next to my son for the convention
00:06:35 completely fills my heart.
00:06:48 Despite an ongoing economic crisis,
00:06:52 many delegates from Venezuela
00:06:54 were able to attend the international convention
00:06:57 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
00:07:00 Coming from Venezuela,
00:07:02 it’s difficult to earn a living or save money.
00:07:05 We had to sell our electronic devices and work long hours to be here.
00:07:10 But these sacrifices
00:07:12 will always be worth it.
00:07:19 The love we show to our brothers is possible
00:07:21 because of the love Jehovah shows us.
00:07:25 An expression of his love to us comes in the form of his Word, the Bible.
00:07:30 In Copenhagen, Denmark,
00:07:32 delegates from Iceland were delighted to receive a special gift.
00:07:37 We are happy to announce the release
00:07:40 of the Icelandic New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:07:51 Additionally, at several 2019 international conventions,
00:07:56 our brothers received the revised New World Translation
00:08:01 in the language of their heart.
00:08:37 I can really feel the love from Jehovah.
00:08:39 He’s given us this wonderful gift
00:08:42 because he wants us to know that the words in this book
00:08:45 are from him.
00:08:48 The conventions also gave thousands the opportunity
00:08:51 to express their love for Jehovah
00:08:53 by symbolizing their dedication to him
00:08:56 through baptism.
00:09:02 The love among our brothers was evident to onlookers as well.
00:09:06 The police directing traffic
00:09:08 had less work than they normally do.
00:09:12 The atmosphere was so contagious that they started greeting
00:09:15 foreign and local delegates.
00:09:18 They were so happy.
00:09:20 They said: “This country does not need more police.
00:09:24 What it needs is more Jehovah’s Witnesses!”
00:09:28 Our 2019 international conventions have given us
00:09:33 an opportunity to demonstrate how Jehovah’s love
00:09:36 motivates us to love.
00:09:40 Well, as we approach the end of this system of things,
00:09:43 we’re going to need love more than ever before.
00:09:47 Of course, we need loyalty;
00:09:50  of course, we need endurance;
00:09:52 and, of course, we’re going to sing that song of courage.
00:09:56 But remember what else we want
00:09:59 —Jehovah’s loyal love!
00:10:02 May we be determined to imitate Him in letting
00:10:06 our love never ever fail,
00:10:12 all to Jehovah’s glory.

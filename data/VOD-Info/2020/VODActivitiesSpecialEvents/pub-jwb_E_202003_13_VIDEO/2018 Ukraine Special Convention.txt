00:00:01 In July 2018, a long-awaited event took place
00:00:05 in Lviv, Ukraine:
00:00:07 the “Be Courageous”! Special Convention.
00:00:10 The delegates were arriving from nine different countries
00:00:13 at all times of day and night.
00:00:16 Even so, all of them were warmly welcomed by local brothers and sisters.
00:00:21 When we got here, we were picked up and everything was just perfectly organized.
00:00:26 For about a year and a half,
00:00:28 brothers in various departments were preparing for this event.
00:00:32 We are confident in Jehovah’s blessing and support.
00:00:36 The delegates also worked with local publishers in the field service,
00:00:39 inviting the residents of Lviv to the convention.
00:00:43 The branch office organized different excursions.
00:00:46 Tours in the ancient city center enriched the delegates
00:00:50 not only culturally but also spiritually.
00:00:53 On some buildings, they could see Bible citations
00:00:56 and the Tetragrammaton of God’s name.
00:01:00 Outside of Lviv, tours included visiting the picturesque
00:01:04 Carpathian Mountains region.
00:01:08 The delegates also visited three castles,
00:01:10 in which art and historical exhibitions were on display.
00:01:14 In the Svirzh Castle, they enjoyed a dancing program,
00:01:17 in which about 90 brothers and sisters participated.
00:01:26 In the branch office, guests learned about the work done by each department
00:01:30 and got acquainted with the Bethel family, who had prepared a special program for them.
00:01:37 The evening gathering program consisted of songs, dances,
00:01:41 and a video about the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine.
00:01:45 It encouraged the guests a lot.
00:01:47 Many of them were even moved to tears.
00:01:51 At the same time, preparations at the stadium were underway.
00:01:56 We are waiting for the moment
00:01:58 when this whole stadium will be filled with faithful servants of Jehovah.
00:02:03 It’s a special privilege for the Branch Committee
00:02:06 in Ukraine to warmly welcome all of you!
00:02:14 We couldn’t speak the language.
00:02:16 You could barely say any words to each other, but the hugs and—
00:02:19 You could feel the love, and that’s why it was so special.
00:02:22 The convention program was held in four languages: Ukrainian,
00:02:27 English, Russian, and Russian Sign Language.
00:02:30 It helped everyone to be courageous despite any trials.
00:02:36 A special time for me
00:02:38 was to be able to be with my brothers and sisters
00:02:42 and learn to have courage despite difficulties.
00:02:47 The peak attendance at the convention
00:02:49 was 25,489,
00:02:53 with 255 being baptized.
00:02:59 May Jehovah richly bless all of you.
00:03:02 You will never regret the decision you made today.
00:03:11 If God is for us, no one can be against us.
00:03:16 So put your trust in Jehovah
00:03:19 because there are more who are with us
00:03:23 than against us.
00:03:30 I can say one thing that stood out to me is that it taught me hospitality
00:03:33 at a level that I’ve never experienced before.
00:03:36 The way the brothers and sisters have been kind to us and treated us
00:03:39 is a lesson that I’ll bring back with me.
00:03:44 We can see that love.
00:03:46 It’s just another demonstration that we are in the true religion,
00:03:50 and this is Jehovah’s organization.
00:03:52 So it’s all thanks to him.

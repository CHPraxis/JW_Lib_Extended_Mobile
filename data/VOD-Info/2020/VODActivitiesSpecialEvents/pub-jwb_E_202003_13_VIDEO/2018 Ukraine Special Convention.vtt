when this whole stadium will be filled

It’s a special privilege
for the Branch Committee

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ukraine to warmly welcome all of you!

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t speak the language.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could barely say any words
to each other, but the hugs and—

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could feel the love,
and that’s why it was so special.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention program
was held in four languages: Ukrainian, 

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
English, Russian,
and Russian Sign Language.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped everyone to be courageous
despite any trials.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A special time for me

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to be able to be
with my brothers and sisters

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn to have courage
despite difficulties.

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The peak attendance at the convention

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was 25,489,

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 255 being baptized.

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah richly bless all of you.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will never regret
the decision you made today.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:16.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If God is for us, no one can be against us.

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put your trust in Jehovah

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there are more
who are with us

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:25.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than against us.

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say one thing that stood out to me
is that it taught me hospitality

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a level
that I’ve never experienced before.

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way the brothers and sisters
have been kind to us and treated us

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:42.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a lesson that I’ll bring back with me.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see that love.

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:50.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just another demonstration
that we are in the true religion,

00:03:50.084 --> 00:03:52.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is Jehovah’s organization.

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s all thanks to him.

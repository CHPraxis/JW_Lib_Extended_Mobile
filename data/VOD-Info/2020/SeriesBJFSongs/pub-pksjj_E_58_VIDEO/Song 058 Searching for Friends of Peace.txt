00:00:08 Jesus commanded: ‘Let the truth be heard.’
00:00:15 In summer heat, on dusty roads, He let all hear Jehovah’s word.
00:00:24 He loved God’s sheep and called to ev’ryone.
00:00:32 He searched the land from the sunrise ‘til the day was done.
00:00:41 From door to door and in the street, We share with ev’ryone we meet
00:00:48 The news that soon man’s troubles all will be gone.
00:00:56 Searching the world For friends of peace in ev’ry nation,
00:01:05 Searching to find A heart inclined toward salvation,
00:01:13 Wanting to leave No stone unturned.
00:01:22 Time waits for no one, so the search goes on.
00:01:29 A million hearts, a million lives, We give our all to save just one.
00:01:38 Love is the force that makes us call again.
00:01:45 A wounded heart can be healed, and broken lives can mend.
00:01:54 We search the towns and city squares, And when we find someone who cares,
00:02:02 The joy we feel inspires us to go on.
00:02:10 Searching the world For friends of peace in ev’ry nation,
00:02:19 Searching to find A heart inclined toward salvation,
00:02:27 Wanting to leave No stone unturned.
00:02:42 Searching the world For friends of peace in ev’ry nation,
00:02:51 Searching to find A heart inclined toward salvation,
00:02:59 Wanting to leave No stone unturned.

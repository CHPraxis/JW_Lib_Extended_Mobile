00:00:06 Esther had a simple life When she was just a girl.
00:00:13 Raised by her cousin Mordecai, She learned Jehovah’s will.
00:00:20 Her life then changed so fast. She was chosen to be queen.
00:00:27 Esther obeyed; she showed courage.
00:00:32 So this teaches me:
00:00:36 I want to be like Esther. She had courage; she was brave.
00:00:43 She took a stand for Jehovah. I want to do the same.
00:00:51 I want to be like Esther ‘Cause she listened and obeyed.
00:00:57 I want to be like her ‘Cause Esther—she was brave.
00:01:04 Esther’s husband was the king, And he did not serve God.
00:01:11 Still, she showed respect for him; For that she was cherished.
00:01:18 And one day she was asked To stop a very evil scheme.
00:01:25 Esther obeyed; she showed courage.
00:01:30 So this teaches me:
00:01:33 I want to be like Esther. She had courage; she was brave.
00:01:40 She took a stand for Jehovah. I want to do the same.
00:01:48 I want to be like Esther ‘Cause she listened and obeyed.
00:01:55 I want to be like her ‘Cause Esther—she was brave.

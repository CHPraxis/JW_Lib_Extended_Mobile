Esther had a simple life
When she was just a girl.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raised by her cousin Mordecai,
She learned Jehovah’s will.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her life then changed so fast.
She was chosen to be queen.

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther obeyed;
she showed courage.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this teaches me:

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be like Esther.
She had courage; she was brave.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She took a stand for Jehovah.
I want to do the same.

I want to be like Esther
‘Cause she listened and obeyed.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be like her
‘Cause Esther—she was brave.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther’s husband was the king,
And he did not serve God.

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, she showed respect for him;
For that she was cherished.

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one day she was asked
To stop a very evil scheme.

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther obeyed;
she showed courage.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this teaches me:

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

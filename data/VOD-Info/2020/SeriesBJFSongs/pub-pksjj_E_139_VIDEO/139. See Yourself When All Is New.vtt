Just see yourself, just see me too;
Just see us all in a world that is new.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think how you’ll feel, how it will be,
To live in peace, to be truly free.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:43.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No evil one will then prevail;
Rule by our God cannot ever fail.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time will have come
for a new earthly start,

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song of our praises
will pour out from our heart:

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We thank you, our God,
for all you have done.

“All things are new
by the rule of your Son.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fullness of our heart
overflows in our song;

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory and honor
and praise to you belong.”

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:40.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now see yourself, and see me too;
And look ahead to a world that is new.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:51.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No sight we see, no sound we hear
Will cause alarm or give rise to fear.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All has come true, just as he said;
Now over mankind, his tent is spread.

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He now will awaken
those sleeping in death;

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their voices will join ours with
ev’ry grateful breath:

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We thank you, our God,
for all you have done.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are new
by the rule of your Son.

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fullness of our heart
overflows in our song;

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory and honor
and praise to you belong.”

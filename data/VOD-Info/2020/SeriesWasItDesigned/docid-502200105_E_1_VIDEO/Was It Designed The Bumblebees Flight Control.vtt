Humans have a fascination with flying.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for many who fly small aircraft,

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the smaller the plane,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the greater the instability.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, the tiny bumblebee is capable of flying

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with unmatched stability in strong winds.

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does such a small creature 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outfly even the most experienced pilots?

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bee will reduce speed
when it encounters wind turbulence,

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowing it to focus its energy
on correcting its flight path.

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, the bee
is more susceptible to flight disruption

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the wind blows against it horizontally.

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So another key to stability

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it will roll midair
into the force of the wind.

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This repositioning allows for better control 

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the bee can easily adjust
to oncoming vertical turbulence.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understanding
the bumblebee’s innate control system

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could someday help aeronautical engineers
design small aircraft

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
better suited
for stable flight in adverse weather.

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
scientists still have much to learn

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before practical application is possible.

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the bumblebee’s impressive ability

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fly in turbulent weather
a product of evolution?

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was it designed?

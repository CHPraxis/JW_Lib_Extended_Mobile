00:00:07 Humans have a fascination with flying.
00:00:11 But for many who fly small aircraft,
00:00:15 the smaller the plane,
00:00:17 the greater the instability.
00:00:21 Yet, the tiny bumblebee is capable of flying
00:00:25 with unmatched stability in strong winds.
00:00:29 How does such a small creature
00:00:32 outfly even the most experienced pilots?
00:00:36 The bee will reduce speed when it encounters wind turbulence,
00:00:40 allowing it to focus its energy on correcting its flight path.
00:00:45 Additionally, the bee is more susceptible to flight disruption
00:00:49 when the wind blows against it horizontally.
00:00:51 So another key to stability
00:00:54 is that it will roll midair into the force of the wind.
00:00:58 This repositioning allows for better control
00:01:01 as the bee can easily adjust to oncoming vertical turbulence.
00:01:05 Understanding the bumblebee’s innate control system
00:01:09 could someday help aeronautical engineers design small aircraft
00:01:13 better suited for stable flight in adverse weather.
00:01:17 In the meantime, scientists still have much to learn
00:01:20 before practical application is possible.
00:01:23 What do you think?
00:01:25 Is the bumblebee’s impressive ability
00:01:27 to fly in turbulent weather a product of evolution?
00:01:31 Or was it designed?

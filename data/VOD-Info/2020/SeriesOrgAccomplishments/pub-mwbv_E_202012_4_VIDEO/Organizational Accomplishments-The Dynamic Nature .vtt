The prophet Isaiah foretold

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘in the final part of the days,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nations would stream

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to the mountain of Jehovah

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[his elevated pure worship]

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be instructed about his ways.’

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In God’s organization,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can all benefit
from that divine education.

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also see the results

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Proverbs 4:18:

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The path of the righteous
is like the bright morning light

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grows brighter and brighter.”

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naturally, what we learn

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the program of divine education

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has to keep pace
with our refined understanding

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Bible teachings.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish this,

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Teaching Committee
of the Governing Body

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oversees the work 
of the Theocratic Schools Department

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they keep
the curriculums of our theocratic schools

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up-to-date and effective

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in training God’s people to do his will?

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fall of 1942,

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Nathan Knorr wondered

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if 1,000 pioneers could be found

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be willing to go through Gilead

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ensure the school’s operation

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for at least five years.

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nearly 80 years later,

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead School is still going strong,

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s not alone.

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Theocratic Schools Department

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
develops and maintains seven schools

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of the Teaching Committee.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Together, these schools train God’s people

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for theocratic assignments around the world.

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But each school’s curriculum

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs continual review and updating.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may receive new direction
for a school from the Governing Body

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or need to integrate Bible teachings

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from new or updated publications.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah’s rich blessing,

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic schools are being conducted

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 93 branch territories in 293 languages.

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The amazing growth of these schools produces

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a mammoth amount of work behind the scenes.

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are more than 2,000 documents
that need to be put through a robust process

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of formatting, proofreading,

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
editing, cross-checking for redundancy,
and internal indexing.

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:43.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, thousands of reference checks

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that include scripture citations
and publication references are made.

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:51.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The schools are dynamic,
so this work is continuous

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep them up-to-date,
accurate, and harmonious.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once revisions are identified,
the affected teaching outlines are adjusted.

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:04.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, when a school is revised,
a pilot class is taught.

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers from the Schools Department
can observe

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to comments and suggestions
from the instructors.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can then make further adjustments

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the updated school
is taught worldwide.

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theocratic schools
are having a far-reaching effect.

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:25.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the students feel
about their training?

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:30.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The training I received at Gilead
was a big help

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my new assignment
as a member of the Branch Committee.

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped me not to be rule oriented
or position oriented.

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped me to understand how Jehovah

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants me to use authority

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to treat our brothers and sisters

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a humble and a friendly and a loving way,

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really take care of his sheep.

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In October 2018,
a special announcement was made.

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to inform you

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body has given approval

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:11.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all field missionaries
with an FMF enrollment

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:16.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been serving for at least five years

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, SKE.

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
SKE was very much a refresher course for us.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It helped us to be able to bring back to mind

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that we had learned from Gilead

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then improve upon them.

00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going to SKE was just Jehovah’s way

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving us
that encouragement (that hug)

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:45.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
telling us that he loves us and giving us

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the needed training to keep on going.

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:52.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr may have wondered in 1942

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:54.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we’d ever find 1,000 students,

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by the tenth class of Gilead,

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 1,000th student had graduated.

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just the United States branch territory,

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 1,000 students are being trained

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in theocratic schools each week!

00:05:09.663 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our times,
we see Isaiah 60:22 coming true:

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The little one will become a thousand
and the small one a mighty nation.”

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has blessed
the use of theocratic schools

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:23.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to contribute to this amazing growth.

00:05:23.468 --> 00:05:25.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with such training,

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:27.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s strengthening his people
from the inside out

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he prepares us all
for “the real life” to come.

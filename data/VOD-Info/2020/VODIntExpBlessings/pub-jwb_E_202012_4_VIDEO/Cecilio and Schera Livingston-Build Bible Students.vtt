A teacher should always help
his or her student

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:12.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to develop love for Jehovah.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the best foundation to build on.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.206 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For me, it’s important that they see Jehovah

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as a real Person.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to help them build
a good foundation, they need to know

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gave us the Bible
so that we can receive his guidance

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the future and for eternity.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so thankful for my Bible teacher.

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always helped me see
Jehovah’s point of view

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:41.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on things from the Bible.

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never stop thanking Jehovah

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for what he’s done for me.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He drew me to the truth.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me a teacher
that didn’t just teach me about the Bible,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by his example, the brother taught me

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to really be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started studying,

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents told me that they didn’t
consider me their daughter anymore.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the study, my teacher helped 

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
me see from the Bible that Jehovah had
a lot of really good things in store for me.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My environment was very hostile before.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My problem was
that my wife and I argued a lot,

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had a bad temper.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:40.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother’s advice really helped us
to keep calm when we had problems.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person starts
getting to know Jehovah and they learn 

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply Bible truths in their lives,

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people who were their friends before
are going to disappear.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to give them
that friendship they’re losing.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to make some sacrifices
for our students.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we think about the blessings,

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:11.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can barely remember the sacrifices.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked full-time,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had to adapt to the student’s needs,

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not the other way around.

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I’d be up
at six o’clock in the morning

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conducting a Bible study.

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes things come up,
and you can’t make it.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the study should still happen.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother can study with them
if we’re not going to be there.

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When someone starts studying,
it can feel like a lot.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible itself has 66 books.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for example, you can suggest
that the student start reading

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few verses every day

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then add a little more every week.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is how we see them progress.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get to see them practice
what they’re learning

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really following the Bible’s counsel
in their lives.

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just conduct a study,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see them progress, get baptized,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then say, “OK, see you later.”

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t work like that.
They become part of our life.

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been my friend
since before I got baptized.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been about 28 years now.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:22.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years ago, my former student Abel
had a really difficult time.

00:03:22.848 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wife got sick.

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we were far away
when we heard about it,

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we kept in touch with him.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, Livingston family,

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for calling Jessica during these hard times.

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very encouraging to us.”

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know that you love us,
and we also love you very much.

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are an example in true worship for us.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah continue caring
for you and blessing you.”

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized 34 years ago

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have been pioneering for 33 years.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My Bible teacher was Schera.

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was diagnosed with cancer.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:20.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got sick, 
Jehovah used Mercedes to help me.

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all this time, since I helped 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her learn the truth, now she comforts me.

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a father-son relationship.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At some point,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe this student will help me.

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can say that ‘we are
good-for-nothing slaves,

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have done
what we ought to have done.’

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they keep loving and serving Jehovah.

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:45.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s better than that?

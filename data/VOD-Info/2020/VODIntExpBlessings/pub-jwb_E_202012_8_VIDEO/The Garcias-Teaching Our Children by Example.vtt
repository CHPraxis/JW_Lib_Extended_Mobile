00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already had our firstborn, Renita.

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I was told
that we were going to have twins.

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were new in the truth and inexperienced.

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:14.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was saying to myself:

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I take care of my children,
not only physically but more so spiritually?

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will I be able
to teach them to love Jehovah,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to worship Jehovah?’

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 1 Corinthians 3:10 

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows us the importance

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of raising a family

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using good quality materials.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having a spiritual routine
is very important for the children.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I would have to lay
a good spiritual foundation.

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would have to set
a good example for our children.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as I could remember,
I would always see my parents studying,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing personal Bible study.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember Dad—one time,
he came to us in the living room,

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “You know,
I was reading Psalm 1:2, 

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:06.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where it said we should find
‘delight in the law of Jehovah

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read in an undertone day and night.’”

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “What if we do this
as a family project,

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, we read the Bible every day
out loud together?”

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my parents were very simple, you know.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t require a lot of fancy things.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were content.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Dad always worked part-time.

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad pioneered, so money was limited.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the car we had
wasn’t the most reliable,

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would break down
right before the meeting.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when our car broke down.

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially I thought,
‘Oh, we’re not going to go to the meeting.’

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Dad would say:
“Well, the car broke down.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a meeting tonight, so let’s walk.”

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are the five of us
—my dad in his suit,

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the four women would be
in our dresses with our book bags.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that taught me not to let obstacles

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anxieties prevent me
from going to my meetings.

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spending quality time
was very important to my parents,

00:02:08.107 --> 00:02:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after the meetings.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would change
into our pajamas, grab a snack,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to the living room, and just start talking

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how our day went
and how the meeting went.

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just those special moments

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they brought us closer together.

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that Dad,

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how busy he was,

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would drop what he was doing
and look at me and talk.

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I was more important
to him than what he was doing.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember a time
when I had a crush on a boy.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents reasoned with me.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very comfortable,
you know, after that point, to maybe talk 

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about other things
because I could see that my parents

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not going to be angry at me.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, they were going
to listen to me and what I was feeling.

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the blessings
that Mom and Dad gave me

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was teaching me how to think

00:03:08.042 --> 00:03:10.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on scriptures.

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They encouraged us to set full-time service,

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or pioneering, as a goal.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all worked part-time, me and my siblings.

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember one close family friend

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said to me: “You know,
your parents are getting older.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:33.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You know, you’re their daughter,
and you should probably work full-time.

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way they’d have more of an easy life.”

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:40.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that sister’s conversation,
I almost gave up

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on pioneering, but I knew deep down

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my parents
would not be happy about that.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted us to spend
our youth serving Jehovah.

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I were invited to attend

00:03:55.923 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 145th class of Gilead,
and that was like a dream come true.

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to thank my parents for that

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they always
supported me through the years.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t have done it without them,

00:04:09.144 --> 00:04:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for that I’ll be forever grateful.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:14.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really do thank my parents

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the upbringing that they gave me.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a very happy life.

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:22.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m thankful that I was able

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid a lot of heartache,

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s because my parents raised me

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the truth and in Jehovah’s way.

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children are born imitators,

00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re going to imitate our example.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to thank Jehovah
for what our family is now.

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see all of us in the pioneer work

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all five of us are pioneering—
thank you, Jehovah.

My family started studying
with Witnesses in New Jersey.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents had been very diligent
in helping us to appreciate

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only Bible principles

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also characters in the Bible

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could be a role model for us.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped us to know that Jehovah cared

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for adult publishers

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the children

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were serving him.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you went out in the ministry,

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became such a common thing

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the police would come and pick you up.

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:46.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they couldn’t track down the parents,
they would put the children in jail,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that eventually the parents
would have to come looking for them.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The police would use scare tactics.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d say: “There are rats in the cell.

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that where you want to be?”

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anything to make you fearful,

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to intimidate you to tell them
where your parents were.

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d put us in the jail,

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:14.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in order to build our faith,
we would sing.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have Kingdom melodies back then,

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we used to make up songs,

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would keep us focused

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we were doing there.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I reached the age of 18,

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:33.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents were agreeable
to my accepting an assignment.

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in those years,

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the racial issue in the south,

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were so many areas in the south

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they didn’t have Kingdom Halls

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the colored could attend.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you were free 
and you would accept an assignment,

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Society usually sent you to the south.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents were both born in the south,

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they were able to tell us what to expect

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep the culture shock
from being so great.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to pioneer
in Andalusia, Alabama.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:20.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on all of the matters that pertain

00:02:20.077 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to integration and segregation,

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:25.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was a hotbed

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for testing those issues.

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I was concerned

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about whether I had the fiber

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:39.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work under those circumstances.

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The field was wide open.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many in the area

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:49.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had no knowledge of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were very receptive to the message.

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That part of our ministry was very rewarding.

00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:01.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had some very strong

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helpful brothers

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:07.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was using

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get his people

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter what color—

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate Him and his purpose.

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you focused on these things

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the suggestions and the ideas—

00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers would help you to appreciate

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to deal with the issues.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They taught us, for one thing,

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the whole purpose of the Ku Klux Klan

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to intimidate.

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that if they frighten you enough,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will leave.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:45.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan has always used

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:48.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
methods to try to intimidate.

00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:52.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we would make it a practice to stay,
to hold our place.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were in street work,
we’d stay right there.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And of course, as they passed,

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had their remarks to make,

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we just stood there.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think back on my youth,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there isn’t anything that I was able
to participate in

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:13.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I came to regret.

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were always blessings
that went along with it.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you make yourself available,

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:22.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use you.

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always there as a support.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There isn’t anything
that he directs his organization to do

00:04:32.126 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doesn’t receive his support.

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:39.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we are challenged with a new assignment

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if we feel inadequate about it,

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we look to Jehovah

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—with Jehovah, you can’t fail.

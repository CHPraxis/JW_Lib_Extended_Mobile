00:00:03 We were serving in a small town in Alberta,
00:00:07 and then we began having children.
00:00:10 When we moved to Craig we had four children.
00:00:13 And after living here, we now have nine children.
00:00:18 You were given this trust, and so as a parent,
00:00:23 you need to put the Kingdom first;
00:00:25 you need to set a good example; you need to be at the meetings;
00:00:29 you need to be regular in field service.
00:00:31 We really believed that we needed to love Jehovah first
00:00:36 in order to be a good example for our children.
00:00:40 They helped us see that what would make us happy were spiritual things.
00:00:44 My parents, more in action than in words,
00:00:47 taught us to seek first the Kingdom.
00:00:50 With nine kids, it’s always going to be hectic.
00:00:52 You have extra children; you have more excuses, perhaps.
00:00:56 Having nine children is a challenge in a million ways.
00:01:07 Yeah, she had moments where she’d sit
00:01:10 in her rocking chair and just look so  exhausted.
00:01:14 I remember one time when it was time to go to the meeting,
00:01:18 but I was so exhausted.
00:01:21 And I thought of Isaiah 40, where Jehovah says
00:01:25 that “those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.”
00:01:28 So I figured that Jehovah wants me to do it.
00:01:31 He’s going to make me strong enough to do this.
00:01:33 So I prayed, and I got ready.
00:01:36 It’s a scramble.
00:01:42 In Hebrews, we see the encouragement
00:01:46 to never forsake “our meeting together.”
00:01:49 My dad always spoke of that.
00:01:50 There was a time that we had to travel in the wintertime,
00:01:55 maybe up to two hours to get to the meeting.
00:01:58 You’d come back to your home late at night,
00:02:02 you know, with all these kids that are worn out—and yourself too.
00:02:06 Seeing the importance that they placed on the meetings,
00:02:10 I was able to see that you never take meetings for granted.
00:02:15 My parents always instilled in us consistency
00:02:19 in field service just like the meetings.
00:02:23 It was just what we did.
00:02:27 That wasn’t questioned.
00:02:28 We got up on Saturday morning,
00:02:30 and we got ourselves out the door and in service.
00:02:33 We couldn’t simply just be a backseat ornament.
00:02:37 We knew that we were there to give a witness.
00:02:42 From an early age, we were really following the example
00:02:46 of our parents in showing interest in people.
00:02:49 So because of that, we enjoyed being in the ministry.
00:02:53 It gave me a sense of purpose.
00:02:55 I had people to go visit in service.
00:02:57 I had to know what I was going to talk to them about and have a plan.
00:03:01 In field service, we would often take breaks
00:03:05 for the sake of the children and ourselves.
00:03:08 It was important to have our children
00:03:12 enjoy field service—not push them hard
00:03:15 and be too rigid, and so forth.
00:03:19 I think about Proverbs 22:6 in the Byington translation
00:03:23 where it says to “give a boy the start his course requires.”
00:03:28 They did that by putting the spiritual things
00:03:33 before the material things.
00:03:35 Jehovah helped us to be the best parents we could be.
00:03:40 We failed at times, but I always knew that Jehovah was the best Parent.
00:03:44 So if we could teach them to love Him, then he would take over.
00:03:50 Well, we as a family were successful
00:03:53 because we did have Jehovah in our lives.
00:03:55 All our children
00:03:57 are doing very well in the truth.
00:04:00 And so we’re very happy about that,
00:04:02 and I’m sure it makes Jehovah happy.

I grew up in a country where people judge you
according to the color of your skin.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was black, white, mixed race,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we all kept separate.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to learn,
not to see color, but to see people.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though it’s such a multicultural area,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:38.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is still this prejudice that exists.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve witnessed times
where ones from another country

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:47.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are often left isolated or are treated
in a way that they’re not welcome here.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful, these attitudes
could creep into the congregation.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could have isolated groups

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:55.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cultures that maybe would stick together.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the area where I grew up,

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
young ones show great respect for older ones.

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Older ones, however,
do not give much importance to young people.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This attitude, or culture,

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a major impact on recommendations
of young ones as elders in the congregation.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might say, ‘In my opinion, he is too young

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be appointed as an elder
in the congregation.’

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this area, people sort of open up to you
when you appear rich.

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some areas, they would even wonder

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you are doing there
if you don’t have the right kind of looks

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of what you can afford to wear,

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of car you can afford to drive,
what your profession is.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we brought that with us
into the Christian congregation,

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then what Solomon mentions

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be the case
—that we actively seek the friendship

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those whom we regard to be rich
and abandon those who are poor.

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the example in Galatians of Peter.

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:04.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grew up in an area
where there was a lot of prejudice.

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t something
that he overcame straightaway.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m not careful,
I think it would be easy for me

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to slide back and see people
as a different race,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would affect the way I view
my brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions
that when we use the Bible,

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps us to make changes.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to constantly look at ourselves

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue to make progress.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, it mentioned
about ‘opening our hearts wide’

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’d be
working with them in the ministry

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:42.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or having them over socially,

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just from the same group
that we might be comfortable with,

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually with different ones
from different backgrounds.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:54.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was still a young man,
but the apostle Paul

00:02:54.778 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had given him heavy responsibility
in the congregation.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:03.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions that ‘the Scriptures
do not give an exact age

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for recommendation of brothers
as ministerial servants or elders.’

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recommending a younger brother
as an elder in the congregation

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been a great blessing to us.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, there was a little phrase

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has become a guiding principle for me.

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:33.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not judge
our relationship with him

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what we possess.

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I meet new brothers and sisters

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for a moment I’m tempted

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to judge, or view, them

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to those sentiments
as to whether they are rich or poor,

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that principle comes into my mind.

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My focus, therefore,
shifts to who they really are

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:58.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of their devotion to Jehovah
—their faith.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:01.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what we build friendships on.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have friends
from different cultures, different races.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t see them as color,

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I see my brother or my sister.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got the most amazing friendships

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with ones
from different backgrounds and cultures

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something I will always, always cherish.

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:28.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our congregation
is a wonderful place for everybody.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no emphasis
on who is rich and who is poor.

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships are built
on the basis of our love for Jehovah.

00:00:13 I grew up in a country where people judge you according to the color of your skin.
00:00:17 There was black, white, mixed race,
00:00:21 but we all kept separate.
00:00:27 I needed to learn, not to see color, but to see people.
00:00:32 Even though it’s such a multicultural area,
00:00:36 there is still this prejudice that exists.
00:00:38 I’ve witnessed times where ones from another country
00:00:42 are often left isolated or are treated in a way that they’re not welcome here.
00:00:47 If we’re not careful, these attitudes could creep into the congregation.
00:00:51 We could have isolated groups
00:00:53 of cultures that maybe would stick together.
00:00:58 In the area where I grew up,
00:01:00 young ones show great respect for older ones.
00:01:04 Older ones, however, do not give much importance to young people.
00:01:11 This attitude, or culture,
00:01:13 has a major impact on recommendations of young ones as elders in the congregation.
00:01:18 We might say, ‘In my opinion, he is too young
00:01:22 to be appointed as an elder in the congregation.’
00:01:27 In this area, people sort of open up to you when you appear rich.
00:01:31 In some areas, they would even wonder
00:01:34 what you are doing there if you don’t have the right kind of looks
00:01:38 in terms of what you can afford to wear,
00:01:40 what kind of car you can afford to drive, what your profession is.
00:01:44 If we brought that with us into the Christian congregation,
00:01:48 then what Solomon mentions
00:01:50 could be the case —that we actively seek the friendship
00:01:53 of those whom we regard to be rich and abandon those who are poor.
00:01:57 I like the example in Galatians of Peter.
00:02:00 He grew up in an area where there was a lot of prejudice.
00:02:04 It wasn’t something that he overcame straightaway.
00:02:07 If I’m not careful, I think it would be easy for me
00:02:10 to slide back and see people as a different race,
00:02:14 and that would affect the way I view my brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:02:19 The article mentions that when we use the Bible,
00:02:23 it helps us to make changes.
00:02:26 We need to constantly look at ourselves
00:02:29 so that we can continue to make progress.
00:02:34 In the article, it mentioned about ‘opening our hearts wide’
00:02:38 —whether it’d be working with them in the ministry
00:02:40 or having them over socially,
00:02:42 not just from the same group that we might be comfortable with,
00:02:46 but actually with different ones from different backgrounds.
00:02:51 Timothy was still a young man, but the apostle Paul
00:02:54 had given him heavy responsibility in the congregation.
00:02:58 The article mentions that ‘the Scriptures do not give an exact age
00:03:03 for recommendation of brothers as ministerial servants or elders.’
00:03:15 Recommending a younger brother as an elder in the congregation
00:03:18 has been a great blessing to us.
00:03:24 In the article, there was a little phrase
00:03:27 that has become a guiding principle for me.
00:03:30 Jehovah does not judge our relationship with him
00:03:33 by what we possess.
00:03:35 So when I meet new brothers and sisters
00:03:38 and for a moment I’m tempted
00:03:40 to judge, or view, them
00:03:44 according to those sentiments as to whether they are rich or poor,
00:03:47 that principle comes into my mind.
00:03:50 My focus, therefore, shifts to who they really are
00:03:54 in terms of their devotion to Jehovah —their faith.
00:03:58 That is what we build friendships on.
00:04:01 I have friends from different cultures, different races.
00:04:04 And I don’t see them as color,
00:04:07 but I see my brother or my sister.
00:04:10 I’ve got the most amazing friendships
00:04:12 with ones from different backgrounds and cultures
00:04:15 —something I will always, always cherish.
00:04:24 So our congregation is a wonderful place for everybody.
00:04:29 There is no emphasis on who is rich and who is poor.
00:04:32 Friendships are built on the basis of our love for Jehovah.

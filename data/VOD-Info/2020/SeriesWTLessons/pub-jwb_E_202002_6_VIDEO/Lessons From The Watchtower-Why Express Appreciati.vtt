I work as a pioneer
and also as a commuter at Bethel.

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find this service to be very enjoyable.

00:00:22.418 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because of my busy schedule,

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:28.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at times I almost forget
to express my appreciation

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brothers and sisters.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to express
my appreciation to my wife,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I found myself
feeling bashful in doing so.

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:42.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew something wasn’t quite natural.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generally, expressing appreciation
is considered to be a virtue.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:54.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I realized that I needed
some sort of stronger motivation.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all ten lepers
must have been grateful,

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only one person returned to give thanks.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:10.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suddenly realized
that even if I feel appreciative,

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might fail to express it.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esau was an impatient man.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, David thought deeply

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how wonderful pure worship is.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize
that it is important to think deeply.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:36.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister was visiting
a very sick sister almost every day

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her with shopping
and was looking after her very tenderly.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I thought carefully

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:49.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about why she was doing so much
and how she felt,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt deep appreciation well up in me.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah richly rewards us.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah desires
to express his appreciation,

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:08.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of person am I
if I don’t show it from the heart?

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps I might be thinking to myself

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I deserve to be appreciated,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I am the one providing
for my family, aren’t I?

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started thinking
about how Jehovah wants to reward my wife.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me want to interact

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with her with kinder words.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that the way I look at her

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my facial expressions
are changing as well.

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:49.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gets easier
to resolve disagreements quickly.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also feel that we are growing
closer and closer as a couple.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By expressing appreciation,
I feel very happy.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:03.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with brothers and sisters

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the congregation has gotten better,

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:08.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the bonds of friendship
between us are stronger.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that the reason why
Jehovah encourages us

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express our appreciation
to others is for our happiness.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:21.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That drew me even closer to Jehovah.

00:00:14 I work as a pioneer and also as a commuter at Bethel.
00:00:19 I find this service to be very enjoyable.
00:00:22 However, because of my busy schedule,
00:00:25 at times I almost forget to express my appreciation
00:00:28 to the brothers and sisters.
00:00:32 I wanted to express my appreciation to my wife,
00:00:36 but I found myself feeling bashful in doing so.
00:00:39 I knew something wasn’t quite natural.
00:00:44 Generally, expressing appreciation is considered to be a virtue.
00:00:49 But I realized that I needed some sort of stronger motivation.
00:00:57 Although all ten lepers must have been grateful,
00:01:01 only one person returned to give thanks.
00:01:06 I suddenly realized that even if I feel appreciative,
00:01:10 I might fail to express it.
00:01:14 Esau was an impatient man.
00:01:17 In contrast, David thought deeply
00:01:20 about how wonderful pure worship is.
00:01:25 I came to realize that it is important to think deeply.
00:01:31 One sister was visiting a very sick sister almost every day
00:01:36 to help her with shopping and was looking after her very tenderly.
00:01:43 As I thought carefully
00:01:45 about why she was doing so much and how she felt,
00:01:49 I felt deep appreciation well up in me.
00:01:56 Jehovah richly rewards us.
00:01:59 If Jehovah desires to express his appreciation,
00:02:03 what kind of person am I if I don’t show it from the heart?
00:02:11 Perhaps I might be thinking to myself
00:02:15 that I deserve to be appreciated,
00:02:19 since I am the one providing for my family, aren’t I?
00:02:27 I started thinking about how Jehovah wants to reward my wife.
00:02:32 That made me want to interact
00:02:35 with her with kinder words.
00:02:37 I feel that the way I look at her
00:02:40 and my facial expressions are changing as well.
00:02:45 It gets easier to resolve disagreements quickly.
00:02:50 I also feel that we are growing closer and closer as a couple.
00:02:56 By expressing appreciation, I feel very happy.
00:03:00 My relationship with brothers and sisters
00:03:03 within the congregation has gotten better,
00:03:05 and the bonds of friendship between us are stronger.
00:03:09 I realized that the reason why Jehovah encourages us
00:03:13 to express our appreciation to others is for our happiness.
00:03:18 That drew me even closer to Jehovah.

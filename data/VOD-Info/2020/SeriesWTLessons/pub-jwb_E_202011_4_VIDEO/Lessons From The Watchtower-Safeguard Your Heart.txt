00:00:16 Well, very good friends of ours
00:00:19 decided they wanted to go their own way and leave Jehovah.
00:00:22 And in the interim, they became bad association for us.
00:00:26 We had many good times together.
00:00:29 We drove to isolated territory together;
00:00:32 we even visited a brother who was sick in the hospital to encourage him.
00:00:39 I feel heartbroken
00:00:41 that they’re no longer serving Jehovah.
00:00:43 It’s really hard to lose a friend spiritually —very hard.
00:00:47 I was about to enter into full-time service,
00:00:50 but I still needed reassurance.
00:00:53 I was raised by my mother as a Witness.
00:00:57 Even though I had very little contact with my father,
00:01:00 he still tried to oppose my spiritual progress.
00:01:03 I kept fighting for the truth,
00:01:05 and I got baptized when I was 11.
00:01:09 I guess I felt like I was doing OK.
00:01:11 And after high school, I went to university.
00:01:15 I had to make some changes in my choice of entertainment.
00:01:20 We really never stop learning.
00:01:24 I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.
00:01:28 But I must admit that it is more and more difficult
00:01:32 to find something decent to watch these days.
00:01:36 Well, I’m not saying that I watch bad programs.
00:01:39 I would never do that,
00:01:41 but still I wonder
00:01:44 if what I watch is spiritually healthy for me.
00:01:51 The way of thinking I was exposed to in university
00:01:56 was pressuring me to find security in my life through material things
00:02:00 —like having my own place to live and economic stability.
00:02:05 But at what cost?
00:02:11 I remember that paragraph.
00:02:13 It said that Satan promotes making money
00:02:16 as the only way
00:02:17 you can find security in this world.
00:02:19 But one could sacrifice
00:02:21 so much to achieve it.
00:02:23 You could even lose
00:02:24 your friendship with Jehovah.
00:02:25 That article—it was just what we needed.
00:02:29 It described a watchman
00:02:31 who would protect the city
00:02:33 by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.
00:02:36 And at sounding that alarm,
00:02:39 he would shut the gates to the city to protect the city.
00:02:42 And I needed to do that.
00:02:45 We both needed to do that.
00:02:46 It’s true.
00:02:47 And it’s not even a question.
00:02:50 Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first
00:02:53 —before we’re loyal to any friends we have in this world.
00:02:58 The Watchtower  said
00:03:00 that storytelling
00:03:02 does more than entertain us.
00:03:07 In Bana, the city of Cameroon where I was born,
00:03:11 mothers spend their evenings with their children, telling them stories.
00:03:16 And even though I was young,
00:03:18 the stories my mother told me
00:03:22 continue to influence me even today.
00:03:24 So I said to myself: ‘Oh, no. Wait a minute, Happy!
00:03:29 ‘It means that the stories that I watch on television
00:03:33 ‘will also affect me sooner or later,
00:03:36 and the Devil knows that too.’
00:03:39 So I decided to completely cut out a number
00:03:42 of programs that I used to watch.
00:03:46 Now I’m serving in full-time service,
00:03:48 and I love it!
00:03:50 Jehovah is really taking care of me,
00:03:53 but I don’t want to forget
00:03:55 the beautiful principles I’ve learned from that article.
00:03:58 I still have to safeguard my heart.
00:04:02 I want to give my best to my Father, Jehovah.
00:04:05 Not a day goes by where we don’t think about these friends of ours.
00:04:10 And it’s certainly our hope that they come back to Jehovah
00:04:13 and that we can serve Jehovah together shoulder to shoulder.
00:04:16 But we’ve also learned
00:04:18 to keep our “little watchman” in check.
00:04:20 We need to make sure he does his job to “sound the alarm” and “shut those gates.”
00:04:25 Hmm, we never stop learning.
00:04:29 Well, true, it’s easier said than done,
00:04:32 but it is up to us.
00:04:34 It’s so important to safeguard your heart!

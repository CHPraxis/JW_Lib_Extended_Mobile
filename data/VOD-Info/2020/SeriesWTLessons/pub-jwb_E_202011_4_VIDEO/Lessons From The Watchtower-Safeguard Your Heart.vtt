00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, very good friends of ours

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided they wanted
to go their own way and leave Jehovah.

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the interim,
they became bad association for us.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had many good times together.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We drove to isolated territory together;

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we even visited a brother who was sick
in the hospital to encourage him.

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel heartbroken

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re no longer serving Jehovah.

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard to lose a friend spiritually
—very hard.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about to enter into full-time service,

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still needed reassurance.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised by my mother as a Witness.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I had
very little contact with my father,

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he still tried to oppose
my spiritual progress.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept fighting for the truth,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got baptized when I was 11.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I felt like I was doing OK.

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after high school, I went to university.

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make some changes
in my choice of entertainment.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:24.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really never stop learning.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I must admit
that it is more and more difficult

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find something decent to watch these days.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not saying
that I watch bad programs.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never do that,

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still I wonder

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if what I watch
is spiritually healthy for me.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way of thinking
I was exposed to in university

00:01:56.136 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was pressuring me to find security in my life
through material things

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like having my own place to live
and economic stability.

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at what cost?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that paragraph.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that Satan promotes making money

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only way

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can find security in this world.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:21.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one could sacrifice

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much to achieve it.

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could even lose

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:25.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your friendship with Jehovah.

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That article—it was just what we needed.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:31.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It described a watchman

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would protect the city

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at sounding that alarm,

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would shut the gates
to the city to protect the city.

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I needed to do that.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We both needed to do that.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not even a question.

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—before we’re loyal
to any friends we have in this world.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that storytelling

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does more than entertain us.

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bana, the city of Cameroon
where I was born,

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mothers spend their evenings
with their children, telling them stories.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though I was young,

00:03:18.802 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stories my mother told me

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to influence me even today.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said to myself: ‘Oh, no.
Wait a minute, Happy!

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It means that the stories
that I watch on television

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will also affect me sooner or later,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Devil knows that too.’

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to completely cut out a number

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of programs that I used to watch.

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:48.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m serving in full-time service,

00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I love it!

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is really taking care of me,

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I don’t want to forget

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beautiful principles
I’ve learned from that article.

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still have to safeguard my heart.

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to give my best to my Father, Jehovah.

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by where we don’t think
about these friends of ours.

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s certainly our hope
that they come back to Jehovah

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we can serve Jehovah
together shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:18.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’ve also learned

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our “little watchman” in check.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to make sure he does his job
to “sound the alarm” and “shut those gates.”

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, we never stop learning.

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, true, it’s easier said than done,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is up to us.

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:38.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so important to safeguard your heart!

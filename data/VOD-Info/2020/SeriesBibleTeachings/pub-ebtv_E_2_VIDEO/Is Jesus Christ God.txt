00:00:10 Many people regard Jesus
00:00:12 as the most influential person in history.
00:00:16 But is he Almighty God himself?
00:00:20 Or was he simply a good man?
00:00:24 Many people personally met Jesus,
00:00:27 and some of their accounts are found in the Bible,
00:00:30 revealing who Jesus really is.
00:00:35 For instance, an angel spoke to Jesus’ mother about her unborn son
00:00:40 and said: “This one will be great
00:00:43 and will be called Son of the Most High.”
00:00:51 When Jesus was being baptized,
00:00:53 God’s own voice confirmed Jesus’ identity:
00:00:57 “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”
00:01:06 What did his followers believe?
00:01:08 When Jesus asked who they thought he was,
00:01:11 Peter responded:
00:01:14 “You are the Christ,
00:01:16 the Son of the living God.”
00:01:22 What did Jesus’ enemies say?
00:01:24 Those wanting to kill him explained why:
00:01:27 “According to the law he ought to die,
00:01:30 because he made himself God’s son.”
00:01:37 What did Jesus himself say
00:01:39 about his identity and relationship to God?
00:01:43 He told his followers: “The Father is greater than I am.”
00:01:52 Even after his death and resurrection, Jesus said this about his future:
00:01:59 “I am ascending to my Father and your Father
00:02:03 and to my God and your God.”
00:02:10 The Biblical record makes it clear that Jesus is a distinct person,
00:02:15 separate from God Almighty.
00:02:19 In fact, the Bible teaches that although Jesus
00:02:22 is a powerful spirit creature in heaven,
00:02:25 he is still subject to his God and Father.
00:02:30 Still, God has given a special assignment to his Son:
00:02:34 to bring everlasting life and happiness to all humankind,
00:02:39 just as God originally purposed.
00:02:43 What else does the Bible say about Jesus?

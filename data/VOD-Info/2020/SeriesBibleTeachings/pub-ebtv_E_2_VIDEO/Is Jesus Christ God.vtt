Many people regard Jesus

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the most influential person in history.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is he Almighty God himself?

00:00:20.207 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was he simply a good man?

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:27.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people personally met Jesus,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of their accounts
are found in the Bible,

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
revealing who Jesus really is.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, an angel spoke to Jesus’ mother
about her unborn son

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said: “This one will be great

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be called Son of the Most High.”

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was being baptized,

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s own voice confirmed Jesus’ identity:

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved,
whom I have approved.”

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:08.589 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What did his followers believe?

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus asked who they thought he was,

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:14.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter responded:

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are the Christ,

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of the living God.”

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus’ enemies say?

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those wanting to kill him explained why:

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to the law he ought to die,

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he made himself God’s son.”

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:39.703 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus himself say

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about his identity and relationship to God?

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told his followers:
“The Father is greater than I am.”

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even after his death and resurrection,
Jesus said this about his future:

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am ascending to my Father and your Father

00:02:03.394 --> 00:02:06.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to my God and your God.”

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Biblical record makes it clear
that Jesus is a distinct person,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
separate from God Almighty.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible teaches
that although Jesus

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a powerful spirit creature in heaven,

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is still subject to his God and Father.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, God has given
a special assignment to his Son:

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring everlasting life
and happiness to all humankind,

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as God originally purposed.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else does the Bible say about Jesus?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jesus really perform miracles?

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jesus die?

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jesus return?

00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our text highlights the fact

00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:06.856 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we are at war with Satan.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
War is defined

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:11.094 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as “a state of hostility

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.096 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“accompanied by actions

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“to conquer or to destroy

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those viewed as the enemy.”

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the context
of our text today at 1 Peter 5:8

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talks about the type of enemy we have

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:30.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“a roaring lion,
seeking to devour someone.”

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that expression “roaring” denotes

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:37.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the howl of a beast in fierce hunger.”

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have a real enemy.

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why the words of Jesus

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are so meaningful for us
when he gave the model prayer.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said at Matthew 6:13:

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not bring us into temptation,

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:56.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but deliver
[or, the footnote, “rescue”] us

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wicked one.”

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, other Bible translations,

00:01:00.543 --> 00:01:04.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the <i>King</i> <i>James Version</i>
or the <i>Revised Standard Version,</i>

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:09.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
use an expression like,
“Deliver us from evil.”

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the <i>Contemporary English Version</i> says:

00:01:11.688 --> 00:01:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Protect us from evil.”

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that doesn’t convey
the real fierceness of a real enemy, does it?

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more generic.

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jesus knew the Devil was real,

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is a real enemy.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Devil has no remorse.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s fierce.
He has no pity.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will take a person and,
with his traps and lures,

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get him to do something
bad in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the person is overcome with guilt.

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, like a fierce enemy,

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Devil comes along and stomps on him

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes him feel worse
because he caved in and sinned.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we deal
with such a powerful enemy?

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in war, there are soldiers.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s use an expression

00:02:01.104 --> 00:02:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul used
to describe our situation.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles, please,
to the book of 2 Timothy.

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2 Timothy chapter 2,
we’re going to read verses 3 and 4

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talk for a few moments
about our being soldiers.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 2:3:

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“take your part in suffering adversity.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No man serving as a soldier

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“involves himself
in the commercial businesses of life,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to gain the approval
of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.”

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become soldiers of Christ

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we accept Jehovah’s arrangements

00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:43.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for salvation through Christ Jesus

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we dedicate our lives to him unreservedly

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our entire life.

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:54.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become a soldier and, like a soldier,

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that it’s not going to be easy.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are going to be hardships and trials.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, a fine soldier

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his main objective is to stay
loyal to his commanding officers

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to those who are giving instructions.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likewise we know
it’s not going to be easy.

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy, but we have chosen
to become a soldier of Christ.

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, a soldier,
like this loyal one being described,

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is far different from a mercenary.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mercenary is one
who hires himself out to fight,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he may not have any devotion,
really, to the cause.

00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a hired man,
and he’s doing it for the reward only

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or for something else that he may gain.

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not mercenaries.

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re those with godly devotion, 
wholly devoted to Jehovah

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:47.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and loyal to Christ
so that we can be fine soldiers,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal and true.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another aspect of soldiers
is that they are identified

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by their distinctive uniforms

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or their particular fighting equipment.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:02.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, it helps to identify

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s the friend and who’s the foe
in the middle of the battle.

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:10.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their appearance makes that possible.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today,
there is a clear difference, isn’t there,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the soldiers of Satan

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the soldiers of Christ?

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s great enmity, 
but there’s a sharp contrast

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in appearance and attitude and disposition

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivation and conduct.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why when we think about that,

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:37.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think about the contrast
between “the works of the flesh”

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:39.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
described in Galatians chapter 5

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those who have
the fruitage of God’s spirit.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is such a strong distinction

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between “one serving God
and one not serving him.”

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why, too,

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think about the type of armor we bear.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians chapter 6 says:

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God.”

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our very armor is from God.

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not use the tactics
and the methods of the Devil,

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are clearly identified
as a soldier of Christ.

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there can be no gray area here;

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re either on one side
or the other, correct?

00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:21.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, suppose that you’re a soldier,

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re on guard duty, and it’s evening,

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see someone approaching,
and you cry out:

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Halt! Who goes there?

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friend or foe?”

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:34.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you hear back, “I’m both.”

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an enemy.

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t be on both sides.

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is another aspect
of being a good soldier in this fight?

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles 
to Philippians chapter 1,

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:54.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians chapter 1,
and we get to the concept of unity

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and working closely together in peace,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because an army needs to be unified.

00:06:01.044 --> 00:06:04.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:27 says:

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only behave in a manner
worthy of the good news about the Christ,

00:06:08.251 --> 00:06:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that whether I come
and see you or I am absent,

00:06:12.588 --> 00:06:15.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I may hear about you and learn

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you are standing firm in one spirit,

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with one soul
[and the footnote, or “with one accord”],

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“striving side by side
for the faith of the good news,

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and in no way being
frightened by your opponents.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This very thing is a proof
of destruction for them,

00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of salvation for you;
and this is from God.”

00:06:40.616 --> 00:06:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have this matter of unity
—don’t we?—

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shoulder to shoulder, side by side.

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, one of the tactics of the Devil

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to get us divided and disjointed

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fighting among ourselves.

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:02.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To turn the enemy on itself
is a very effective war strategy.

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Jehovah used that
—remember?—

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against his enemies.

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Chronicles 20:20-23,

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was the attack
“of Ammon, Moab,

00:07:13.082 --> 00:07:15.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the mountainous region of Seir”
against Judah.

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He confused them.

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They struck down each other;
they helped destroy one another.

00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Devil, in a very sinister way,
uses that same approach.

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if he can get us
to not get along with each other

00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:36.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn on one another,

00:07:36.172 --> 00:07:38.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then that’s a very effective tactic.

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:42.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we remember the expression

00:07:42.345 --> 00:07:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ephesians 4:26, 27 about getting along:

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be wrathful, but do not sin;

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not let the sun set
while you are still angry;

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not give the Devil an opportunity.”

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he sees discord and disunity,

00:08:00.663 --> 00:08:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can really amplify that.

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:06.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to remember
who our real enemies are.

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our brothers may disappoint us; 
they may frustrate us;

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may hurt us at times
because of imperfections.

00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they’re not the enemy.

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil and his hordes
—they are the enemies.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t get to fighting
with the wrong person.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We keep in mind
that our brothers are with us.

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:28.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in this connection

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we just read it
in that scripture in Philippians),

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talked about not being afraid.

00:08:33.963 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember
something about being afraid

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it related
to a soldier in Israel’s army?

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 20:8 says:

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The officers should also ask the people,

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:48.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Who is fearful and fainthearted?

00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘He should return to his house,

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he may not cause
his brothers to lose heart as he has.’”

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we do have an effect on each other.

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine being in Joshua’s army,

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting ready to battle,
and to your left is a soldier?

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you’re about ready
to leave for battle,

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says to you:
“We’re going to die.

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re not going to come back.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say goodbye to your family.
This is it.”

00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or he may say,

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:19.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m not sure Joshua
has Jehovah’s backing like Moses did.”

00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of that would be terrible.

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:24.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so anyone
in that category was to go home

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they would have
an effect on others.

00:09:26.849 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful, though, we are
that we have positive, courageous brothers

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:32.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who trust in Jehovah,

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examples in the Bible,
and also modern-day examples,

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like our brothers in Russia!

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as soldiers in this battle,
we’re ‘not ignorant of Satan’s designs.’

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he studies us very carefully,
and he knows our weaknesses.

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The September 1, 1988, <i>Watchtower</i>
had an article

00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:57.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stand Firm Against Satan’s Machinations,”

00:09:57.079 --> 00:10:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in that, it said the Devil
knows what our weaknesses are.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do we?

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t identify them
and then correct them,

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be defenseless at times.

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it takes honesty and humility

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:14.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an earnest desire
to address that which is bad.

00:10:14.597 --> 00:10:17.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we become a victim.

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to ask:
‘What are my weaknesses?

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I identify them?
Do I work on them?’

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, with Jehovah’s help,
we can come off victorious in this battle.

00:10:28.644 --> 00:10:32.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:10 says
that ‘Jehovah will finish our training;

00:10:32.114 --> 00:10:34.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will make us firm;
he will make us strong.’

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with Jehovah’s help, we can succeed.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we all continue
as fine soldiers of Christ,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting in Jehovah,

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and win the battle
against the enemy—the Devil.

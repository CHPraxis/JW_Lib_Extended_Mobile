00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:04.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, let us consider two questions:

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:09.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What do we have in common with Noah?

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.496 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And how does his example apply to us?

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Noah, we fully trust

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will fulfill
his promise to end all wickedness

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he will do so
at exactly the right time.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what helped Noah
to build his trust in Jehovah’s promises?

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One factor that must have helped him 
was his upbringing.

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to confirm that statement,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will consider two of Noah’s relatives,

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt they had a big influence on him.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Noah must have received

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a godly upbringing from his father, Lamech.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Insight </i> book states with certainty:

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lamech had faith in God.”

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does the Bible indicate

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Lamech (and likely also his wife)
had strong faith in Jehovah?

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One indication is found in Genesis chapter 5.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s consider that chapter for a moment.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you will take the time,
perhaps later today,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read verses 6-31 in chapter five,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will see that these verses contain

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a list of eight fathers and eight sons.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The list starts with the father Seth
and his son, Enosh

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ends with the father Lamech
and his son Noah.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this list,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lamech stands out from all the other fathers.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why so?

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:46.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all eight fathers,
only Lamech provides a reason

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for why he named his son
in the way that he did.

00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:54.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we read that reason
in verses 28 and 29.

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:
“Lamech lived for 182 years

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then became father to a son.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He named him Noah.”

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s pause here for a moment.

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote gives us
the likely meaning of the name Noah

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “Rest” or “Consolation.”

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then comes the most significant part.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lamech goes on to explain

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he gave his son the name Consolation.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 29, Lamech adds:

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:27.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This one will bring us comfort
[Or, as the footnote says, “relief.”]

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from our labor
and from the painful toil of our hands

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:36.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the ground
that Jehovah has cursed.”

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:39.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, note the expressions
that Lamech used:

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“painful toil,”

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the ground that Jehovah cursed.’

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Lamech’s words show that he looked back

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what had happened in the Garden of Eden.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he used the very same words

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—cursed, ground, pain—

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had used
when he told Adam after the rebellion:

00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cursed is the ground on your account.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In pain you will eat its produce.”

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by repeating Jehovah’s words,

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:13.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lamech indicated that he realized
that the rebellion of Adam and Eve

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had sentenced humans to pain

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:20.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from which there seemed no relief or comfort.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, Lamech had meditated

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s words.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Lamech looked back
not only to a dark time

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also forward to a bright time.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first part of verse 29,
he said about his son:

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This one will bring us comfort
from our labor.”

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So clearly,
Lamech hoped that his son Noah

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:49.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be instrumental
in bringing relief to man’s situation.

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Lamech’s words were much more

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:57.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a warm sentiment
expressed by a father to his son.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:04:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the real significance
of Lamech’s words about Noah?

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Insight </i> book further states

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:07.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘Lamech’s words
were an inspired revelation

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s purpose and will.’

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Lamech’s words expressed

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:17.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s thoughts and feelings about Noah.

00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:22.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Noah’s father died
five years before the Flood,

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his prophecy came true.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did it happen? 

00:04:26.382 --> 00:04:29.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> of 2017 states:

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah inspired Lamech
to utter a prophecy about Noah,

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that prophecy
came true after the Flood.’

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When exactly did it come true?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answer at Genesis 8:21.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after the Flood,
when Noah offered burnt offerings to God:

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah said in his heart:

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Never again

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will I curse the ground on man’s account.’”

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, Noah had lived up
to the meaning of the name

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:03.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had received from his father.

00:05:03.853 --> 00:05:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of Noah’s faith in action,

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:09.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used him to bring relief.

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does this account of Noah
and his father apply to us?

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Noah in the past,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of us have had the privilege
to be raised by godly parents.

00:05:21.504 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know
that by serving Jehovah wholeheartedly,

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we bring great joy
to the hearts of our parents.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:29.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are happy
that we serve at Assembly Halls,

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at RTOs, at construction projects,
at maintenance sites,

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Bethel,
and in the local congregations.

00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And much like Lamech did in the past,

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:44.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
godly parents today pray to Jehovah

00:05:44.193 --> 00:05:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the sacred service

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their children give at these locations

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may indeed bring comfort and relief to many.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for those of us whose godly parents
have already fallen asleep in death

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well, we long for the time
when they will come back to life in Paradise

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can relate to them

00:06:04.981 --> 00:06:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we used our life fully
in Jehovah’s service.

00:06:08.584 --> 00:06:12.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy they will be when they hear

00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the godly training that they gave us

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped us to build
our faith in God’s promises

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to survive Armageddon!

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likewise, we can imagine
that when Noah is raised to life in Paradise,

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will long for the moment
when he can tell his father

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he endured
till the end of that old system

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and survived the Flood.

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just think how happy Lamech will be

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he hears that his son

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did indeed bring comfort

00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relief to many.

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, besides Lamech,

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is the second relative
who must have strengthened

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s trust in Jehovah’s promises

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his protection

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his assurance to protect his servants?

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well here is a clue.

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both Noah and his second relative

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are described
in exactly the same way in the Bible.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 6, we read:

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:12.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah walked with the true God.”

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 5, we read:

00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:18.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Enoch walked with the true God.’

00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch was Noah’s great-grandfather.

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since Jehovah
moved the writer of Genesis

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to describe these two men
in exactly the same manner,

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it indicates that Noah had much in common

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his great-grandfather.

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true that Noah never met Enoch

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Enoch died before Noah was born.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Noah’s father’s life

00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overlapped for more than 100 years
with that of Enoch.

00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can imagine that Lamech

00:07:51.354 --> 00:07:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have told stories to Noah
about his grandfather:

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Enoch prophesied courageously

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:00.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while surrounded by ungodly people,

00:08:00.062 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how these people hated Enoch
to the point that they wanted to kill him.

But despite being in danger,

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read at Genesis 5:22:

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Enoch continued to walk with the true God.”

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah protected Enoch.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as Noah listened to these stories

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflected on Enoch’s faith and courage,

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:23.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his desire to follow in Enoch’s footsteps

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt grew stronger and stronger.

00:08:26.856 --> 00:08:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Noah’s faith became so strong

00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:35.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he continued to walk
with God for 600 years

00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the time of the Flood

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in spite of the ungodly
and violent people around him.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just as Noah
must have been strengthened

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the faith of his forefathers,

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of us may be
the third or the fourth generation

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our family who serve Jehovah.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that’s the case with you,

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your parents or grandparents
likely told you stories

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about your relatives who served Jehovah

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps way back in the time
of Brother Rutherford or even earlier.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you listened to these stories
about your faithful relatives,

00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your desire to walk in their footsteps
grew stronger and stronger.

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though,
if we are not part of a family

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a long line of Witnesses?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we too
are encouraged by the examples

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters
of previous generations

00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we read their life stories
as found in <i>The Watchtower. </i>

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we learn
about their courage and endurance,

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:35.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their stories strengthen our faith.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, the examples
of God’s servants in the past

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded in the Bible,

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our family history,

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the life stories
found in<i> </i><i>The Watchtower</i>

00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:53.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to trust fully
in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:58.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn,
that trust strengthens us to do what?

00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:02.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To imitate Noah and walk with God

00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:05.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just now but forever.

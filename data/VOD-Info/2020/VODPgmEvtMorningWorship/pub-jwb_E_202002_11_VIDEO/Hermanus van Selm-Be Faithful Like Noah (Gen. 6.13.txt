00:00:01 Now, let us consider two questions:
00:00:06 What do we have in common with Noah?
00:00:09 And how does his example apply to us?
00:00:14 Well, like Noah, we fully trust
00:00:16 that Jehovah will fulfill his promise to end all wickedness
00:00:20 and that he will do so at exactly the right time.
00:00:25 Now, what helped Noah to build his trust in Jehovah’s promises?
00:00:30 One factor that must have helped him  was his upbringing.
00:00:34 Now, to confirm that statement,
00:00:36 we will consider two of Noah’s relatives,
00:00:39 and no doubt they had a big influence on him.
00:00:44 First, Noah must have received
00:00:47 a godly upbringing from his father, Lamech.
00:00:50 The Insight  book states with certainty:
00:00:53 “Lamech had faith in God.”
00:00:57 But how does the Bible indicate
00:00:59 that Lamech (and likely also his wife) had strong faith in Jehovah?
00:01:03 One indication is found in Genesis chapter 5.
00:01:07 So let’s consider that chapter for a moment.
00:01:10 Now, if you will take the time, perhaps later today,
00:01:14 to read verses 6-31 in chapter five,
00:01:19 you will see that these verses contain
00:01:21 a list of eight fathers and eight sons.
00:01:25 The list starts with the father Seth and his son, Enosh
00:01:29 and ends with the father Lamech and his son Noah.
00:01:33 Now, in this list,
00:01:35 Lamech stands out from all the other fathers.
00:01:39 Why so?
00:01:41 Of all eight fathers, only Lamech provides a reason
00:01:46 for why he named his son in the way that he did.
00:01:49 And we read that reason in verses 28 and 29.
00:01:54 There it says: “Lamech lived for 182 years
00:01:59 “and then became father to a son.
00:02:01 He named him Noah.”
00:02:03 Now, let’s pause here for a moment.
00:02:05 The footnote gives us the likely meaning of the name Noah
00:02:09 as “Rest” or “Consolation.”
00:02:12 But then comes the most significant part.
00:02:14 Lamech goes on to explain
00:02:16 why he gave his son the name Consolation.
00:02:20 In verse 29, Lamech adds:
00:02:23 “This one will bring us comfort [Or, as the footnote says, “relief.”]
00:02:27 “from our labor and from the painful toil of our hands
00:02:31 because of the ground that Jehovah has cursed.”
00:02:36 Now, note the expressions that Lamech used:
00:02:39 “painful toil,”
00:02:42 ‘the ground that Jehovah cursed.’
00:02:45 So Lamech’s words show that he looked back
00:02:48 to what had happened in the Garden of Eden.
00:02:50 In fact, he used the very same words
00:02:53 —cursed, ground, pain—
00:02:56 that Jehovah had used when he told Adam after the rebellion:
00:03:01 “Cursed is the ground on your account.
00:03:04 In pain you will eat its produce.”
00:03:07 So by repeating Jehovah’s words,
00:03:09 Lamech indicated that he realized that the rebellion of Adam and Eve
00:03:13 had sentenced humans to pain
00:03:16 from which there seemed no relief or comfort.
00:03:20 Indeed, Lamech had meditated
00:03:24 on Jehovah’s words.
00:03:26 But Lamech looked back not only to a dark time
00:03:31 but also forward to a bright time.
00:03:34 In the first part of verse 29, he said about his son:
00:03:37 “This one will bring us comfort from our labor.”
00:03:41 So clearly, Lamech hoped that his son Noah
00:03:44 would be instrumental in bringing relief to man’s situation.
00:03:49 Now, Lamech’s words were much more
00:03:52 than a warm sentiment expressed by a father to his son.
00:03:57 What is the real significance of Lamech’s words about Noah?
00:04:02 The Insight  book further states
00:04:04 that ‘Lamech’s words were an inspired revelation
00:04:07 of God’s purpose and will.’
00:04:09 So Lamech’s words expressed
00:04:13 Jehovah’s thoughts and feelings about Noah.
00:04:17 Now, Noah’s father died five years before the Flood,
00:04:22 but his prophecy came true.
00:04:24 When did it happen?
00:04:26 The Watchtower  of 2017 states:
00:04:29 ‘Jehovah inspired Lamech to utter a prophecy about Noah,
00:04:33 and that prophecy came true after the Flood.’
00:04:37 When exactly did it come true?
00:04:40 We find the answer at Genesis 8:21.
00:04:43 Shortly after the Flood, when Noah offered burnt offerings to God:
00:04:47 “Jehovah said in his heart:
00:04:49 “‘Never again
00:04:51 will I curse the ground on man’s account.’”
00:04:56 Indeed, Noah had lived up to the meaning of the name
00:05:01 that he had received from his father.
00:05:03 Because of Noah’s faith in action,
00:05:06 Jehovah used him to bring relief.
00:05:10 Now, how does this account of Noah and his father apply to us?
00:05:14 Well, like Noah in the past,
00:05:17 many of us have had the privilege to be raised by godly parents.
00:05:21 And we know that by serving Jehovah wholeheartedly,
00:05:24 we bring great joy to the hearts of our parents.
00:05:27 They are happy that we serve at Assembly Halls,
00:05:29 at RTOs, at construction projects, at maintenance sites,
00:05:34 at Bethel, and in the local congregations.
00:05:38 And much like Lamech did in the past,
00:05:41 godly parents today pray to Jehovah
00:05:44 that the sacred service
00:05:46 that their children give at these locations
00:05:49 may indeed bring comfort and relief to many.
00:05:54 And for those of us whose godly parents have already fallen asleep in death
00:05:58 —well, we long for the time when they will come back to life in Paradise
00:06:02 and we can relate to them
00:06:04 that we used our life fully in Jehovah’s service.
00:06:08 How happy they will be when they hear
00:06:12 that the godly training that they gave us
00:06:14 helped us to build our faith in God’s promises
00:06:17 and to survive Armageddon!
00:06:20 And likewise, we can imagine that when Noah is raised to life in Paradise,
00:06:24 he will long for the moment when he can tell his father
00:06:28 how he endured till the end of that old system
00:06:30 and survived the Flood.
00:06:32 And just think how happy Lamech will be
00:06:35 when he hears that his son
00:06:37 did indeed bring comfort
00:06:40 and relief to many.
00:06:43 Now, besides Lamech,
00:06:45 who is the second relative who must have strengthened
00:06:48 Noah’s trust in Jehovah’s promises
00:06:50 and in his protection
00:06:52 and in his assurance to protect his servants?
00:06:56 Well here is a clue.
00:06:58 Both Noah and his second relative
00:07:01 are described in exactly the same way in the Bible.
00:07:06 In Genesis chapter 6, we read:
00:07:08 “Noah walked with the true God.”
00:07:12 In Genesis chapter 5, we read:
00:07:15 ‘Enoch walked with the true God.’
00:07:18 Enoch was Noah’s great-grandfather.
00:07:21 Now, since Jehovah moved the writer of Genesis
00:07:24 to describe these two men in exactly the same manner,
00:07:28 it indicates that Noah had much in common
00:07:31 with his great-grandfather.
00:07:33 Now, it’s true that Noah never met Enoch
00:07:37 because Enoch died before Noah was born.
00:07:40 But Noah’s father’s life
00:07:44 overlapped for more than 100 years with that of Enoch.
00:07:49 So we can imagine that Lamech
00:07:51 must have told stories to Noah about his grandfather:
00:07:55 how Enoch prophesied courageously
00:07:58 while surrounded by ungodly people,
00:08:00 how these people hated Enoch to the point that they wanted to kill him.
00:08:03 But despite being in danger,
00:08:05 as we read at Genesis 5:22:
00:08:08 “Enoch continued to walk with the true God.”
00:08:12 And Jehovah protected Enoch.
00:08:15 Well, as Noah listened to these stories
00:08:18 and reflected on Enoch’s faith and courage,
00:08:21 his desire to follow in Enoch’s footsteps
00:08:23 no doubt grew stronger and stronger.
00:08:26 In fact, Noah’s faith became so strong
00:08:30 that he continued to walk with God for 600 years
00:08:35 until the time of the Flood
00:08:37 —in spite of the ungodly and violent people around him.
00:08:41 Now, just as Noah must have been strengthened
00:08:44 by the faith of his forefathers,
00:08:47 some of us may be the third or the fourth generation
00:08:50 in our family who serve Jehovah.
00:08:53 If that’s the case with you,
00:08:55 your parents or grandparents likely told you stories
00:08:58 about your relatives who served Jehovah
00:09:00 —perhaps way back in the time of Brother Rutherford or even earlier.
00:09:04 And as you listened to these stories about your faithful relatives,
00:09:08 your desire to walk in their footsteps grew stronger and stronger.
00:09:14 What, though, if we are not part of a family
00:09:17 with a long line of Witnesses?
00:09:19 Well, we too are encouraged by the examples
00:09:23 of our brothers and sisters of previous generations
00:09:26 when we read their life stories as found in The Watchtower.
00:09:30 As we learn about their courage and endurance,
00:09:32 their stories strengthen our faith.
00:09:35 Indeed, the examples of God’s servants in the past
00:09:40 as recorded in the Bible,
00:09:42 in our family history,
00:09:45 or in the life stories found in The Watchtower
00:09:48 help us to trust fully in the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises.
00:09:53 In turn, that trust strengthens us to do what?
00:09:58 To imitate Noah and walk with God
00:10:02 —not just now but forever.

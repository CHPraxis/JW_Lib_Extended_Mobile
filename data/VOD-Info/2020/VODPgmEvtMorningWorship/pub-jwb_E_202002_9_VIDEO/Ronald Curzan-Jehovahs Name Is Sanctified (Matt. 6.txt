00:00:01 Have you ever asked a child,
00:00:03 “Where’s Jehovah?”
00:00:05 Right away their finger goes up.
00:00:07 It’s cute.
00:00:08 We appreciate that their parents
00:00:09 have taught them
00:00:10 some very basic things,
00:00:12 Jehovah’s name as well.
00:00:13 But what if we were to ask
00:00:15 the same question to an adult, “Where’s Jehovah?”
00:00:18 and they put their hand up
00:00:19 —not so cute.
00:00:21 The question is really deeper than that.
00:00:24 The question, Where is Jehovah?
00:00:26 is really, ‘Where is Jehovah in my life?
00:00:30 ‘Where is Jehovah when I’m making decisions?
00:00:33 ‘What is his will?
00:00:35 What would he like for me to do?’
00:00:37 That’s the question: ‘Where is Jehovah in my life?’
00:00:42 And that’s basically what Jesus Christ was saying in the model prayer.
00:00:46 There would be a priority in things
00:00:48 that we would request of our heavenly Father.
00:00:51 If we were to put our own interests first, our concerns,
00:00:54 that would really be out of the priority that he outlined.
00:00:58 It’s the sanctification of Jehovah’s name —which is number one—
00:01:02 and then his Kingdom, as well as Jehovah’s will.
00:01:06 When Jesus was here on earth, there was no question
00:01:09 that he put Jehovah first in his life.
00:01:12 Everything he did, everything he said,
00:01:15 how he treated others all revolved around Jehovah’s sanctification.
00:01:20 Jesus not only gave the model prayer
00:01:23 but he lived the model prayer.
00:01:26 He worked in perfect harmony with that prayer,
00:01:29 and he instructed his followers to do the same
00:01:33 —always try to put Jehovah as the number one thing in their life
00:01:38 in small decisions as well as the large decisions.
00:01:42 So he gave the model prayer
00:01:45 as something for us to follow as a model,
00:01:48 as a guide, not word for word,
00:01:51 but the thoughts and the order of importance within that prayer.
00:01:55 In fact, Jesus was so concerned about sanctifying Jehovah’s name
00:02:00 that he did this on a regular basis,
00:02:03 reminding his closest associates how to pray.
00:02:06 What are the proper things to pray for?
00:02:09 The footnote on Matthew 6:9 is interesting for “be sanctified.”
00:02:13 It defines it as “be held sacred;
00:02:17 be treated as holy.”
00:02:19 And that really helps us to understand what sanctification means.
00:02:23 But our Study Bible  really helps us,
00:02:26 as this point is put in a comment.
00:02:30 It says this in the Study Bible:
00:02:32 “This is a petition that all creation,
00:02:35 “including both humans and angels,
00:02:37 “hold God’s name holy.
00:02:39 “The petition also includes the thought that God take action
00:02:43 “to sanctify himself by clearing his name of the reproach
00:02:47 “that has been heaped on it ever since the rebellion
00:02:50 of the first human pair in the garden of Eden.”
00:02:54 Yes, toward the end of Jesus’ ministry,
00:02:57 he could confidently and humbly approach Jehovah
00:03:00 and say at John 17:26:
00:03:03 “I have made your name known to them
00:03:06 and will make it known [to them].”
00:03:09 Those are the words that we want to say as well
00:03:13 as we follow Jesus, our model.
00:03:16 And there’s no question, again, that Jesus put Jehovah first.
00:03:20 He was a priority.
00:03:21 The sanctification of His name was number one.
00:03:25 To sanctify God’s name,
00:03:27 for you and for me, is more than just words.
00:03:30 It’s more than what we say in our prayer.
00:03:33 It’s what we do, what we put into action.
00:03:36 And we need to ask ourselves on a daily basis,
00:03:40 ‘Where is Jehovah in my life when I’m making decisions
00:03:45 —how I treat others and how I serve Jehovah?’
00:03:50 Yes, Jehovah must be very happy when he looks down
00:03:53 at all those who are tied in to this program
00:03:55 to see how they (you) are putting Jehovah first.
00:03:59 You are simplifying your lives.
00:04:01 You’re sanctifying his name by your work assignments,
00:04:04 in the congregation, in your actions, and in your thoughts.
00:04:08 And many of us have been serving Jehovah
00:04:10 for many years, many decades.
00:04:13 But we must continue to ask,
00:04:15 ‘Where’s Jehovah in my life?’
00:04:17 by making wise decisions,
00:04:19 even if we have many years of faithful service.
00:04:22 The problem with Jehovah’s people in the past,
00:04:25 his people, Israel,
00:04:27 was that they were supposed to be holy.
00:04:29 They were supposed to be sanctified, set apart to do his will.
00:04:32 But many times, they did their own will.
00:04:35 Notice what the prophet Jeremiah had to say on this subject
00:04:38 at Jeremiah 2:5, 6,
00:04:43 and notice the question that was posed by Jeremiah to those people.
00:04:48 Jeremiah 2:5 says:
00:04:50 “This is what Jehovah says:
00:04:52 “‘What fault did your forefathers find in me,
00:04:55 “‘so that they strayed so far from me,
00:04:57 “‘and they walked after worthless idols
00:05:00 “‘and became worthless themselves?
00:05:02 “‘[This is the point.]
00:05:04 They did not ask, “Where is Jehovah?”’”
00:05:07 It’s a simple question but profound.
00:05:10 And notice verse 8:
00:05:12 “[Even] the priests
00:05:13 “[who were supposed to be holy, leading the people, they] did not ask,
00:05:17 “‘Where is Jehovah?’
00:05:19 “Those handling the Law did not know me,
00:05:21 “the shepherds rebelled against me,
00:05:23 “the prophets prophesied by Baal,
00:05:26 and they followed those who could bring no benefit.”
00:05:30 Jehovah was not part of their lives.
00:05:33 They were doing their own will, not Jehovah’s.
00:05:37 Now, it’s one thing to follow Jehovah’s direction
00:05:39 to do his will when things are going well,
00:05:42 when things are going as we have anticipated,
00:05:45 but what about when difficulties come upon us
00:05:48 —trialsome situations?
00:05:50 Then here comes the test.
00:05:52 Now, many of God’s servants throughout the centuries
00:05:54 have proved their integrity and their faithfulness
00:05:57 despite whatever has been thrown against them.
00:06:00 Can you think of a Bible character that had so much against him
00:06:05 —so many trials, so many depressing situations—
00:06:09 and yet he was very faithful?
00:06:12 Are you thinking about Job?
00:06:14 He’s one of the characters that we refer to many, many times.
00:06:18 Now, Job was a faithful man.
00:06:21 We know the end of the story.
00:06:22 But throughout his ordeals,
00:06:25 he was really tested and he lost focus.
00:06:28 He became shortsighted; he became self-absorbed.
00:06:32 In a way, he replaced all the windows in his home
00:06:36 with mirrors so that all he could see was himself.
00:06:39 All he could see were his own problems.
00:06:41 So Jehovah used the young man Elihu
00:06:44 to remind Job that he needed
00:06:46 to look at things from a different perspective.
00:06:49 Notice Job chapter 35
00:06:51 —Job 35:9.
00:07:00 Elihu said:
00:07:01 “People cry out when under great oppression;
00:07:04 “they cry for relief from the domination of the powerful.
00:07:07 But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Grand Maker?’”
00:07:12 So he was trying to, really, remind him of the big picture
00:07:16 —looking at things from Jehovah’s standpoint.
00:07:19 And he helped Job remove those mirrors
00:07:22 so that he could look out his windows
00:07:24 —see Jehovah; see the big picture;
00:07:27 see his smallness in comparison to Jehovah’s largeness.
00:07:31 In fact, if you go to Job chapter 42,
00:07:34 notice there his response as he was readjusted
00:07:37 and humbly listened to these reminders.
00:07:40 At Job 42:3, he said:
00:07:42 “I spoke, but without understanding.”
00:07:45 Verse 5: “My ears have heard about you,
00:07:48 “but now I do see you with my eyes.
00:07:51 “That is why I take back what I said,
00:07:53 and I repent in dust and ashes.”
00:07:57 Job’s experience is something that we may have experienced
00:08:01 —some kind of trial, some kind of discouraging experience.
00:08:05 There’s a very close friend of mine
00:08:07 who came into Bethel around the same time as myself.
00:08:10 We got married around the same time,
00:08:12 and, unfortunately, he lost his wife in death
00:08:15 a few years ago.
00:08:18 Now, that very month, what did he do?
00:08:21 Did he get depressed? Did he quit?
00:08:23 He auxiliary pioneered.
00:08:25 And when I spoke to him and asked him,
00:08:27 “How could you have such a focus, such a determination?”
00:08:30 he said: “Well, I looked at it this way:
00:08:32 “Paul said that we are
00:08:33 “‘a theatrical spectacle before men and angels.’
00:08:37 “I view myself as this is my ‘Job moment.’
00:08:41 “So here I am. I’m thrust onto the stage.
00:08:44 “Up in that balcony is Jehovah, Jesus,
00:08:47 “the resurrected anointed ones, the angels.
00:08:50 “They’re looking down at me,
00:08:51 “and there before me in the audience
00:08:53 “is the world and my brothers and my sisters.
00:08:57 “And down in that orchestra pit is Satan the Devil and the demons.
00:09:01 “Here I am. Lights are on.
00:09:03 “Everyone is looking at me.
00:09:04 “What am I going to do? Will I run? Will I hide?
00:09:08 “Or is this my ‘Job moment’?
00:09:10 Is this where I prove my integrity?”
00:09:12 He did, and he continues to do so today.
00:09:15 What about us?
00:09:17 When we’re going through discouraging circumstances
00:09:21 —our “Job moment”—
00:09:23 do we ask, Where is Jehovah?
00:09:25 Are we proving our integrity by what we’re doing
00:09:28 —promoting Kingdom interests, sanctifying Jehovah’s name?
00:09:31 Is that the number one thing in our life?
00:09:33 Are we doing that daily?
00:09:36 We need to ask ourselves that on a daily basis.
00:09:38 Even when we’re giving talks,
00:09:40 when we’re dealing with brothers and sisters
00:09:42 at work or in a congregation,
00:09:44 we need to ask, Where is Jehovah?
00:09:48 And that will really change our treatment of others,
00:09:51 how we view them, and how we view ourselves.
00:09:54 So Jesus’ reminders really help us to appreciate
00:09:57 that there’s a priority in what we pray for
00:10:00 and how we carry out those prayers
00:10:03 —always putting Jehovah as the number one thing in our life,
00:10:06 knowing that all of our other requests,
00:10:08 our personal requests, will be heard by Jehovah
00:10:11 and will be answered by him.

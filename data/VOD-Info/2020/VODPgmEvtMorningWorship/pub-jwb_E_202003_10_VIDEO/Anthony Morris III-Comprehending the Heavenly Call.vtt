00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, we’re going to be

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.943 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
discussing the anointed this morning. 

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:08.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower’s </i>theme

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:10.865 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from where the comments are taken was

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.285 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The Spirit Bears Witness With Our Spirit.”

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing to keep in mind is that this issue

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower, </i>January 2016,

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the comments
 were taken from  this morning

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(as well as the following article)

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
addressed the matter of the anointed

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:32.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how God’s people
should view this subject.

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:36.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And really, they’re both
certainly worthy of reviewing.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since the time that we studied this,

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are thousands that have been baptized.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these questions come up,

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s nice and clear
in these two study articles.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this morning,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since this is the focus
of the Scriptural discussion,

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll talk about these questions
about the anointed.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s
open up to the entire scripture here

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from where our text came from,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 John chapter 3

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 John chapter 3.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 2 in its entirety:

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Beloved ones, we are now children of God,

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it has not yet been made
manifest what we will be.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:32.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We do know that when
he is made manifest we will be like him,

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we will see him just as he is.”

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s very obvious, and, of course,
we know that John was inspired here,

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this was written
after decades of sacred service

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God as one of his anointed sons.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can note the confidence

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what John writes here

00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his fellow anointed brothers and sisters.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go to the end of the verse,

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not that we might “be like him,”
we might “see him.”

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, “we will be like him”;

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will see him just as he is.”

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:17.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s not an overconfidence,
but that’s a confidence

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:22.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the conviction
that Jehovah had indeed anointed him.

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was obvious there
in the first century with the gifts and such.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s the same kind of conviction
for the anointed today

00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is what’s going to be

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the future as long as they
maintain their integrity

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:41.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and honor Jehovah God.

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why with this nice statement

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and today’s comments that we’ll read shortly,

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some wonder (and maybe
you’ve had the experience

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of someone talking to you,
particularly if you’re an elder)

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they have the heavenly hope?

00:02:57.614 --> 00:02:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some are sincere.

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:02.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve gone through
difficult times in their life.

00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe they’ve been
in the truth for a few years,

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re looking
for some advice and direction.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:13.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what <i>The Watchtower</i>
stated, if you’re wondering:

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:18.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, if you are wondering whether
you have received the heavenly calling,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that would in itself indicate

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:26.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have <i>not </i>received it.”

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Straightforward
—so something to keep in mind

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use whenever that comes up.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be done in a kind way.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if they’re wondering about it,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they haven’t received it.

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes some brothers

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will ask anointed ones,
“How do you know you are anointed?”

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine saying that to the apostle John.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘John, how do you know you’re anointed?’

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, read my first letter there

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that Jehovah inspired me to write,

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that will answer it for you.’

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the anointed
may choose to attempt to answer

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:10.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they might say that it is personal.

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second article,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
addressed this issue,
and it’s a good thing to keep in mind.

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second article
in paragraph 10 stated regarding

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appropriate respect
for those whom Jehovah chooses to anoint:

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We would not ask them personal questions

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their anointing.”

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s pretty clear.

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So God forgives you
if you’ve done that in the past,

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but from now on,

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s the clear message.

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonetheless, it’s happened
many times in the past,

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can still happen

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re all imperfect
—we’re not paying attention.

00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll share with you what I know
happened with Brother Fred Franz.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, of course,
is clearly one of the anointed,

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:11.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before he died, he was
part of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:15.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was in the early 1980’s,

00:05:15.544 --> 00:05:20.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife and my sons were
at a Kingdom Hall where I gave a public talk.

00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:25.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there was a small gathering
following the meeting.

00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:29.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the one couple that had us over,

00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was one particular sister
there who had a lot of questions and such,

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t know her personally.

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she had just been at Brooklyn Bethel,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she had the opportunity
to meet Brother Fred Franz.

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:48.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m just listening to her,
and the rest of the family is listening,

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she says (among some
of the other things she mentioned),

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I asked Brother Franz, ‘How do you
 know you’re one of the anointed?’”

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m looking at her like, really?

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:05.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You asked this spiritual giant,

00:06:05.594 --> 00:06:08.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do you know you’re one of the anointed?”

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:13.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t
a real inquisitive type of question,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just whatever was going on in her mind.

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:19.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be patient with Jehovah’s sheep.

00:06:19.024 --> 00:06:23.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was very touched,
and I think you may be as well.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:27.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Franz’s answer—
Because I said, “Well, what did he say?”

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Romans 8:15-17,

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:35.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s all he’d say.”

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:36.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s read that,

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:15-17.

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:47.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the answer to that question

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where the theme
for that <i>Watchtower</i><i> </i><i> </i>article came from.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 15: “For you did not
receive a spirit of slavery

00:06:55.644 --> 00:07:00.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“causing fear again, but you
received a spirit of adoption as sons,

00:07:00.274 --> 00:07:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by which spirit we cry out: <i>‘Abba, </i>Father!’

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:09.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit itself bears witness
with our spirit that we are God’s children.

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:14.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, then, we are children, we are also heirs

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:16.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—heirs indeed of God,

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:20.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but joint heirs with Christ
—provided we suffer together

00:07:20.252 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may also be glorified together.”

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the simple, direct answer.

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s spirit bears witness

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:33.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the spirit of the one
that he’s chosen to anoint

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:36.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most powerful force in the universe.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:41.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it convinces that individual
that they’re an adopted son of God

00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:44.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a joint heir with Christ Jesus.

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:48.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is a nice experience in how well

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kindly Brother Franz handled that.

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:55.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he had never met her in his life

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:59.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just gave her a Scriptural response.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now further on this, in addition,
I just want to have you consider this thought

00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:09.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you try to get
the anointed to try to explain

00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:14.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and you’re not anointed
and you want them to try to explain)

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:16.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they know they’re anointed.

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:19.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve appreciated this over the years.

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a quote from <i>The Watchtower </i>

00:08:24.608 --> 00:08:27.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2000, January 15, page 15,

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had the theme “‘Desirable Things’
Are Filling Jehovah’s House.”

00:08:31.615 --> 00:08:36.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice: “In effect, Jesus was
offered up on the altar of God’s will

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when he was baptized and anointed
by God’s holy spirit in 29 C.E.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, this event marked
the beginning of a sacrificial life course

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:49.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jesus that lasted
for three and a half years.

00:08:49.674 --> 00:08:51.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that period,

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:55.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus enjoyed
a spirit-begotten relationship with God.”

00:08:55.097 --> 00:09:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice: “This unique standing
that Jesus had with his heavenly Father

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:05.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“could not be fully comprehended
by other humans.

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:08.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was as if a screen
blocked their eyes of discernment,

00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:11.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as a screen shielded the Holy

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the view
of those in the tabernacle courtyard.”

00:09:15.283 --> 00:09:18.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s very clear.

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s trying to explain
that you can’t see into the Holy.

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:26.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even the disciples
at that time couldn’t comprehend

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:30.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ spirit-begotten status

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:34.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until later when Jehovah
gave them his holy spirit

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:36.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and begot them as his sons.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:41.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, carrying over
the same point with the spiritual temple,

00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:45.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in 1996, July 1, page 16,

00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:48.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding Jehovah’s great spiritual temple:

00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The first compartment of the temple

00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pictures a condition
superior to that of the courtyard.

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Priests who served inside
the Holy of the earthly temple

00:09:59.369 --> 00:10:03.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were unseen by worshipers on the outside.”

00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:06.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, in the courtyard
you couldn’t see into the Holy.

00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice <i>The Watchtower </i>stated:

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Likewise, anointed Christians
experience a spiritual condition

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is not shared or fully understood

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:19.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the majority of worshipers of God,

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:22.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose hope is to live forever
on a paradise earth.”

00:10:22.809 --> 00:10:26.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re not going to be able to explain

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it’s like because you
can’t see in there.

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you can’t even see in there,

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:35.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are you going to even understand
what it’s like to be in there?

00:10:35.238 --> 00:10:38.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is just a good thing to keep in mind.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us has a place
in Jehovah’s organization,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for this we should rejoice.

00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:47.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s just thank him
for whatever hope we have

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for his undeserved kindness.

00:00:01 Obviously, we’re going to be
00:00:03 discussing the anointed this morning.
00:00:05 The Watchtower’s theme
00:00:08 from where the comments are taken was
00:00:10 “The Spirit Bears Witness With Our Spirit.”
00:00:15 The thing to keep in mind is that this issue
00:00:18 of The Watchtower, January 2016,
00:00:21 where the comments  were taken from  this morning
00:00:24 (as well as the following article)
00:00:26 addressed the matter of the anointed
00:00:29 and how God’s people should view this subject.
00:00:32 And really, they’re both certainly worthy of reviewing.
00:00:36 And since the time that we studied this,
00:00:39 there are thousands that have been baptized.
00:00:41 So these questions come up,
00:00:43 and it’s nice and clear in these two study articles.
00:00:47 So this morning,
00:00:49 since this is the focus of the Scriptural discussion,
00:00:53 we’ll talk about these questions about the anointed.
00:00:57 And let’s open up to the entire scripture here
00:01:01 from where our text came from,
00:01:03 1 John chapter 3
00:01:09 —1 John chapter 3.
00:01:13 Let’s read verse 2 in its entirety:
00:01:18 “Beloved ones, we are now children of God,
00:01:22 “but it has not yet been made manifest what we will be.
00:01:27 “We do know that when he is made manifest we will be like him,
00:01:32 because we will see him just as he is.”
00:01:37 So it’s very obvious, and, of course, we know that John was inspired here,
00:01:41 and this was written after decades of sacred service
00:01:46 to Jehovah God as one of his anointed sons.
00:01:50 And you can note the confidence
00:01:53 in what John writes here
00:01:56 to his fellow anointed brothers and sisters.
00:02:00 If you go to the end of the verse,
00:02:02 it’s not that we might “be like him,” we might “see him.”
00:02:07 No, “we will be like him”;
00:02:11 “we will see him just as he is.”
00:02:14 So that’s not an overconfidence, but that’s a confidence
00:02:17 because of the conviction that Jehovah had indeed anointed him.
00:02:22 And it was obvious there in the first century with the gifts and such.
00:02:27 But it’s the same kind of conviction for the anointed today
00:02:31 that this is what’s going to be
00:02:35 the future as long as they maintain their integrity
00:02:39 and honor Jehovah God.
00:02:41 That’s why with this nice statement
00:02:44 and today’s comments that we’ll read shortly,
00:02:47 some wonder (and maybe you’ve had the experience
00:02:51 of someone talking to you, particularly if you’re an elder)
00:02:55 if they have the heavenly hope?
00:02:57 And some are sincere.
00:02:59 They’ve gone through difficult times in their life.
00:03:02 Maybe they’ve been in the truth for a few years,
00:03:04 and they’re looking for some advice and direction.
00:03:08 Notice what The Watchtower stated, if you’re wondering:
00:03:13 “In fact, if you are wondering whether you have received the heavenly calling,
00:03:18 “that would in itself indicate
00:03:22 that you have not received it.”
00:03:26 Straightforward —so something to keep in mind
00:03:29 to use whenever that comes up.
00:03:32 It would be done in a kind way.
00:03:35 But if they’re wondering about it,
00:03:37 they haven’t received it.
00:03:39 Now, sometimes some brothers
00:03:43 will ask anointed ones, “How do you know you are anointed?”
00:03:49 Imagine saying that to the apostle John.
00:03:53 ‘John, how do you know you’re anointed?’
00:03:56 ‘Well, read my first letter there
00:03:59 ‘that Jehovah inspired me to write,
00:04:01 and that will answer it for you.’
00:04:04 Now, the anointed may choose to attempt to answer
00:04:07 or they might say that it is personal.
00:04:10 Now, the second article, as I mentioned earlier,
00:04:13 addressed this issue, and it’s a good thing to keep in mind.
00:04:17 The second article in paragraph 10 stated regarding
00:04:20 appropriate respect for those whom Jehovah chooses to anoint:
00:04:24 “We would not ask them personal questions
00:04:29 about their anointing.”
00:04:35 That’s pretty clear.
00:04:37 So God forgives you if you’ve done that in the past,
00:04:41 but from now on,
00:04:44 that’s the clear message.
00:04:47 Nonetheless, it’s happened many times in the past,
00:04:51 and it can still happen
00:04:53 because we’re all imperfect —we’re not paying attention.
00:04:57 I’ll share with you what I know happened with Brother Fred Franz.
00:05:02 This, of course, is clearly one of the anointed,
00:05:06 and before he died, he was part of “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:05:11 So it was in the early 1980’s,
00:05:15 and my wife and my sons were at a Kingdom Hall where I gave a public talk.
00:05:20 And then there was a small gathering following the meeting.
00:05:25 I knew the one couple that had us over,
00:05:29 but there was one particular sister there who had a lot of questions and such,
00:05:33 and I didn’t know her personally.
00:05:35 But she had just been at Brooklyn Bethel,
00:05:38 and she had the opportunity to meet Brother Fred Franz.
00:05:43 So I’m just listening to her, and the rest of the family is listening,
00:05:48 and she says (among some of the other things she mentioned),
00:05:52 “I asked Brother Franz, ‘How do you  know you’re one of the anointed?’”
00:05:58 Well, I’m looking at her like, really?
00:06:02 You asked this spiritual giant,
00:06:05 “How do you know you’re one of the anointed?”
00:06:08 It wasn’t a real inquisitive type of question,
00:06:13 just whatever was going on in her mind.
00:06:16 We want to be patient with Jehovah’s sheep.
00:06:19 But I was very touched, and I think you may be as well.
00:06:23 Brother Franz’s answer— Because I said, “Well, what did he say?”
00:06:27 And she said,
00:06:30 “Romans 8:15-17,
00:06:33 and that’s all he’d say.”
00:06:35 So let’s read that,
00:06:36 Romans 8:15-17.
00:06:43 And this is the answer to that question
00:06:47 and where the theme for that Watchtower  article came from.
00:06:50 Verse 15: “For you did not receive a spirit of slavery
00:06:55 “causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons,
00:07:00 “by which spirit we cry out: ‘Abba, Father!’
00:07:04 “The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.
00:07:09 “If, then, we are children, we are also heirs
00:07:14 “—heirs indeed of God,
00:07:16 “but joint heirs with Christ —provided we suffer together
00:07:20 so that we may also be glorified together.”
00:07:23 So that’s the simple, direct answer.
00:07:27 Jehovah’s spirit bears witness
00:07:29 with the spirit of the one that he’s chosen to anoint
00:07:33 —the most powerful force in the universe.
00:07:36 And it convinces that individual that they’re an adopted son of God
00:07:41 —a joint heir with Christ Jesus.
00:07:44 So this is a nice experience in how well
00:07:48 and kindly Brother Franz handled that.
00:07:52 And he had never met her in his life
00:07:55 but just gave her a Scriptural response.
00:07:59 Now further on this, in addition, I just want to have you consider this thought
00:08:05 when you try to get the anointed to try to explain
00:08:09 (and you’re not anointed and you want them to try to explain)
00:08:14 how they know they’re anointed.
00:08:16 I’ve appreciated this over the years.
00:08:19 Here’s a quote from The Watchtower
00:08:24 of 2000, January 15, page 15,
00:08:27 that had the theme “‘Desirable Things’ Are Filling Jehovah’s House.”
00:08:31 Now notice: “In effect, Jesus was offered up on the altar of God’s will
00:08:36 “when he was baptized and anointed by God’s holy spirit in 29 C.E.
00:08:41 “Indeed, this event marked the beginning of a sacrificial life course
00:08:46 “for Jesus that lasted for three and a half years.
00:08:49 “During that period,
00:08:51 Jesus enjoyed a spirit-begotten relationship with God.”
00:08:55 Now notice: “This unique standing that Jesus had with his heavenly Father
00:09:00 “could not be fully comprehended by other humans.
00:09:05 “It was as if a screen blocked their eyes of discernment,
00:09:08 “just as a screen shielded the Holy
00:09:11 from the view of those in the tabernacle courtyard.”
00:09:15 So it’s very clear.
00:09:18 It’s trying to explain that you can’t see into the Holy.
00:09:22 And even the disciples at that time couldn’t comprehend
00:09:26 Jesus’ spirit-begotten status
00:09:30 until later when Jehovah gave them his holy spirit
00:09:34 and begot them as his sons.
00:09:36 Now, carrying over the same point with the spiritual temple,
00:09:41 back in 1996, July 1, page 16,
00:09:45 regarding Jehovah’s great spiritual temple:
00:09:48 “The first compartment of the temple
00:09:50 “pictures a condition superior to that of the courtyard.
00:09:55 “Priests who served inside the Holy of the earthly temple
00:09:59 were unseen by worshipers on the outside.”
00:10:03 See, in the courtyard you couldn’t see into the Holy.
00:10:06 Now notice The Watchtower stated:
00:10:08 “Likewise, anointed Christians experience a spiritual condition
00:10:13 “that is not shared or fully understood
00:10:16 “by the majority of worshipers of God,
00:10:19 whose hope is to live forever on a paradise earth.”
00:10:22 So you’re not going to be able to explain
00:10:26 what it’s like because you can’t see in there.
00:10:29 So if you can’t even see in there,
00:10:31 how are you going to even understand what it’s like to be in there?
00:10:35 So this is just a good thing to keep in mind.
00:10:38 Each of us has a place in Jehovah’s organization,
00:10:41 and for this we should rejoice.
00:10:43 And let’s just thank him for whatever hope we have
00:10:47 and for his undeserved kindness.

00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:04.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are at war, and that is very clear.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So for all of us,

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.791 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we have to protect ourselves

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from Satan and the demons

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the spiritual fight is on to the finish.

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Working out [our] salvation

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with fear and trembling” is essential.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles
to Revelation chapter 12,

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s learn
why the Devil is so infuriated

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why he hates Jehovah’s servants.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to focus first

00:00:27.544 --> 00:00:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Revelation chapter 12 and verse 11

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 11:

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they [that’s the anointed remnant]

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conquered him [that’s the Devil].”

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hates that.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The anointed conquer Satan the Devil.

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They prove him to be a liar.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re loyal; they’re integrity-keepers;

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their conduct and their words
—everything that they do—

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conquer the Devil.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, in addition to that,
in addition to their faith in the ransom,

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 11 goes on to say something else
which truly infuriates the Devil.

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:06.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that they conquer him

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 by “the word of their witnessing.”

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 24:14—the preaching activity.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, there is a direct connection

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between conquering Satan
and our preaching activity.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he hates,
and that is why he relentlessly attacks

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our preaching activity
and tries to stir up opposition.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s conquered by means
of the preaching work.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:36.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan’s opposition
to our preaching work is nothing new.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Amos chapter 7,

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note some striking similarities
between our day and Amos’ day

00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:48.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Amos chapter 7.

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this is when Jehovah God sent Amos
to the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel.

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeroboam was the king,

00:01:55.765 --> 00:01:59.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put calf worship there
in a city called Bethel,

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and calf worship was now a part

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the religion there
at the ten-tribe kingdom.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:09.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now Amos finds himself
right in the middle of that situation.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s see what happens
—how the opposition mounts

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it’s similar in our day.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 10:

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Amaziah the priest of Bethel”

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:27.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so Amaziah is the priest
of this State religion of calf worship.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethel is the center of apostate religion.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Amaziah do?

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sends a message
to King Jeroboam of Israel.

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice now how the religious entity, Amaziah,

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sends the message to the State
(over to the government),

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to King Jeroboam, and gets him all worked up,

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:53.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he says: “Amos is conspiring against you

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“right in the midst of the house of Israel.

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The land cannot put up with all his words.”

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Conspiring against Jeroboam

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:04.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this was an act of treason.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, this lying report
went straight to Jeroboam

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Amaziah (the priest),

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now see what happens here in verse 11.

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He stirs up opposition, true,

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now notice
the three misleading statements

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:24.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Amaziah accuses Amos of.

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) “For this is what Amos says.”

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:31.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not true.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos didn’t say that.

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:36.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos always said:
‘This is what Jehovah wants me to say.

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah commanded me to say.’

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:44.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Amaziah just says:
“This is what Amos [said]”—misleading.

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) “Jeroboam will die by the sword.”

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos never said that.

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Amos said
that it was Jeroboam’s house

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his dynasty or his posterity—
that would die.

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:03.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, again, a misleading,
distorted way of presenting matters.

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) “Israel will surely go

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into exile from its land.”

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:12.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Amaziah does not add

00:04:12.635 --> 00:04:15.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Amos was trying to help people.

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos was trying
to turn people to Jehovah God.

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Serve Jehovah God,
and you’ll get a blessing.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do what Jehovah wants you to do,
and you’ll have his favor.’

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Amaziah doesn’t touch that.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t say anything positive
that Amos is doing.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, these are the three things

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Amaziah was doing and accusing Amos of

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—three misleading statements,
distorted half-truths—

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:44.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to get the official ban
on the preaching activity of Amos.

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see something similar today?

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We note striking similarities

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the methods of Amaziah

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those employed by the opposers

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s people.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Amaziah tried to silence Amos,

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so certain religious leaders
today do the same.

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They try to block the preaching work
of Jehovah’s servants.

00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:17.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amaziah falsely accused Amos of treason.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, some religious leaders
falsely accuse Jehovah’s people

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being a threat to national security.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:31.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Amaziah turned to the king,
Jeroboam, to help in opposing Amos,

00:05:31.214 --> 00:05:34.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so religious leaders today

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often turn to political allies

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:40.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an effort to support their persecution

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses—striking similarities.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to the preaching work,
you see, the Devil hates it.

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:52.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Amos do?

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he back down?

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he be intimidated?

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:58.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he cower in fear?

00:05:58.141 --> 00:05:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he run away from his assignment?

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was just a shepherd boy.

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:06.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was one who took care of figs,

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was a herdsman.

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here he’s taken
from his little, bleak surroundings,

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s put right in the middle
of this hotbed of activity there

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Bethel—apostate center.

00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that he didn’t go off

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into some area where there were no people,

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was right there at the nerve center.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This little, humble, modest man, Amos

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we don’t know much about him.

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not impressive,
but his message is impressive.

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:36.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more importantly,

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see how Jehovah emboldened him

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his holy spirit
to be valiant and courageous

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of this situation.

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s see what Amos says.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do?

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 16:

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So now hear the word of Jehovah.”

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:57.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Amos is saying this to Amaziah.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hear the word of Jehovah.”

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:01.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, he gives Jehovah all the credit:

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’s not me; it’s Jehovah
who asked me to do this, Amaziah.

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’s as if a lion roars;
who would not be afraid?

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:14.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah speaks,
and I’m going to spring into action.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is the word of Jehovah.’

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are saying [to me],
‘Do not prophesy against Israel,

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not preach
against the house of Isaac,’”

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the descendants of Jacob,
which would have been that ten-tribe kingdom.

00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:28.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos says: ‘I can’t do that.

00:07:28.464 --> 00:07:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I cannot stop.

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This commission comes from Jehovah God.’

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:35.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he cower?

00:07:35.004 --> 00:07:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, verse 17:
“Therefore this is what Jehovah says:

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[Amaziah,] your wife
will become a prostitute in the city.’”

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that would mean that his wife

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:51.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be violated
by the soldiers of a conquering army.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Your sons and your daughters
will fall by the sword.

00:07:53.823 --> 00:07:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You yourself are going to be buried
on unclean land.’

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:58.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s outside of Israel.

00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s what I have to say.
Checkmate.’

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amos—really, when you think about this man

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he just wanted
to do Jehovah’s work (Jehovah’s will),

00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was not intimidated and neither are we.

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to speaking Jehovah’s word,
we will not disobey Jehovah God.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in the lands
where we have these modern-day “Amaziahs”

00:08:23.653 --> 00:08:25.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fomenting cruel persecution,

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:28.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Amos, we keep on proclaiming,

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:31.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says.”

00:08:32.728 --> 00:08:35.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah God
tried to help those Israelites.

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:38.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tried to help them change their ways.

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used Amos to preach to them.

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, look at us;

00:08:43.472 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at Jehovah’s people earth wide
trying to help people.

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Devil hates this work.

00:08:48.644 --> 00:08:50.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the point.
Why?

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:52.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it conquers him.

00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The faithful slave is successful.

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what the anointed
are doing in fulfilling Matthew 24:14.

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is our role at Bethel?

00:09:01.023 --> 00:09:03.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are we talking about this
to the Bethel family?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we are the support group

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are Kingdom Support Services.

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In any war, in any war,

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to have a supply line.

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that supply line
is cut off from the front lines,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those front-lines people are in trouble.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in any war, the idea is to cut off—

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The enemy wants to cut off that supply line,

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:28.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants to sever the supply line.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It demoralizes the troops.

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:33.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s our job.
We are the supply line.

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:37.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom support role is vital
as we serve at Bethel.

00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:40.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a noble, honorable, work

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the preaching work
continue to move forward.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we look at chapter 4,

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is such a God of kindness and mercy.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, Jehovah repeatedly recounts

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he tried to help his people.

00:09:58.514 --> 00:09:59.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sent Amos.

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tries to correct them and chastise them,

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sends Amos back over and over again.

00:10:05.454 --> 00:10:07.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s this reoccurring theme.

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five times He reminds them
how He tried to help them

00:10:11.327 --> 00:10:15.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and five times: ‘You did not come back to me.

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You ten-tribe kingdom,
you did not come back to me.

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:20.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I tried to help you.

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You did not come back to me.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:23.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You did not come back to me.

00:10:23.606 --> 00:10:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You did not come back to me.

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:27.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m trying to help.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You didn’t come back to me.

00:10:28.744 --> 00:10:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So there’s only one option;

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:34.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you leave me one decision to make;
it’s military confrontation.’

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the way it will be in our day.

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:40.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s one option
—military confrontation—

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because people will not come back to Jehovah.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then what will happen?

00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:48.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 4, verse 12:

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get ready to meet your God.”

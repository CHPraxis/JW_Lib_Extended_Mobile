Our focus in the <i>Watchtower</i> study article

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:05.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is on how we can unleash

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the power of God’s Word

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:10.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when teaching from the platform.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, whether we’re teaching

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.064 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in a congregation setting,

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on a Bible study, or in the family,

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that all of us,
brothers and sisters,

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to ‘pay constant attention
to ourselves and to our teaching’?

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:28.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know why that’s so important
—because lives are at stake.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, younger or older,

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:34.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touch the lives of other people.

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:36.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we teach effectively,

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are giving opportunity to others

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:43.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attain the wisdom and the discernment
that God’s Word can give them.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we need to approach
any teaching opportunity

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seriously and prayerfully.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some constructive counsel
after a public talk.

00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:59.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, with a warm smile, he said this,

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.”

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ll never forget that counsel.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were those observations so helpful?

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:12.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it reminded me that when teaching,

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:16.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our model needs to be Jesus,
the Great Teacher.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s more to learn from him.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus’ example reminds us of the need

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:26.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain humble and diligent
students of Jehovah

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:29.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Grand Instructor.

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though all of us are teachers on occasion,

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that most often

00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the role we play during spiritual programs

00:01:38.748 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of students?

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just for a moment, think about the many hours

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:48.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we spend as students
—not teachers—

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:52.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in the audience
at congregation meetings,

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at assemblies, and at conventions.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:58.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to that the time we are students

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:01.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we buy out time to watch
the monthly broadcast,

00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for meetings,
to engage in family and personal study.

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think of the added privilege
that many of us here have

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to enjoy morning worship five days a week.

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, a typical program
of morning worship

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you multiply that by 5 days a week
and then by 52 weeks,

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:26.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a minimum, we are exposed

00:02:26.095 --> 00:02:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to at least 86 hours

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:32.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of divine instruction each year.

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re not careful,

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some or much of that valuable instruction,

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouragement, and counsel
could just wash over us.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the remaining time
for our program this morning,

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider some things all of us can do

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen more effectively

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:52.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at spiritual programs.

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:54.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, for our first point, open your Bible

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:58.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Ezra 7:10,

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s consider Ezra’s example.

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:06.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Ezra 7:10,

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the reading carefully:

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ezra had prepared his heart

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to consult the Law of Jehovah

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to practice it,

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:18.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to teach its regulations

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judgments in Israel.”

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
next to “prepared his heart,”

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:30.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you tap on that, you’ll notice
that that could be rendered as

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had determined in his heart.”

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from Ezra?

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right attitude
going into a period of study.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:44.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right approach
to study and learning.

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He recognized that it was Jehovah

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:49.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be teaching him through His Law.

00:03:49.345 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the verse goes on to say,
he first recognized

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he needed to personally practice
what he was learning.

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:01.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only then would he be in a rightful position

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to effectively teach others.

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this scripture emphasizes the point
we’ve already made, doesn’t it?

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we are teachers on occasion,

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are always first and foremost

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
students of God’s Word.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate Ezra’s example

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:22.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare our hearts before study,

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:24.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before attending a spiritual program

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(whether here at Bethel
or in the congregation),

00:04:27.617 --> 00:04:31.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before watching a monthly broadcast?

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to prepare our hearts
by specifically praying to Jehovah,

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing him
as the Source of the teaching.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we pray specifically about?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one, we want to pray
that we remain humble

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while listening to theocratic instruction.

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to listen

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter how long
we’ve been in Jehovah’s classroom—

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because none of us know it all,

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will we ever know it all.

00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:03.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 1:5 reminds us

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a wise person listens
and takes in more instruction.”

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this leads to another question:

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we find we have
a somewhat negative attitude

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward a certain presentation

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:20.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps the material doesn’t interest us,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we have a negative attitude
toward a certain brother

00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his teaching ability?

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we do?

00:05:27.944 --> 00:05:29.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepare our heart.

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah
to recognize and appreciate

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the instruction is from him.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to have a thankful spirit.

00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, back in 2002,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made this helpful point

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an article that was entitled
“Pay More Than the Usual Attention.”

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:52.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quote: “Some may tend to gauge
the quality of a meeting

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the teaching abilities
of the participants. . . .

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though the teaching ability
of participants is important,

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is not the sole factor contributing
to a meeting’s success.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you not agree
that our prime concern should be,

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not how well the speaker delivers his talk,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but how well we incline our ear?

00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:15.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we attend meetings,”
the article continues,

00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:18.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pay attention
to what is being presented,

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are worshiping God
in harmony with his will.

00:06:21.064 --> 00:06:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what makes the meeting a success.

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we are eager
to take in the knowledge of God,

00:06:26.602 --> 00:06:28.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will benefit from meetings,

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of a speaker’s abilities.”

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder for all of us!

00:06:34.877 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first point: Like Ezra,

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:40.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s prepare our hearts with prayer,

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as students who are determined to always

00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accept and apply
what Jehovah has to teach us.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second point:

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need to focus our attention.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you faced the challenge
of staying focused

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during spiritual programs?

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our minds may be distracted

00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with anxieties and many other things.

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noise and movements around us
could distract us.

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re watching morning worship 

00:07:11.214 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a location other than
the Bethel dining room,

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:17.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely we well know the numerous distractions

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fight for our attention.

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us have ailments
and physical discomforts

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may make it difficult to concentrate.

00:07:25.428 --> 00:07:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, a sister in our congregation

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told us about her long-term battle
with migraine headaches.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to put myself in her shoes,

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:39.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a migraine headache
while attending a spiritual program

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—difficult to concentrate.

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whatever the case may be, we know
—we admit—

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are many challenges
and distractions.

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do about it?

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since the eyes strongly influence

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we focus our attention,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Benefit</i>  book provides this suggestion:

00:07:56.993 --> 00:08:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use your eyes to help you concentrate
by keeping them on the speaker.

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he cites a Bible text
—even a familiar one—

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look it up, and follow along as he reads it.”

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it said this:
“Resist the temptation to turn your head

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:13.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the direction of every noise or movement.

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the eyes are flooding your mind
with distracting information,

00:08:17.713 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will miss much
of what is presented from the platform.”

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about, too,
the use of electronic devices.

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:30.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been alerted,
messaged, or e-mailed

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while looking at the Bible on your device?

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wise it is when we turn
those devices to a mode

00:08:38.134 --> 00:08:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that eliminates unnecessary distractions!

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:46.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about anxieties
or disquieting thoughts?

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could we do about that?

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here, again, is where we can remember

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who the Grand Instructor is
and how close he can be to us

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:58.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in a teaching environment.

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94:19

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:05.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.

00:09:05.995 --> 00:09:10.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:09:12.068 --> 00:09:14.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read:

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you [Jehovah] comforted and soothed me.”

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder!

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can soothe and comfort us

00:09:26.382 --> 00:09:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when attending spiritual programs

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can focus
on what he’s teaching us.

00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:34.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, spiritual programs
are a provision from him

00:09:34.924 --> 00:09:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a spiritual lifeline.

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as needed during a spiritual program,

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:43.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should pray to Jehovah
to help us stay focused.

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray repeatedly as needed.

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:49.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in summary, what have we learned?

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:52.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are teachers from time to time,

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but first and foremost, we are students

00:09:56.646 --> 00:10:00.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the classroom of the Great Teacher
and the Grand Instructor.

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:03.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Ezra, humility and appreciation

00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should move us to ‘prepare our hearts’
before every spiritual program.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to miss anything

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has for us.

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re determined ‘to consult that Law

00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:18.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can practice it
and then teach it.’

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in view
of all the potential distractions,

00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s make it our aim to use
our eyes, our mind, and our heart

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus attention on the goodness
of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions.

00:00:01 Sometimes, I think all of us would agree
00:00:03 that it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand
00:00:05 when things are going well
00:00:07 —when we get a court victory,
00:00:09 when someone’s health improves,
00:00:12 or maybe when someone really asked
00:00:15 to come to study the Bible with us and they’re at our meetings.
00:00:18 But it’s harder to see Jehovah’s hand when we see bad things happen
00:00:23 either to us or to our brothers and sisters.
00:00:27 So we may wonder, ‘How can we see Jehovah’s hand
00:00:30 when bad things are happening?’
00:00:33 Well, you can see my hand right now, right?
00:00:36 But if I put it away, you can’t see it.
00:00:41 Now, do you assume that because you can’t see my hand
00:00:44 that I don’t have a hand anymore?
00:00:46 Well, no.
00:00:47 You reason on the fact that since you see the rest of me,
00:00:49 and there’s probably still my hand attached.
00:00:53 So likewise, there are times when it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand,
00:00:58 and there are other times when we have to reason
00:01:01 on what we know about Jehovah in order to see his hand in action.
00:01:06 So let’s consider one thing.
00:01:08 What do we know about Jehovah
00:01:10 so that we could reason that his hand is in action?
00:01:13 Well, let’s reason on the point that he is a “happy God.”
00:01:19 Now, how does Jehovah stay happy,
00:01:22 seeing all the bad things that are happening?
00:01:25 Maybe you’ve wondered that. I know it’s crossed my mind.
00:01:28 How does Jehovah stay happy
00:01:30 when he sees all the suffering that’s going on?
00:01:34 And frankly, he sees all  the suffering;
00:01:37 he sees everything going on.
00:01:39 I know how I feel, and you probably know how you feel
00:01:41 just when you read about what’s happening
00:01:44 to our brothers in Venezuela or in Russia
00:01:46 or with all of the hurricanes
00:01:48 and earthquakes that we’ve had in recent times.
00:01:51 And we see the suffering
00:01:53 not only of our brothers and sisters but also of other people,
00:01:56 and we consider,
00:01:58 ‘How can Jehovah stay happy when he knows all of what is happening?’
00:02:03 Well, let’s consider three (I’m sure) of many reasons
00:02:06 why Jehovah can stay happy even though he knows all the suffering.
00:02:09 And then we can see how that could benefit us as well.
00:02:12 First of all,
00:02:14 his hand is hard at work preparing the new world for us.
00:02:18 And I think Jeremiah 29:11
00:02:22 really covers how Jehovah feels
00:02:25 about the future for us.
00:02:27 At Jeremiah 29:11, he says:
00:02:30 “‘For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’
00:02:33 “declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,
00:02:37 to give you a future and a hope.’”
00:02:41 So Jehovah is not simply just watching events occur.
00:02:45 He’s actively working on the solution.
00:02:49 He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels,
00:02:51 is working hard on the Kingdom.
00:02:54 Now, we can’t see into heaven right now,
00:02:58 but I want you to just imagine all the activity of the angels,
00:03:03 the resurrected anointed brothers,
00:03:05 and Jesus working hard on making preparations
00:03:10 for Armageddon and the new world.
00:03:12 Just think of all the work we’re doing just to prepare
00:03:15 for the annual meeting and dedication.
00:03:17 Can you imagine all the work going on in heaven that is there?
00:03:19 I mean, how far along are the new scrolls?
00:03:23 How are our basic needs  as far as clean water,
00:03:25 food, and homes going to be provided for the survivors?
00:03:29 So while we can’t see into heaven,
00:03:33 we know that his hand is there.
00:03:36 So Jehovah is happy because he’s actively working right now
00:03:39 to make things better for us.
00:03:42 What is the lesson for us?
00:03:44 We can be happy when we see the suffering around us
00:03:47 because we know what Jehovah and our brothers are doing up there
00:03:51 to prepare for the new world.
00:03:53 A second point about how Jehovah can be happy
00:03:56 is that he can comfort us right now.
00:03:59 He is happy when he can do that.
00:04:01 In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29,
00:04:05 Jehovah continued after saying that he was working on the future (he says):
00:04:10 “And you will call me and come and pray to me,
00:04:15 and I will listen to you.”
00:04:18 So I love this point because Jehovah is saying,
00:04:22 ‘Don’t worry; I’m taking care of building a better future for you.’
00:04:25 And we appreciate it.
00:04:27 If we’re going through some trial —some difficulty—
00:04:30 and a good friend of ours reminds us,
00:04:32 “Remember things are going to get better in the future;
00:04:34 Jehovah is going to change this; it’s going to get better,”
00:04:37 it is comforting.
00:04:38 But it is also comforting  (like Jehovah says here in verse 12)
00:04:41 when the person says, “What can I do for you right now?”
00:04:45 And Jehovah is saying right now, ‘Come, pray to me.’
00:04:49 Jehovah is there to comfort and help us.
00:04:52 We could kind of illustrate the way Jehovah feels
00:04:55 by thinking about parents and how they deal with a small child.
00:04:59 Have you ever seen a small child, maybe two or three years of age,
00:05:02 and they fall really badly and scrape their knees badly,
00:05:06 and they are screaming in pain?
00:05:09 There’s this red liquid leaking out of them.
00:05:11 They are distraught.
00:05:13 In fact, in that child’s mind,
00:05:15 he may think: ‘This is the end of it. This is the end of my life as I know it.
00:05:19 ‘I’m never going to recover from this.
00:05:21 I’m going to die.’
00:05:23 But for the parents, of course, their perspective is different, isn’t it?
00:05:28 But they comfort the child; they help to take care of the skinned knee.
00:05:31 They comfort them, and they tell them: “You’re going to live.
00:05:34 It’s going to be OK. It’s going to be all right.”
00:05:37 And why can the parent have that view?
00:05:39 Because they know that in a few hours maybe
00:05:42 (at least in a week or so),
00:05:44 the child is not even going to remember that skinned knee.
00:05:46 It’s going to be just a very distant memory.
00:05:48 Well, Jehovah also knows that whatever we’re going through right now
00:05:53 —whatever suffering we may be going through now—
00:05:56 that soon in that new world, we aren’t going to recall that suffering.
00:06:00 And he knows that he can solve any problem we’re facing
00:06:03 as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.
00:06:06 He knows our whole eternal lives are ahead of us.
00:06:10 So he comforts us; he listens to our heartfelt prayers.
00:06:14 And like a kind parent, he’s telling us
00:06:16 (through our brothers, the Bible, and holy spirit),
00:06:20 ‘You will live.’
00:06:22 Jehovah is happy because right now, what can he do?
00:06:26 He can comfort us and help us.
00:06:28 Well, what is the lesson for us?
00:06:30 We can comfort and help others.
00:06:33 We’re, really, kind of all in this “lifeboat” together,
00:06:36 trying to make it to the “new-world shore,”
00:06:38 and we can help one another.
00:06:41 Third, his hand is patiently waiting
00:06:45 for the right time to act.
00:06:47 Jehovah is waiting patiently
00:06:50 for the complete vindication of his sovereignty.
00:06:52 I really love what the June 2017 Watchtower  article
00:06:56 “Keep Your Eyes on the Big Issue” said:
00:06:59 “Let us not become so absorbed in our own lives
00:07:02 “that we lose sight of this big issue
00:07:05 “—the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:07:08 “And let us appreciate that our role in this vital issue
00:07:11 “entails remaining faithful
00:07:13 even under difficult circumstances.”
00:07:17 Isn’t that a beautiful quote to think about?
00:07:20 Jehovah knows that by his being patient now,
00:07:23 he and all his faithful servants will never have to go through this again.
00:07:27 The issue of sovereignty will be completely settled.
00:07:32 Don’t you admire Jehovah’s patience?
00:07:35 I mean, to watch all that is happening
00:07:37 and to have the self-control to wait for the appointed time
00:07:42 is truly an example of patience in action.
00:07:46 When we think about the different situations
00:07:49 our brothers and sisters and others face
00:07:51 —when a mother, for example,
00:07:53 watches a handicapped son struggle to walk or to talk
00:07:57 or a husband watches his wife struggle to breathe—
00:08:01 we want so much at that moment
00:08:04 to press that big, red, “start-the-new-world” button now.
00:08:09 But when you have that feeling,
00:08:11 remember our text for today:
00:08:14 “The hand of Jehovah will become known to his servants.”
00:08:21 What is the lesson for us?
00:08:23 We need to be patient
00:08:25 and keep our eyes on the big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:08:30 So let’s just review those three points.
00:08:33 How can we see Jehovah’s hand
00:08:36 and be happy when we see all of this suffering around us?
00:08:40 Well, we can be happy knowing
00:08:42 what Jehovah and Jesus and the resurrected anointed
00:08:45 are doing right now to prepare for the new world.
00:08:48 And we can be happy because we have a role
00:08:51 in comforting and helping others.
00:08:54 And we can be happy being patient,
00:08:58 knowing why we’re being patient.
00:09:00 We have our eyes on that big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:09:06 We may not always be able to see Jehovah’s hand,
00:09:09 but we can be sure, as our text for today says,
00:09:13 that Jehovah’s hand is there, and it will become known.

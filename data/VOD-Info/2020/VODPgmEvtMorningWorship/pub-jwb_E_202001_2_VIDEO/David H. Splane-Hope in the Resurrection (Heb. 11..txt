00:00:01 I’d like to invite you to take your booklet
00:00:04 Examining the Scriptures
00:00:07 and focus on the second to the last
00:00:10 sentence in our comment.
00:00:12 There’s quite a lot in there.
00:00:15 So that’s our November 8 comment,
00:00:18 the second to the last sentence.
00:00:20 It says: “Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
00:00:25 “and others like them believed in the resurrection of the dead
00:00:31 “and looked forward to life on earth under God’s Kingdom,
00:00:36 ‘the city having real foundations.’”
00:00:41 Well, there’s a lot there.
00:00:43 Let’s take it apart
00:00:45 and see how we can confirm
00:00:48 each one of those statements that’s made.
00:00:51 What about the first statement?
00:00:53 “Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
00:00:56 and others like them believed in the resurrection of the dead.”
00:01:01 Now, that’s a pretty strong statement.
00:01:05 We don’t see a clear teaching of the resurrection in the book of Genesis.
00:01:11 But just because Genesis doesn’t mention it
00:01:14 doesn’t mean that these faithful men of old didn’t know about the resurrection.
00:01:19 The apostle Paul tells us that they were all looking forward to a reward
00:01:24 —a reward that they would receive,
00:01:27 not in their lifetime, but in the future.
00:01:30 And that would require a resurrection.
00:01:34 Now, the comment mentions Enoch.
00:01:36 What do we know about him?
00:01:38 Turn to Hebrews chapter 11, and leave your Bibles open there, please,
00:01:43 because we’re going to be reading several verses in Hebrews.
00:01:46 Hebrews 11,
00:01:48 Hebrews 11:5,
00:01:53 it says: “By faith
00:01:55 “Enoch was transferred so as not to see death,
00:01:59 “and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him;
00:02:04 “for before he was transferred
00:02:08 “[that is, just before he died]
00:02:11 he received the witness that he had pleased God well.”
00:02:16 So at the end of his life, he is told that he has pleased God well.
00:02:20 And then what? No reward?
00:02:23 That doesn’t make sense.
00:02:25 Now, the clergy of Christendom don’t believe that Enoch
00:02:29 needed a resurrection because they don’t believe he died.
00:02:33 They focused on Paul’s words
00:02:35 that Enoch was transferred
00:02:38 and he did not see death.
00:02:41 But the fact is that Enoch did die.
00:02:45 How do we know?
00:02:47 Paul says so.
00:02:49 Look at verse 5; we’re talking about Enoch.
00:02:53 Look at verse 7; he’s talking about Noah.
00:02:57 Verse 8: Abraham.
00:02:59 Verse 11: Sarah.
00:03:02 Now, look at verse 13:
00:03:04 “In faith all [all ] of these died.”
00:03:09 Well, that would include Enoch, wouldn’t it?
00:03:12 So Enoch did die.
00:03:14 Well, when it says “he was transferred,”
00:03:17 does it mean that he went to heaven after he died?
00:03:20 Well, when was he baptized?
00:03:24 He couldn’t get to heaven if he wasn’t baptized.
00:03:28 When was Abraham baptized?
00:03:30 Noah? Moses?
00:03:32 Jesus said:
00:03:34 ‘Unless anyone is born of water and spirit,
00:03:38 he cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven.’
00:03:40 Well, come to think of it, none of these faithful men of old were baptized.
00:03:44 None of them were born of water and spirit, so none of them could get to heaven.
00:03:49 So that confirms the second part of our comment,
00:03:53 where it says that they “looked forward to life on earth
00:03:57 under God’s Kingdom,”
00:03:59 because they were not born again.
00:04:03 So they would have life on earth.
00:04:07 So we have covered, really, the first two parts of our comment:
00:04:11 the fact that these men did believe in the resurrection
00:04:15 and that they were going to be resurrected to life on earth.
00:04:20 But, wait a minute, how do we know that they believed in a resurrection?
00:04:25 Let’s look at verse 13 again,
00:04:27 and this time we’re going to emphasize a little different word.
00:04:33 Verse 13:
00:04:35 “In faith
00:04:38 [in faith] all of these died.”
00:04:42 Now, what’s Paul’s definition of “faith”?
00:04:46 In the same chapter, he says that the one who has faith
00:04:50 ‘believes that God is the rewarder
00:04:54 of those who are earnestly seeking him.’
00:04:57 So when Paul says that ‘all of these men died in faith,’
00:05:00 he means that when they died, they were looking forward to a reward
00:05:05 —that God was going to become their rewarder.
00:05:09 Well, in order for that to take place,
00:05:11 they would have to have a resurrection, wouldn’t they?
00:05:14 What about Abraham?
00:05:16 He believed in the resurrection, although he never saw one.
00:05:20 Paul mentions that in verses 17-19.
00:05:25 Paul says: “By faith Abraham,
00:05:29 “when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac
00:05:33 “—the man who had gladly received the promises attempted
00:05:36 “to offer up his only-begotten son —although it had been said to him:
00:05:41 “‘What will be called your offspring will be through Isaac.’
00:05:44 “But he reasoned [he reasoned]
00:05:48 “that God was able to raise him up even from the dead
00:05:53 “[he reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead],
00:05:58 and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.”
00:06:04 But how do we know that Abraham believed in the resurrection?
00:06:09 On what basis can Paul say that Abraham ‘reasoned
00:06:13 that God was able to resurrect Isaac’?
00:06:17 What would you say?
00:06:20 The key is in verse 18.
00:06:24 God said to Abraham:
00:06:26 “What will be called your offspring
00:06:30 will be through Isaac.”
00:06:34 In other words, Abraham’s descendants were going to come through Isaac,
00:06:39 and at the time that Abraham attempted to offer Isaac,
00:06:42 Isaac didn’t have any offspring.
00:06:45 God’s Word had to come true.
00:06:47 When God said that “your offspring will be through Isaac,” it had to come true.
00:06:52 And so if God allowed Abraham to go through with the sacrifice,
00:06:57 he would have to resurrect Isaac
00:07:01 because ‘God cannot lie.’
00:07:04 Now, there’s a third part of our comment that we were looking at,
00:07:08 and it says that God’s Kingdom
00:07:10 is “the city having real foundations.”
00:07:14 But since when is a city a kingdom?
00:07:19 Why do we draw that conclusion?
00:07:22 Well, when you come to think of it,
00:07:24 even today there are independent nations or kingdoms
00:07:28 that are cities:
00:07:30 Monaco, Singapore,
00:07:34 Gibraltar, Vatican City.
00:07:38 But go further in Bible times;
00:07:40 a lot of cities were kingdoms.
00:07:43 We read about the king of Salem,
00:07:45 the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah.
00:07:48 These were cities, but the cities had kings.
00:07:51 So Paul’s listeners or readers would have understood
00:07:55 (when he said they were “awaiting the city having real foundations”)
00:07:59 that this was a kingdom.
00:08:02 Now, Paul makes another powerful point in verse 35,
00:08:05 when we talk about whether these faithful men of old
00:08:07 knew about the resurrection or not.
00:08:10 In verse 35, he says:
00:08:12 “Women received their dead by resurrection,
00:08:16 “but other men were tortured
00:08:18 “because they would not accept release by some ransom,
00:08:22 in order that they might attain a better resurrection.”
00:08:27 That makes sense, doesn’t it?
00:08:29 Why would anybody accept to be tortured to death
00:08:33 if he didn’t believe in a better life?
00:08:36 So these men accepted to be persecuted and tortured
00:08:40 because they knew that something else —something better—was coming,
00:08:44 and that would require a resurrection.
00:08:47 So we can heartily agree
00:08:50 with all of the points that are made
00:08:52 in this second to the last sentence of our comment today:
00:08:55 “Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham and others like them
00:09:00 “believed in the resurrection of the dead
00:09:03 “and looked forward to life on earth under God’s Kingdom,
00:09:07 ‘the city having real foundations.’”

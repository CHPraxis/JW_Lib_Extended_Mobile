What would you say

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is the biggest single emotion

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:08.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
gripping people today?

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:10.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, many would readily agree

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:12.796 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s fear.

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:15.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, in 1982, the book

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>You Can Live Forever</i>
<i>in Paradise on Earth</i> said this:

00:00:18.802 --> 00:00:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fear is probably the biggest single emotion

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in people’s lives today.”

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that comment by
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was based on Jesus’ words

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in giving us a sign about the last days.

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:38.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that in addition
to wars, earthquakes,

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food shortages, and epidemics,

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:11, the Bible tells us

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:47.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus included “fearful sights,”

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “terrifying events,”
as indicated in the <i>Study Bible.</i>

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:54.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 21:26,

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:59.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you recall the emotion that Jesus said
would overwhelm God’s enemies

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they looked ahead
in the near future

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seeing the sign of “the Son of man”?

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be fear.

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:
“People will become faint out of fear

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expectation of the things coming
upon the inhabited earth.”

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about us as Jehovah’s people?

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a group, we are nowhere near

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being “faint out of fear,”

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:30.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will we be as things worsen

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we approach the great tribulation.

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply put, it’s because
Jehovah has prepared us

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain calm

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when bad things happen in the world
or in our personal lives.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about one way
Jehovah prepared us

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the year 2020.

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:53.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was by giving us in the year 2019

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the yeartext at Isaiah 41:10.

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our study of that yeartext last year,

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:05.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were reminded that a key
to not giving way to fear

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to meditate on
the three faith-building promises

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contained in Isaiah 41:10.

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at it again, please,
in <i>Examining the Scriptures.</i>

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the three promises?

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jehovah will be with us;

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, he is our God;

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and third, he will help us.

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:31.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This morning, to illustrate

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reliability of those three guarantees,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll consider some delightful experiences.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, consider, please,

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:42.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the experience of a sister we’ll call Anna

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:46.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is in prison for her faith.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna’s cellmate noticed

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Anna was not able to reply

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:54.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all the letters of encouragement
that she was receiving.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this experience was compiled
last November,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know how many letters
our sister had received?

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:04.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 1,700.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So her cellmate in a friendly way

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered to be Anna’s secretary.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Anna, this cellmate agreed

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would read
each letter very carefully

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:18.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then consult with Anna
about how to respond.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She became so good at the job

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:25.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she even would respond
to letters by herself.

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Anna’s circumstances in prison
were not ideal.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, a prison guard
conducted an inspection of the cell

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:38.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked Anna to give him her Bible.

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She begged him not to take it away,

00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:43.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did anyway.

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna started to cry.

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then something unexpected happened.

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surprisingly, Anna’s other cellmates

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started making a lot of noise
and began beating on the cell doors

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding that the Bible
be returned immediately to Anna.

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told the guard,
“To Anna the Bible

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more important than food”

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:08.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had regularly
seen her reading that Bible.

00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, the guard returned
the Bible to our sister.

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Anna confronted another test in jail.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of the prisoners in her cell
were in jail for criminal activity,

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:25.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were singing Gypsy songs one day

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their criminal life.

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:30.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though our sister
did not completely understand

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the language they were using,

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she suspected that their singing

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
included some vulgar speech.

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, Anna prayed to Jehovah

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:43.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked that he correct the situation.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, something unexpected happened.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, one of the Gypsy women
began singing one of our Kingdom songs.

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:52.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna was shocked.

00:04:52.442 --> 00:04:54.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She asked,
“How do you know this song?”

00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Anna joined her
in finishing the song.

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it turned out,
this Gypsy woman’s mother

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had studied the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and during that time
her daughter who is now in prison

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had memorized the Kingdom song.

00:05:10.927 --> 00:05:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna said that this experience was proof

00:05:14.097 --> 00:05:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah responds very quickly to prayers

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he can even use non-Witnesses
to encourage his servants.

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
in thinking about the promise

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Isaiah 41:10,

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can there be any doubt

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is with Anna

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with all of our imprisoned
brothers and sisters at this time?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when cut off from family and friends,

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives his servants his full affection

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and attention.

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second experience received last July

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights the fact that Jehovah is our God,

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second assurance in Isaiah 41:10.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother we will call Peter reported this,
and I quote:

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:06.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During the first few months of imprisonment,
I was placed in solitary confinement.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt downhearted and began to dream of
a shepherding visit.

00:06:11.187 --> 00:06:13.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I thought about how good it would be

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to talk with two brothers in ties.

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I had heard that in some congregations
when someone received a shepherding visit,

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:25.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they would say, after the fact,
that ‘the ties’ came to visit me.

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I too wanted such a visit,
so I prayed:

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah, I understand
that this is practically impossible now,

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I want “the ties” to come visit me.’”

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:40.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter goes on to state:

00:06:40.516 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After a short time,
I received a letter with a card.

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:47.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The card was made in the form of

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pink shirt with a yellow tie.”

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see it on the monitors.

00:06:52.962 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the card,” Peter said,

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were the words from the song
<i>Shepherds—Gifts in Men,</i>

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our song 103.”

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:07.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters, can you imagine
how Peter felt at that moment?

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he view Jehovah?

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continues:
“This was the answer to my prayer.

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:15.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A real shepherding visit.

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This encouraged me more than
I could have imagined.

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was one of the best days
during that difficult time.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With tears, I thanked Jehovah
for his support.

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw tangible evidence of Jehovah’s care
for my emotional needs.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will keep this card
as a treasured memento.”

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do we see how Jehovah
proved true to that second assurance?

00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:40.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am your God.”

00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:42.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered Peter’s need

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an unexpected but very tender way.

00:07:46.682 --> 00:07:49.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In discussing this part of Isaiah 41:10,

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i> acknowledged
that now more than ever

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:55.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to remember who is in control.

00:07:55.158 --> 00:08:00.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People around us are in fear
because so many things seem out of control.

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:04.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we’re affected by
the same problems that affect other people,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know, based on Jehovah’s assurances,

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:11.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there’s no need for us to be afraid.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problems people face today

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are like the strong winds
that might rock an airplane during flight.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some passengers naturally panic.

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do we remain calm?

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we know who our pilot is.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah our God.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider one more experience
that connects well with Isaiah 41:10,

00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah says:
“I will help you.”

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Illinois, we have a dear anointed sister

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the name of Antonia,
who is 90 years old.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is homebound
and does not have a mobile device

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:48.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor access to the Internet.

00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:51.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Due to the pandemic,
she was very nervous about

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being home alone
last week for the Memorial.

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did Jehovah help Antonia?

00:08:57.687 --> 00:09:00.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation worked out a plan

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:03.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she could observe the Memorial
with another sister present

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without risking their health.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patty, a close friend,
offered to assist Antonia

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if it would be safe to do so.

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a doctor was consulted,
and he provided detailed instructions

00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:18.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would keep both sisters safe,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included the use of gloves and masks

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sanitizing the plate and the cup
that would be used for the emblems.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the plan was presented
to our sister Antonia,

00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was asked
if she would like Patty to assist.

00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She replied,
“With all my heart.”

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our two sisters listened together

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:41.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Memorial talk last week.

00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Antonia partook of the emblems
with tears in her eyes.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With heartfelt emotion she said,

00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I pray to Jehovah to help me

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay worthy and faithful.”

00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
these true-to-life experiences

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are heartwarming, aren’t they?

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what Jehovah has done
for Anna, Peter, and Antonia

00:10:05.121 --> 00:10:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves what <i>The Watchtower</i> said,
and I quote:

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No force in the universe
can make Jehovah abandon his love

00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who serve him;
his loyalty to us is unshakable.”

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, would you like to strengthen
your confidence in Jehovah,

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God and our Father?

00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:28.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, why not meditate deeply
on Isaiah 41:10?

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If possible, commit those verses to memory.

00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:36.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s keep working
to get to know Jehovah better

00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by regularly reading 

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible carefully and meditating
on what we read.

00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:44.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, as we face trials together,

00:10:44.126 --> 00:10:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll move ahead with full confidence
that Jehovah is with us.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll do so with faith, not fear.

00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:03.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
All of us recognize 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.622 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the last days are going “from bad to worse.”

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:06.856 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told us that it

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was going to be the case.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:12.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And so, wickedness is just

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:14.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so prevalent now.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:15.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m one who has always liked to keep up

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the news.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to find out how things are

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers
in certain parts of the world

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for instance, Hurricane Florence.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s filled with all this other garbage.

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, last night I started
(for about three minutes)

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching the 6:30 p.m. news
and I said, “Forget it.”

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just filled with it.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the subject that we’re going to have
a discussion about this morning,

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while sobering
(I hope you find it encouraging)

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I thought we’d discuss
the final end of God’s enemies.

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it can be very encouraging,
albeit sobering.

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to help us with it,
there’s a beautiful expression

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in the 37th Psalm

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so find that 37th Psalm.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:11.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how encouraging

00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meditate on this beautiful verse

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 20:

00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the wicked will perish;

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the enemies of Jehovah
will vanish like glorious pastures;

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will vanish like smoke.”

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So since they’re Jehovah’s enemies

00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:34.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah is our best Friend,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that means they’re our enemies.

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we look forward to

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these enemies of Jehovah, our enemies,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘vanishing like smoke’!

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in 1919,

00:01:48.758 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah brought “the Israel of God” into
his favored position,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then, as we know,
historically in the 1930’s,

00:01:56.232 --> 00:02:01.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the emphasis went toward
the “great crowd” of “other sheep.”

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been flocking to his side,

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:07.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are millions and millions
that are on Jehovah’s side.

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:12.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it just emphasizes
the righteousness of his sovereignty.

00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, all of this growth

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the advances in this organization

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:20.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the earthly part that we’re discussing—

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it infuriates Satan the Devil,

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:25.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just infuriates him.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And hence, how we look forward to

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the end of Jehovah’s chief enemy

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as all the other enemies
that are under his influence!

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting 
that the <i>Isaiah’s Prophecy</i> book

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had some sobering comments.

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And find, if you would, please,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very last chapter of Isaiah

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:51.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the very last verse in Isaiah

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah 66—

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 24:

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they will go out and look on
the carcasses of the men

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who rebelled against me;

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:10.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the worms on them will not die,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and their fire will not be extinguished,

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:17.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will become
something repulsive to all people.”

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s making reference to all of these

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who rebel against Jehovah God
—his enemies.

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what makes this even more of an impact

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the fact that Christ Jesus
likely had this verse in mind

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he said these well-known words

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well-known to
Jehovah’s Witnesses anyway—

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mark chapter 9.

00:03:41.938 --> 00:03:44.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Mark chapter 9,

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is a very clear warning

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all who would want
to stay friends of Jehovah God.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verses 47 and 48:

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And if your eye makes you stumble,
throw it away.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is better for you to enter one-eyed
into the Kingdom of God

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:10.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than to be thrown with two eyes
into Gehenna,

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where the maggot does not die

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the fire is not put out.”

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Christendom will twist

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these inspired thoughts of our Master,
Christ Jesus,

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s very clear.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll notice
that the cross-reference scripture

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:32.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of verse 48 is Isaiah 66:24.

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus likely had that particular thought
from Isaiah in mind.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:42.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the warning
—the final end of God’s enemies

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:46.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he feels about them.

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is this place called Gehenna?

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to review it a little bit,

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:56.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Isaiah’s Prophecy</i> book
had some fine thoughts

00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:59.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to aid us with this.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:03.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They quote this Jewish scholar,
who wrote (and quoting him):

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is a place . . . adjoining Jerusalem,

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:09.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it is a loathsome place,

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they throw there
unclean things and carcasses.

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also there was a continual fire there

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to burn the unclean things
and the bones of the carcasses.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is called parabolically Gehinnom,”

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ending his quote.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the <i>Isaiah’s Prophecy</i> book mentions:

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, as this Jewish scholar suggests,

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Gehenna was used for
the disposal of refuse

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:41.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and carcasses of those
deemed unworthy of burial,

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“fire would be a suitable means
of eliminating such refuse.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now this is the point:]

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:53.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the fire did not consume,
the maggots would.”

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I don’t know if you
know much about maggots,

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if you see a whole bunch of them,

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just not a pleasant sight.

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a fitting picture

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the final end of all of God’s enemies

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—sobering, yet something
we look forward to!

00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the apostates
and the enemies of Jehovah would say:

00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, that’s gruesome; that’s despicable.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You teach your people these things?”

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:26.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, God teaches his people these things.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what he’s foretelling.

00:06:28.571 --> 00:06:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And frankly, for friends of Jehovah God,
how reassuring

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re finally going to be gone

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all these despicable enemies

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have just reproached Jehovah’s name—

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
destroyed, never ever to live again!

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s not that we rejoice in
someone’s death,

00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when it comes to God’s enemies,

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finally they’re out of the way

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially these despicable apostates,

00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:58.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who at one point had dedicated
their life to God

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they joined forces
with Satan the Devil,

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the chief apostate of all time.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we eagerly await

00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:12.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah bringing his enemies to their end,

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s a very sobering point
from James chapter 4 that you’ll remember.

00:07:16.652 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find James

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what he writes here

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—James chapter 4.

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And James, of course, Jehovah
used him and inspired him,

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’s always nice and direct.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t read James and go away saying,
“I wonder what he meant by that?”

00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very clear, verse 4:

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Adulteresses, do you not know

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that friendship with the world
is enmity with God?

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:54.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever, therefore, wants to be
a friend of the world

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is making himself an enemy of God.”

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:02.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what a clear warning!

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:05.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to have any friendship

—whether socially or on social networks—

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s enemies.

00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:14.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not friends of the world.
We’re Jehovah’s friends.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re looking at him

00:08:17.713 --> 00:08:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our closest and most precious Friend.

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we never would want Jehovah to view us

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an enemy.

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion, let’s go back to

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that opening Psalm that we looked at here,

00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to help this verse stay in your mind
—we hope.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 20, just to emphasize this:

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the wicked will perish;
the enemies of Jehovah

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will vanish like glorious pastures;

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:53.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[particularly] they will <i>vanish like smoke</i>.”

00:08:53.783 --> 00:08:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just thought this would be
a nice memory aid

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that this verse stays in your mind.

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:02.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is what Jehovah is promising:

00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah’s enemies

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they’re going to “vanish like smoke”!

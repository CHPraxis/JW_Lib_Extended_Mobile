00:00:01 All of us recognize
00:00:03 the last days are going “from bad to worse.”
00:00:05 Jehovah told us that it
00:00:06 was going to be the case.
00:00:08 And so, wickedness is just
00:00:12 so prevalent now.
00:00:14 I’m one who has always liked to keep up
00:00:15 with the news.
00:00:18 I like to find out how things are
00:00:20 with our brothers in certain parts of the world
00:00:23 —for instance, Hurricane Florence.
00:00:26 But it’s filled with all this other garbage.
00:00:30 In fact, last night I started (for about three minutes)
00:00:33 watching the 6:30 p.m. news and I said, “Forget it.”
00:00:36 It’s just filled with it.
00:00:39 So the subject that we’re going to have a discussion about this morning,
00:00:44 while sobering (I hope you find it encouraging)
00:00:48 —I thought we’d discuss the final end of God’s enemies.
00:00:53 So it can be very encouraging, albeit sobering.
00:00:58 And to help us with it, there’s a beautiful expression
00:01:01 here in the 37th Psalm
00:01:04 —so find that 37th Psalm.
00:01:08 And how encouraging
00:01:11 to meditate on this beautiful verse
00:01:14 —verse 20:
00:01:17 “But the wicked will perish;
00:01:19 “the enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures;
00:01:24 they will vanish like smoke.”
00:01:28 So since they’re Jehovah’s enemies
00:01:31 and Jehovah is our best Friend,
00:01:34 that means they’re our enemies.
00:01:37 How we look forward to
00:01:39 these enemies of Jehovah, our enemies,
00:01:43 ‘vanishing like smoke’!
00:01:46 Now, in 1919,
00:01:48 Jehovah brought “the Israel of God” into his favored position,
00:01:53 and then, as we know, historically in the 1930’s,
00:01:56 the emphasis went toward the “great crowd” of “other sheep.”
00:02:01 They’ve been flocking to his side,
00:02:03 and there are millions and millions that are on Jehovah’s side.
00:02:07 And it just emphasizes the righteousness of his sovereignty.
00:02:12 However, all of this growth
00:02:15 and the advances in this organization
00:02:17 —the earthly part that we’re discussing—
00:02:20 it infuriates Satan the Devil,
00:02:23 just infuriates him.
00:02:25 And hence, how we look forward to
00:02:28 the end of Jehovah’s chief enemy
00:02:31 as well as all the other enemies that are under his influence!
00:02:35 Now, it’s interesting  that the Isaiah’s Prophecy book
00:02:39 had some sobering comments.
00:02:41 And find, if you would, please,
00:02:44 the very last chapter of Isaiah
00:02:46 and the very last verse in Isaiah
00:02:52 —Isaiah 66—
00:02:55 and we’re going to read verse 24:
00:03:00 “And they will go out and look on the carcasses of the men
00:03:04 “who rebelled against me;
00:03:06 “for the worms on them will not die,
00:03:10 “and their fire will not be extinguished,
00:03:13 and they will become something repulsive to all people.”
00:03:17 So it’s making reference to all of these
00:03:19 who rebel against Jehovah God —his enemies.
00:03:24 Now, what makes this even more of an impact
00:03:28 is the fact that Christ Jesus likely had this verse in mind
00:03:33 when he said these well-known words
00:03:35 —well-known to Jehovah’s Witnesses anyway—
00:03:38 in Mark chapter 9.
00:03:41 Find Mark chapter 9,
00:03:46 and this is a very clear warning
00:03:51 for all who would want to stay friends of Jehovah God.
00:03:56 Notice verses 47 and 48:
00:04:00 “And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away.
00:04:03 “It is better for you to enter one-eyed into the Kingdom of God
00:04:07 “than to be thrown with two eyes into Gehenna,
00:04:10 “where the maggot does not die
00:04:13 and the fire is not put out.”
00:04:17 Of course, Christendom will twist
00:04:19 these inspired thoughts of our Master, Christ Jesus,
00:04:23 but it’s very clear.
00:04:25 And you’ll notice that the cross-reference scripture
00:04:28 at the end of verse 48 is Isaiah 66:24.
00:04:32 So Jesus likely had that particular thought from Isaiah in mind.
00:04:37 And here’s the warning —the final end of God’s enemies
00:04:42 and how he feels about them.
00:04:46 Now, what is this place called Gehenna?
00:04:50 Just to review it a little bit,
00:04:52 the Isaiah’s Prophecy book had some fine thoughts
00:04:56 to aid us with this.
00:04:59 They quote this Jewish scholar, who wrote (and quoting him):
00:05:03 “It is a place . . . adjoining Jerusalem,
00:05:06 “and it is a loathsome place,
00:05:09 “and they throw there unclean things and carcasses.
00:05:12 “Also there was a continual fire there
00:05:15 “to burn the unclean things and the bones of the carcasses.
00:05:19 “Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones
00:05:22 is called parabolically Gehinnom,”
00:05:25 ending his quote.
00:05:27 So the Isaiah’s Prophecy book mentions:
00:05:30 “If, as this Jewish scholar suggests,
00:05:34 “Gehenna was used for the disposal of refuse
00:05:38 “and carcasses of those deemed unworthy of burial,
00:05:41 “fire would be a suitable means of eliminating such refuse.
00:05:46 “[Now this is the point:]
00:05:48 What the fire did not consume, the maggots would.”
00:05:53 Now, I don’t know if you know much about maggots,
00:05:56 but if you see a whole bunch of them,
00:05:59 it’s just not a pleasant sight.
00:06:04 But what a fitting picture
00:06:06 of the final end of all of God’s enemies
00:06:10 —sobering, yet something we look forward to!
00:06:13 However, the apostates and the enemies of Jehovah would say:
00:06:17 “Well, that’s gruesome; that’s despicable.
00:06:20 You teach your people these things?”
00:06:22 No, God teaches his people these things.
00:06:26 This is what he’s foretelling.
00:06:28 And frankly, for friends of Jehovah God, how reassuring
00:06:32 that they’re finally going to be gone
00:06:34 —all these despicable enemies
00:06:37 who have just reproached Jehovah’s name—
00:06:40 destroyed, never ever to live again!
00:06:44 Now, it’s not that we rejoice in someone’s death,
00:06:48 but when it comes to God’s enemies,
00:06:51 finally they’re out of the way
00:06:53 —especially these despicable apostates,
00:06:55 who at one point had dedicated their life to God
00:06:58 and then they joined forces with Satan the Devil,
00:07:02 the chief apostate of all time.
00:07:06 So while we eagerly await
00:07:08 Jehovah bringing his enemies to their end,
00:07:12 here’s a very sobering point from James chapter 4 that you’ll remember.
00:07:16 Let’s find James
00:07:20 and what he writes here
00:07:23 —James chapter 4.
00:07:28 And James, of course, Jehovah used him and inspired him,
00:07:32 but he’s always nice and direct.
00:07:34 You don’t read James and go away saying, “I wonder what he meant by that?”
00:07:38 It’s very clear, verse 4:
00:07:43 “Adulteresses, do you not know
00:07:46 “that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
00:07:50 “Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world
00:07:54 is making himself an enemy of God.”
00:07:59 So, what a clear warning!
00:08:02 We don’t want to have any friendship
00:08:05 —whether socially or on social networks—
00:08:08 with Jehovah’s enemies.
00:08:11 We’re not friends of the world. We’re Jehovah’s friends.
00:08:14 We’re looking at him
00:08:17 as our closest and most precious Friend.
00:08:20 And we never would want Jehovah to view us
00:08:24 as an enemy.
00:08:26 So in conclusion, let’s go back to
00:08:29 that opening Psalm that we looked at here,
00:08:34 just to help this verse stay in your mind —we hope.
00:08:38 Verse 20, just to emphasize this:
00:08:43 “But the wicked will perish; the enemies of Jehovah
00:08:46 “will vanish like glorious pastures;
00:08:48 [particularly] they will vanish like smoke.”
00:08:53 So I just thought this would be a nice memory aid
00:08:58 so that this verse stays in your mind.
00:09:00 Here is what Jehovah is promising:
00:09:12 That was Jehovah’s enemies
00:09:15 —they’re going to “vanish like smoke”!

Usually,

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:04.754 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the language that we learned

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from infancy becomes

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the language of the heart,

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:12.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we learn it at home.

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In most cases, the dominant influence

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:17.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our life in connection
with our language of the heart,

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:20.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the first language, is our mother.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s precisely what took place

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:26.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Israel in the days of Nehemiah.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the mothers in this case were pagans

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing their language and probably
their beliefs with their children.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a lot of Jewish men
—prominent Jewish men—

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had married pagan women.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the scripture together

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Nehemiah 13:23, 24

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Nehemiah 13:23, 24.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “In those days I also saw Jews

00:00:57.073 --> 00:01:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who had married Ashdodite, Ammonite,

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Moabite women.

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Half of their sons were speaking Ashdodite

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and half spoke the language
of the different peoples,

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but none of them

00:01:10.186 --> 00:01:13.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew how to speak the language of the Jews.”

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as was stated,
it’s very likely that those mothers

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:21.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be teaching the children

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about their land, their culture,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their worship,
and the pagan gods they worshipped.

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:29.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the decision was made

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Jews themselves,

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they were counseled and given direction

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Ezra and from Nehemiah,

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to send those wives away
along with the children.

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s an interesting thing.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have been a bit difficult

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some husbands to see
their children sent away.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all they knew were
the languages of the pagan wives

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:55.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nothing about Hebrew
and the worship of Jehovah God.

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:58.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the problem was
that they were sent away to keep the Jews

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from losing their identity
by a gradual assimilation into the cultures

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the religions of the surrounding nations
that those wives belonged to.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Nehemiah’s day, speaking Hebrew was vital,

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re grateful it’s not necessary today.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all don’t have to learn Hebrew.

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:22.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in his wisdom, Jehovah
invites people who speak any language

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn the “pure language,”
the truth about him and his purposes.

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, it’s a bit like the opposite

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what took place at the Tower of Babel,

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:37.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah intervened and confused
the builders of the Tower of Babel,

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imposing upon them different languages,
including different ways of thinking.

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:46.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they went off disorganized
and separated from one another.

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, we have people
from all over the world

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who speak many, many different languages,

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in Jehovah’s wisdom,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s bringing them all together

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those who love the truth and love him—
in unity.

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:03.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Zephaniah says
—Zephaniah 3:9.

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of the “pure language”:

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:11.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I shall give to peoples
the change to a pure language,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for them all
to call upon the name of Jehovah.”

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what these people do
who speak other languages.

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reach them with the truth,
but then they’re unified

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s organization,

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it goes on to say
“in order to serve him

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:27.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shoulder to shoulder.”

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t that interesting—the way Jehovah
has used the “pure language”

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:34.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring people of many diverse backgrounds

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:36.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and languages together in his worship?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our day,
people of many different languages

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are leaving their home countries
to live elsewhere.

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really quite amazing
when you consider:

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Large cities are filled with people

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different languages,
and even in little villages,

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:55.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find people speaking different languages.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need help to learn the truth

00:03:58.254 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting to note how many Bethelites

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:10.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have learned other languages
in order to teach the truth to people.

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the United States Bethel, in our branch,

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:18.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are over 2,500 Bethelites

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are engaged

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:25.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 24 different language groups
and congregations.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:29.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a lot of Bethelites (and commuters
are included in those numbers)

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing a very fine work

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping people
in the territory to learn the truth.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:39.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wouldn’t it be nice— I know some of us
would love to learn some other languages

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—wouldn’t it be lovely
if we could learn the way a child does?

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just absorb it
—no effort—

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they start speaking it.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A researcher, Dr. John Brierley, says this:

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Clearly the young brain seems

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be programmed almost like a computer’ 

00:04:54.677 --> 00:04:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for language development.

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He notes that even ‘brain anatomy’ suggests

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that an infant is born

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:06.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a pre-programmed
biological capacity to speak.’”

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the comment in <i>Awake!</i>  said

00:05:09.492 --> 00:05:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s as though the brain is hardwired

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:14.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn language.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry to say that as the years go by,

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hardwiring starts
to fray a bit in many of us.

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we make the effort 

00:05:27.543 --> 00:05:32.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we do make a switch to a congregation
where they speak the language

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you would like to learn, remember this:

00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children can be
a big help in the congregation

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you attend in a foreign language.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can also be very startling and frank:

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You speak funny.

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why can’t you pronounce that word properly?

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so easy.”

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:51.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, yes, to <i>you </i> it’s easy.

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were raised with it.’

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:54.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s how kids are.

00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t realize the difficulties we have 

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get older, 
with the grooves being so deep

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so thick in the brain
with our original language

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s hard to get out
of those grooves the vowels and consonants

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re not used 
to saying in a certain order.

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep a sense of humor; listen to the kids.

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:15.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll help you.

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t be overly concerned

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about speaking a new language
without an accent.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everybody has an accent one way or another.

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are more agreeable than others,
but everyone has that.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some don’t want to admit it,
but they really do.

00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have an accent.

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when we all speak the same language,
you can tell where a person is from

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:40.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’s east, north, west
(whatever it may be), south.

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are accents or intonations
in the way words are pronounced.

00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:47.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember, in years gone by,
for missionaries

00:06:47.356 --> 00:06:49.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were sent out into the field,

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:53.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had to follow a special program
in learning a new language.

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:55.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your first month in your new assignment,

00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you had to study 11 hours a day

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 30 days your new language.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you felt like you were
in the Tower of Babel

00:07:03.473 --> 00:07:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on those occasions
because it was very difficult.

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second month,
you had to study your new language

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four hours a day
and be out preaching 130 hours.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your third month
was 150 hours in the field ministry,

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’d study the language as you could.

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:21.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who are striving
to learn a new language,

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:26.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here are a few suggestions I gleaned
from the <i>Awake!</i>  of March 2007

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the January issue of 2000.

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are four points:

00:07:31.567 --> 00:07:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) motivation,

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) humility,

00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) patience,

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(4) practice. 

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Motivation.</i>

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need an incentive
—a reason to pursue your goal.”

00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if you have
a high level of motivation,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to be more successful.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have the best motivation there is:

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teach people the truth;
praise our God, Jehovah;

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:58.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build up the congregation
we’ve chosen to attend.

00:07:58.594 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about humility?

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “don’t expect too much of yourself”
when you start learning a new language.

00:08:06.102 --> 00:08:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mistakes are inevitable.”

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:11.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you wait
until you can speak it perfectly

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you start making
comments or give a talk,

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may be waiting quite a while.

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:19.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be prepared, because it may not be

00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until after Armageddon
that you achieve that goal.

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t be afraid to make mistakes
and carry on with your new language.

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:29.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘Patience.</i>

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:32.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A brother stated: “For me,
the first two years were difficult,

00:08:32.828 --> 00:08:35.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and at times I felt like giving up.”

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Still, he acknowledges

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it does get easier as time goes by.’

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it gets enjoyable.

00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:45.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And number four: <i>“Practice.</i>

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:49.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A regular routine will help you
to become fluent in [your] new language.

00:08:49.912 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Try to practice every day,
even if it’s for just a few minutes.

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[There’s an interesting saying]
As one textbook puts it,

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“A little and often”

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:02.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is preferable to “a lot but seldom.”’”

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:04.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be steady,

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for short periods of time,
in practicing the new language.

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fact is
that most Bethelites in our branch

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are serving in the English-language field,

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:17.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are truly a blessing
to their congregations.

00:09:17.707 --> 00:09:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers are happy
to have Bethelites who take the lead,

00:09:21.877 --> 00:09:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who give of themselves, and who work hard
to build up the congregation.

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the decision to serve
in an English congregation

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with a different language group
is highly personal.

00:09:33.856 --> 00:09:37.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the decision may be,
there’s a key factor

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we all have to keep in mind

00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain our spirituality at a high level 

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give our Bethel assignment our best.

00:09:46.636 --> 00:09:49.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that key factor
that we have to keep in mind

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:53.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to focus on the one language
that counts the most

00:09:53.976 --> 00:09:58.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the “pure language” that Jehovah God
has given to his people.

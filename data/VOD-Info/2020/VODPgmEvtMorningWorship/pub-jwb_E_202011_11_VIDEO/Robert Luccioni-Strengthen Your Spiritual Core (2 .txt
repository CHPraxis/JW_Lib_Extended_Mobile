00:00:01 How strong is your core?
00:00:04 Now, health experts will tell you
00:00:06 that the core is
00:00:07 one of the most important groups
00:00:09 of muscles that you can strengthen.
00:00:10 These are the muscles
00:00:12 that are in the trunk of the body
00:00:13 from somewhere around the neck to the waist.
00:00:16 And a strong core will keep you standing if something knocks against you.
00:00:21 Having a strong core will allow you to carry a heavy weight.
00:00:25 And if you fall, a strong core
00:00:28 will help you to get back up on your feet.
00:00:30 So thus, experts say that exercises that strengthen the core,
00:00:34 these foundational muscles, are so important,
00:00:36 especially for older people.
00:00:39 So how strong is your core?
00:00:43 But the real question we want to consider today is,
00:00:46 How strong is your spiritual core
00:00:49 —our spiritual foundational muscles?
00:00:52 Now, we see the importance of having a strong spiritual core
00:00:56 when we look at today’s text in 2 Timothy chapter 3.
00:01:00 If you look up verse 6, here the apostle Paul is talking
00:01:04 about wicked “men who slyly work their way
00:01:06 into households” and deceive many.
00:01:09 At verse 8, he talks about “Jannes and Jambres [who] opposed Moses.”
00:01:13 These were wicked men, “completely corrupted in mind,”
00:01:17 who tried to discredit everything that Moses said and did.
00:01:20 And then, as we see in today’s text, Paul said that “wicked men and impostors”
00:01:25 would arise in the last days and they would “advance from bad to worse.”
00:01:30 Well, what did Paul say would help Timothy?
00:01:33 What did he need to do?
00:01:34 He needed a strong spiritual core.
00:01:37 What was that?
00:01:39 Well, look what he says in verses 14 and 15—2 Timothy 3.
00:01:43 He says: “You, however, continue in the things that you learned
00:01:46 “and were persuaded to believe, knowing from whom you learned them
00:01:51 “and that from infancy you have known the holy writings,
00:01:55 which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.”
00:02:00 Do you see the two things?
00:02:01 Number one: He needed to have a deep understanding
00:02:05 and trust of “the holy writings,” the Scriptures.
00:02:08 And two: He needed to never forget, to remember,
00:02:12 from whom he learned all the good things that he knew.
00:02:15 See, he needed to make sure that was solid.
00:02:17 That would help him to deal with the wicked men
00:02:20 and impostors.
00:02:23 Now, this solid, spiritual foundation
00:02:26 is what also helped Jesus’ apostles.
00:02:29 Think about the tactics that the wicked men and imposters
00:02:33 used against Jesus and how this  could have affected the apostles
00:02:37 or affected us, if we had been there.
00:02:39 Let’s consider four tactics that they used against Jesus.
00:02:42 Number one: They used lies and misrepresentation.
00:02:46 Turn back, if you will, to Matthew 11:9 as an example
00:02:51 —Matthew 11:19, excuse me.
00:02:54 Matthew 11:19—it says:
00:02:57 “The Son of man did come eating and drinking, but people say,
00:02:59 “‘Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine,
00:03:03 a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’”
00:03:07 Now, did Jesus like to eat and drink?
00:03:10 Yes.
00:03:11 Did he, in fact, eat with tax collectors and sinners?
00:03:15 Yes.
00:03:16 But you know what the wicked men and imposters did?
00:03:18 They stretched it to say,  ‘Well, you see, he’s a glutton;
00:03:22 he’s a drunkard; he is a friend  of tax collectors and sinners.’
00:03:26 Look at Luke 15:2;
00:03:29 it even kind of insinuates that he condones their behavior
00:03:31 or maybe even shares in their sins.
00:03:34 What if you were there?
00:03:37 ‘Now, we know he likes to eat and drink,
00:03:39 ‘but I’m not with him 24 hours a day.
00:03:41 I hope that’s not true.’
00:03:43 Can you see how that could plant seeds of doubt?
00:03:46 how it could rock somebody?
00:03:48 A second tactic: Wicked men and imposters would also twist Jesus’ words.
00:03:52 Look at John 5:18 as an example.
00:03:57 John 5:18—it says:
00:04:01 “This is why the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him,
00:04:04 “because not only was he breaking the Sabbath
00:04:07 “but he was also calling God his own Father,
00:04:09 making himself equal to God.”
00:04:12 So here they twist Jesus’ words,
00:04:15 saying that Jesus was saying that he was “equal to God.”
00:04:17 Jesus never said that he was equal to God.
00:04:19 He said that he was God’s Son; he said: “The Father is greater than I am.”
00:04:23 But they constantly took Jesus’ words and repackaged them,
00:04:26 twisting them to make it sound like Jesus was off on his own.
00:04:31 Now, what if you heard that story told and retold?
00:04:34 You didn’t hear the conversation,
00:04:36 but you heard the story; you heard the sound bite.
00:04:39 ‘Wow! Did he really say that?
00:04:42 ‘Now, that would be out of line if he had,
00:04:44 because nobody is equal to God.’
00:04:46 They also capitalized on errors that were made.
00:04:49 Look over to Luke chapter 9.
00:04:51 You remember, this is the account when the disciples
00:04:54 could not cast out the demon in the young man.
00:04:57 And you look at verse 40.
00:04:59 Here the father says —Luke 9:40—
00:05:01 he says: “‘I begged your disciples to expel it, but they could not.’
00:05:05 “In response Jesus said: ‘O faithless and twisted generation,
00:05:09 “‘how long must I continue with you and put up with you?
00:05:13 Bring your son over here.’”
00:05:15 Now, as we know, apparently the scribes were criticizing
00:05:17 the disciples because of their failure to heal the boy.
00:05:21 Now, again, what if you were standing there?
00:05:23 What if you saw this one with your own eyes?
00:05:25 ‘Wait a minute, those are Jesus’ disciples.
00:05:27 ‘That’s their commission.
00:05:29 ‘That’s what they’re supposed to do.
00:05:31 Perhaps these people aren’t as special as I thought they were.’
00:05:34 Wicked men and impostors
00:05:36 would also inflame statements that people did not understand.
00:05:39 Look at John 6:54.
00:05:45 You remember here when Jesus said:
00:05:47 “Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life,
00:05:51 and I will resurrect him on the last day.”
00:05:54 What was the reaction?
00:05:55 You look at verse 60:
00:05:56 “When they heard this, many of the disciples said:
00:05:58 ‘This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?’”
00:06:01 Verse 66: “[They] went off to the things behind
00:06:04 and would no longer [follow] him.”
00:06:06 See, rather than giving it time to see if they understood it correctly
00:06:10 or waiting to see if maybe Jesus clarified the statement, it knocked them.
00:06:14 And you notice (in verse 52) the Jews further stirred this up,
00:06:19 and because of that, many stopped following him.
00:06:21 It was too heavy for them to carry.
00:06:24 Now, what if you were there, and this time you heard Jesus say that?
00:06:29 ‘Whoa! Man, that’s odd!
00:06:31 ‘I don’t think I can explain that teaching.
00:06:33 He seems to be getting more and more extreme.’
00:06:36 Well, how did many react to these attacks?
00:06:40 Well, the crowds loved to follow Jesus.
00:06:42 They loved to hear his winsome words.
00:06:44 ‘No man has ever spoken like this.’
00:06:46 Thousands would come to be fed by him and to be healed by him,
00:06:51 but in the end, most did not stick with Jesus.
00:06:54 Why?
00:06:56 Well, because when you strip all the other peripherals away,
00:06:59 all the other extras away,
00:07:01 it came down to their faith in Bible prophecy
00:07:05 and that this man that was speaking to them
00:07:08 was the Son of God.
00:07:10 Their spiritual core was not strong enough.
00:07:14 Now, Jesus’ disciples had a strong spiritual core.
00:07:17 See, even though they did get knocked down
00:07:19 —they got confused at times— they stayed solid.
00:07:21 They were able to get back up. Why?
00:07:23 Because they recalled the Scriptures,
00:07:25 and they were convinced that they were listening to the Son of God.
00:07:31 Well, today, wicked men and imposters use exactly the same techniques.
00:07:36 And it’s only going to get worse.
00:07:38 They use lies and misrepresentation.
00:07:41 They lie about how we deal with child abusers
00:07:44 and how we care for the victims of child abuse.
00:07:47 They twist statements that are made regarding our stand on blood,
00:07:50 loyalty to families, disfellowshipping.
00:07:53 They capitalize on what they perceive as errors
00:07:56 —perhaps dogmatic statements we made in the past
00:07:59 regarding a Bible prophecy or our understanding of the time of the end,
00:08:03 and then we later changed it.
00:08:05 They also put a negative spin on changes that they do not understand
00:08:10 —why we simplified and did reassignments in 2015,
00:08:14 new explanations of the generation, or changes at world headquarters.
00:08:19 What’s the result? Well, some are swayed by these things.
00:08:21 They’re stumbled; they’re knocked down.
00:08:23 It’s too heavy for them to carry.
00:08:26 How about us?
00:08:28 How strong is our spiritual core?
00:08:32 See, that’s why we hear repeatedly
00:08:34 that we must personally have a regular,
00:08:38 deep study of the Scriptures.
00:08:41 That’s why we’re reminded repeatedly that Jehovah
00:08:44 is using the Governing Body to give us the good things that we have.
00:08:48 Now, why is that so important?
00:08:51 Well, because one day we may hit a time,
00:08:55 whether personally (in our personal life) or as an organization,
00:08:59 when all the other spiritual peripherals are gone—all the extras.
00:09:04 What do we do then?
00:09:06 What do we do, for example, if the lights go out on JW Broadcasting®?
00:09:11 What happens, perhaps, when we don’t have the incredible conventions,
00:09:14 the touching videos, the catchy music,
00:09:18 the beautifully-written (well-written) Watchtower  articles,
00:09:20 the exciting annual meetings?
00:09:22 They’re gone.
00:09:23 See, some of our brothers and sisters do not have access
00:09:26 to those things right now.
00:09:28 Well, you see, at that time, it will come down to our faith
00:09:31 that this is God’s Word
00:09:33 and that the Governing Body is the channel that Jehovah has been using.
00:09:38 So during this period of relative calm,
00:09:41 may we follow the advice of the apostle Paul
00:09:43 at 2 Timothy 3:14, 15
00:09:46 and know “the holy writings” inside and out
00:09:50 and remember from whom we’ve learned all the good things that we know.
00:09:54 That’s our spiritual core —strengthen it; maintain it.
00:09:58 It will stabilize us, and it will help us
00:10:00 to get through the things that are yet to come.

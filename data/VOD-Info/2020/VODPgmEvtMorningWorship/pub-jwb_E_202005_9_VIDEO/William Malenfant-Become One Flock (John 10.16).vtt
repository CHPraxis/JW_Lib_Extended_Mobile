This is certainly an interesting text

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.483 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for us today—very well-known.

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:09.280 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah reveals to us what we need

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.615 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—what we need to know in order to be happy

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:12.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and what we need

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:15.452 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in order to serve him faithfully.

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are some things

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God has not revealed to us

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things that we may be curious about

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things that we really don’t know.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our curiosity may persist
even though it’s something

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are not able to know or fully understand.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:42.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, our text comment tells us
that we don’t need to know the names

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of the anointed on earth today.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the last sentence in the text comment

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that “it would be pointless . . . 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to try to ascertain
who among God’s servants

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will eventually be part of the 144,000.”

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The final judgment and sealing
of the anointed

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a very private matter
between Jehovah

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and individual anointed ones.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, some of us may be a bit like Peter,

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
curious about others

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what God’s will is for them.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, frankly speaking, brothers and sisters,

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our curiosity does have to be controlled.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to recognize our limitations.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are things

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really don’t pertain to us.

00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read a scripture text
on this point in John chapter 21.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In John chapter 21,
we’ll read verses 20 through 23.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This follows Jesus telling Peter
what sort of death he would undergo.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so at John 21:20-23,

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says in verse 20:
“Peter turned around and saw the disciple

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whom Jesus loved following
[that would be the apostle John],

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one who at the evening meal

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had also leaned back on his chest and said:

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, who is the one betraying you?’

00:02:14.947 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when he caught sight of him

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, Peter caught sight
of John following],

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter said to Jesus:
‘Lord, what about this man?’”

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Peter had just learned
what sort of death he would undergo.

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he wanted to know about John.

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to him: ‘If it is my will for him

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to remain until I come,
of what concern is that to you?’

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Isn’t that interesting?]

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You continue following me.”

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the key point.

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:50.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it goes on; it says:
“So the saying went out among the brothers

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this disciple would not die.”

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, rumors sometimes start circulating.

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:01.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hear something, and then we
pass it on and may be misunderstood.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Jesus did not say to him

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he would not die, but he said:

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If it is my will for him
to remain until I come,

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what concern is that to you?’”

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That probably stifled Peter
for a few moments on that occasion

00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—slowed him down a bit—

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Peter didn’t go away distressed or upset

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:29.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jesus not telling him
how John would remain until Jesus came.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would be
when Jesus revealed to John

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:37.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about His coming
in the Kingdom in the future.

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And John wrote it all down
in the book of Revelation.

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was done about the year 96 C.E.

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:49.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Peter was curious
about what was going to happen with John,

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t know
—didn’t have the right to know—

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:58.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about something
that pertained to Jesus and to John.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was private.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing the names of brothers and sisters

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our congregation is of interest to us.

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Frankly, I’m finding it
a little bit difficult at times

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remember names in a new congregation

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I have to call on brothers,
but little by little, we learn.

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And usually, we of the “other sheep” know

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:20.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who partake of the emblems,

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, after all, in our congregation,
we see the emblems being passed,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:28.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can see individuals partaking

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in a sense, telling us that,
yes, they have the heavenly calling.

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:35.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see it at the Memorial.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I might also add at this point

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even though we don’t know

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about that personal relationship
that comes about

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we don’t experience it ourselves—

00:04:46.557 --> 00:04:49.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we are convinced, for example,

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the members of the Governing Body
have the heavenly calling.

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, Jehovah has blessed them.

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fulfill Bible prophecy
about “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are certain things
that we acquire knowledge about 

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re convinced of.

00:05:04.616 --> 00:05:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Jehovah’s favor on them.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have no doubt
that Jehovah’s blessing is upon their efforts

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of the “domestics”
and provide spiritual food for all of us.

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:17.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s something we don’t know.

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have nothing to do with the final sealing.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a personal thing that takes place

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:27.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the individual and Jehovah God.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the comments on the text state,

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes place “sometime before
[the anointed one]

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:38.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dies faithful or . . . before the outbreak
of ‘the great tribulation.’”

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’re told,
and that’s what we understand.

00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:43.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what’s indicated in Revelation,

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:47.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it speaks
of the final sealing of the anointed.

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as our scripture text today says,

00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the anointed and the other sheep make up
‘one flock under one shepherd.’

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work together to do Jehovah’s will
and to honor his name.

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:00.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re not seeking
to make a name for ourselves

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:03.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among men, among people,

00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:06.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get some type
of personal glory about what we do.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an interesting account about Manoah

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the man who became father to Samson)

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the angel that appeared to Manoah.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:20.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Manoah refers to the angel
as “the man of the true God.”

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his impression was that it was a man
who came from the true God

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:26.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak to his wife and then to him.

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:31.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that it wasn’t Jehovah  
because Manoah had spoken to Jehovah God

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:35.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he requested that Jehovah
send the man of the true God again to him.

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:40.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s see what took place
in that account in Judges chapter 13,

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we get a viewpoint
of what kind of attitude

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:49.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to have in connection
with our service to God, Jehovah.

00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:54.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Judges 13:17, 18,

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:58.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says there:
“Then Manoah said to Jehovah’s angel:

00:06:58.272 --> 00:07:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What is your name,
so that we may honor you

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:04.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when your word comes true?’

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:07.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, Jehovah’s angel said to him:

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Why are you asking about my name,

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing that it is a wonderful one?’”

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:16.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, ‘I’m not giving you my name;

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:19.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t need to know my name.’

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:23.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That angel displayed modesty.

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:25.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the other point, too, to keep in mind:

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:28.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Manoah’s words reveal something to us.

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to know the angel’s name
in order to honor him

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his word came true.

00:07:36.977 --> 00:07:39.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah deserves the honor.

00:07:39.396 --> 00:07:41.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t the angel’s word,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was Jehovah’s word
by means of his messenger, the angel.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the angel was not about to
take credit that belonged to Jehovah.

00:07:50.824 --> 00:07:53.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think about it,
isn’t that the way that the anointed

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other sheep look at things?

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not here to try
and take credit for ourselves,

some kind of glory among our brothers.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we’re here to honor
Jehovah God and bring him praise.

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:11.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever we do
in our sacred service is to honor Jehovah.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about knowing
at some point in the future

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who will be
in the heavenly Kingdom with Christ?

00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:24.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower </i> from which
our text comments are taken says this:

00:08:24.066 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Psalm 87:5, 6

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:32.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“indicates that it is likely
that in the future the names of all those

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:36.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been raised to rule with Jesus
in heaven will be revealed.”

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Romans is cited.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of “the revealing
of the sons of God,”

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not directly in connection 
with revealing their names,

00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:45.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that term is used there.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Psalm 87:5, 6 is cited,

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referring to “Zion” and those “born in her.”

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that those
of the anointed receive—

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:58.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re “born again”
with the hope of everlasting life.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’re born
to Jehovah’s heavenly organization (his wife)

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:07.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rule with Jesus Christ in the heavens.

00:09:07.526 --> 00:09:10.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t need to know
the names of every member

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:13.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the anointed and follow each one of them.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:15.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not what we do.

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is our Leader,

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:22.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Bible tells us
we must follow only him—Matthew 23:10.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:24.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is a principle to keep in mind

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:26.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s found at 2 Timothy 2:19.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It applies to all the anointed
and the other sheep.

00:09:30.173 --> 00:09:32.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful principle:

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows those who belong to him.”

00:00:00 This is certainly an interesting text
00:00:02 for us today—very well-known.
00:00:04 And we appreciate
00:00:06 that Jehovah reveals to us what we need
00:00:09 —what we need to know in order to be happy
00:00:11 and what we need
00:00:12 in order to serve him faithfully.
00:00:15 But there are some things
00:00:17 that Jehovah God has not revealed to us
00:00:21 —things that we may be curious about
00:00:25 and things that we really don’t know.
00:00:30 But our curiosity may persist even though it’s something
00:00:34 we are not able to know or fully understand.
00:00:38 For example, our text comment tells us that we don’t need to know the names
00:00:42 of all of the anointed on earth today.
00:00:46 And the last sentence in the text comment
00:00:49 tells us that “it would be pointless . . .
00:00:51 “to try to ascertain who among God’s servants
00:00:55 will eventually be part of the 144,000.”
00:01:00 The final judgment and sealing of the anointed
00:01:04 is a very private matter between Jehovah
00:01:08 and individual anointed ones.
00:01:11 However, some of us may be a bit like Peter,
00:01:16 curious about others
00:01:19 and what God’s will is for them.
00:01:22 But, frankly speaking, brothers and sisters,
00:01:24 our curiosity does have to be controlled.
00:01:28 We need to recognize our limitations.
00:01:32 And there are things
00:01:34 that really don’t pertain to us.
00:01:37 Let’s read a scripture text on this point in John chapter 21.
00:01:43 In John chapter 21, we’ll read verses 20 through 23.
00:01:48 This follows Jesus telling Peter what sort of death he would undergo.
00:01:54 And so at John 21:20-23,
00:01:57 it says in verse 20: “Peter turned around and saw the disciple
00:02:02 “whom Jesus loved following [that would be the apostle John],
00:02:06 “the one who at the evening meal
00:02:08 “had also leaned back on his chest and said:
00:02:11 “‘Lord, who is the one betraying you?’
00:02:14 “So when he caught sight of him
00:02:17 “[that is, Peter caught sight of John following],
00:02:20 Peter said to Jesus: ‘Lord, what about this man?’”
00:02:24 Well, Peter had just learned what sort of death he would undergo.
00:02:27 Now he wanted to know about John.
00:02:30 “Jesus said to him: ‘If it is my will for him
00:02:34 “to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?’
00:02:39 “[Isn’t that interesting?]
00:02:42 You continue following me.”
00:02:45 And that’s the key point.
00:02:47 And then it goes on; it says: “So the saying went out among the brothers
00:02:50 that this disciple would not die.”
00:02:53 Well, rumors sometimes start circulating.
00:02:57 We hear something, and then we pass it on and may be misunderstood.
00:03:01 “However, Jesus did not say to him
00:03:03 “that he would not die, but he said:
00:03:06 “‘If it is my will for him to remain until I come,
00:03:10 of what concern is that to you?’”
00:03:15 That probably stifled Peter for a few moments on that occasion
00:03:19 —slowed him down a bit—
00:03:21 but Peter didn’t go away distressed or upset
00:03:24 with Jesus not telling him how John would remain until Jesus came.
00:03:29 And that would be when Jesus revealed to John
00:03:33 about His coming in the Kingdom in the future.
00:03:37 And John wrote it all down in the book of Revelation.
00:03:40 And that was done about the year 96 C.E.
00:03:44 So Peter was curious about what was going to happen with John,
00:03:49 but he didn’t know —didn’t have the right to know—
00:03:53 about something that pertained to Jesus and to John.
00:03:58 It was private.
00:04:00 Knowing the names of brothers and sisters
00:04:03 in our congregation is of interest to us.
00:04:05 Frankly, I’m finding it a little bit difficult at times
00:04:08 to remember names in a new congregation
00:04:10 when I have to call on brothers, but little by little, we learn.
00:04:15 And usually, we of the “other sheep” know
00:04:19 who partake of the emblems,
00:04:20 because, after all, in our congregation, we see the emblems being passed,
00:04:25 and we can see individuals partaking
00:04:28 —in a sense, telling us that, yes, they have the heavenly calling.
00:04:33 We see it at the Memorial.
00:04:35 And I might also add at this point
00:04:38 that even though we don’t know
00:04:40 about that personal relationship that comes about
00:04:44 —we don’t experience it ourselves—
00:04:46 but we are convinced, for example,
00:04:49 that the members of the Governing Body have the heavenly calling.
00:04:53 After all, Jehovah has blessed them.
00:04:56 They fulfill Bible prophecy about “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:04:59 There are certain things that we acquire knowledge about
00:05:02 and we’re convinced of.
00:05:04 We see Jehovah’s favor on them.
00:05:06 We have no doubt that Jehovah’s blessing is upon their efforts
00:05:09 to take care of the “domestics” and provide spiritual food for all of us.
00:05:14 But there’s something we don’t know.
00:05:17 We have nothing to do with the final sealing.
00:05:20 That is a personal thing that takes place
00:05:23 between the individual and Jehovah God.
00:05:27 And as the comments on the text state,
00:05:29 it takes place “sometime before [the anointed one]
00:05:33 dies faithful or . . . before the outbreak of ‘the great tribulation.’”
00:05:38 That’s what we’re told, and that’s what we understand.
00:05:41 And that’s what’s indicated in Revelation,
00:05:43 where it speaks of the final sealing of the anointed.
00:05:47 And as our scripture text today says,
00:05:49 the anointed and the other sheep make up ‘one flock under one shepherd.’
00:05:54 We work together to do Jehovah’s will and to honor his name.
00:05:58 And we’re not seeking to make a name for ourselves
00:06:00 among men, among people,
00:06:03 to get some type of personal glory about what we do.
00:06:06 There’s an interesting account about Manoah
00:06:10 (the man who became father to Samson)
00:06:13 and the angel that appeared to Manoah.
00:06:16 Now, Manoah refers to the angel as “the man of the true God.”
00:06:20 So his impression was that it was a man who came from the true God
00:06:24 to speak to his wife and then to him.
00:06:26 He knew that it wasn’t Jehovah   because Manoah had spoken to Jehovah God
00:06:31 and he requested that Jehovah send the man of the true God again to him.
00:06:35 Well, let’s see what took place in that account in Judges chapter 13,
00:06:40 because we get a viewpoint of what kind of attitude
00:06:44 we want to have in connection with our service to God, Jehovah.
00:06:49 At Judges 13:17, 18,
00:06:54 it says there: “Then Manoah said to Jehovah’s angel:
00:06:58 “‘What is your name, so that we may honor you
00:07:01 “when your word comes true?’
00:07:04 “However, Jehovah’s angel said to him:
00:07:07 “‘Why are you asking about my name,
00:07:10 seeing that it is a wonderful one?’”
00:07:13 In other words, ‘I’m not giving you my name;
00:07:16 you don’t need to know my name.’
00:07:19 That angel displayed modesty.
00:07:23 And the other point, too, to keep in mind:
00:07:25 Manoah’s words reveal something to us.
00:07:28 He wanted to know the angel’s name in order to honor him
00:07:33 when his word came true.
00:07:36 Jehovah deserves the honor.
00:07:39 And it wasn’t the angel’s word,
00:07:41 but it was Jehovah’s word by means of his messenger, the angel.
00:07:45 So the angel was not about to take credit that belonged to Jehovah.
00:07:50 And when you think about it, isn’t that the way that the anointed
00:07:53 and the other sheep look at things?
00:07:56 We’re not here to try and take credit for ourselves,
00:07:59 some kind of glory among our brothers.
00:08:01 No, we’re here to honor Jehovah God and bring him praise.
00:08:07 Whatever we do in our sacred service is to honor Jehovah.
00:08:11 And what about knowing at some point in the future
00:08:15 those who will be in the heavenly Kingdom with Christ?
00:08:19 Well, The Watchtower  from which our text comments are taken says this:
00:08:24 “Psalm 87:5, 6
00:08:28 “indicates that it is likely that in the future the names of all those
00:08:32 who have been raised to rule with Jesus in heaven will be revealed.”
00:08:36 And then Romans is cited.
00:08:39 It speaks of “the revealing of the sons of God,”
00:08:41 not directly in connection  with revealing their names,
00:08:43 but that term is used there.
00:08:45 And Psalm 87:5, 6 is cited,
00:08:49 referring to “Zion” and those “born in her.”
00:08:52 And we know that those of the anointed receive—
00:08:55 They’re “born again” with the hope of everlasting life.
00:08:58 And they’re born to Jehovah’s heavenly organization (his wife)
00:09:03 to rule with Jesus Christ in the heavens.
00:09:07 So we don’t need to know the names of every member
00:09:10 of the anointed and follow each one of them.
00:09:13 That’s not what we do.
00:09:15 Jesus is our Leader,
00:09:17 and the Bible tells us we must follow only him—Matthew 23:10.
00:09:22 And there is a principle to keep in mind
00:09:24 that’s found at 2 Timothy 2:19.
00:09:26 It applies to all the anointed and the other sheep.
00:09:30 It’s a beautiful principle:
00:09:32 “Jehovah knows those who belong to him.”

Welcome to our special

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.900 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Morning Worship program

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.653 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the most important day of the year.

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:10.030 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s a real privilege this morning

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just to speak to the Bethel family

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to be able to share
some Scriptural thoughts

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the majority
of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right around the world, including you

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever you may be this morning.

00:00:24.628 --> 00:00:28.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are looking forward
with excitement to this evening,

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we unitedly remember
the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s start by reading

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scripture text selected for today.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to ask Brother David Schafer,

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read for us this morning.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, David,
let’s have the scripture text read.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.072 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Tuesday, April 7, 2020

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:55.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the Memorial date after sundown.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The text is taken from Romans 5:8:

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ died for us.”

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, David.

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine, please,
that you are in a prison cell.

00:01:10.174 --> 00:01:12.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve just been notified

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will be executed
in the morning because of your faith.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no further means of appeal.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The decision is final.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you spend this last night?

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you think about?

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers and sisters in the past

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have found themselves
in this challenging situation.

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these used their last night

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:41.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to write letters to strengthen and comfort

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their friends and relatives.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, consider the courageous words

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
written by one young brother to his family

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he awaited death
at the hands of Nazi persecutors.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:02:00.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote: “It is already past midnight.

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:03.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still have time to change my mind.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ah! could I be happy again in this world

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after I had denied our Lord?

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Surely not!

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now you have the assurance

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:18.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I leave this world
in happiness and peace.”

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, this dear brother didn’t use

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that final evening just to focus
on his own hardships.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he used part of that evening

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage those whom he loved.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to strengthen them

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they wouldn’t be overwhelmed

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the sad news of his death.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with these thoughts in mind,

00:02:41.932 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s now think about
how Jesus spent his last evening

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a human here on earth.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To start with, let’s ask this question:

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time of that evening,

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did Jesus know
about the circumstances of his death?

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together
what’s stated in Matthew chapter 20.

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you turn with me, please,

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Matthew 20:18, 19,

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:16.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem,

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Son of man will be handed over

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the chief priests and the scribes.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will condemn him to death

00:03:27.561 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and hand him over to men of the nations

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:34.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be mocked and scourged
and executed on a stake;

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the third day he will be raised up.”

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on that final evening,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did Jesus already know about his death,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what would he
have been thinking about?

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These verses that we just read

00:03:50.834 --> 00:03:53.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mention four things.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, it tells us that he knew

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be handed over
to the Jewish religious leaders

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:03.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would take him to court
and find him guilty of a crime,

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:07.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps one
including the charge of blasphemy.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Jesus knew
that he would be handed over

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “men of the nations”
(in other words, the Romans),

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they would violently abuse him.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, he knew
that he would be executed on a stake.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the final point,

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:32.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he realized that he
would be resurrected on the third day.

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on that final evening,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus already knew some of the details
concerning his death,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these would have weighed
heavily on his mind.

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But were there any other things
that he already knew?

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:47.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:52.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider another three facts
that were on his mind that evening.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one we’ll notice

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we turn to the book of John this time.

00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:59.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In John chapter 13,

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to start by reading verse 21:

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After saying these things,
Jesus became troubled in spirit,

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he bore witness, saying:

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:17.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Most truly I say to you,
one of you will betray me.’”

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now if we turn across to verse 26,

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:24.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us that Jesus continued to say:

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:29.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is the one to whom
I will give the piece of bread that I dip.’

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So after dipping the bread, he took it

00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:36.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave it to Judas,
the son of Simon Iscariot.”

00:05:37.482 --> 00:05:41.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that one of his apostles
would betray him,

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he even knew
who his betrayer would be.

00:05:45.782 --> 00:05:48.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now for something else that Jesus knew,

00:05:48.452 --> 00:05:51.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read verse 38 of the same chapter

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—John 13:38.

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus here said to Peter:

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will you surrender your life in my behalf?

00:06:02.674 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Most truly I say to you,
a rooster will by no means crow

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:11.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you have disowned me three times.”

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus also knew
that Peter would deny him three times.

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for another point,
let’s turn to John chapter 16

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—John 16:32.

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:31.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, speaking to his apostles, Jesus said:

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:33.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! The hour is coming,

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:35.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“indeed, it has come,

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when each one of you
will be scattered to his own house

00:06:39.336 --> 00:06:41.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will leave me alone.”

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus also realized
that the rest of his apostles

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:49.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would run away and desert him.

00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus have
on his mind that evening?

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:55.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only would Jesus have been thinking

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:59.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his upcoming court trial, persecution,

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:02.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and execution but he also knew

00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:05.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would be betrayed,

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
denied, and abandoned.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you were Jesus,

00:07:12.244 --> 00:07:15.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you have reacted
to this knowledge?

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you
would have preferred to be by yourself,

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoiding those who would fail you.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:23.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might have thought,

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:26.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’s better for me
to spend the evening in prayer

00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—preparing properly—
without these negative distractions.’

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about it:

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all these negative things,

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:39.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus didn’t hide away and stay by himself.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he told his apostles
that he “greatly desired”

00:07:44.609 --> 00:07:47.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to celebrate this last Passover with them.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
he wasn’t going to “miss the meeting”

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of these negative things.

00:07:54.286 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, even with
all these things on his mind,

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:03.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus focused on
how to help his faithful apostles.

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:06.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved them,
and he wanted to prepare them

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what was about to happen.

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:11.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in John’s account,

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:14.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
five chapters are devoted
to Jesus’ final words

00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:17.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of encouragement to his apostles.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:22.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing,
unselfish love Jesus showed!

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:26.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine, Jesus took the time

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:29.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wash the feet of his apostles,

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:33.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the feet
of his betrayer, Judas Iscariot.

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:37.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only were the apostles
unwilling to do this lowly service

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:39.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when Jesus
started to wash their feet,

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:43.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of them stood up
and offered to take over.

00:08:43.168 --> 00:08:46.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they had
a real problem with their attitude.

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:48.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was further shown by the fact

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they had an argument that evening

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about who was the greatest among them.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:58.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do we see the evidence
of Jesus’ love in all of this?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t give up on them.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus didn’t allow these failures

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:07.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause him to have
a negative view of his apostles.

00:09:07.859 --> 00:09:11.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he commended
his 11 faithful apostles

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:15.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even made a covenant with them
to be part of his Kingdom.

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that truly amazing?

00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, Jesus
earnestly prayed to Jehovah

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:25.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to watch over those apostles

00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:29.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to care for those
who would later believe in him

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that includes us today.

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:36.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all the negative things on his mind,

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:41.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus focused on strengthening others
and praying for them.

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:45.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an expression of unselfish love!

00:09:46.398 --> 00:09:49.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This evening, we’ll be focusing on the love

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus expressed for us.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we meditate
on the events of Nisan 14,

00:09:56.366 --> 00:10:00.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s also remember
how Jesus proved his love

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:03.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his apostles by not giving up on them.

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even at a time when his thoughts
would have been focused

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:10.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the excruciating death
that lay ahead of him,

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:12.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he patiently helped them

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:16.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could deal
with what was about to happen.

00:10:17.804 --> 00:10:20.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn from this?

00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this may not be
the last night of our life,

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:27.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we may not expect
to be executed tomorrow.

00:10:27.522 --> 00:10:30.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we imitate the love

00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:33.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus displayed that final evening?

00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some things
we can all be determined to do:

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:40.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t give up on our brothers and sisters,

00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:43.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if at times they seem to fail us.

00:10:43.914 --> 00:10:46.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to strengthen others,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we are facing difficulties.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we will also prove
our genuine love

00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:58.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah and his loving Son, Jesus Christ.

00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:01.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, David, let’s have our comments read.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus was willing
not only to die for his disciples

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:10.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also to live each day in a way
that put their interests ahead of his own.

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:12.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For instance, he met with his followers

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:16.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even when he was physically tired
or emotionally distressed.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he focused on
what he could give to others,

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not on what he could get from them.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:24.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We belong to
the only true Christian brotherhood,

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:27.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we enjoy spending
as much time as possible

00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:29.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“inviting new ones to join us.

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:31.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, we are particularly interested

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:34.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in helping those
who are ‘related to us in the faith’

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:37.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but who have become inactive.

00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We prove our love for them
by encouraging them to attend our meetings,

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“especially the Memorial.

00:11:44.307 --> 00:11:46.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Like Jehovah and Jesus,

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are deeply moved
when an inactive one returns to Jehovah.”

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:55.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, David,
for reading for us this morning.

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:57.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to turn our attention

00:11:57.946 --> 00:12:00.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our scheduled Bible reading
for this morning.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now on the first day
of the Unleavened Bread,

00:12:11.751 --> 00:12:16.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when they customarily offered up
the Passover sacrifice,

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:18.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his disciples said to him: 

00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:22.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where do you want us to go
and prepare for you to eat the Passover?’

00:12:22.012 --> 00:12:24.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With that

00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he sent two
of his disciples and said to them: 

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:29.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go into the city,

an earthenware water jar will meet you.

“‘Follow him, and wherever he goes inside,

the Passover with my disciples?’

“Prepare it for us there.’”

00:12:53.043 --> 00:12:55.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So the disciples went out,

and found it just as he said to them,

and they prepared for the Passover.”

with my disciples at your home.’”’

00:13:33.124 --> 00:13:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

as Jesus instructed them

began to say the same thing.

the hour might pass away from him.

“And he came straight up
and approached him

“and said, ‘Rabbi!’

00:19:04.372 --> 00:19:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and took him into custody.

“However, one of those
standing by drew his sword

of the high priest, taking off his ear.

“But in response Jesus said to them:

this is to fulfill the Scriptures.’

“And they all abandoned him and fled.

wearing only a fine linen garment

00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:58.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over his naked body 
began to follow him nearby,

and got away naked.

“But Peter,
from a good distance, followed him

“as far as into the courtyard
of the high priest;

00:20:23.451 --> 00:20:26.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he was sitting together
with the house attendants

“Now the chief priests
and the entire Sanhedrin

00:20:34.587 --> 00:20:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were looking for testimony against Jesus

00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to put him to death,
but they were not finding any. 

00:20:41.969 --> 00:20:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many, indeed,
were giving false witness against him,

00:20:46.849 --> 00:20:50.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but their testimonies were not in agreement.

00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, certain ones were standing up

00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:57.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and bearing false witness
against him, saying:

00:20:57.819 --> 00:21:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We heard him say,
“I will throw down this temple

“‘“that was made with hands,
and in three days

“I will build another not made with hands.”’

00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:11.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But even on these grounds,

00:21:11.249 --> 00:21:14.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“their testimony was not in agreement.

00:21:16.712 --> 00:21:18.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the high priest stood up in their midst

00:21:18.422 --> 00:21:21.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and questioned Jesus, saying:

00:21:21.634 --> 00:21:24.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do you say nothing in reply?

00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is it these men 
are testifying against you?’

00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:32.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he kept silent and made no reply at all.

00:21:33.646 --> 00:21:38.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again the high priest
began to question him and said to him:

“‘Are you the Christ
the Son of the Blessed One?’

00:21:43.489 --> 00:21:46.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus said:

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:50.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am; and you will see the Son of man

00:21:50.496 --> 00:21:55.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and coming with the clouds of heaven.’

00:21:57.837 --> 00:22:01.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this the high priest
ripped his garments and said:

“‘What further need
do we have of witnesses?

00:22:05.052 --> 00:22:09.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You heard the blasphemy.
What is your decision?’

00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:14.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They all condemned him
as deserving of death.

00:22:14.395 --> 00:22:17.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And some started to spit on him

00:22:17.607 --> 00:22:19.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to cover his face

00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:23.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and hit him with their fists and say to him:

00:22:23.404 --> 00:22:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Prophesy!’

00:22:25.615 --> 00:22:30.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And slapping him in the face,
the court attendants took him.

00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:35.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now while Peter was below in the courtyard,

00:22:35.082 --> 00:22:38.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“one of the servant girls
of the high priest came.

“On seeing Peter warming himself,

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“she looked straight at him and said:

00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:49.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You too were
with the Nazarene, this Jesus.’ 

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he denied it, saying:

“‘Neither do I know him nor do I
understand what you are talking about,’

00:22:57.563 --> 00:23:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he went outside to the entryway.

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:08.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There the servant girl saw him
and again began to say to those standing by:

00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:10.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is one of them.’

00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again he was denying it.

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:15.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And after a little while,

00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:19.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those standing by
again began saying to Peter:

“‘Certainly you are one of them,

“for you are, in fact, a Galilean.’

00:23:26.342 --> 00:23:29.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he started to curse and swear:

“‘I do not know this man of whom you speak!’

“Immediately a rooster
crowed a second time,

00:23:38.729 --> 00:23:43.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Peter recalled
what Jesus had said to him:

“‘Before a rooster crows twice,

“you will disown me three times.’

00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:54.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he broke down and began to weep.”

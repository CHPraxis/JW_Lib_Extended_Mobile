00:00:01 The cities of refuge
00:00:04 —that was a merciful provision of God.
00:00:07 But we might link it to something
00:00:10 that could involve all of us,
00:00:13 and that is the common expression
00:00:17 “Forgive and forget.”
00:00:19 I’m sure you’ve heard it, and maybe you have tried to apply it.
00:00:25 But maybe at the outset, ask yourself,
00:00:28 ‘Were the cities of refuge
00:00:30 a provision to forgive and forget?’
00:00:34 Well, if you were there and some men were chopping a tree
00:00:39 and the ax head flew off
00:00:41 and bonked your uncle, killing him,
00:00:44 do you think you’d be in position to say:
00:00:47 “Oh, well, it was an accident. You didn’t mean it.
00:00:50 You feel sorry, so why don’t we just forgive and forget?”
00:00:54 No, that wasn’t possible
00:00:56 because the sanctity of life and blood
00:01:00 were involved in that case.
00:01:03 But do they suggest (the cities of refuge)
00:01:07 that God, though merciful,
00:01:09 does not forgive or forget?
00:01:14 Well, if you open to the fourth chapter of Ephesians,
00:01:18 there is a verse there that makes it clear what the answer is.
00:01:23 That is, Ephesians 4:32:
00:01:28 “But become kind to one another,
00:01:32 “tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another
00:01:37 “just as God also by Christ
00:01:40 freely forgave you.”
00:01:43 So, certainly, we wouldn’t disagree
00:01:45 that God is able to forgive.
00:01:49 As to forgetting, in Jeremiah chapter 31,
00:01:52 the comment (with regard to the new covenant) said:
00:01:56 “I will forgive their error,
00:01:59 and I will no longer remember their sin.”
00:02:05 So does God forgive and forget?
00:02:10 Think of the account of David.
00:02:14 We know of his grievous sin.
00:02:17 Still, afterward,
00:02:19 God said to Solomon (with regard to David)
00:02:23 that ‘David walked, with integrity of heart with uprightness,
00:02:28 by doing according to all that I commanded.’
00:02:32 So, clearly, God had forgiven David.
00:02:37 But how about forgetting?
00:02:40 Did God forget David’s sins?
00:02:44 We know about them because they’re recorded in the Bible.
00:02:48 We don’t forget them, and certainly by God recording them in the Bible,
00:02:52 it shows that he doesn’t forget them in the strictest sense of the word.
00:02:57 But with regard to David’s serious sins,
00:03:01 God was able to forget in the sense of putting behind Him
00:03:06 David’s sins and not remembering them
00:03:11 in the sense of calling them back
00:03:14 to punish David time and time again.
00:03:18 He—that is, God— put David’s sins behind Him.
00:03:24 Well, what about us and the encouragement
00:03:26 to forgive and forget?
00:03:30 We know that there are times, as mentioned earlier today,
00:03:34 when individuals may rub us the wrong way
00:03:37 or say something hurtful about us;
00:03:40 maybe it’s like a stab of a sword.
00:03:43 They may do something thoughtless;
00:03:46 they may even betray a confidence
00:03:49 and hurt us in that way.
00:03:52 So, what’s our reaction going to be? get angry?
00:03:56 say something harsh in return?
00:03:58 maybe simply avoid the brother or sister thereafter?
00:04:04 Well, we mentioned Ephesians 4:32,
00:04:07 read it, and it said:
00:04:09 “Freely forgiving one another
00:04:12 “just as God
00:04:14 also by Christ freely forgave you.”
00:04:19 So, clearly, if we want to imitate God,
00:04:24 then that involves being willing to forgive,
00:04:29 and that means
00:04:31 putting the individual’s trespasses
00:04:34 behind us.
00:04:37 Realistically, though, how can we go about that?
00:04:42 We might think of some physical wounds to illustrate the point.
00:04:47 Some wounds are small and light
00:04:50 and others more serious or deeper,
00:04:53 and they don’t all require the same reaction.
00:04:56 But let’s just imagine that we had an envelope
00:05:01 and we used our finger to open the envelope,
00:05:05 and in the process we got a paper cut.
00:05:08 “Ow! Wow, that hurt!”
00:05:10 We wished we had used a letter opener.
00:05:13 We didn’t. We used our finger, and it really hurt.
00:05:18 But isn’t it true that if you’ve done that,
00:05:21 a day or two later
00:05:23 you can’t even remember where the wound is?
00:05:26 I mean, you cut yourself, but you’ve forgotten it.
00:05:31 Some wounds, of course, are more serious or deeper.
00:05:35 Let’s just say that you needed
00:05:38 an emergency appendectomy,
00:05:41 and it wasn’t going to be done laparoscopically
00:05:45 with three small holes
00:05:47 but rather with an open incision.
00:05:51 Now, after that, would it be rational
00:05:54 to stick your finger through the incision
00:05:58 and kind of poke around inside where the appendix had been?
00:06:03 Would poking around in the wound help things?
00:06:08 Or, rather, do we let it go —forget about it?
00:06:12 It might be hurtful to walk for a few days,
00:06:15 but in time, it’s behind you.
00:06:18 And, in fact, now, if you’ve had an appendectomy,
00:06:21 you probably don’t think about it,
00:06:23 and maybe it’s been years since you thought about it.
00:06:25 Oh, granted, there may be a small scar on your abdomen,
00:06:29 but it’s been put behind you.
00:06:34 Can that same concept be applied
00:06:37 to unkind things that have been said about us
00:06:41 by someone who hurt us, perhaps betrayed a trust?
00:06:46 Now what?
00:06:49 Colossians chapter 3,
00:06:52 we might read the whole verse,
00:06:55 verse 13:
00:06:57 “Continue putting up with one another
00:07:00 “and forgiving one another freely
00:07:02 “even if anyone has
00:07:06 “a cause for complaint against another.
00:07:10 “Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,
00:07:14 you must also do the same.”
00:07:17 Now, we want to imitate Jehovah, do we not?
00:07:21 And if God freely forgives,
00:07:25 is that not an incentive for us to try to do the same?
00:07:30 Now, granted, that doesn’t mean
00:07:32 that Jehovah has forgotten the trespass against us.
00:07:38 Can we? Maybe, maybe not.
00:07:42 We do recall what Jesus said in the model prayer, however,
00:07:45 when he said that ‘as we forgive the trespasses of others
00:07:50 so God will accordingly forgive our trespasses.’
00:07:55 Conversely, if we are disinclined
00:07:59 to forgive the trespasses of others,
00:08:02 what can we expect of God for us?
00:08:07 So, then, what is the essence,
00:08:10 applied personally,
00:08:12 of this encouragement to forgive and forget?
00:08:18 It means to forgive
00:08:20 in the sense of letting go,
00:08:23 not holding on to the anger,
00:08:26 not feeling constant resentment thereafter,
00:08:30 or not even gossiping
00:08:32 about what was done that hurt us.
00:08:36 Maybe it really is quite immaterial.
00:08:39 Maybe it’s simply like a paper cut:
00:08:42 In a couple of days, we don’t even remember where the wound is.
00:08:47 Can we do that with regard to the offense,
00:08:50 or the hurt, personally?
00:08:53 But even with something more serious
00:08:56 —an offense that seems deeper—
00:08:59 can we be like Jehovah
00:09:02 by forgetting in the sense of putting it behind us?
00:09:06 Just as Jehovah didn’t thereafter
00:09:10 punish David time and time again,
00:09:14 can we put the fellow servant’s error,
00:09:18 offense,
00:09:20 perhaps a lack of trust—
00:09:24 Can we put those things behind us
00:09:26 just realizing that he or she is still our brother?
00:09:31 And it’s an imperfect brother just as we’re imperfect,
00:09:35 but put it behind and forgive the trespass
00:09:39 just as Jehovah forgives our trespasses.

00:00:01 What are your convenient times?
00:00:04 Our text for today discusses
00:00:06 one of the temptations
00:00:08 that Satan presented to Jesus.
00:00:10 Luke 4:13 later says
00:00:13 that then Satan goes away
00:00:15 to return at “another convenient time” to tempt Jesus.
00:00:20 So with all that in mind, we’re going to consider three questions today:
00:00:23 (1) What were these three temptations really about?
00:00:28 (2) Did Satan ever find a convenient time
00:00:33 to come back and tempt Jesus?
00:00:36 (3) Does Satan try to use these temptations today?
00:00:40 We’re going to look at Matthew’s account of these three temptations
00:00:43 and try to answer those questions.
00:00:45 So let’s start first with Matthew 4:2, 3.
00:00:49 It says: “After he had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights,
00:00:53 “he felt hungry.
00:00:55 “And the Tempter approached and said to him:
00:00:58 “‘If you are a son of God,
00:01:00 tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’”
00:01:04 Now, our first question is, What was at the root of this temptation?
00:01:07 Well, Satan knew full well
00:01:09 that Jesus was Jehovah’s firstborn Son,
00:01:12 but he was trying to get Jesus to question
00:01:15 that he was who Jehovah said he was.
00:01:19 ‘If you are a son of God,
00:01:23 ‘why hasn’t your Father fed you?
00:01:25 Can you really trust Jehovah to take care of you?’
00:01:28 See, Satan wanted Jesus to begin to question Jehovah’s care
00:01:32 and use his position to benefit himself.
00:01:36 Well, Jesus recognized that this was a temptation,
00:01:39 and he did not fall for it.
00:01:41 Question two is, Did Satan ever come back
00:01:43 and try this trick again with Jesus?
00:01:47 Well, when Jesus was arrested, could that have been a convenient time?
00:01:52 Remember, Jesus said that he could have called on “12 legions of angels”
00:01:55 to come and save him.
00:01:57 Could that have been a temptation to save himself?
00:02:01 Or remember when he was on the stake,
00:02:03 the rulers and the soldiers taunted him and said,
00:02:07 ‘If you are a son of God, come on down off the stake!’
00:02:12 It’s interesting that they used the same terminology.
00:02:15 Could that have been a temptation?
00:02:17 No.
00:02:18 Jesus trusted that Jehovah would take care of him.
00:02:21 Now, our third question is, Does Satan use that temptation today?
00:02:26 Well, we are living in unsettled times.
00:02:29 Are these convenient times for Satan?
00:02:32 Our families and our friends may be in need.
00:02:35 Could we be tempted to question
00:02:38 if we really trust that Jehovah is going to take care of them?
00:02:42 Could we be convinced or convince ourselves
00:02:45 that we may need to take matters into our own hands?
00:02:48 Are we ever tempted to use our privileges of service
00:02:52 to benefit ourselves?
00:02:54 Let’s look at the second temptation.
00:02:55 Matthew 4:5, 6 says:
00:02:59 “Then the Devil took him along into the holy city,
00:03:02 “and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple
00:03:04 “and said to him: ‘If you are a son of God,
00:03:08 “‘throw yourself down, for it is written:
00:03:10 “‘“He will give his angels a command concerning you,”
00:03:13 “‘and, “They will carry you on their hands,
00:03:16 so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.”’”
00:03:19 Again, what was the root here?
00:03:21 Well, Satan was again trying to cast doubt on who Jesus was.
00:03:26 ‘If you are who you say you are, prove it.
00:03:30 ‘Let’s see if Jehovah really is there for you.
00:03:32 ‘He does value you.
00:03:34 ‘He’ll save you because Psalms says
00:03:36 that’s what he’ll do for the real Son of God.’
00:03:40 Well, Jesus saw that this was a temptation and did not fall for it.
00:03:43 Now, did Satan ever try such a temptation again?
00:03:47 Well, perhaps another time
00:03:49 is what’s recorded at Mark 8:11,
00:03:53 where the Pharisees came, and the account says
00:03:55 they “started disputing with him,
00:03:58 demanding from him a sign from heaven, to put him to the test.”
00:04:02 Now, Jesus had just healed a deaf and speechless man
00:04:06 and miraculously fed over 4,000 people, but that wasn’t enough for them.
00:04:09 They wanted something spectacular.
00:04:12 ‘Throw yourself off the temple or something.
00:04:16 ‘Prove you are who you say you are.
00:04:19 Let’s see if Jehovah really values you.’
00:04:23 Now, when might we face a similar temptation?
00:04:26 Well, some of our brothers and sisters may feel unlovable
00:04:30 because of events in their life.
00:04:32 Times of isolation and depression may be convenient times
00:04:37 for Satan to attack them.
00:04:40 ‘Am I sure Jehovah really loves me?
00:04:43 ‘Am I sure I’m important to Jehovah?
00:04:45 Do I have value?’
00:04:47 Well, such feelings have caused ones to stop serving Jehovah
00:04:51 or to seek validation of their value
00:04:54 through unscriptural means.
00:04:56 Look at our third temptation.
00:04:58 Matthew 4:8, 9:
00:05:02 “Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain
00:05:05 “and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
00:05:08 “And he said to him: ‘All these things I will give you
00:05:11 if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.’”
00:05:15 So, what was Satan offering here?
00:05:17 ‘Don’t wait! You can have it now.
00:05:19 ‘You know what’s coming —the pain that’s coming.
00:05:22 My offer is better than Jehovah’s.’
00:05:25 Again, Jesus recognized what Satan was doing,
00:05:28 and he resisted that temptation.
00:05:30 Did Satan ever find a convenient time to try that again?
00:05:34 Well, perhaps the account at Luke 6:15 explains
00:05:38 what may have been another convenient time.
00:05:40 Remember, the people wanted Jesus to begin ruling right then.
00:05:44 Could that have been a temptation to get his Kingdom started
00:05:47 without the pain of being tortured to death?
00:05:51 Well, knowing that the people were coming for him,
00:05:54 Jesus withdrew.
00:05:56 Do we face similar temptations today?
00:05:59 Well, we willingly make sacrifices and have made sacrifices to serve Jehovah.
00:06:04 But we may see what others do and what others have and wonder:
00:06:08 ‘Are our sacrifices really worth it?
00:06:11 ‘Is there any way I can have it now?
00:06:13 ‘Maybe if there’s a way I can make some more money, I could do both
00:06:15 and have the things I want.’
00:06:17 You see, three powerful temptations:
00:06:20 Can you trust that your Father will take care of you?
00:06:25 Are you sure Jehovah loves you and you have value?
00:06:29 Why wait when you can have it now?
00:06:33 So again, the question is,
00:06:35 What are your convenient times?
00:06:39 What are my convenient times?
00:06:41 Satan is going to find convenient times to tempt us—that’s a given.
00:06:46 First Peter 5:8 says that he’s out there
00:06:51 “like a roaring lion, seeking to devour [us].”
00:06:53 If he found convenient times to tempt Jesus,
00:06:56 we can be sure that he will do the same to us.
00:07:00 What do we need to do?
00:07:01 Our job is to resist his temptations.
00:07:04 How do we do that?
00:07:06 The same way that Jesus did.
00:07:08 Did you notice the two things he did?
00:07:10 (1) Jesus recognized
00:07:13 when he was being tempted,
00:07:16 and (2) at that moment, he focused on Jehovah.
00:07:20 It’s interesting that in every one of his responses to Satan,
00:07:23 he used Jehovah’s name.
00:07:26 See, Jehovah’s name is a powerful protection against Satan’s attacks.
00:07:31 That’s why Jesus listed praying to Jehovah
00:07:34 to resist temptation, to resist the wicked one,
00:07:37 as a fundamental part when he was teaching his disciples how to pray.
00:07:41 That’s why Jesus said that he made Jehovah’s name known to his followers.
00:07:46 That’s why Proverbs 18:10 tells us that Jehovah’s name
00:07:50 “is a strong tower” that we can run to for protection.
00:07:54 See, speaking with Jehovah, using his name,
00:07:58 and meditating on his name and everything that it means
00:08:02 can help us when we are being tempted by Satan
00:08:06 —when he finds convenient times to attack us.
00:08:09 And if we do that, what will be the result?
00:08:12 Well, notice the guarantee that we have
00:08:14 at Psalm 44:5
00:08:18 —Psalm 44:5.
00:08:20 It says: “By your power
00:08:23 “we will drive back our adversaries;
00:08:26 “in your name
00:08:28 “we will trample down
00:08:30 those who rise up against us.”
00:08:33 Yes, all of us are going to find times
00:08:37 that Satan finds convenient to tempt us.
00:08:40 When that happens, may we be sensitive to recognize
00:08:44 that it is a temptation
00:08:47 and then look to Jehovah and focus on his name.
00:08:51 And if we do, we can have the confidence
00:08:53 that as this psalm says, this will help—
00:08:55 Jehovah’s name will help us to drive back and trample
00:08:59 those who rise against us individually
00:09:02 and as an organization.

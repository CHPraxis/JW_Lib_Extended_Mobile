Our text comments contain this thought

00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(if you look about halfway down,

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:06.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there’s a sentence that says):

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:09.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Feeling <i>tender compassion </i>

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.162 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will move us to acts of <i>kindness.” </i>

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.563 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that the Bible

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:14.764 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in different places

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.399 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
links those two qualities together.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Ephesians 4:32 states:

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:23.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become kind to one another,
tenderly compassionate.”

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Insight on the Scriptures</i>  defines
compassion this way:

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A sympathetic awareness
of another’s suffering or adversity

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with a desire to alleviate it.”

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have the awareness
—we have the feeling—

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with that desire to act kindly.

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, as <i>The Watchtower</i>  once mentioned:

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The moral climate of our time . . .

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:53.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has killed compassion
in the hearts of so many.”

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:57.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A “Watching the World” item
highlighted that some years ago in the <i>Awake! </i>

00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Italy, a six-year-old girl and her father
were driving to the beach.

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:05.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they entered a tunnel, the father,

00:01:05.515 --> 00:01:09.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was only in his 30’s,
suddenly suffered a heart attack.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before he died, he told his little girl
to find her way home.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She struggled out of the tunnel,

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeatedly blown over by gusts of wind

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from cars that zipped by without slowing.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scratched, bleeding, and in tears,

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she walked along the highway
for half an hour,

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ignored by hundreds of passing cars
filled with vacationers

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until finally one car stopped to help.

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:40.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Newspaper editorials around the country
asked searching questions,

00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as whether the country’s affluence
had made it lose

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the warmth and compassion

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for which it had long been famous.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One newspaper mentioned:

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Along the happy road of vacation,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there were no scheduled stops

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for attending to the pain of others.”

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that account sadly illustrates
the world that we live in.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:07.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk a little bit more
about this quality of compassion.

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll consider when compassion
should not be shown,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll look at an example
of Jehovah’s compassion,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we’ll consider some practical ways

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can show compassion.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there are times when compassion
should not be shown.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:26.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if someone
deliberately persists in sin,

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be wrong to feel that we

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should compassionately shield them
from discipline.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that would be misplaced compassion.

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s notice an example in ancient Israel.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 13
—Deuteronomy 13.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:44.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at verse 6,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites were commanded
that if a brother, child,

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll notice there some expressions
such as “cherished wife”

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “closest companion,”

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if any of those were to urge
a person to “serve other gods,”

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:00.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the instruction in verse 8:

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not give in to him
or listen to him, nor should you show pity

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or feel compassion or protect him;

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead, you should kill him without fail.”

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why was that so important?

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it important not to show compassion?

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 11: “Then all Israel
will hear and become afraid,

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will never again

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do anything bad like this among you.”

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:30.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was for a protection for the nation.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If someone tried to turn an Israelite
from serving Jehovah,

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was not the time to show compassion.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yielding to pressure to show compassion
when it’s contrary to God’s will

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have serious consequences.

00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we certainly need to avoid
misplaced compassion.

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:52.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider an example
of Jehovah’s compassion.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:57.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Exodus chapter 3
—Exodus chapter 3.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While tending to his father-in-law’s sheep,

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:02.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses saw something he’d never seen before.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I daresay none of us
have ever seen it either.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses saw a thornbush on fire,

00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t being consumed.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Moses decided to go and investigate.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of an angel, Jehovah spoke
to Moses from the midst of the fire.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what he said in verse 5:

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not come any nearer.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remove your sandals from your feet,

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:28.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the place where you are standing
is holy ground.”

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:33.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just think: Because the holy God
was present representatively,

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:36.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ground itself became holy.

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep that thought in mind;
we’re going to come back to it.

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:43.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s focus now on Jehovah’s compassion
for his people who were suffering in Egypt.

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 7: “Jehovah added:

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have certainly seen the affliction
of my people who are in Egypt,

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:55.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I have heard their outcry
because of those who force them to work;

00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I well know the pains they suffer.’”

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah wasn’t blind
to the misery of his people.

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:05.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t deaf to their cries for help.

00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their anguish became his own.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the expression
at the end of the verse?

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I well know the pains they suffer.”

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding the phrase “I well know,”
one reference work states:

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The expression implies personal feeling,

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tenderness, and compassion.”

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:27.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah’s words here
reveal a deeply concerned,

00:05:27.443 --> 00:05:30.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring, and compassionate God.

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what would Jehovah do?

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he act kindly on that compassion?

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know he was going to.

00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10, in part,
Jehovah commissioned Moses:

00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:42.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bring my people . . . out of Egypt.”

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:46.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, this account should be
encouraging to us.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:49.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be sure that Jehovah
sees our adversities.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hears our cries for help.

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:55.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows the pain that we suffer at times.

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:58.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah just doesn’t <i>feel </i>
compassion for us.

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he’s moved to act kindly.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:7
—he cares for each one of us.

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s compassion also gives us
reason for hope.

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister who struggled
with depression and discouragement

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found comfort in this account
about Moses and the thornbush.

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:19.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the holy ground
that we read about in verse 5.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister said:

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If Jehovah can make even the dirt holy,

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:28.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then maybe there is a little hope for me.”

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:31.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, she’d benefited
from Jehovah’s compassion.

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so far we’ve seen the need
to avoid misplaced compassion.

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve considered Jehovah’s example
of not only <i>feeling</i>  compassion

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but <i>acting </i> kindly on it.

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate him?

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One quality that can help is love

00:06:46.122 --> 00:06:48.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—unselfish love—
of neighbor.

00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider two practical ways
that can help us

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:54.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we can show this type of compassion.

00:06:54.897 --> 00:06:57.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, compassion will help us to avoid

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reacting harshly when others make mistakes.

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:04.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that earlier we quoted
Ephesians 4:32,

00:07:04.373 --> 00:07:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
linking kindness and compassion.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:08.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s turn to the verse
just previous to it

00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ephesians 4 and let’s read verse 31—
Ephesians 4:31.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that thought in mind:
Compassion will help us

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid reacting harshly
when others make mistakes.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31: “Put away from yourselves
every kind of malicious bitterness,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech,

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as everything injurious.”

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then verse 32 says:
“But [there’s the connector, but]

00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become kind to one another,

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tenderly compassionate.”

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether at home, in the congregation,

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Bethel, on construction sites
—wherever we may be—

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s allow love,
this unselfish love of neighbor,

00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause us to show compassion

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid reacting harshly
when others make mistakes.

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second way that love can help us
to be compassionate

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that it will help us
to avoid the imperfect tendency

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to abuse power.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:12 states:

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Clothe yourselves with the tender affections
of compassion, kindness.”

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are the two linked together again,

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the verse adds “humility
[or “lowliness of mind,” ftn.].”

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once made
this point about that verse:

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lowliness of mind
enables us to put ourselves

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:29.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the position of those
under our supervision.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To be compassionate involves
being humble and reasonable

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rather than hard to please.

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Efficiency should not be an excuse

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for treating people
as mere parts of a machine”

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good points to keep in mind.

00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those are two ways that love
can help us to be compassionate:

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid reacting harshly
when others make mistakes,

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid the imperfect tendency
to abuse power.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while the moral climate
has killed compassion

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hearts of so many today,

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to be known for our compassion.

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:09.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, never would we want
to display misplaced compassion

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:12.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone deliberately persists in sin.

00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we want to imitate Jehovah

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kindly act on our feelings of compassion
for those in need.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we go about our day,
let’s look for ways

00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:25.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can heed the admonition
there at Ephesians 4:32:

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become kind to one another,
tenderly compassionate.”

00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:03.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You know, a very simple way

00:00:03.553 --> 00:00:05.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to visualize Romans 12:2

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to use a rock and clay.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, we want to be like a rock

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:16.166 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Satan’s hands—resisting his molding.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we want to be like clay

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, being like a rock in Satan’s hand

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:28.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really represents
the first part of Romans 12:2

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that says: “Stop being molded
by this system of things.”

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And being clay in Jehovah’s hands

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very similar to the thought

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the rest of Romans 12:2 that says

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be transformed by making your mind over.”

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate the difference

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between our reaction when Satan tries

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shape and mold us
with this system of things

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
versus when Jehovah wants to.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to think that
maybe, you’re in a public place

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’re at a shopping mall or someplace—

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:04.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a perfect stranger walks up behind you

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starts to massage your shoulders.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do?

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would stiffen up and say:
“Get away! What are you doing?”

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if someone you love and trust does that,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you might relax
and have a very different reaction, right?

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:23.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is our reaction when Satan

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants to try to shape and mold us?

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s being like a rock.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Jehovah wants
to shape and mold us,

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to be like clay.

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s consider one rocklike quality

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to resist
Satan’s shaping and molding of us.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s courage.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To start that discussion on courage,

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:47.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s open our Bibles
to a very straightforward,

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simple statement at Psalm 56:3.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 56:3 says:

00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Satan uses fear
and intimidation and persecution

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get us to change
our relationship with Jehovah,

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to break our integrity,
to stop us from worshipping Jehovah.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you read the accounts in JW News

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our brothers in Russia,
I’m sure all of us have some reactions,

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you’re thinking,
‘Wow! How would I deal

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that kind of persecution?’

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you’re a wife, maybe you think,

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now, how would I deal
with my husband being put into prison

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having these kinds
of things done to him?’

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, in many ways, we are very proud

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:46.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the courage, the rocklike qualities,

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:50.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers are showing
when Satan tries to shape and mold them.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was particularly moved
when I read the account

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the brothers and sisters
in Russia in Orenburg.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here a group of brothers
and sisters boldly went to the prison,

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identified themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses
(at some risk of their own freedom),

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to know how their brothers

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were being treated in the prison.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we really, truly proud of those kinds

00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of rocklike qualities
that we see in our brothers and sisters?

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, it also takes courage

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resist other kinds of ways

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:27.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan is trying to mold and shape us.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes courage, for example,
to change the channel

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:34.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to click the mouse away
from bad entertainment.

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we rocklike in that kind of courage?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes courage
to face sickness or a terminal illness

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the rocklike hope and strength

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is going to be a resurrection.

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes courage to watch the news these days

00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see all that is going on in the world

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep our rocklike courage and faith

00:03:57.854 --> 00:03:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a new world coming

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the end of this system is coming.

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the lesson for us is this:

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:08.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we like a rock in Satan’s hands?

00:04:08.698 --> 00:04:10.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it possible that we have become

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soft and comfortable
in this system of things?

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how are we doing

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about being clay in Jehovah’s hands?

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 64:8

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this discussion about the clay

00:04:32.956 --> 00:04:37.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it shows the choice
that we’ve made—Isaiah 64:8.

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:42.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But now, O Jehovah,
you are our Father.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are the clay, and you are our Potter;

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all the work of your hand.”

00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes when I’ve heard this read,

00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes people say,
“We are the clay, and you are the Potter.”

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, that word “our”
is very important.

00:04:58.047 --> 00:05:01.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are the clay, and you are <i>our</i>  Potter.”

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that we’ve made a choice

00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that Jehovah is the one
to shape and mold us.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:12.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine clay that you go
to shape and mold it, and it says:

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ow! Hey, don’t do that!
Hey, I don’t want to look like that.

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t change me like that.”

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK, OK, OK.”

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of reaction are we having

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah is trying to shape and mold us?

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider two claylike qualities

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:35.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can have when Jehovah
is trying to shape and mold us.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, obedience.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s clear to all of us that Jehovah

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shaping and molding and preparing us

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the end of this system of things

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the events that are leading
directly up to the great tribulation.

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we be obedient when we get direction

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how to preach, how to do our meetings,

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what assignment we may have
during that turbulent time?

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, yesterday Brother Splane

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made some excellent comments
about King Solomon.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, King Solomon
had some divine instruction,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he ignored it, and he basically said,

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know,
I can marry lots of foreign wives,

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s not going to have any effect on me.’

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to have that kind of attitude
when it comes to divine instruction.

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we could be like an athlete
who hires a coach,

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:29.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pays him lots of money, and says,
“What can I do to be better?”

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the athlete says: “Well, you know,
I’m the professional athlete.

00:06:32.075 --> 00:06:35.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really don’t need to listen
to what you have to say.”

00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:38.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah is giving us counsel and advice.

00:06:38.347 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to listen.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, this virus
that is spreading around

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is giving us an opportunity
to see about being obedient.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many rules or guidelines
that are being set for us.

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be quarantined.

00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have trips and other things canceled.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may be told to wash our hands

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to not shake hands, but elbow bump.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, we can try hard

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be obedient to those rules and guidelines,

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also have an opportunity
to not just be obedient

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rules and guidelines

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but be obedient
to the principles behind them.

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this case,
often the principle is love of neighbor.

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to look out for others

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these rules and guidelines
when it comes to the virus.

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, when you think about it,

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any of the opportunities we have now

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a time to practice being obedient.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, view it as training for us.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have an opportunity
to practice being obedient for the future.

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s at times like these
that we can set a pattern of obedience,

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because with time and effort and practice,

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can make obedience our first reaction

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than a second reaction.

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s another claylike quality
that we could have?

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s spiritual focus.

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah is making it perfectly clear
that we’re living in the last days.

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the people of Noah’s time,

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they took no note”
of the time they were living in.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have that claylike quality,
and they were swept away.

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a video recently
of an athlete doing a track meet.

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were running a race around the track,

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when this one athlete
crossed the finish line,

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he threw his hands up and he was
absolutely jubilant that he had won the race.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he didn’t see anybody
cheering for him,

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the rest of the runners were running.

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was too early.
There was one more lap to go.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he lost track of where he was.

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t know that that wasn’t the last lap.

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t want to lose track

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:58.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of where we are in the race for life,

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being so busy with doing other things.

00:09:02.024 --> 00:09:06.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the fact that we’re living
in the last of the last days

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:10.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
influence our day-to-day decisions.

00:09:10.032 --> 00:09:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Become claylike, moldable
—we’re living in the last days.

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay attention to the Bible principles

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are mentioned to us
in <i>The Watchtower  </i>and our meetings

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have good spiritual conversations.

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:25.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those conversations can help to remind us

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:27.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the time in which we’re living.

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the lesson for us is this:

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have chosen Jehovah to be your Potter.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be good, obedient,

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritually-focused clay in his hands.

00:09:40.896 --> 00:09:44.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to be
like a rock in Satan’s hands,

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we need to be
like clay in Jehovah’s hands.

00:00:01 Our text comments today
00:00:03 highlight this point about a husband.
00:00:04 Notice it says:
00:00:06 “Although he cannot always do
00:00:08 “as she [that is, his wife] asks,
00:00:10 “he often arrives at a more balanced decision
00:00:13 by consulting her.”
00:00:15 Well, those of us who are husbands
00:00:17 know the truthfulness of those words, don’t we?
00:00:20 Now, there are a number of qualities
00:00:22 that this statement may bring to mind.
00:00:24 And one of those qualities
00:00:26 is the quality of reasonableness.
00:00:28 That’s a quality that all of us need to display.
00:00:32 How would you describe a reasonable person?
00:00:36 What examples of reasonableness
00:00:38 do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?
00:00:40 And what can we learn from their example?
00:00:43 Well, let’s first consider that description.
00:00:45 Our publications have stated
00:00:47 that a reasonable person is patient, gentle,
00:00:51 and kind in his dealings with himself and with others.
00:00:55 He takes into consideration
00:00:57 others’ limitations and their circumstances.
00:01:00 Someone with a reputation of being reasonable
00:01:04 is flexible when circumstances warrant it.
00:01:07 It’s like that husband that we just mentioned.
00:01:10 When he is reasonable as he consults with his wife,
00:01:13 he’s willing to listen to her and, when appropriate,
00:01:16 to go along with her wishes.
00:01:19 Now notice with me at Philippians 4:5
00:01:22 the inspired counsel about this quality of reasonableness.
00:01:27 Please turn there in Philippians chapter 4,
00:01:30 and notice what the Bible tells us in the A portion of verse 5.
00:01:35 It states:
00:01:36 “Let your reasonableness become known to all men.”
00:01:41 So others should see us displaying this quality.
00:01:46 Another translation renders the verse:
00:01:48 “Have a reputation for being reasonable.”
00:01:53 So notice, it’s not so much how we view ourselves,
00:01:56 whether we feel we’re reasonable,
00:01:59 rather, it’s how others see us —how we are known,
00:02:03 if we have the reputation of being reasonable.
00:02:07 When you think about it,
00:02:09 reasonableness attracts, doesn’t it,
00:02:12 whereas unreasonableness tends to drive away?
00:02:16 Well, now that we have that description,
00:02:19 what examples of reasonableness do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?
00:02:23 Let’s consider Jehovah’s example first.
00:02:26 And if you turn with me to Leviticus chapter 5,
00:02:28 let’s look at an example of his reasonableness
00:02:31 with the nation of Israel.
00:02:32 Leviticus chapter 5,
00:02:35 and notice there in verse 5 to begin.
00:02:40 It says: “If he becomes guilty as respects one of these things
00:02:43 “[talking about someone who’s committed a sin, it says],
00:02:47 then he must confess in what he has sinned.”
00:02:49 Verse 6: “He will also bring his guilt offering
00:02:52 “to Jehovah for the sin that he committed,
00:02:54 “namely, a female from the flock,
00:02:57 either a female lamb or a young female goat, for a sin offering.”
00:03:02 So that was plain.
00:03:04 But notice Jehovah’s reasonableness in verse 7:
00:03:08 “If, though, he cannot afford a sheep,
00:03:11 “he must bring to Jehovah two turtledoves
00:03:13 or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for the sin.”
00:03:18 So that was reasonable on Jehovah’s part.
00:03:21 But Jehovah took it a step further.
00:03:23 Notice verse 11:
00:03:25 “Now if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
00:03:29 “he must bring as his offering for his sin
00:03:32 a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.”
00:03:37 So notice, Jehovah was reasonable in what he expected,
00:03:41 depending on the Israelites’ financial circumstances.
00:03:45 As we read verse 11, you may have wondered, ‘Well, what’s a tenth of an ephah?’
00:03:49 Well, our footnote helps us.
00:03:51 You notice what it says?
00:03:53 “A tenth of an ephah equaled 2.2 L
00:03:56 (2 dry qt).”
00:03:59 Notice this image of an Israelite woman.
00:04:02 She’s of very limited means, and she’s holding out
00:04:05 —possibly to give to the priest— her sin offering of two quarts of flour.
00:04:11 It wasn’t much, was it?
00:04:13 Here in Leviticus, it was as if Jehovah was saying:
00:04:16 ‘If you don’t have enough for a lamb or a goat, that’s OK.
00:04:21 ‘If you don’t have enough for those two small birds, don’t worry.
00:04:25 Just bring me two quarts of flour as your sacrifice.’
00:04:30 Well, imagine how happy a poor Israelite like this woman would have been
00:04:34 that Jehovah valued her small offering
00:04:37 just as much as one of the costlier sacrifices
00:04:40 presented by her wealthier neighbors!
00:04:44 But did you notice an important detail there in verse 11 about the flour?
00:04:48 The flour that the needy Israelite
00:04:51 was to offer wasn’t just any type of flour.
00:04:53 Did you see there in the verse?
00:04:54 It was to be fine flour,
00:04:57 such as that used to prepare a meal for an honored guest.
00:05:02 So though the poor Israelite couldn’t give as much as others,
00:05:06 the little they offered to Jehovah was to be their best.
00:05:10 In effect, Jehovah was saying, ‘I realize you can’t offer as much as others,
00:05:14 but I know, I know, that you’re going to give me your best.’
00:05:20 What’s the lesson?
00:05:22 Jehovah displays reasonableness
00:05:24 by taking into consideration our limitations and our circumstances.
00:05:29 You know, some brothers and sisters can offer
00:05:31 in their service the equivalent of a lamb or a goat.
00:05:35 Others can offer the equivalent of two turtledoves or two pigeons.
00:05:39 And perhaps in the past, some of us
00:05:41 were able to offer the same in our assignments.
00:05:44 But right now, because of our circumstances,
00:05:46 because of limitations, maybe we’re not able to.
00:05:50 Well, what do we know about Jehovah?
00:05:52 He graciously and reasonably accepts our best
00:05:57 in his service even if that’s comparable
00:05:59 to two quarts of fine flour.
00:06:03 What a reasonable God we worship
00:06:05 and a good lesson for us to be reasonable
00:06:08 and not compare ourselves with others
00:06:11 or to expect more than we should of our brothers and sisters!
00:06:16 Now, what about Jesus’ example?
00:06:18 He set an example in reasonableness
00:06:20 by being patient and kind in his dealings
00:06:22 with his disciples despite their shortcomings.
00:06:26 Let’s notice an example.
00:06:27 Turn with me to Luke chapter 22,
00:06:30 and let’s notice an example of Jesus’ reasonableness.
00:06:33 Luke chapter 22
00:06:35 —the setting is shortly before Jesus’ death,
00:06:38 and he’s aware that Peter is soon going to deny him three times.
00:06:42 So, what did Jesus do?
00:06:44 He encouraged Peter.
00:06:45 Notice verse 32.
00:06:48 Jesus said: “But I have made supplication
00:06:50 “for you that your faith may not give out;
00:06:53 and you, once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”
00:06:58 Notice the encouragement?
00:07:00 Jesus said: “I have made supplication for you.”
00:07:02 In other words, Jesus prayed in Peter’s behalf
00:07:05 that Peter’s faith not give out.
00:07:07 And then he told him:
00:07:09 “Once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”
00:07:12 Jesus expressed confidence that Peter,
00:07:15 after a short lapse, would return to faithful service
00:07:18 and he would strengthen his brothers
00:07:21 —and that despite the fact, you notice in verse 34,
00:07:24 Jesus told him, ‘You’re going to deny me three times.’
00:07:28 Now, how does this account show reasonableness on Jesus’ part?
00:07:32 Well, you may remember what Jesus had said sometime earlier,
00:07:35 as recorded at Matthew 10:33.
00:07:38 He said: “Whoever disowns me before men,
00:07:41 I will also disown him.”
00:07:45 Now, that was a strong statement,
00:07:47 and Jesus could have applied that to Peter.
00:07:50 But demonstrating reasonableness, Jesus didn’t reject Peter.
00:07:54 Why?
00:07:56 Because Jesus knew that there were going to be
00:07:58 extenuating circumstances.
00:08:00 He was willing to forgive his repentant apostle
00:08:03 and express confidence in what Peter would do in the future.
00:08:08 So the lesson?
00:08:10 We should look for the good in our brothers.
00:08:13 Brother Splane highlighted that on Saturday for us, didn’t he?
00:08:16 Despite their imperfections,
00:08:18 we should express confidence and faith in our brothers.
00:08:22 We should be reasonable in what we expect of others.
00:08:25 Who knows?
00:08:26 They may be facing challenges that we either don’t know about
00:08:30 or that we don’t fully understand.
00:08:32 One Watchtower stated this:
00:08:35 “How much better it is to commend our brothers
00:08:38 for what they do than to judge them for what they do not do!”
00:08:45 Like Jesus, let’s be reasonable when love calls for it
00:08:49 and circumstances warrant it.
00:08:52 Well, what have we considered?
00:08:54 A reasonable person is patient, kind, and gentle
00:08:58 in his dealings with himself and with others.
00:09:01 He takes into consideration the limitations
00:09:04 and the circumstances of others.
00:09:06 Reasonableness attracts,
00:09:09 unreasonableness tends to drive away.
00:09:14 What excellent examples we have in reasonableness with Jehovah and Jesus!
00:09:18 Remember the fine flour and the need to look for the good in others,
00:09:22 expressing confidence in them.
00:09:24 So as we go about our day,
00:09:26 may we look for opportunities
00:09:28 to let our reasonableness become known to all men.

Our text comments today

00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:04.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
highlight this point about a husband.

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:06.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Notice it says:

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:08.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Although he cannot always do

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“as she [that is, his wife] asks,

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:13.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“he often arrives at a more balanced decision

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:15.632 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by consulting her.”

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those of us who are husbands

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know the truthfulness
of those words, don’t we?

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are a number of qualities

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this statement may bring to mind.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of those qualities

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the quality of reasonableness.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a quality
that all of us need to display.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:36.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you describe a reasonable person?

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What examples of reasonableness

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:40.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can we learn from their example?

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s first consider that description.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have stated

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a reasonable person is patient, gentle,

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kind in his dealings
with himself and with others.

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes into consideration

00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others’ limitations and their circumstances.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:04.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone with a reputation of being reasonable

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is flexible when circumstances warrant it.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like that husband
that we just mentioned.

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he is reasonable
as he consults with his wife,

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s willing to listen to her
and, when appropriate,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go along with her wishes.

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:22.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice with me at Philippians 4:5

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the inspired counsel
about this quality of reasonableness.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:30.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there in Philippians chapter 4,

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what the Bible tells us
in the <i>A </i>portion of verse 5.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:36.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It states:

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your reasonableness
become known to all men.”

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So others should see us
displaying this quality.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another translation renders the verse:

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have a reputation for being reasonable.”

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:56.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, it’s not so much
how we view ourselves,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we feel we’re reasonable, 

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather, it’s how others see us
—how we are known,

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have the reputation
of being reasonable.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think about it,

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasonableness attracts, doesn’t it,

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas unreasonableness tends to drive away?

00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now that we have that description,

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:23.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what examples of reasonableness
do we find in Jehovah and Jesus?

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider Jehovah’s example first.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn with me
to Leviticus chapter 5,

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s look at an example
of his reasonableness

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the nation of Israel.

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leviticus chapter 5,

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:40.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice there in verse 5 to begin.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “If he becomes guilty
as respects one of these things

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[talking about someone
who’s committed a sin, it says],

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then he must confess in what he has sinned.”

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 6:
“He will also bring his guilt offering

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to Jehovah for the sin that he committed,

00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“namely, a female from the flock,

00:02:57.694 --> 00:03:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either a female lamb or a young female goat,
for a sin offering.”

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was plain.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice
Jehovah’s reasonableness in verse 7:

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:11.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, though, he cannot afford a sheep,

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he must bring to Jehovah two turtledoves

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or two young pigeons
as his guilt offering for the sin.”

00:03:18.314 --> 00:03:21.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was reasonable on Jehovah’s part.

00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah took it a step further.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 11:

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if he cannot afford
two turtledoves or two young pigeons,

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he must bring as his offering for his sin

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:36.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a tenth of an ephah
of fine flour for a sin offering.”

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, Jehovah
was reasonable in what he expected,

00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:45.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depending on
the Israelites’ financial circumstances.

00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verse 11, you may have wondered,
‘Well, what’s a tenth of an ephah?’

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our footnote helps us.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:52.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice what it says?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A tenth of an ephah equaled 2.2 L

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2 dry qt).”

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this image of an Israelite woman.

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:05.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s of very limited means,
and she’s holding out

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—possibly to give to the priest—
her sin offering of two quarts of flour.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t much, was it?

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in Leviticus,
it was as if Jehovah was saying:

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:21.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you don’t have enough
for a lamb or a goat, that’s OK.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you don’t have enough
for those two small birds, don’t worry.

00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:30.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just bring me two quarts
of flour as your sacrifice.’

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, imagine how happy a poor Israelite
like this woman would have been

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah valued her small offering

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as much
as one of the costlier sacrifices

00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:43.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented by her wealthier neighbors!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice an important detail
there in verse 11 about the flour?

00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The flour that the needy Israelite

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to offer wasn’t just any type of flour.

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:54.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see there in the verse?

00:04:54.744 --> 00:04:57.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was to be fine flour,

00:04:57.847 --> 00:05:02.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as that used to prepare
a meal for an honored guest.

00:05:02.652 --> 00:05:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So though the poor Israelite
couldn’t give as much as others,

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the little they offered to Jehovah
was to be their best.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:14.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, Jehovah was saying,
‘I realize you can’t offer as much as others,

00:05:14.764 --> 00:05:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know, I know, that you’re going
to give me your best.’

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah displays reasonableness

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by taking into consideration
our limitations and our circumstances.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, some brothers and sisters can offer

00:05:31.881 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their service
the equivalent of a lamb or a goat.

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others can offer the equivalent
of two turtledoves or two pigeons.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps in the past, some of us

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to offer the same
in our assignments.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right now, because of our circumstances,

00:05:46.996 --> 00:05:50.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of limitations,
maybe we’re not able to.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we know about Jehovah?

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He graciously and reasonably accepts our best

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his service even if that’s comparable

00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to two quarts of fine flour.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a reasonable God we worship

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:08.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good lesson for us to be reasonable

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not compare ourselves with others

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to expect more than we should
of our brothers and sisters!

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about Jesus’ example?

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He set an example in reasonableness

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:22.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being patient and kind in his dealings

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his disciples
despite their shortcomings.

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s notice an example.

00:06:27.837 --> 00:06:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Luke chapter 22,

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice an example
of Jesus’ reasonableness.

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke chapter 22

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the setting is shortly before Jesus’ death,

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s aware that Peter
is soon going to deny him three times.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus do?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged Peter.

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 32.

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “But I have made supplication

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you that your faith may not give out;

00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you, once you have returned,
strengthen your brothers.”

00:06:58.234 --> 00:07:00.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the encouragement?

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:02.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:
“I have made supplication for you.”

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:05.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
Jesus prayed in Peter’s behalf

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Peter’s faith not give out.

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:09.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he told him:

00:07:09.112 --> 00:07:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Once you have returned,
strengthen your brothers.”

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus expressed confidence that Peter,

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after a short lapse,
would return to faithful service

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would strengthen his brothers

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that despite the fact,
you notice in verse 34,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told him,
‘You’re going to deny me three times.’

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does this account
show reasonableness on Jesus’ part?

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you may remember
what Jesus had said sometime earlier,

00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:38.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Matthew 10:33.

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Whoever disowns me
before men,

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will also disown him.”

00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was a strong statement,

00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus could have applied that to Peter.

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But demonstrating reasonableness,
Jesus didn’t reject Peter.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:07:56.225 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus knew
that there were going to be

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:00.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extenuating circumstances.

00:08:00.696 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was willing to forgive
his repentant apostle

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and express confidence
in what Peter would do in the future.

00:08:08.304 --> 00:08:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the lesson?

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should look for the good in our brothers.

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Splane highlighted that
on Saturday for us, didn’t he?

00:08:16.412 --> 00:08:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite their imperfections,

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should express confidence
and faith in our brothers.

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:25.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should be reasonable
in what we expect of others.

00:08:25.454 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows?

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may be facing challenges
that we either don’t know about

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:32.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that we don’t fully understand.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One <i>Watchtower </i>stated this:

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How much better it is
to commend our brothers

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:43.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what they do than to judge them
for what they do not do!”

00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, let’s be reasonable
when love calls for it

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and circumstances warrant it.

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:54.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what have we considered?

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A reasonable person
is patient, kind, and gentle

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:01.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his dealings with himself and with others.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes into consideration the limitations

00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the circumstances of others.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reasonableness attracts,

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:14.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unreasonableness tends to drive away.

00:09:14.036 --> 00:09:18.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What excellent examples we have
in reasonableness with Jehovah and Jesus!

00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the fine flour
and the need to look for the good in others,

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing confidence in them.

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we go about our day,

00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we look for opportunities

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:32.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to let our reasonableness
become known to all men.

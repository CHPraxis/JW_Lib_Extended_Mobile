00:00:01 Modesty is absolutely essential
00:00:05 to having a good relationship
00:00:06 with our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:00:09 We remember what Micah 6:8 tells us:
00:00:13 “He has told you, O man, what is good.
00:00:17 “And what is Jehovah requiring of you?
00:00:20 “Only to exercise justice,
00:00:23 “to cherish loyalty,
00:00:25 and to walk in modesty with your God!”
00:00:30 Well now, what does modesty mean to you?
00:00:34 You probably, when you listened to the comments this morning,
00:00:37 heard a variety of different definitions.
00:00:40 All of them had a common theme,
00:00:42 but each one had a slightly different sense.
00:00:46 The Watchtower  of 2000 made some very interesting comments
00:00:50 about the definition of modesty.
00:00:52 It said: “Modesty can mean a number of things,
00:00:55 “such as a lack of conceit, or vanity,
00:01:00 “and a reluctance to boast  about one’s abilities,
00:01:03 “achievements, and possessions.
00:01:06 “According to one reference work,
00:01:09 “modesty also means ‘keeping within bounds.’
00:01:13 “A modest person
00:01:15 “stays within the bounds of good behavior.
00:01:19 “He also acknowledges  that there are limits
00:01:22 “to what he ought to do  and is able to do.
00:01:26 “He knows that there are things
00:01:29 to which he is not entitled.”
00:01:31 That’s a very interesting definition, isn’t it?
00:01:34 And it kind of helps us to see
00:01:36 that there are many shades of meaning involved with this word.
00:01:40 But let’s center our discussion this morning on that last thought.
00:01:45 A modest person “acknowledges that there are limits
00:01:49 to what he ought to do and is able to do.”
00:01:53 Well now, to be modest, we understand,
00:01:56 involves recognizing our own personal limitations.
00:01:59 And sometimes it’s easier to be able to see our physical limitations.
00:02:04 For example, if you’re not a strong swimmer,  probably when you go to the beach,
00:02:08 you won’t swim right out into the ocean, will you?
00:02:11 You’ll recognize your limitations.
00:02:13 Or if you’re not in good shape,
00:02:16 you probably won’t sign up for the New York marathon.
00:02:19 You see, we are able to see
00:02:21 that we’re not able to do some of these physical tasks.
00:02:25 But modesty goes far beyond
00:02:28 just simply acknowledging our own physical limitations.
00:02:32 Now let’s look at an example from the Scriptures
00:02:34 that can help us to see this, perhaps more clearly.
00:02:37 Let’s go to 1 Samuel chapter 26,
00:02:42 and we’re going to start reading here at verse 7,
00:02:45 so 1 Samuel 26:7.
00:02:48 Now, just to set the context for you here,
00:02:52 you’ll remember that David had been hiding from King Saul,
00:02:56 who was seeking to kill him.
00:02:58 Now, a golden opportunity came for David
00:03:01 to be able to put an end to Saul
00:03:05 and to all of this hiding that David had had to be doing for so long.
00:03:10 Now, let’s read what it says, verse 7:
00:03:12 “So David and Abishai made their way to the troops by night,
00:03:16 “and they found Saul lying asleep in the camp enclosure
00:03:20 “with his spear stuck to the ground next to his head;
00:03:24 “Abner and the troops were lying all around him.
00:03:28 “Abishai now said to David:
00:03:30 “‘Today God has surrendered your enemy into your hand.
00:03:35 “‘And now, please, let me pin him to the ground
00:03:38 “‘with the spear just once,
00:03:40 “and I will not need to do it twice.’
00:03:44 “However, David said to Abishai:
00:03:48 “‘Do not harm him,
00:03:50 “‘for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah
00:03:54 “and remain innocent?’
00:03:56 “David continued:
00:03:58 “‘As surely as Jehovah is living,
00:04:01 “‘Jehovah himself will strike him down,
00:04:04 “‘or his day will come and he will die,
00:04:07 “‘or he will go down into battle and perish.
00:04:10 “‘It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint
00:04:14 “‘for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah!
00:04:17 “‘So now take, please, the spear next to his head and the water jug,
00:04:22 and let us be on our way.’”
00:04:24 Well now, it would have been so easy
00:04:27 for David to kill Saul, right?
00:04:30 But what helped David
00:04:33 to act modestly in this situation?
00:04:36 Well, let’s consider the first factor:
00:04:39 David had to consider his own position,
00:04:43 or his own authority.
00:04:45 Now, had Jehovah instructed David to kill Saul?
00:04:50 No.
00:04:51 Jehovah had never assigned David to carry out that task.
00:04:55 After all, Saul was anointed by Jehovah
00:04:59 to be the king of Israel,
00:05:01 so David acknowledged
00:05:04 that he simply did not have the authority to kill Saul.
00:05:07 It was not his place.
00:05:10 But now, let’s consider a second factor.
00:05:13 Notice verse 10.
00:05:15 Do you remember what David said?
00:05:17 He said: “As surely as Jehovah is living,
00:05:20 “Jehovah himself will strike him down,
00:05:24 “or his day will come and he will die,
00:05:27 or he will go down into battle and perish.”
00:05:30 Well, what’s the point?
00:05:32 You see, David had complete confidence in Jehovah.
00:05:36 You see, instead of taking matters into his own hands,
00:05:39 he had the total confidence
00:05:41 that Jehovah was going to handle this situation
00:05:44 in his own way and in his own time
00:05:48 David modestly trusted in Jehovah.
00:05:53 Well, David acted modestly on that occasion.
00:05:56 But perhaps you can think of a few other occasions later in his life
00:06:00 when he didn’t act so modestly.
00:06:02 What’s the lesson?
00:06:05 Modesty is a quality
00:06:07 that we must work hard to develop,
00:06:10 but we must also work hard to maintain our modesty.
00:06:14 Otherwise, our minds can begin to focus
00:06:18 on our strengths, on our talents, and on our abilities
00:06:23 to such an extent
00:06:25 that we begin to get a very distorted view of self.
00:06:30 When that happens, our modesty can begin to disappear,
00:06:34 and we can begin to behave presumptuously.
00:06:37 Now, who is one of the greatest examples of this in the Bible?
00:06:42 Well, perhaps right away you think of the example of Uzziah.
00:06:47 And if you go in your Bible to 2 Chronicles chapter 26,
00:06:51 let’s just review for a minute
00:06:53 what we know about Uzziah and what happened to him.
00:06:57 You see in 2 Chronicles 26:4—
00:07:01 Do you see what it says?
00:07:03 “He [speaking of Uzziah]
00:07:05 “continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes,
00:07:09 “just as his father Amaziah had done.
00:07:12 “And [you notice this] he kept searching for God
00:07:16 “in the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear the true God.
00:07:20 “During the time he was searching for Jehovah,
00:07:23 the true God made him prosper.”
00:07:25 Now, do you hear the modesty there? Did you hear it?
00:07:30 Well, you see, it says Uzziah was not a self-satisfied person
00:07:34 at that point in his life.
00:07:36 He was searching for Jehovah.
00:07:39 He felt the need for Jehovah’s guidance
00:07:42 and wisdom and blessing in his life.
00:07:45 But what happened?
00:07:47 If you go down to verse 16, do you see?
00:07:50 “However, as soon as he was strong,
00:07:53 “his heart became haughty to his own ruin,
00:07:58 “and he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God
00:08:02 “by entering the temple of Jehovah
00:08:04 to burn incense on the altar of incense.”
00:08:07 Can you imagine?
00:08:09 He became so emboldened
00:08:11 that he actually went into Jehovah’s temple
00:08:13 and burned incense on the altar of incense.
00:08:16 Well, the priests came running.
00:08:18 And what did they say to him? Do you see verse 18?
00:08:21 “It is not proper for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Jehovah!
00:08:26 “It is only the priest who should burn incense,
00:08:29 “for they are the descendants of Aaron, those who have been sanctified.
00:08:33 “Go out from the sanctuary,
00:08:35 “for you have acted unfaithfully
00:08:38 and you will receive no glory from Jehovah God for this.”
00:08:43 Well, Uzziah started out fearing God.
00:08:47 He started out searching for Jehovah,
00:08:50 but when he became powerful, what happened?
00:08:53 He quickly lost his modesty.
00:08:57 Well now, brothers, why is this an important discussion,
00:09:00 really, for all of us?
00:09:03 Well, all of us face trying situations in life.
00:09:07 And when we face those situations,
00:09:10 we may be tempted
00:09:12 to want to rush in and handle them.
00:09:16 We may be tempted to ignore Bible principles
00:09:20 and even published direction that we have
00:09:23 from “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:09:26 How wise we are in those moments, in those situations,
00:09:31 to step back for a moment,
00:09:33 take a deep breath, count to ten,
00:09:37 and say to ourselves:
00:09:39 ‘Do I really have the authority to do what I’m about to do?
00:09:43 ‘Is it really my place to say what I’m about to say?
00:09:48 ‘Instead, would it be better
00:09:51 to wait on Jehovah to correct this situation?’
00:09:55 You see, by having a proper view of self,
00:09:59 by sticking closely to the direction that we have from Jehovah
00:10:03 and from “the faithful and discreet slave,”
00:10:06 and by maintaining our full and complete confidence
00:10:09 that Jehovah will correct any matters
00:10:12 that need to be rectified,
00:10:15 we can have the privilege to walk
00:10:17 —not just for a short time but to walk eternally—
00:10:21 in modesty with our magnificent,
00:10:24 our wonderful God, Jehovah.

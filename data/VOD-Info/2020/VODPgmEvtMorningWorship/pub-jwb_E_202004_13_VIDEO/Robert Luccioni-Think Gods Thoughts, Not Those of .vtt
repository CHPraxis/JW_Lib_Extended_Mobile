“You think, not God’s thoughts,

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but those of men.”

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.426 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Has that ever happened to us?

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:13.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When is it particularly dangerous to do so?

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.232 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, the text for today is based

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the events of Matthew 16:21-23,

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read that together.

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 16:21:

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From that time forward,
Jesus began explaining to his disciples

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he must go to Jerusalem
and suffer many things

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the elders and chief priests
and scribes and be killed,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and on the third day be raised up.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Peter took him aside
and began to rebuke him, saying:

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will not have
this happen to you at all.’

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But turning his back, he said to Peter:
‘Get behind me, Satan!

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You are a stumbling block to me,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you think,
not God’s thoughts, but those of men.’”

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus here had just expressed

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real events that were
going to take place.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that “from that time forward,”
he began to explain them.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this account and parallel accounts,

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see he began
to talk about what was going to happen,

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were going to go,
and what would happen to him,

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even what was
going to happen to the apostles.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Peter say?

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He, in effect, said:
‘No, no, Jesus. No, no, you’re wrong.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You’re not thinking right.
You’re overreacting.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing is going to happen.’

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:32.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, while Peter
took the brunt of the counsel,

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the parallel account in Mark chapter 8

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicates that perhaps
the other apostles

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thought the same way.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, they found that what Jesus
was saying was hard to believe.

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was the problem?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were not wicked men.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were spiritual men.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the problem was
that at that moment,

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were using human reasoning
—thoughts of men—

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than realizing that Jesus
was expressing God’s thoughts.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus immediately
corrected their thinking.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, at this crucial time,
he needed Peter and the apostles,

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in front of him as stumbling blocks,

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but behind him as willing supporters.

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this time, Jesus needed
supporters, not distracters.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the apostles
obviously got the message.

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s no indication that Jesus
ever had to counsel them like that again.

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:26.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at Luke 22:28,

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus even commended them and said:

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are the ones
who have stuck with me in my trials.”

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, they learned
a very valuable lesson.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was that?

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That lesson was this:
Trust Jehovah,

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust the channel
that Jehovah is using.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they did that,
they would be thinking God’s thoughts.

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they also learned
that it was imperative that they did so,

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially as pressures mounted

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they got closer
to the end of Jesus’ ministry.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about us?

00:02:57.327 --> 00:02:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do?

00:02:59.028 --> 00:03:01.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we think thoughts of men?

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we think God’s thoughts?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt all of us struggle at times.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I do.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m very sure that at times Jesus
would like to say to me,

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:14.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps he does, ‘Rob, you’re
thinking, not thoughts of God but,

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather, thoughts of men’ because of
how I react to things at times.

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt we all do that.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have to be careful, though,

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because events and pressures at times

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause us to only see things

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the perspective of humans
—human thinking.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:36.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when would that be
particularly dangerous?

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when you think about it,

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s very easy to trust Jehovah
and his representatives

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things are going well.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also quite easy to trust Jehovah
and the channel he’s using

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things are obvious.

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:54.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not always so easy to do

00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things become confusing

00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or when things start to get more dire.

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may think of the nation of Israel

00:04:02.725 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they were getting ready
to leave Egypt.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at Exodus chapter 11,

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice chapter 11 and verse 3.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “And Jehovah gave the people
favor in the eyes of the Egyptians.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, Moses himself
had become highly esteemed

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the land of Egypt
among Pharaoh’s servants

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and among the people.”

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interesting thing is at this time,

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites and the Egyptians
had already seen the nine plagues.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious
that something was going on,

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many were willing to follow Moses
—do exactly what he said.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look in chapter 12,
we see Moses giving direction:

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:42.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay in your homes,
what to eat, how to cook it, how to eat it.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at chapter 12 and verse 50,

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:50.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says: ‘The Israelites did
just as Moses commanded.’

00:04:50.173 --> 00:04:54.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, at this point, they were sure
this tenth plague was going to happen.

00:04:54.344 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no record of any dissent,
any argument, with Moses

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—complete obedience,
willing submission.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about as things
got a little more confusing?

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got more dire?

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about
when they appeared shortly thereafter

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be trapped by the Red Sea?

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over to chapter 14,
verses 11 and 12:

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They said to Moses:

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Is it because there are no burial places
in Egypt that you have brought us here

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to die in the wilderness?

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What have you done to us
by leading us out of Egypt?

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Is this not the very thing
we told you in Egypt when we said,

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Let us alone, so that
we may serve the Egyptians”?

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For it is better for us to serve the
Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.’”

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My, what a difference!

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What have you done to us?
You don’t know what you’re doing.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all going to die.’

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, they began looking at things
from man’s perspective, not God’s.

00:05:46.195 --> 00:05:48.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:50.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson is
that as pressures mount,

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to continue to make sure

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are thinking God’s thoughts.

00:05:55.738 --> 00:05:58.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to continue to trust the channel

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is using.

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these events
over the past few months

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reminded us,
have shown us (demonstrated),

00:06:04.814 --> 00:06:07.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how quickly the world can change.

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, from one minute, it’s riding high.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next minute, it’s in panic;
it’s in turmoil.

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:15.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve also seen
how quickly our lives can change.

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:17.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From one minute,
we’re with our congregations;

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re serving Jehovah;
we’re working, going on vacations,

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
traveling to assignments,
and suddenly, everything has stopped.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did we do?

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s so encouraging to see

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how well the organization
has responded

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:34.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—completely supporting
the adjustments made

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rallying behind all the changes
to make them work.

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to have that resolve.

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust Jehovah;

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:45.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust the channel
that Jehovah is using.

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But again, it’s relatively easy to do that

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the situation
is obvious, such as it is now.

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:57.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happens
if things get more confusing?

00:06:57.867 --> 00:06:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get more dire?

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know, according to Bible prophecy,
at some point in the future

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is going to happen.

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, it’s at that time
we need to be extra careful

00:07:08.478 --> 00:07:12.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not rely
on man’s thinking—human reasoning.

00:07:12.048 --> 00:07:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we cannot trust
human reasoning,

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can rely on Jehovah’s direction.

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:24.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to illustrate that, for me,
I always think of two of the attacks

00:07:24.393 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the contrasts
of two of the attacks on Jerusalem.

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in both situations, it was dire.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was confusing.
They were trapped.

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looked like they were going to die.

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the one
when the Assyrians came

00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:40.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Jerusalem in Hezekiah’s time.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The direction through Isaiah the prophet
was very, very clear.

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was this:
Do not go to Egypt for support,

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:51.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not surrender to the Assyrians.

00:07:51.154 --> 00:07:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember from our drama

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:55.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from the Bible account that
that went against human reasoning.

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to appeal to Egypt.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some did use Egypt for support.

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:01.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others thought,
‘Well, maybe if we surrender,

00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:03.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Assyrians will be kind to us.’

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s direction was clear.
What happened?

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They followed the direction,
and they lived.

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, later on when the Babylonians
came against Jerusalem,

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again Jehovah’s direction through
Jeremiah the prophet was very clear:

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not go to Egypt for support,

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:23.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do surrender to the Babylonians.

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, that went
completely against human reasoning.

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:27.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were so mad
they wanted to kill Jeremiah.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to go to Egypt for support.

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They eventually did.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They definitely did not want
to surrender to the Babylonians,

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:37.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even thinking back
to Hezekiah’s time

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they were commanded
not to do that.

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not follow the direction,
with tragic results.

00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson is that in both cases,

00:08:50.346 --> 00:08:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
survival depended on trusting
the channel Jehovah was using

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:58.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and following that direction,
even when it went against

00:08:58.487 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
human reasoning—popular opinion.

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about today?

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:09.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we do not know where these
events, current events, are heading.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may just be another marker in time

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:14.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an event in history or not.

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:17.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know
is that these events illustrate

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:21.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how quickly the world
can become unglued

00:09:21.344 --> 00:09:24.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become completely
“faint out of fear.”

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:27.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also know that
just as Jesus needed

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the full support of his apostles

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it got closer to the end of his life,

00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:35.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same is needed today
as we get closer to the end.

00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body,
our Branch Committees,

00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers who are taking the lead
—they need our support.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:43.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need us, not as stumbling blocks,

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:47.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as distracters, but fully behind them.

00:09:47.637 --> 00:09:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear brothers and sisters,
we say to you to continue to do

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what you have been doing.

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:54.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay calm.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay united.

00:09:56.712 --> 00:10:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust Jehovah,
and trust the channel Jehovah is using.

00:10:01.484 --> 00:10:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we do, we will be thinking

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:07.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s thoughts
and not those of men.

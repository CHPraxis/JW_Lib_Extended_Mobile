00:00:01 “You think, not God’s thoughts,
00:00:05 but those of men.”
00:00:07 Has that ever happened to us?
00:00:09 When is it particularly dangerous to do so?
00:00:13 Well, the text for today is based
00:00:16 on the events of Matthew 16:21-23,
00:00:21 and let’s read that together.
00:00:23 Matthew 16:21:
00:00:25 “From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to his disciples
00:00:30 “that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things
00:00:33 “from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed,
00:00:37 “and on the third day be raised up.
00:00:39 “At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying:
00:00:43 “‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;
00:00:45 “you will not have this happen to you at all.’
00:00:47 “But turning his back, he said to Peter: ‘Get behind me, Satan!
00:00:52 “‘You are a stumbling block to me,
00:00:54 because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.’”
00:00:59 Now, Jesus here had just expressed
00:01:01 real events that were going to take place.
00:01:03 It says that “from that time forward,” he began to explain them.
00:01:07 From this account and parallel accounts,
00:01:09 we see he began to talk about what was going to happen,
00:01:12 where they were going to go, and what would happen to him,
00:01:15 perhaps even what was going to happen to the apostles.
00:01:18 But what did Peter say?
00:01:20 He, in effect, said: ‘No, no, Jesus. No, no, you’re wrong.
00:01:23 ‘You’re not thinking right. You’re overreacting.
00:01:26 Nothing is going to happen.’
00:01:28 Now, while Peter took the brunt of the counsel,
00:01:32 the parallel account in Mark chapter 8
00:01:34 indicates that perhaps the other apostles
00:01:36 thought the same way.
00:01:38 See, they found that what Jesus was saying was hard to believe.
00:01:42 Now, what was the problem?
00:01:44 These were not wicked men.
00:01:45 These were spiritual men.
00:01:47 But the problem was that at that moment,
00:01:49 they were using human reasoning —thoughts of men—
00:01:54 rather than realizing that Jesus was expressing God’s thoughts.
00:01:59 Now, Jesus immediately corrected their thinking.
00:02:02 See, at this crucial time, he needed Peter and the apostles,
00:02:05 not in front of him as stumbling blocks,
00:02:08 but behind him as willing supporters.
00:02:10 At this time, Jesus needed supporters, not distracters.
00:02:15 And the apostles obviously got the message.
00:02:18 And there’s no indication that Jesus ever had to counsel them like that again.
00:02:23 In fact, at Luke 22:28,
00:02:26 Jesus even commended them and said:
00:02:28 “You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.”
00:02:31 See, they learned a very valuable lesson.
00:02:33 And what was that?
00:02:35 That lesson was this: Trust Jehovah,
00:02:39 and trust the channel that Jehovah is using.
00:02:42 And if they did that, they would be thinking God’s thoughts.
00:02:46 And they also learned that it was imperative that they did so,
00:02:49 especially as pressures mounted
00:02:51 as they got closer to the end of Jesus’ ministry.
00:02:55 Well, how about us?
00:02:57 How do we do?
00:02:59 Do we think thoughts of men?
00:03:01 Or do we think God’s thoughts?
00:03:03 Well, no doubt all of us struggle at times.
00:03:06 I know I do.
00:03:07 I’m very sure that at times Jesus would like to say to me,
00:03:10 or perhaps he does, ‘Rob, you’re thinking, not thoughts of God but,
00:03:14 rather, thoughts of men’ because of how I react to things at times.
00:03:17 And no doubt we all do that.
00:03:20 And we have to be careful, though,
00:03:22 because events and pressures at times
00:03:25 can cause us to only see things
00:03:28 through the perspective of humans —human thinking.
00:03:32 Now, when would that be particularly dangerous?
00:03:36 Well, when you think about it,
00:03:38 it’s very easy to trust Jehovah and his representatives
00:03:42 when things are going well.
00:03:44 It’s also quite easy to trust Jehovah and the channel he’s using
00:03:48 when things are obvious.
00:03:51 But it’s not always so easy to do
00:03:54 when things become confusing
00:03:57 or when things start to get more dire.
00:04:00 We may think of the nation of Israel
00:04:02 as they were getting ready to leave Egypt.
00:04:05 If you look at Exodus chapter 11,
00:04:08 notice chapter 11 and verse 3.
00:04:10 It says: “And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians.
00:04:15 “Moreover, Moses himself had become highly esteemed
00:04:18 “in the land of Egypt among Pharaoh’s servants
00:04:20 and among the people.”
00:04:22 The interesting thing is at this time,
00:04:24 the Israelites and the Egyptians had already seen the nine plagues.
00:04:27 It was obvious that something was going on,
00:04:31 and many were willing to follow Moses —do exactly what he said.
00:04:35 If you look in chapter 12, we see Moses giving direction:
00:04:38 stay in your homes, what to eat, how to cook it, how to eat it.
00:04:42 Look at chapter 12 and verse 50,
00:04:45 and it says: ‘The Israelites did just as Moses commanded.’
00:04:50 See, at this point, they were sure this tenth plague was going to happen.
00:04:54 There’s no record of any dissent, any argument, with Moses
00:04:58 —complete obedience, willing submission.
00:05:01 But now, what about as things got a little more confusing?
00:05:04 got more dire?
00:05:06 What about when they appeared shortly thereafter
00:05:08 to be trapped by the Red Sea?
00:05:10 Look over to chapter 14, verses 11 and 12:
00:05:13 “They said to Moses:
00:05:15 “‘Is it because there are no burial places in Egypt that you have brought us here
00:05:19 “‘to die in the wilderness?
00:05:21 “‘What have you done to us by leading us out of Egypt?
00:05:23 “‘Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt when we said,
00:05:27 “‘“Let us alone, so that we may serve the Egyptians”?
00:05:30 For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.’”
00:05:35 My, what a difference!
00:05:36 ‘What have you done to us? You don’t know what you’re doing.
00:05:38 We’re all going to die.’
00:05:41 See, they began looking at things from man’s perspective, not God’s.
00:05:46 What’s the lesson?
00:05:48 Well, the lesson is that as pressures mount,
00:05:50 we need to continue to make sure
00:05:52 that we are thinking God’s thoughts.
00:05:55 We need to continue to trust the channel
00:05:58 that Jehovah is using.
00:06:00 Now, these events over the past few months
00:06:02 have reminded us, have shown us (demonstrated),
00:06:04 how quickly the world can change.
00:06:07 Now, from one minute, it’s riding high.
00:06:09 The next minute, it’s in panic; it’s in turmoil.
00:06:12 We’ve also seen how quickly our lives can change.
00:06:15 From one minute, we’re with our congregations;
00:06:17 we’re serving Jehovah; we’re working, going on vacations,
00:06:20 traveling to assignments, and suddenly, everything has stopped.
00:06:24 How did we do?
00:06:26 Well, it’s so encouraging to see
00:06:28 how well the organization has responded
00:06:31 —completely supporting the adjustments made
00:06:34 and rallying behind all the changes to make them work.
00:06:37 Continue to have that resolve.
00:06:39 Trust Jehovah;
00:06:41 trust the channel that Jehovah is using.
00:06:45 But again, it’s relatively easy to do that
00:06:49 when the situation is obvious, such as it is now.
00:06:54 But what happens if things get more confusing?
00:06:57 get more dire?
00:06:59 We know, according to Bible prophecy, at some point in the future
00:07:03 that is going to happen.
00:07:05 See, it’s at that time we need to be extra careful
00:07:08 that we do not rely on man’s thinking—human reasoning.
00:07:12 Why?
00:07:13 Because we cannot trust human reasoning,
00:07:16 but we can rely on Jehovah’s direction.
00:07:20 And to illustrate that, for me, I always think of two of the attacks
00:07:24 and the contrasts of two of the attacks on Jerusalem.
00:07:27 And in both situations, it was dire.
00:07:31 It was confusing. They were trapped.
00:07:33 It looked like they were going to die.
00:07:35 Remember the one when the Assyrians came
00:07:38 against Jerusalem in Hezekiah’s time.
00:07:40 The direction through Isaiah the prophet was very, very clear.
00:07:44 It was this: Do not go to Egypt for support,
00:07:48 and do not surrender to the Assyrians.
00:07:51 Now, you remember from our drama
00:07:52 and from the Bible account that that went against human reasoning.
00:07:55 They wanted to appeal to Egypt.
00:07:57 Some did use Egypt for support.
00:07:59 Others thought, ‘Well, maybe if we surrender,
00:08:01 the Assyrians will be kind to us.’
00:08:03 But Jehovah’s direction was clear. What happened?
00:08:05 They followed the direction, and they lived.
00:08:09 Now, later on when the Babylonians came against Jerusalem,
00:08:12 again Jehovah’s direction through Jeremiah the prophet was very clear:
00:08:16 Do not go to Egypt for support,
00:08:18 but do surrender to the Babylonians.
00:08:23 And again, that went completely against human reasoning.
00:08:25 They were so mad they wanted to kill Jeremiah.
00:08:27 They wanted to go to Egypt for support.
00:08:29 They eventually did.
00:08:31 They definitely did not want to surrender to the Babylonians,
00:08:34 maybe even thinking back to Hezekiah’s time
00:08:37 when they were commanded not to do that.
00:08:39 What happened?
00:08:41 They did not follow the direction, with tragic results.
00:08:45 So, what’s the lesson?
00:08:47 The lesson is that in both cases,
00:08:50 survival depended on trusting the channel Jehovah was using
00:08:54 and following that direction, even when it went against
00:08:58 human reasoning—popular opinion.
00:09:01 Well, what about today?
00:09:04 Well, we do not know where these events, current events, are heading.
00:09:09 This may just be another marker in time
00:09:11 and an event in history or not.
00:09:14 But what we do know is that these events illustrate
00:09:17 how quickly the world can become unglued
00:09:21 and become completely “faint out of fear.”
00:09:24 And we also know that just as Jesus needed
00:09:27 the full support of his apostles
00:09:29 as it got closer to the end of his life,
00:09:32 the same is needed today as we get closer to the end.
00:09:35 The Governing Body, our Branch Committees,
00:09:38 the brothers who are taking the lead —they need our support.
00:09:41 They need us, not as stumbling blocks,
00:09:43 not as distracters, but fully behind them.
00:09:47 So dear brothers and sisters, we say to you to continue to do
00:09:51 exactly what you have been doing.
00:09:53 Stay calm.
00:09:54 Stay united.
00:09:56 Trust Jehovah, and trust the channel Jehovah is using.
00:10:01 And if we do, we will be thinking
00:10:04 Jehovah’s thoughts and not those of men.

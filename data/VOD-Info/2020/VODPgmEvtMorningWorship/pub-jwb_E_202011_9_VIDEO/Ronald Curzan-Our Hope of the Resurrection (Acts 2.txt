00:00:01 We would like to begin
00:00:02 by posing three questions
00:00:04 and then answering those three questions.
00:00:06 First, what do we know
00:00:09 about the resurrection?
00:00:11 Second, what don’t we know
00:00:13 about the resurrection?
00:00:15 And third, what should we do
00:00:17 with what we know about the resurrection?
00:00:21 Well, first, let’s go to that first question posed:
00:00:24 What do we know about the resurrection
00:00:26 that will soon take place here on earth?
00:00:29 Well, first of all, we know it’s a guarantee.
00:00:31 It’s a promise that will be fulfilled.
00:00:34 And based on today’s text
00:00:36 at Acts 24:15, it says:
00:00:39 “There is going to be a resurrection
00:00:43 of both the righteous [as well as] the unrighteous.”
00:00:47 And just imagine what it will be like when that begins,
00:00:52 when over 6,000 years of deaths are undone
00:00:56 and those who are sleeping in the graves will come back to life.
00:01:01 What an amazing prospect!
00:01:03 And as was pointed out,
00:01:05 the first line in our Watchtower  comments
00:01:07 was pretty awesome, and I’m sure you saw that too,
00:01:10 that Jehovah wants people to live, not die.
00:01:15 So this is really a manifestation of Jehovah’s power
00:01:19 as well as his unfailing love for all mankind.
00:01:23 And Jesus reflected his Father’s love.
00:01:27 In fact, he died in our behalf,
00:01:30 and he wanted to fulfill the promise he made
00:01:33 at John 5:28, 29,
00:01:38 where he said: “All those in the memorial tombs
00:01:42 will hear his voice and come out.”
00:01:45 “All” meaning
00:01:47 “all the righteous and the unrighteous.”
00:01:51 Those who are asleep will awaken.
00:01:54 They may have been long forgotten by humans,
00:01:58 but Jehovah has never forgotten them.
00:02:01 They are right in his memory.
00:02:04 Now, have you ever gone to an old cemetery
00:02:07 and looked at some of the gravestones?
00:02:10 Some of the engraving has been worn off over years of weathering.
00:02:15 We don’t even know who’s buried
00:02:17 in that burial plot, but Jehovah does.
00:02:20 And he has it filed away in his everlasting memory.
00:02:25 So when we’re talking about the righteous that will come back,
00:02:28 who are we talking about?
00:02:30 Well, the righteous are the faithful men and women
00:02:33 that have died before Jesus’ sacrificial death
00:02:37 and the other sheep who die during the last days.
00:02:42 And what about the unrighteous?
00:02:44 Well, the unrighteous are humans, billions of humans,
00:02:48 who died without really having an opportunity
00:02:52 to know Jehovah, to get to worship him
00:02:55 or even to apply Bible truths.
00:02:58 They will have the opportunity to get to know Jehovah,
00:03:02 to draw close to him, and to do his will.
00:03:07 The March 2016 meeting workbook
00:03:10 (you may recall this) had this scenario.
00:03:14 It said: “Instead of funerals,
00:03:17 there may be welcoming sessions for the resurrected.”
00:03:21 Wow!
00:03:22 That’s going to be so amazing for us to actually be there
00:03:25 and experience these welcoming-type of meetings.
00:03:30 And it posed two questions in that meeting workbook:
00:03:33 “Which of your friends and relatives
00:03:35 do you especially look forward to seeing again?”
00:03:38 Now, there are probably some people
00:03:40 going through your mind right now, like I am thinking about.
00:03:43 The second question:
00:03:45 “Which Bible characters do you especially want to meet and talk to?”
00:03:49 Again, a whole list is probably coming into our minds.
00:03:52 Well, stay tuned.
00:03:55 Well, here’s a question:
00:03:57 What indication do we have as to the manner
00:04:00 in which the resurrected ones will take their place?
00:04:03 How will they come back?
00:04:05 Well, based on 1 Corinthians 15:23,
00:04:09 we know that the heavenly resurrection
00:04:11 of the anointed is done in an orderly way.
00:04:15 As Paul said: “Each one in his own proper order:
00:04:20 “Christ the firstfruits,
00:04:22 afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.”
00:04:27 So it will be progressive during that time.
00:04:30 Now, since we know that Jehovah is a God of order,
00:04:33 it’s reasonable to conclude that the earthly resurrection
00:04:36 will take place in a logical and orderly way.
00:04:41 Instead of having billions come back to life all at once,
00:04:45 we know that it would make much more sense that it would be done progressively.
00:04:50 So as each one is resurrected —they come to life—
00:04:53 we can help them individually
00:04:55 with their needs and their circumstances.
00:04:59 Well, what do we know about the physical and spiritual care
00:05:02 resurrected ones will receive at that time?
00:05:06 Well, at the right time,
00:05:08 at Jehovah’s perfect timing, he will awaken them.
00:05:12 And what will they find?
00:05:14 They will find abundant housing, clothing,
00:05:17 and food all given to them.
00:05:19 By whom?
00:05:21 By those who will make it through this system and on into the next
00:05:25 —great tribulation survivors,
00:05:28 you and me.
00:05:31 And we have a precedent for that.
00:05:33 Remember when Jesus resurrected a little girl?
00:05:36 And all those who saw that amazing miracle
00:05:39 —what did he say to those who saw that?
00:05:42 He said: ‘Please give the little girl something to eat.’
00:05:45 So he didn’t say that every time he resurrected someone,
00:05:49 but he knew her individual needs, and he addressed those.
00:05:54 And likewise, we will have that privilege in this coming system.
00:05:59 Most of us will have that privilege.
00:06:01 And think about all the training
00:06:03 that we have received here at Bethel and LDC
00:06:06 and other areas of our organization
00:06:08 that will be put to use at that time.
00:06:12 And think about the billions of “unrighteous ones”
00:06:16 that will be resurrected that will need to have spiritual instruction.
00:06:20 They will need to learn about Jehovah;
00:06:22 they will need to learn about Jesus and the ransom sacrifice
00:06:25 and how they can exercise that faith in the ransom.
00:06:30 Who will teach them?
00:06:32 You will teach them, and hopefully I will teach them.
00:06:36 And what will we use as a basis
00:06:40 to teach these ones who need to learn
00:06:42 about Jehovah, Jesus, and Jehovah’s requirements?
00:06:45 Well, of course, the Bible will be something that we will use.
00:06:49 But John’s vision at Revelation 20:12 gives us another clue.
00:06:54 Let’s turn there and read this together,
00:06:56 Revelation 20:12;
00:07:01 it says:
00:07:03 “And I saw the dead, the great and the small,
00:07:06 “standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened.
00:07:10 “But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life.
00:07:14 “The dead were judged out of those things
00:07:16 written in the scrolls according to their deeds.”
00:07:21 Now, was this mentioning the “deeds”
00:07:24 of their past conduct, or past deeds?
00:07:28 No.
00:07:30 This judgment will not focus on what they did before they died.
00:07:34 But how do we know that?
00:07:36 Romans 6:7, as you recall, says:
00:07:41 “For the one who has died has been acquitted
00:07:44 “[or the footnote says: “released (pardoned)”]
00:07:47 from his sin.”
00:07:49 So those who come back to life,
00:07:52 those who are resurrected, will have a clean slate.
00:07:55 What a relief for them and for us,
00:07:59 because many of us do know many
00:08:01 who did not worship Jehovah before they passed away!
00:08:05 So that clean slate is such a relief.
00:08:09 So to live forever there will be further requirements
00:08:13 for those who survive the great tribulation
00:08:16 as well as those who are resurrected.
00:08:18 We need to learn and continue to obey those requirements
00:08:22 and any new ones that might be revealed by Jehovah
00:08:26 during the thousand years.
00:08:28 Well, what don’t we know about the resurrection?
00:08:32 A lot.
00:08:33 There are so many questions that we might have:
00:08:36 Will those who died recently be raised
00:08:41 near the start of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign?
00:08:44 Will the righteous be brought back first and then the unrighteous?
00:08:49 Will they be welcomed by loved ones who know them?
00:08:52 Will resurrections take place in the area where people died?
00:08:56 How will Jehovah arrange matters
00:08:58 for those who were married when they died?
00:09:00 Will faithful men of old with leadership abilities
00:09:03 come back to help to organize matters?
00:09:06 Well, how will theocratic spiritual food be given?
00:09:11 Will there be a Teaching Committee or Writing Committee,
00:09:13 or will another arrangement be made to provide spiritual food?
00:09:17 Will there be hard copies?
00:09:19 Will there be electronic copies? Will there be videos?
00:09:21 Will there be some sort of JW broadcast?
00:09:24 We just don’t know.
00:09:26 We need to stay tuned, and we need to be patient.
00:09:30 It’s good to heed Jeremiah’s advice.
00:09:32 If you turn to Lamentations chapter 3,
00:09:36 notice there in Lamentations 3:25, 26
00:09:40 something that we want to focus on today in the meantime.
00:09:44 It says: “Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him,
00:09:49 “to the person who keeps seeking him.
00:09:52 “Good it is to wait in silence [or the footnote says: “to wait patiently”]
00:09:57 for the salvation of Jehovah.”
00:10:01 So we know that in due course,
00:10:03 all will be revealed by Jehovah.
00:10:06 And as we rest our hope on Jehovah
00:10:09 and those in the future come back,
00:10:11 they will know that the one who will “satisfy the desire of every living thing”
00:10:15 will have it all taken care for us.
00:10:17 All the answers will be given to us.
00:10:19 Jehovah has always given us what we need to be faithful now,
00:10:24 and he’ll do the same in the future.
00:10:26 And now it’s up to each and every one of us
00:10:28 to prove our faithfulness,
00:10:31 to put our hope in that resurrection hope, and to share it with others.
00:10:36 And hopefully some day, maybe a thousand years from now,
00:10:39 we’ll look back, and we’ll say:
00:10:41 “There [was ] a resurrection
00:10:43 of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”

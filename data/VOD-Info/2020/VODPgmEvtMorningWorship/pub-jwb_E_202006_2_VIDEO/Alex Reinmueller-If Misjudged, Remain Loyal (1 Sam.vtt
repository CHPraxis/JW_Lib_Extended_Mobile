Have you ever been misjudged?

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:07.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Brother Parkin was serving

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:10.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Puerto Rico, it happened to him.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:12.324 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr came down from Brooklyn

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:14.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the very first international convention

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.953 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the island.

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an exciting time for everyone,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Parkin did his best
to get everything well-organized.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after the missionary meeting,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr assumed that transportation

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had not been arranged
for everyone to get back to the hotel

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:33.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—although, in fact, it had.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later he gave Brother Parkin
some strong counsel

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:39.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about being better organized.

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even said that he was disappointed in him.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Parkin thought:

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:46.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s it.
I’m out of here.’

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he even told
his wife later to start packing.

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the time, he says
that he didn’t argue with Brother Knorr

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or try to justify himself.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he admits that he did feel misjudged

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was upset afterward for quite a while.

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has something like that ever happened to you?

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely it has.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It usually happens to all of us at some time.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others misjudge us,
we might initially get upset,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel betrayed, or become
discouraged for a while.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might worry that others
don’t see us as smart enough,

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong enough, spiritual enough.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:29.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what they said
may threaten our whole identity.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when something like that happens,

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:36.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will help us to stay loyal to Jehovah?

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The writer here is King David,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he well knew what
it was like to be upset by injustice.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more important,
what he wrote is inspired of God,

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can trust that it can help us.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start reading with verse 3.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.”

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:10.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When someone misunderstands us,

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our first instinct
may be to prove ourselves right,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but usually that isn’t very helpful.

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David says we should focus
on Jehovah and keep doing good.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be faithful, be humble,
continue caring for your assignments.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus once said that “wisdom
is proved righteous by its works.”

00:02:31.213 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many times, it’s our works over time

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(instead of trying to straighten
the other person out)

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that win back their heart and our reputation.

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we trust Jehovah
to help us in these situations?

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember what happened
to him in the garden of Eden?

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah based everything in creation

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his entire sovereignty—
on love.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After he made Jesus,
they made everything else together.

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As each new angel and human was created,

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus saw just how Jehovah treated them,

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that made him love Jehovah even more.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, as we know,
Satan slandered Jehovah.

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:20.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t challenge his position or power;

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he challenged his motives—God’s love.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now can you imagine how hurtful
that was to Jehovah and Jesus?

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:32.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this raised all sorts of questions.

00:03:32.274 --> 00:03:35.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many others
would believe Satan’s accusations?

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen to Adam’s offspring?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would Jehovah’s reputation
be cleared, and so on?

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah is the Almighty,

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he took immediate steps
to resolve those issues,

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it has taken
a lot of time to resolve them.

00:03:53.962 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if someone misjudges us,

00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think Jehovah
knows what we’re going through?

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sure does.

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows exactly what it feels like.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as David says
later in verse 18 in this psalm:

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:13.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is aware
of what the blameless go through.”

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 4.

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

00:04:25.285 --> 00:04:30.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David is urging us here
to find safety in Jehovah,

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:32.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when we feel safe,

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s easier for us to hear
what others are saying to us

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be less inclined to push
our own views or justify ourself.

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other psalms,

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:48.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David talks about how Jehovah
brought him into a place of safety.

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:52.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And really, who makes us feel safer
than Jehovah does?

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are in Jehovah’s place of safety,

00:04:56.525 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can hear almost anything
without becoming defensive.

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5:

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah.”

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:11.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David says: “Rely on him,
and he will act in your behalf.”

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:14.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, let Jehovah lead you.

00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:17.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we fully commit ourselves to Jehovah,

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we won’t feel lost or abandoned
when we have setbacks in life.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:25.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that he’ll continue
to guide and bless us

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did Joseph
and Hannah and David and others.

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:33.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 23 and 24 of this psalm say:

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah guides the steps of a man
 when he finds pleasure in his way.

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:40.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although he may fall,

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will not be hurled down,

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah supports him by the hand.”

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 6:

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:52.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will make your righteousness
shine like daybreak,

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your justice like the midday sun.”

00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:58.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah will either vindicate you

00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, at the very least,
reassure you of his love.

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:05.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows our motives and intentions,

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so if a relative or friend
or an overseer misjudges us,

00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:13.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make his own decision. 

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:17.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i>once said that if Jehovah
wants to vindicate us in some matter,

00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:21.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can do so at the proper time.

00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:25.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if he chooses to do that,
it will be obvious.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One translation says in this verse

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it will become as clear
as “the noonday sun” that you are right.

00:06:34.248 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not all situations
get resolved in that way, do they?

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to hear those stories
about Joseph and Hannah and David,

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:44.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the underdog ends up on top.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:46.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Mephibosheth,

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah, or the apostle Paul?

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were their reputations ever completely
cleared during their lifetime?

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it makes no sense
to hold on to hurt feelings

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:01.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until Jehovah vindicates us.

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:04.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so much better
to resolve the matter now.

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 7:

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep silent before Jehovah
and wait expectantly for him.

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be upset by the man
who succeeds in carrying out his schemes.”

00:07:16.915 --> 00:07:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bottom line is that we can’t stay upset.

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:23.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, if we get counsel

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:26.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doesn’t seem to be 100 percent correct,

00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:29.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like in Brother Parkin’s case?

00:07:29.678 --> 00:07:33.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if you’re accused
of something serious, you should speak up,

00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:36.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least to satisfy your conscience.

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more often,

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:43.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after you pray about it
and think about what was said,

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not just apply what you can?

00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most counsel has at least something
that we can benefit from.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if there is something
that still doesn’t seem to fit,

00:07:54.953 --> 00:07:59.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then wait “patiently,”
as the footnote on verse 7 says,

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah to clarify matters
or make things right.

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In most cases, the only way
for misunderstandings to get cleared up

00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is with the passing of time.

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:12.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like this quote from a brother years ago.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:16.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “If God has been willing
to wait six thousand years

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for his true character to be made manifest,

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:23.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

That’s the key, isn’t it?

Focus on Jehovah,

and we can be happy

How did things turn out
for Brother Parkin and Brother Knorr?

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:53.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in his life story, Brother Parkin says:

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:57.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The next time Maxine and I saw him
(about six months later),

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he invited us to his room
and cooked a meal for us.’

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:03.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it looks like Jehovah
gave Brother Parkin

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the requests of [his] heart,” right?

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:07.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he told me recently 

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:11.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he and Brother Knorr
became the best of friends.

00:00:20 This wasn’t the first health scare with Mum.
00:00:27 And my brother and sister
00:00:29 were always quick to help out.
00:00:52 But this time was different.
00:01:01 She’d be here for at least another week and then more long-term care.
00:01:10 We just weren’t prepared for that.
00:01:23 I should have accepted more help when the friends offered.
00:01:26 I just didn’t want to be a burden.
00:01:31 Janice understood,
00:01:33 and she was wondering how this might affect her Bethel service.
00:01:38 Terrance wished he lived closer so he could do more.
00:01:43 We decided to pray, sleep on it,
00:01:47 and regroup after doing some research.
00:02:20 I shared the example of Joseph in Genesis 45,
00:02:29 where he told his father:
00:02:33 “You must dwell in the land of Goshen, where you will be near me . . .
00:02:38 I will supply you with food.”
00:02:43 He didn’t let a long distance get in his way of caring for Jacob.
00:02:52 He took practical steps
00:02:55 and made his care a priority.
00:03:06 Janice and Terrance too found great articles
00:03:09 offering solutions
00:03:11 such as asking for periodic help,
00:03:22 making more time to communicate with Mum,
00:03:36 or even getting a part-time nurse.
00:03:48 We weren’t prepared for her situation to change so suddenly,
00:03:55 but Jehovah is guiding us through each new challenge.
00:04:06 And with his help, we’re honoring Mum,
00:04:11 making her care our continual priority.
00:04:24 In this dramatization, we saw one way
00:04:27 that a family decided to care for an aging parent.
00:04:30 Of course, situations will differ from one family to the next.
00:04:35 Each must make a prayerful decision based on their circumstances.

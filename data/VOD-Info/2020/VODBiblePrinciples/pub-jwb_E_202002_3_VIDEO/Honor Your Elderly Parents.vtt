This wasn’t the first health scare with Mum.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my brother and sister

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were always quick to help out.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time was different.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:06.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d be here for at least another week
and then more long-term care.

00:01:10.854 --> 00:01:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just weren’t prepared for that.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should have accepted
more help when the friends offered.

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t want to be a burden.

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Janice understood,

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was wondering
how this might affect her Bethel service.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Terrance wished he lived closer
so he could do more.

00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:47.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to pray, sleep on it,

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regroup after doing some research.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shared the example of Joseph in Genesis 45,

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he told his father:

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must dwell in the land of Goshen,
where you will be near me . . .

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will supply you with food.”

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t let a long distance
get in his way of caring for Jacob.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took practical steps

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made his care a priority.

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Janice and Terrance too found great articles

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offering solutions

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:15.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as asking for periodic help,

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making more time to communicate with Mum,

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even getting a part-time nurse.

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:52.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t prepared
for her situation to change so suddenly,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah is guiding us
through each new challenge.

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:09.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with his help, we’re honoring Mum,

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making her care our continual priority.

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization, we saw one way

00:04:27.317 --> 00:04:30.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a family decided
to care for an aging parent.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, situations will differ
from one family to the next.

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each must make a prayerful decision
based on their circumstances.

I, Steven, take you, Emily,
to be my wedded wife.

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, Emily, take you, Steven,
to be my wedded husband.

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt our vows were forever.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could have prepared me
for the heartbreak.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never expected her to be unfaithful

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unwilling to work things out.

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt humiliated.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could she do such a thing?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was embarrassed,

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t want to talk to anyone.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read somewhere that time
would help me heal

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just to stay busy.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed to work.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was constantly reminded of what I lost:

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our spiritual goals,

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hopes and dreams we had

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all destroyed.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to dwell on the hurt,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I just couldn’t ignore it.

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I really coping?

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was I leaving myself open
to even more pain?

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we’re going to talk about marriage today.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we turn to Ephesians chapter 5, . . .

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was angry, but not just with Emily.

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was angry with everything.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Steven!
Steven!

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, let me stop by tomorrow.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:35.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I had to say,

00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t have blamed Tom for judging me,

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right, Steven.

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t understand how you feel.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:50.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know who can.

00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Psalm 34?

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think verse 18 says it best.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:04.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it for us?

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take advantage of Jehovah
being that close to you,

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and include him in everything.

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:26.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah <i>is </i> a loving Shepherd.

00:03:26.727 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hurt, he cares.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew this, but in a way, I’d forgotten.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized I hadn’t included Jehovah

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:41.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ways I tried to cope.

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Staying busy was important,

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I needed to draw closer to God,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not push away.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:51.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I did,

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real healing began.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the pain is still there,

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees the tears;

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:05.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah feels what I feel.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is getting better, slowly,

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:24.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “Jehovah is close
to the brokenhearted.”

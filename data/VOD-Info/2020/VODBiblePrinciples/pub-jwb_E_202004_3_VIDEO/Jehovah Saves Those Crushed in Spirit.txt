00:00:03 I, Steven, take you, Emily, to be my wedded wife.
00:00:10 I, Emily, take you, Steven, to be my wedded husband.
00:00:17 I had no doubt our vows were forever.
00:00:24 Nothing could have prepared me for the heartbreak.
00:00:29 I never expected her to be unfaithful
00:00:33 and unwilling to work things out.
00:00:50 I felt humiliated.
00:00:54 How could she do such a thing?
00:00:58 I was embarrassed,
00:01:00 and I didn’t want to talk to anyone.
00:01:10 I read somewhere that time would help me heal
00:01:13 and just to stay busy.
00:01:18 It seemed to work.
00:01:24 But I was constantly reminded of what I lost:
00:01:27 our spiritual goals,
00:01:30 the hopes and dreams we had
00:01:33 —all destroyed.
00:01:43 I didn’t want to dwell on the hurt,
00:01:46 but I just couldn’t ignore it.
00:01:59 Was I really coping?
00:02:02 Or was I leaving myself open to even more pain?
00:02:06 Brothers and sisters, we’re going to talk about marriage today.
00:02:10 If we turn to Ephesians chapter 5, . . .
00:02:12 I was angry, but not just with Emily.
00:02:16 I was angry with everything.
00:02:22 Steven! Steven!
00:02:24 Hey, let me stop by tomorrow.
00:02:33 What I had to say,
00:02:37 I wouldn’t have blamed Tom for judging me,
00:02:39 but he didn’t.
00:02:42 You’re right, Steven.
00:02:45 I can’t understand how you feel.
00:02:48 But you know who can.
00:02:52 Do you remember Psalm 34?
00:02:58 I think verse 18 says it best.
00:03:01 Can you read it for us?
00:03:05 “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;
00:03:09 he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”
00:03:13 Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?
00:03:15 Take advantage of Jehovah being that close to you,
00:03:20 and include him in everything.
00:03:23 Jehovah is  a loving Shepherd.
00:03:26 When we hurt, he cares.
00:03:29 I knew this, but in a way, I’d forgotten.
00:03:35 I realized I hadn’t included Jehovah
00:03:39 in the ways I tried to cope.
00:03:41 Staying busy was important,
00:03:44 but I needed to draw closer to God,
00:03:46 not push away.
00:03:49 And when I did,
00:03:51 the real healing began.
00:03:55 Even though the pain is still there,
00:03:58 Jehovah sees the tears;
00:04:03 Jehovah feels what I feel.
00:04:09 It is getting better, slowly,
00:04:21 because “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted.”

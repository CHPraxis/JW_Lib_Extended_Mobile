00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to see me?

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, come on in and go ahead
and close the door, please.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for coming up.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, all of your projects have come in
on schedule and under budget.

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
the whole division to start.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Management team

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:42.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I liked the sound of that,

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did sound like a lot more work,

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Victor was so positive.

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may be a little overtime
here and there,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wouldn’t worry about it
—not with your skill.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told me I could think
about it before deciding.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But come on, this was a no-brainer.

00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new position was great!

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the money—well,

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wasn’t too bad either.

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exciting
to work directly with clients,

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the hours

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were crazy.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that the easy thing to do

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the right thing
to do are seldom the same.

00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see an example of this
in this week’s Bible reading.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True worship,

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right thing, was not easy
but required hard work.

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:46.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Hezekiah demonstrated
his zeal for Jehovah’s worship . . .

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:52.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our question for the audience is,
How could we explain this to someone?

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ava, please.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most nights, I was wiped out.

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All around the world,

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people wonder if life has any purpose.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to admit

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even when I wasn’t working, . . .

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so sorry.
Can you take this door for me?

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty minutes.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re really impressed, and we want
to move you up to the management team.

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:39.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll head up
 the whole division to start.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor’s offer really took me by surprise.

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wow!

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The perks were tempting!

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew there was a lot at stake,

00:02:56.113 --> 00:02:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I told him I’d talk to Lisa

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:00.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get back to him tomorrow.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was this job going to mean
for our spiritual goals?

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would we still be able
to keep our life simple?

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were we ready to trade
our time together as a family

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:26.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more money?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Victor how much
I appreciated the opportunity

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but felt that it just wasn’t
the right fit for our family.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:58.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money was tight, but we were OK.

00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:00.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had what we needed.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying no to that promotion

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant holding off on a few upgrades,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also meant more time
for meeting preparation, . . .

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:21.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Miller.

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:22.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go on and look at the—

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:28.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>. . .</i> more time for the ministry,

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:35.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more time

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:38.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each other.

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben, it looks like you forgot
to sign off on a job order.

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually,

00:04:57.818 --> 00:04:59.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 these failed that quality inspection.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember?

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, by like two tenths of a point.

00:05:03.115 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I already talked to Steve
about replacing the components,

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to get that order adjusted,

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll have a new one for you
on your desk tomorrow afternoon.

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no time for that.

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:21.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a huge account.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t sign off on this,

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d be hurting the whole company.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:31.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Victor, I’m-I’m not sure

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m really comfortable

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bypassing the inspection when . . .

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I’m not asking you to tell some big lie.

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a technicality.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:47.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, a good quarter

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:49.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means good bonuses for everyone

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:51.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including you.

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to do it,

00:05:58.045 --> 00:06:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the last thing that Lisa and I needed

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:03.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for me to lose my job.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t have a choice.

00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you lie, they can’t believe you.

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:20.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they might not . . .

00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:23.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling myself
that it was no big deal.

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:26.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All lies are bad, even little ones.

00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:30.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One lie leads to another,
and they cause much harm.

00:06:38.085 --> 00:06:40.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple, right?

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:45.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people always tell the truth.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:55.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Javi.

00:06:55.185 --> 00:06:56.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Ben.
How are you doing?

00:06:56.937 --> 00:06:57.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
How’s the job going?

00:06:57.938 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, the machine is running great!

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, I did have a question
on the specs for the Harrison job.

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:01.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we take a quick look?

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, let’s see here.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Need a hand?

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:08.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m good.
I just . . .

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:13.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:17.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened, guys?

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got—we got to do something!

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:23.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, disconnect . . .

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.
Yeah, yeah, get it going.

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dead

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:36.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I’m pretty sure it’s dead.

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:39.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would just say that it stopped working.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you do,
don’t tell Victor what happened.

00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:57.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just got this set up last month.

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would it just stop working?

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:04.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you can actually smell

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:06.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coffee.

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:09.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to Victor.

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t throw yourself under the bus, Man!

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll help you get this cleaned up.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:14.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will have to know.

00:08:14.014 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of the most expensive
units in the shop.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:18.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take the blame,

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:20.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re just making yourself look bad.

00:08:23.648 --> 00:08:25.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
It’s OK.

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:27.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a mistake.

00:08:27.778 --> 00:08:29.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll explain it.

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:31.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to get this back online.

00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:01.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, I think Victor
actually appreciated my honesty.

00:09:04.773 --> 00:09:06.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wasn’t the only one.

00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:10.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark had some questions,

00:09:11.113 --> 00:09:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a great discussion.

00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:28.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The company took on new clients this year,
and I knew that Victor

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really depending on me
to keep things on schedule.

00:09:33.218 --> 00:09:34.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to let him down,

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I stepped up

00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took on the overtime hours.

00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:47.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I figured it was temporary,

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I even got to take home
a bigger paycheck.

00:09:53.155 --> 00:09:57.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is
that that’s not all I took home.

00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:06.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of each week, I was burned-out.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the weekends

00:10:18.597 --> 00:10:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well,

00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:24.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they weren’t really any better.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I spent a lot
of Saturdays back at the office.

00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:42.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project took a lot longer than I thought.

00:10:42.996 --> 00:10:46.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That pretty much took out field service
and the meetings.

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:48.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew that management

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be impressed.

00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That machine is essential
so that I can get the parts out.

00:10:53.089 --> 00:10:55.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got the reports in right on time.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look!
This is costing a lot of money.

00:10:57.385 --> 00:10:59.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a first quarter that I have to meet,

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and without this,

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:01.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to—it’s going to kill me.

00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:06.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know we had a contract
that you’re supposed to—

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like I said,
I don’t care about your third-party vendors.

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:10.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is unacceptable.

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:15.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working harder than ever,

00:11:15.403 --> 00:11:19.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the end,
I’m not sure anyone even cared.

00:11:39.302 --> 00:11:42.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had been a busy week,

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:45.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the weekend was going to be even busier

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:48.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and better!

00:11:54.776 --> 00:11:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, I needed to make
an important stop.

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:02.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s Ben.

00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come in!

00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s so good to see you.

00:12:06.329 --> 00:12:07.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too.

00:12:07.664 --> 00:12:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, John,

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are you feeling?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben, how are you doing?

00:12:12.836 --> 00:12:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
Good.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:15.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m so glad . . .

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:18.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This illness had been so hard
on John and Sandy.

00:12:21.344 --> 00:12:23.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even imagine
what they were going through.

00:12:34.316 --> 00:12:38.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so encouraging
to see John’s positive attitude.

00:12:40.322 --> 00:12:42.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next day,

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:45.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a fantastic conversation
in the ministry.

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:56.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Tom and I
finally figured out that glitch

00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the A/V system.

00:12:57.631 --> 00:12:59.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Tom, go ahead and hit play.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s playing.

00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:00.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:13:02.677 --> 00:13:03.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right!

00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:04.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:05.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whew!

00:13:06.765 --> 00:13:10.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything looked and sounded great!

00:13:16.816 --> 00:13:19.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We definitely were busy

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:23.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the best way possible,

00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:25.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing things that really mattered

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:28.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for people who love Jehovah.

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, believe me,

00:13:41.257 --> 00:13:43.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s not the only dirt I have on Victor.

00:13:44.427 --> 00:13:46.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we’re listening.

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So last week,
he’s talking in his office, right?

00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:52.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has no idea
that I’m standing right there,

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:54.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s bragging
to his buddy . . .

00:13:54.229 --> 00:13:57.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really didn’t want to hear this.

00:13:57.565 --> 00:14:00.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lunch with them seemed harmless,

00:14:00.026 --> 00:14:03.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this was anything but upbuilding.

00:14:03.405 --> 00:14:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, hey, check out these guys.

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the Bible people.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:15.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-oh.
Don’t look now!

00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:16.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think they have someone.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might try to convert us too!

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the deal with these people?

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s cool

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you want to believe
in fairy tales and everything,

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:32.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but keep it to yourself,

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right?

00:14:33.309 --> 00:14:34.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:14:34.144 --> 00:14:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

00:14:34.978 --> 00:14:35.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:36.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, . . .

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:38.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those carts are everywhere now!

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:41.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re all over the city.

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:47.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t finish my lunch.

00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:52.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never noticed
how sarcastic and negative

00:14:52.454 --> 00:14:54.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my coworkers could be.

00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:00.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had always thought of them as,

00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:07.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, as friends.

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:16.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what kind of friends was I making?

00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:34.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so glad

00:15:34.496 --> 00:15:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had taken a day off from work.

00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:39.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long had it been since Lisa and I

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:41.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to spend a whole day together
in midweek service?

00:15:52.138 --> 00:15:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lisa started a Bible study.

00:15:58.269 --> 00:16:01.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we got to share our day
with good friends

00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:03.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people like Sam and Chloe.

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve really been there for us

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the ups and downs.

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:19.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at that!

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:21.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben,
is that you?

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:23.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing over there?

00:16:26.214 --> 00:16:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you guys know about this?

00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:38.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know where we’d be

00:16:38.977 --> 00:16:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if Jehovah hadn’t helped us
to keep our priorities straight

00:16:44.023 --> 00:16:46.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—keeping our life simple,

00:16:48.194 --> 00:16:51.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a clean conscience,

00:16:54.742 --> 00:16:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staying focused on work
that has real meaning,

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:04.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having real friends.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What more can you ask for?

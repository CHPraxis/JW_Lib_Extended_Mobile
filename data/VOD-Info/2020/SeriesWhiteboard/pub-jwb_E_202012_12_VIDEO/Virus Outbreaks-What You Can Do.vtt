Infectious diseases

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been around for a long time.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, you may have just heard

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about outbreaks in other places.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can you do

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:20.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a disease spreads close to home?

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much is out of your control.

00:00:23.437 --> 00:00:25.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be scary.

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:27.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s a lot you can do

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:30.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect yourself and stay healthy.

00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:32.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the most effective steps

00:00:32.854 --> 00:00:34.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also the simplest,

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like washing your hands often.

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you wash for at least 20 seconds,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soap and water can break up the virus

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bacteria and rinse it away.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:50.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A strong alcohol-based hand sanitizer

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:52.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can work too.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cough and sneeze into a tissue

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:57.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the inside of your elbow.

00:00:57.437 --> 00:01:00.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And avoid touching your face,

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after you touch something else.

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:06.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Follow instructions from the authorities.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That might mean staying home for a while,

00:01:09.395 --> 00:01:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wearing a mask when you go out,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or keeping the recommended safe distance

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from other people.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do get sick,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
call a doctor right away.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:25.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your emotional health is important too!

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Too much bad news, unverified rumors,

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:33.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even conflicting reports can cause anxiety.

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:36.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay informed, but set limits

00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:39.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you don’t feel overwhelmed.

00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep yourself occupied,

00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:44.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay connected with friends and family.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might cheer them up

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel a little better yourself.

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:51.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another aspect

00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:53.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your health that’s important.

00:01:53.854 --> 00:01:57.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, Jesus sought time alone

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pray and meditate.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use some of your time

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of your spiritual health.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you focus on a hope for a better future,

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:11.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll be easier to cope with challenges today.

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses keep their hope strong

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:17.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sharing it with others in whatever ways are safe.

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:22.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They show people what the Bible teaches.

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:24.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They invite them to their meetings too.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:28.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If possible, they meet in person.

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, they have video meetings.

00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says at Isaiah 33:24

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:39.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someday no one will say: “I am sick.”

00:02:39.687 --> 00:02:43.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until then, it says at Isaiah 30:15

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “your strength will be in keeping calm

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:48.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing trust.”

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when things like this happen,

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do your best to stay calm,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay informed,

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay healthy.

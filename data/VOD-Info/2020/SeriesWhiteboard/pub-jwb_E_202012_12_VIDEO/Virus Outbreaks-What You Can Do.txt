00:00:03 Infectious diseases
00:00:05 have been around for a long time.
00:00:10 In the past, you may have just heard
00:00:13 about outbreaks in other places.
00:00:15 But what can you do
00:00:17 when a disease spreads close to home?
00:00:20 So much is out of your control.
00:00:23 It can be scary.
00:00:25 But there’s a lot you can do
00:00:27 to protect yourself and stay healthy.
00:00:30 Some of the most effective steps
00:00:32 are also the simplest,
00:00:34 like washing your hands often.
00:00:37 If you wash for at least 20 seconds,
00:00:41 soap and water can break up the virus
00:00:44 or bacteria and rinse it away.
00:00:47 A strong alcohol-based hand sanitizer
00:00:50 can work too.
00:00:52 Cough and sneeze into a tissue
00:00:55 or the inside of your elbow.
00:00:57 And avoid touching your face,
00:01:00 especially after you touch something else.
00:01:03 Follow instructions from the authorities.
00:01:06 That might mean staying home for a while,
00:01:09 wearing a mask when you go out,
00:01:12 or keeping the recommended safe distance
00:01:15 from other people.
00:01:17 And if you do get sick,
00:01:19 call a doctor right away.
00:01:21 Your emotional health is important too!
00:01:25 Too much bad news, unverified rumors,
00:01:29 even conflicting reports can cause anxiety.
00:01:33 Stay informed, but set limits
00:01:36 so you don’t feel overwhelmed.
00:01:39 Keep yourself occupied,
00:01:41 and stay connected with friends and family.
00:01:44 You might cheer them up
00:01:46 and feel a little better yourself.
00:01:49 There’s another aspect
00:01:51 of your health that’s important.
00:01:53 In the Bible, Jesus sought time alone
00:01:57 to pray and meditate.
00:01:59 Use some of your time
00:02:01 to take care of your spiritual health.
00:02:04 If you focus on a hope for a better future,
00:02:07 it’ll be easier to cope with challenges today.
00:02:11 Jehovah’s Witnesses keep their hope strong
00:02:14 by sharing it with others in whatever ways are safe.
00:02:17 They show people what the Bible teaches.
00:02:22 They invite them to their meetings too.
00:02:24 If possible, they meet in person.
00:02:28 If not, they have video meetings.
00:02:31 The Bible says at Isaiah 33:24
00:02:35 that someday no one will say: “I am sick.”
00:02:39 Until then, it says at Isaiah 30:15
00:02:43 that “your strength will be in keeping calm
00:02:46 and showing trust.”
00:02:48 So when things like this happen,
00:02:51 do your best to stay calm,
00:02:53 stay informed,
00:02:55 and stay healthy.

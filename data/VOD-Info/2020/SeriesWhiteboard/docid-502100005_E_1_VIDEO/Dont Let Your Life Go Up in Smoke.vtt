Do you smoke?

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you tempted to?

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:16.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe to fit in?

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
deal with stress?

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re just curious.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the reason, you should know

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what smoking can do to you.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Romans 12:1,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells you to use
“your power of reason.”

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of just following the crowd,

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be smart enough and think for yourself.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobacco companies spend billions of dollars

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:46.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to convince people to smoke.

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many people fall for it

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without thinking of the consequences.

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, smoking can ruin your health

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the way you look.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says to “cleanse ourselves

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But smoking does the opposite!

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smokers are more likely to die from cancer,

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heart attacks, and other diseases.

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know, it doesn’t just affect you.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secondhand smoke hurts those around you.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about vaping?

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it safer?

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not on your life!

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being promoted
as a safe alternative to smoking,

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vaping was implicated in dozens of deaths

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thousands of users got very sick.

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:45.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, just like smoking,

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:47.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could get addicted.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who really benefits if you take up vaping?

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will you do
if someone invites you to smoke?

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try simply saying:
“No, thanks. I don’t smoke.”

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that doesn’t work, try something like,

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I checked out the risks,
and it’s not for me.”

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you’re already addicted?

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might feel like there’s no way out.

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you can break the habit.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, if you vape or smoke, ask for help,

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if possible, from someone
who has successfully quit smoking.

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, avoid people
and places that feed the urge.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one more thing—pray.

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you pray intensely

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for help before you give in,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can quit with God’s help.

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Bible writer said at Psalm 18:29:

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:50.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By God’s power I can scale a wall.”

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, even if you struggle with addiction,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can win the fight.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Resist the temptation
to use tobacco in any form.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be healthier,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happier, and breathe easier,

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing your life isn’t going up in smoke.

00:00:02 Just a few months ago,
00:00:04 most of us had probably
00:00:06 never even heard the word “coronavirus.”
00:00:11 Now the words “coronavirus” and “COVID-19”
00:00:16 have become an all-too-familiar part
00:00:20 of our vocabulary.
00:00:23 With the world facing this pandemic,
00:00:26 everyday life for many of us
00:00:29 has been disrupted in ways we might never have imagined.
00:00:34 And, sad to say, in just a short time,
00:00:38 this disease has taken the lives of thousands.
00:00:43 We know you are concerned
00:00:46 about the well-being of our brothers and sisters,
00:00:49 especially those living in lands
00:00:52 most directly affected by COVID-19.
00:00:57 Well, in this report, we’ll hear from responsible brothers
00:01:01 in Korea, Italy, and the United States
00:01:06 to find out how our brothers and sisters
00:01:09 are doing and what steps are being taken
00:01:12 to assist those facing this serious health crisis.
00:01:17 But before we hear from those brothers,
00:01:21 please let me share some thoughts with you.
00:01:24 The spread of this disease
00:01:27 is distressing, to be sure.
00:01:31 But we’re really not surprised to see the world
00:01:35 in the grip of such pestilence, are we?
00:01:39 Jesus made it clear at Luke 21:11
00:01:44 that pestilence would be part of the sign of the last days.
00:01:49 And in Revelation chapter 6,
00:01:52 the ride of the fourth horseman
00:01:54 includes mention of “deadly plague.”
00:01:59 So the events unfolding around us
00:02:02 are making it clearer than ever
00:02:05 that we’re living in the final part of the last days
00:02:10 —undoubtedly, the final part of the final part of the last days,
00:02:15 shortly before the last day of the last days.
00:02:21 But while the situation is serious,
00:02:25 as Jehovah’s people, we do not need to panic,
00:02:30 and Isaiah 30:15 tells us why.
00:02:35 Let’s read that together.
00:02:37 Isaiah 30:15:
00:02:41 “For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,
00:02:45 “the Holy One of Israel, says:
00:02:48 “‘By returning to me and resting, you will be saved;
00:02:53 “‘your strength will be
00:02:57 in keeping calm and showing trust.’”
00:03:03 Jehovah has always guided and supported
00:03:07 his people in times of distress.
00:03:10 So we have good reason to do just as this verse tells us:
00:03:15 ‘Keep calm and show trust’ in Jehovah.
00:03:20 And, in turn, Jehovah will give us strength.
00:03:24 As we’ll see in these reports from around the world,
00:03:28 Jehovah has given us Bible principles
00:03:31 to help his people make wise decisions,
00:03:35 even in very difficult circumstances.
00:03:39 Let’s begin by speaking with Brother Reino Kesk,
00:03:44 who serves in Korea.
00:03:46 Thank you, Reino, for joining us.
00:03:49 You’re welcome.
00:03:50 It’s a privilege.
00:03:53 But we ask, Brother Kesk,
00:03:55 how are the brothers in Korea
00:03:57 doing right now?
00:04:01 Although there is fear
00:04:03 throughout the country, our brothers are in good spirits
00:04:07 and they really are endeavoring
00:04:09 to apply the good counsel at Isaiah 26:3
00:04:14 by fully leaning on Jehovah and by trusting in him.
00:04:20 That’s very good to hear.
00:04:23 How has the coronavirus pandemic
00:04:26 affected the congregation meetings
00:04:29 and field ministry in your branch territory?
00:04:33 Well, we’ve had to stop holding meetings
00:04:36 at the Kingdom Halls and also stop public witnessing.
00:04:40 At first, the brothers were a little bit confused when this happened
00:04:45 because of the suddenness of everything.
00:04:48 But once they were informed about the reasons for these steps
00:04:51 that had to be taken and also when they understood the need
00:04:55 to apply Romans 13:1
00:04:57 (to cooperate with the “superior authorities,”
00:04:59 or the government officials),
00:05:01 they understood immediately and started to put into practice
00:05:06 the recommendations and the suggestions that were given.
00:05:10 And they were so thankful for these good suggestions,
00:05:13 recommendations, from the organization.
00:05:16 Well, those are big changes,
00:05:19 but no doubt the obedience and cooperation
00:05:23 of the brothers has reflected favorably
00:05:26 on Jehovah’s name.
00:05:28 But what has helped the brothers
00:05:31 maintain their peace of mind during this time?
00:05:36 Well, the friends are still keeping a very good spiritual routine,
00:05:40 which is helping them, and all of us, to stay calm
00:05:44 and to keep a proper perspective of matters.
00:05:48 As far as meetings are concerned,
00:05:50 the brothers are either meeting together in small groups
00:05:54 or they’re using videoconferencing programs
00:05:57 so they can keep in touch and enjoy the meetings that way
00:06:00 —and also JW Stream.
00:06:02 They’re also more flexible in their ministry.
00:06:06 They’re writing letters, they’re texting their return visits,
00:06:11 they’re conducting Bible studies over the telephone,
00:06:15 they’re calling their family and friends to see how they are (to talk to them),
00:06:19 and they’re also calling former Bible students
00:06:21 to see how they are and are able to witness this way.
00:06:25 But one other thing too I might mention,
00:06:28 and that is, that the brothers are really trying hard
00:06:31 to be balanced in how much time they’re spending
00:06:35 watching news reports and reading about them.
00:06:39 In fact, it’s important, of course,
00:06:41 to stay up-to-date with things that are going on,
00:06:44 but our brothers have found that constantly watching
00:06:48 news reports and updates
00:06:51 can also increase undue,
00:06:54 or unnecessary, anxiety.
00:06:57 For a certainty, we can imitate the faith
00:07:02 of our brothers in Korea and their determination
00:07:06 to maintain good spiritual routines during this time.
00:07:11 Thank you very much for joining us for this report.
00:07:16 It’s been a pleasure.
00:07:19 Thank you.
00:07:21 Now we’ll go to Italy with Brother Greg Cicciù.
00:07:26 Thank you for being here, Greg.
00:07:30 I’m glad to be here, Brother Lett.
00:07:32 Thank you.
00:07:34 We know that our brothers in Italy
00:07:36 are facing many of the same challenges
00:07:39 as our brothers in Korea and in recent weeks
00:07:42 have had to face some especially difficult conditions,
00:07:47 including a nationwide lockdown.
00:07:51 Can you please tell us how our brothers are doing in Italy?
00:07:58 Well, some of our brothers have contracted
00:08:01 COVID-19 and, tragically,
00:08:03 as of March 16, six of them have died.
00:08:07 The vast majority of our brothers are fine.
00:08:10 We’re praying for all of them, especially those
00:08:12 who lost dear loved ones in death.
00:08:16 We’re very glad to hear that most of the brothers are doing well,
00:08:21 but our hearts go out to those who have lost their loved ones.
00:08:27 The news media has reported on the many restrictions in Italy right now.
00:08:33 How have our brothers been looking after each other
00:08:37 despite these restrictions?
00:08:41 Well, the brothers really miss associating together in person but,
00:08:44 thanks to Jehovah’s blessing, they’re doing well spiritually.
00:08:48 As Jesus said at John 13:34, 35
00:08:52 that love for one another would identify his true disciples,
00:08:55 well, we’re seeing this love in action here.
00:08:58 True, government restrictions prevent us from leaving home freely,
00:09:02 but the brothers regularly keep in touch by phone or other electronic means.
00:09:07 The result is that many are reporting  that through this situation,
00:09:11 it’s actually drawing our brothers closer together.
00:09:16 That’s very encouraging news.
00:09:20 Please tell us what the elders are doing to shepherd the brothers.
00:09:26 In addition to providing for physical needs where possible,
00:09:31 the elders are videoconferencing
00:09:33 with individuals and entire field service groups
00:09:37 to share Scriptural encouragement so that no one feels isolated.
00:09:42 Each one receives emotional and spiritual support.
00:09:45 Many are expressing a renewed appreciation for their dear shepherds.
00:09:49 For example, one sister wrote,
00:09:51 “I feel protected, like when a hen gathers
00:09:54 her chicks to protect them from a predator.”
00:09:57 Another brother said, “I feel Jehovah’s love through my elders.”
00:10:02 Just as Isaiah 32:2 says,
00:10:05 our elders are really proving to be “a hiding place from the wind,
00:10:08 [and] a place of concealment from the rainstorm.”
00:10:11 How very encouraging!
00:10:15 We’re excited to hear how Jehovah
00:10:17 is getting you brothers through this difficult time.
00:10:22 Our prayers will continue to be with you.
00:10:26 Thank you very much, Brother Lett.
00:10:29 Now we’ll go to the United States and speak
00:10:33 with Brother Harold Corkern, who serves in Wallkill, New York.
00:10:38 Brother Corkern serves as a helper to the
00:10:41 Publishing Committee of the Governing Body
00:10:43 but is also a member
00:10:45 of the United States Branch Committee.
00:10:48 Thank you for being with us, Harold,
00:10:50 and we look forward to hearing from you.
00:10:55 Thank you for the opportunity, Brother Lett.
00:10:58 Why don’t you tell us how the brothers
00:11:02 at world headquarters and other
00:11:05 United States Bethel facilities are doing?
00:11:09 Well, there’s no question
00:11:11 that we’re going through some challenging times
00:11:14 because we’ve never experienced
00:11:17 a health situation like the scope of this one.
00:11:20 But on behalf of the Branch Committee,
00:11:22 we’re very happy to report that the Bethel family is coping well.
00:11:27 And commendably, they have displayed the “wisdom from above,”
00:11:32 being “ready to obey” as described
00:11:35 in the book of James 3:17.
00:11:38 And likewise, our brothers in the field
00:11:40 are quick to respond to direction from the branch office.
00:11:45 That’s very good to hear.
00:11:48 Can you explain what practical steps
00:11:51 the brothers are taking to avoid spreading the coronavirus?
00:11:58 We’re taking very seriously the guidelines
00:12:02 that we have received from medical and government authorities
00:12:06 regarding steps that can be taken to prevent the spread of the virus.
00:12:11 There are some basic reminders, such as regular hand washing,
00:12:15 not touching the face, avoiding hugs and handshakes,
00:12:21 and making sure to disinfect regularly surfaces that are often touched.
00:12:27 And if someone is sick, they should stay home.
00:12:30 So we have emphasized these basic reminders
00:12:34 not only to our fellow workers here at Bethel but also to those in the field.
00:12:39 Those are very practical reminders.
00:12:43 Even I’ve been greeting my brothers
00:12:46 with an elbow bump instead of a handshake.
00:12:50 Can you tell us what other measures
00:12:53 have been taken to keep everyone
00:12:55 as safe as possible?
00:12:59 Well, as a precaution for the Bethel family,
00:13:02 for our brothers in the field, and for our neighbors,
00:13:06 no tours or guests are permitted
00:13:10 at our Bethel complexes at this time.
00:13:13 At the direction of the Governing Body,
00:13:16 no guests attended in person at the recent Gilead graduation,
00:13:21 and the Bethel family was directed
00:13:25 to watch the program from their personal rooms.
00:13:30 Now with growing concerns,
00:13:33 the most recent precaution that’s being taken
00:13:36 is that the Bethel family has been directed
00:13:39 to not leave their respective complexes
00:13:43 for any activity
00:13:45 —that would include shopping,
00:13:49 social gatherings, and meetings.
00:13:53 And we’d like to emphasize that this
00:13:55 is a precaution to protect the Bethel family,
00:13:58 because we do not have an outbreak at this time,
00:14:01 but we’re being extra careful to protect them.
00:14:04 And we will monitor this latest restriction
00:14:08 on a week-by-week basis
00:14:10 to determine how much longer it should continue.
00:14:13 Now, as far as the field is concerned,
00:14:16 we have directed that all large theocratic events
00:14:20 throughout the U.S. branch territory should be canceled until May 17.
00:14:26 Many of the adjustments you’ve described
00:14:30 have no doubt been challenging.
00:14:33 How have the brothers responded?
00:14:38 We’re happy to report that they have responded very well
00:14:42 to the precautions that have been provided.
00:14:44 And we’d also like to say, Brother Lett,
00:14:47 on behalf of the Branch Committee to you dear brothers on the Governing Body:
00:14:51 Thank you very much for your loving direction.
00:14:54 We can certainly sense your loving concern
00:14:57 and your tender affection.
00:15:00 So thank you very much.
00:15:02 Well, thank you very much, Harold.
00:15:05 I’ll be sure to pass that appreciation on to the other brothers.
00:15:10 We’ve looked to Jehovah for help in making these decisions.
00:15:15 It’s encouraging to see how willing and cooperative
00:15:20 our brothers and sisters have been.
00:15:23 Thank you very much, Brother Corkern, for sharing this update.
00:15:29 You’re very welcome.
00:15:31 As you’ve seen from these reports,
00:15:34 with the situation changing day by day —sometimes hour by hour—
00:15:39 many adjustments have had to be made.
00:15:43 Now, in some cases, the Governing Body
00:15:46 has provided specific direction
00:15:48 on how these adjustments should be put into effect.
00:15:53 But many decisions have been left
00:15:56 to those who are most familiar with local circumstances:
00:16:00 Branch Committee members,
00:16:03 circuit overseers, and congregation elders.
00:16:07 To you faithful spirit-appointed men
00:16:11 serving in these capacities,
00:16:13 we’d like to say this: We trust you,
00:16:18 and we are confident
00:16:20 that you’ll prayerfully evaluate the facts
00:16:24 and local circumstances
00:16:26 and follow the direction of the “superior authorities.”
00:16:30 And we know that you’ll do all within your power
00:16:34 to stay in touch with the congregations.
00:16:38 You will do so on a regular basis
00:16:41 by phone or videoconference as necessary.
00:16:45 We’re also confident that Jehovah’s spirit
00:16:48 will guide you and give you the mature judgment
00:16:53 needed at this time
00:16:55 to apply Bible principles properly
00:16:58 and to provide clear direction.
00:17:03 As for the rest of us, whether the direction we receive comes
00:17:08 from the Governing Body, the branch,
00:17:10 our circuit overseer, or the elders,
00:17:13 we want to follow that direction closely.
00:17:18 It can serve as a protection now and, really,
00:17:23 if we think about it,
00:17:25 it’s good practice as we head
00:17:28 into even more turbulent times ahead.
00:17:32 Before we conclude, we’d like to share a few thoughts
00:17:37 about the upcoming Memorial
00:17:40 of the death of Jesus Christ on April 7.
00:17:44 There’s no virus or pandemic in the world
00:17:49 that can dampen our appreciation
00:17:53 for what Jehovah and Jesus have done for us
00:17:56 or weaken our determination
00:18:00 to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal.
00:18:04 Our gathering to commemorate
00:18:07 that important event is more than a tradition;
00:18:12 it’s a command
00:18:15 recorded at Luke 22:19.
00:18:18 Let’s read that together.
00:18:21 Luke 22:19:
00:18:25 “Also, he [Jesus] took a loaf,
00:18:30 “gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them,
00:18:34 “saying: ‘This means my body,
00:18:37 “‘which is to be given in your behalf.
00:18:41 Keep doing this in remembrance of me.’”
00:18:47 So will we ‘keep doing this in remembrance of Jesus,’ as he commanded?
00:18:53 Absolutely.
00:18:57 But how we do so may vary
00:18:59 depending on our local circumstances.
00:19:03 If it’s possible in your area,
00:19:05 we encourage you to meet with your congregation.
00:19:10 You can be sure that the elders
00:19:12 will take practical measures for the benefit of all those attending.
00:19:17 Of course, in some areas,
00:19:20 local circumstances created by COVID-19
00:19:24 may prevent you from meeting as a congregation.
00:19:27 In that case, you may receive direction
00:19:30 from your elders to meet in smaller groups;
00:19:34 to use videoconferencing, like Skype® or Zoom;
00:19:38 or if none of those options are possible,
00:19:42 to watch the program on jw.org®.
00:19:47 How thankful we are to Jehovah
00:19:51 that he’s equipped us to be able to “drink the milk of nations”
00:19:55 as mentioned at Isaiah 60:16,
00:20:00 which includes the wise use of technology!
00:20:06 Regardless of the specific arrangements involved,
00:20:09 we all want to prepare our hearts
00:20:13 and do whatever is necessary
00:20:16 to obey Jesus’ command
00:20:19 to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal.
00:20:23 Just think for a moment about Jesus’ sacrifice
00:20:27 and what it means,
00:20:29 especially in the light of this global health crisis.
00:20:34 By means of the ransom, Jehovah has made provision
00:20:39 to completely eliminate problems
00:20:42 such as pestilence from the earth
00:20:45 —not just this one viral pandemic
00:20:48 but all sickness and death.
00:20:52 Admittedly, the events we see around us
00:20:57 are now creating “times hard to deal with,”
00:21:02 just as the Bible foretold.
00:21:04 But these events also remind us
00:21:08 of how close we are to seeing
00:21:11 a complete solution
00:21:13 to all these problems forever.
00:21:18 We want you to know that the Governing Body
00:21:22 loves you deeply
00:21:25 and will keep you in our prayers.
00:21:29 Our brothers in the United States, Italy,
00:21:33 and Korea send their warm love and greetings.
00:21:38 This is JW Broadcasting®
00:21:42 from the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

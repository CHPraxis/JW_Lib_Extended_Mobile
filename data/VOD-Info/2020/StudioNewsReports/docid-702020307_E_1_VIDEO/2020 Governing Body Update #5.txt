00:00:01 This global pandemic has thrown the world
00:00:04 into a state of uncertainty,
00:00:07 with so many unknowns.
00:00:10 But there’s one thing that we do  know:
00:00:13 Through it all,
00:00:15 Jehovah has really been taking care of us.
00:00:19 Day after day, brothers around the world tell us
00:00:23 that they truly feel that Jehovah and his organization
00:00:27 are watching over them.
00:00:30 It makes me think of the scripture
00:00:32 at Isaiah 40:11:
00:00:36 “Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.
00:00:41 “With his arm
00:00:43 “he will gather together the lambs,
00:00:46 “and in his bosom he will carry them.
00:00:49 “He will gently lead
00:00:51 those nursing their young.”
00:00:55 Is that how you feel,
00:00:57 like a lamb in the protective arms of our heavenly Father?
00:01:03 Well, we as members of the Governing Body feel exactly the same way!
00:01:08 All of us are getting through this challenging time,
00:01:13 thanks to the tender and loving care of our heavenly Father.
00:01:19 As that tender Shepherd,
00:01:21 Jehovah does more than just take note of our problems.
00:01:26 He looks for ways to help us.
00:01:30 As Psalm 37:5 says:
00:01:32 “Commit your way to Jehovah;
00:01:36 “rely on him,
00:01:38 and he will act in your behalf.”
00:01:42 One way that Jehovah ‘acts in our behalf’
00:01:46 is by motivating his people to help those in need.
00:01:51 In this report, we’d like to share some examples
00:01:55 of how our brothers and sisters are doing just that.
00:01:59 In some parts of the world,
00:02:01 one of the foremost concerns our brothers have
00:02:05 is simply getting enough to eat.
00:02:09 Extremely limited food supplies,
00:02:12 lockdowns, widespread unemployment, and other problems
00:02:17 have left families with little or no food.
00:02:22 The Coordinators’ Committee  of the Governing Body
00:02:24 has been doing all it can to help provide
00:02:27 food and basic medicine to those brothers.
00:02:32 More than 400 Disaster Relief Committees
00:02:36 have already been appointed worldwide.
00:02:39 These committees are working tirelessly
00:02:42 to ensure that our brothers and sisters
00:02:45 have what they need to survive.
00:02:48 That’s the case in the country of Angola.
00:02:52 How are the brothers benefiting from the food relief being provided?
00:02:57 Brother Johannes De Jager from the Angola branch
00:03:00 has an update for us.
00:03:04 Back in March, a state of emergency
00:03:06 was declared here in Angola.
00:03:09 With the lockdown,
00:03:10 many of our brothers and sisters could no longer work,
00:03:12 making it difficult to feed their families.
00:03:16 As a Branch Committee,
00:03:17 we were extremely concerned about the situation.
00:03:20 We wondered,
00:03:22 ‘How are we going to look after all our dear brothers and sisters?’
00:03:27 We immediately wrote the Coordinators’ Committee
00:03:29 and informed them of the situation.
00:03:31 You can imagine how we were overjoyed when they replied,
00:03:35 providing us the aid so that we could feed our dear brothers.
00:03:39 Well, suddenly we needed to coordinate a huge relief effort.
00:03:44 To accomplish the work, we appointed 37 Disaster Relief Committees.
00:03:49 Locally, we purchased and distributed
00:03:52 138 tons of rice,
138 tons of maize meal,
00:03:56 and 104 tons of beans.
00:03:59 Additionally, through world headquarters,
00:04:02 we purchased 313 tons of food from Brazil.
00:04:06 The first shipment arrived July 12th.
00:04:08 Our brothers have worked quickly to distribute the food.
00:04:12 Thus far,
34,701 brothers and interested ones
00:04:17 have received basic food supplies.
00:04:22 The appreciation for these provisions has been overwhelming.
00:04:25 For example, one widowed sister
00:04:28 raising her five grandchildren received food.
00:04:32 She said, “Jehovah sees me.”
00:04:37 We realize that this is an ongoing situation,
00:04:40 but we are confident
00:04:42 that Jehovah will continue to lovingly care
00:04:46 for all our brothers in Angola.
00:04:51 What a clear expression of Jehovah’s tender care
00:04:55 for our brothers in Angola!
00:04:57 Of course, the need for relief isn’t limited to Angola.
00:05:02 Right now, with Jehovah’s help,
00:05:05 relief efforts are ongoing throughout Africa,
00:05:08 South America, and many other parts of the world.
00:05:13 In fact, the Governing Body has thus far approved
00:05:17 over 17 million dollars of relief aid
00:05:22 to help our dear brothers during this pandemic.
00:05:25 Now, on this topic of food supplies,
00:05:28 we’d like to share a reminder:
00:05:31 With ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks occurring
00:05:35 and, in some cases, reoccurring  around the world,
00:05:40 we never know when supply lines will falter in our area
00:05:45 or when we may need to shelter-in-place
00:05:48 for an extended period of time.
00:05:51 So, if possible in your local situation,
00:05:56 it would be wise to have on hand a reserve
00:06:00 of nonperishable food items
00:06:03 and other basic necessities,
00:06:06 not hoarding food or stockpiling it unnecessarily,
00:06:11 but maintaining a reasonable supply as a precaution.
00:06:17 But now, what about our spiritual  food?
00:06:21 How is Jehovah caring for that need?
00:06:24 Many of us have been attending our congregation meetings
00:06:28 by videoconference.
00:06:30 Although we miss the personal contact,
00:06:34 haven’t our online meetings been a blessing?
00:06:38 In many places, meeting attendance has gone up significantly.
00:06:43 Many of our dear inactive brothers and sisters
00:06:47 have been attending with us.
00:06:49 It’s been wonderful to have them.
00:06:52 And how proud we are of you elderly brothers and sisters!
00:06:58 You’ve quickly learned how to use the videoconferencing tools.
00:07:02 We love seeing you participate at the meetings.
00:07:07 But as we know,
00:07:09 many of our brothers and sisters live in areas
00:07:12 where Internet access is either not available
00:07:16 or it’s simply too expensive.
00:07:19 How are our brothers in these areas getting their  spiritual food?
00:07:25 You may recall from the third Governing Body update
00:07:28 that some branches in Africa were approved
00:07:31 to broadcast the special talk and the Memorial
00:07:35 over local TV and radio stations.
00:07:39 Well, I’m so happy to tell you
00:07:42 that the Governing Body has also approved
00:07:45 to have regular congregation meetings
00:07:47 broadcast via TV and radio!
00:07:52 One of the branches  benefiting from this arrangement
00:07:55 is Mozambique.
00:07:57 Brother Amaro Teixeira will give us an update
00:08:01 on the impact that this is having.
00:08:05 In Mozambique,
00:08:07 many brothers live in areas where Internet
00:08:10 and electronic devices are not available.
00:08:13 So we were so happy when the Governing Body
00:08:15 informed all branches in Africa
00:08:18 that we could investigate
00:08:19 broadcasting congregation meetings over TV and radio.
00:08:24 As of July 10, arrangements have been made
00:08:29 with 87 radio stations and one TV outlet in Mozambique.
00:08:33 This allows more than 51,000 of our brothers and sisters
00:08:38 to listen to the meetings each week in 24 different languages.
00:08:43 That is very good for our brothers.
00:08:46 These spiritual programs are at the same time available
00:08:50 to an audience of about 23 million people.
00:08:54 Our brothers are so grateful for these arrangements.
00:08:58 When it was announced, some cried tears of joy.
00:09:03 Many brothers shared the feelings of one couple who wrote:
00:09:07 “Your hard work, together with Jehovah’s holy spirit,
00:09:11 “has moved the ‘mountains’ to give our brothers in Mozambique
00:09:15 “their spiritual ‘food at the proper time.’
00:09:18 “Jehovah’s active support and love for all of us
00:09:22 “overwhelmed us with gratitude and love for him,
00:09:26 his Son, and our spiritual family.”
00:09:31 How wonderful!
00:09:33 This provision was recently extended to other branches,
00:09:37 and now we’re broadcasting congregation meetings
00:09:40 via TV and radio in 21 countries.
00:09:45 This allows about 1.2 million brothers and sisters
00:09:50 to listen to recordings of congregation meetings
00:09:53 and makes our spiritual programs available
00:09:57 to a potential audience
00:10:00 of almost 280 million people!
00:10:06 Jehovah is certainly providing his people
00:10:09 with needed physical and spiritual food.
00:10:13 But how is he caring for our persecuted brothers?
00:10:18 During this pandemic,
00:10:21 many of us may have felt like prisoners in our own homes.
00:10:25 But just think for a moment
00:10:28 about those who are actually in prison
00:10:31 —right now— during this pandemic.
00:10:35 As of July 19, 2020,
00:10:37 at least 116 brothers and sisters worldwide
00:10:42 are imprisoned for their faith.
00:10:45 In Russia,
00:10:47 an additional 27  are presently under house arrest,
00:10:51 and 372 are under criminal investigation.
00:10:57 Worldwide, the youngest ones in prison
00:11:01 are just 19 years old,
00:11:03 and the oldest is 81.
00:11:07 Some of our brothers have been imprisoned
00:11:10 or under house arrest for years.
00:11:12 Take, for example, our three brothers in Eritrea
00:11:16 —Paulos, Isaac, and Negede—
00:11:19 who’ve been in prison the longest
00:11:21 —almost 26 years!
00:11:26 In Russia, just last week, on July 13, 2020,
00:11:31 there was a record number of searches of our brothers’ homes
00:11:35 —at least 100 in one day.
00:11:39 In connection with this raid,
00:11:42 Brothers Dmitrii Katyrov and Aleksandr Bokov
00:11:46 were beaten by the authorities.
00:11:51 Counting from the time when the ban started in 2017,
00:11:55 this brings the total number of home raids
00:11:58 to over 1,000!
00:12:01 Our brothers in prison around the world
00:12:04 needed our prayers before COVID-19,
00:12:08 and they need them even more now.
00:12:12 At Hebrews 13:3, Paul wrote:
00:12:16 “Keep in mind those in prison,
00:12:19 as though you were imprisoned with them.”
00:12:24 Certainly, we feel for our brothers and sisters
00:12:27 who are imprisoned for their faith.
00:12:30 How are they bearing up?
00:12:32 How is Jehovah sustaining them through their trials?
00:12:36 Let’s get an update from two sisters
00:12:39 who were held in detention in Russia.
00:12:47 On June 11, 2019,
00:12:50 at around eight o’clock in the morning,
00:12:52 officers from the investigative committee
00:12:55 and the police burst into our home.
00:12:58 The search lasted almost all day.
00:13:00 And then after the search, they took us to the investigative committee,
00:13:04 where they detained us
00:13:05 and put us in a temporary holding facility.
00:13:09 The result was a court hearing in Novozybkov.
00:13:12 They imposed restrictive measures on me, meaning they put me in detention.
00:13:15 And, altogether, I spent almost eight months behind bars.
00:13:21 I spent eight months in a pretrial detention facility.
00:13:23 I spent 245 days behind bars.
00:13:30 For me, the time I spent in pretrial detention
00:13:33 went by very quickly.
00:13:36 Even that number —245 days—
00:13:39 it sounds like a lot
00:13:41 but, really, it didn’t feel like that many
00:13:44 because I was busy replying to letters
00:13:48 and also talking to my cellmates.
00:13:51 I prayed to Jehovah a lot during that time.
00:13:54 I read the Bible, and I did personal study.
00:13:59 Eight months in pretrial detention—
00:14:02 You could really describe it as being in isolation,
00:14:04 because I missed live association
00:14:07 —live association with brothers and sisters
00:14:10 when you can talk to them in real life,
00:14:12 face-to-face, and even hug them.
00:14:15 In the beginning, it was hard.
00:14:17 But then I saw that if you accept the circumstances,
00:14:22 it becomes easier to get on with life.
00:14:25 I prayed to Jehovah not to feel sorry for myself
00:14:29 and not to concentrate on how bad things were
00:14:32 being in one room all the time.
00:14:36 I prayed to accept the conditions
00:14:38 I found myself in on any given day.
00:14:41 I also realized
00:14:43 that it is important to always look for reasons to be grateful,
00:14:47 and every evening, even if it didn’t seem
00:14:50 as though anything particularly special had happened,
00:14:53 I tried to thank Jehovah, and that also gave me strength,
00:14:57 because it turns out that in every day, there is something good.
00:15:01 It got to the point where sometimes
00:15:04 I didn’t even notice the locked door!
00:15:06 Through the bars, I saw the sky and didn’t even see the bars.
00:15:10 Or when we went out for exercise,
00:15:13 which was just a yard with walls all around
00:15:18 and just a bit of the sky was visible,
00:15:20 I realized that Jehovah gives the right attitude when,
00:15:24 for example, I wondered, ‘What is behind those walls?’
00:15:28 And I could even imagine that the Alps were out there,
00:15:31 that there were cornflowers (my favorite flowers) out there and poppies.
00:15:36 I thanked Jehovah that I had,
00:15:38 for example, the Bible and that I could read it
00:15:41 and for being able to pray to Jehovah,
00:15:44 for the fact that I had been able to do the right thing that day,
00:15:48 for the bird that I had seen from the window.
00:15:50 And before the detention, I imagined
00:15:53 that if it did happen,
00:15:55 it is an assignment from Jehovah for the time being.
00:15:58 The first day I received letters was the anniversary of my baptism.
00:16:03 Twenty-four years had passed since that occasion.
00:16:06 I was feeling somewhat downcast,
00:16:09 and I asked Jehovah for a special gift.
00:16:12 And at the end of the day, I received that special gift
00:16:16 —it was 59 letters from brothers and sisters!
00:16:20 And I realized just what a unique God Jehovah is,
00:16:23 and that he tenderly cares for his servants.
00:16:26 It convinced me once again that Jehovah is a caring Father.
00:16:30 The first time I received
00:16:32 such a large number of letters —54 of them—
00:16:35 I sat on the bed, put them on my lap,
00:16:38 and didn’t know what to do with them.
00:16:40 I gathered my thoughts.
00:16:42 Of course, there were tears in my eyes!
00:16:45 So I gathered my thoughts and started going through them.
00:16:48 Thanks to the letters,
00:16:50 I was also able to do personal study.
00:16:53 I wrote down in two exercise books the thoughts that really strengthened me.
00:16:58 In one letter, it talked about the secret of David’s courage.
00:17:03 And it said that he concentrated,
00:17:06 not on how big Goliath was in comparison to him,
00:17:10 but on how tiny that giant was in comparison to Jehovah.
00:17:14 That thought really helped me
00:17:17 to switch to the right frame of mind and see Jehovah.
00:17:25 And when they escorted me from the courtroom to the vehicle,
00:17:28 to the transport vehicle,
00:17:30 the brothers and sisters who were still there
00:17:34 shouted words of encouragement.
00:17:38 Of course, I didn’t expect to see them there,
00:17:41 because I didn’t know how they would escort us from the courtroom.
00:17:45 Although you could say I was rather sad
00:17:47 because they left in place the restrictive measures,
00:17:50 when I got into the vehicle,
00:17:52 I was overjoyed inside
00:17:55 because, although I could hardly see the brothers,
00:17:57 I could hear their voices.
00:18:04 It made me determined to remain faithful to Jehovah,
00:18:09 and it helped me to stand up for the truth in the court hearings,
00:18:13 and I felt that I was not alone
00:18:17 because I knew that many are concerned for me and praying for me.
00:18:22 When I was in hard circumstances,
00:18:24 I actually became convinced that no matter
00:18:27 how serious the difficulties are,
00:18:30 Jehovah always gives enough holy spirit
00:18:33 to overcome any trial.
00:18:35 I realized that actually
00:18:37 there is no need to be afraid of trials that may befall us.
00:18:41 Jehovah is always close to us,
00:18:44 and he always supports, strengthens,
00:18:47 and helps us.
00:18:49 He is very sensitive to our needs
00:18:52 and, at times like that,
00:18:54 he draws close to us in a unique way.
00:19:04 How encouraging!
00:19:06 Prison walls cannot stop Jehovah
00:19:09 from tenderly caring for his servants.
00:19:12 I think these upbuilding expressions of our sisters
00:19:15 will help many of us who are feeling isolated
00:19:19 because of the pandemic.
00:19:22 Brothers and sisters,
00:19:24 we’re all going through a difficult time.
00:19:28 Some of you have lost your jobs,
00:19:31 some are concerned about finding enough food for each day,
00:19:34 and many of us have lost loved ones in death.
00:19:40 In spite of all these challenges,
00:19:43 isn’t it clear that Jehovah is helping us to cope
00:19:48 —both physically and spiritually?
00:19:51 As our Shepherd,
00:19:54 he is carrying us along
00:19:57 in his loving arms.
00:19:59 Whether we’re in lockdown,
00:20:02 facing food shortages, or even in prison,
00:20:06 his tender care will keep us going
00:20:10 and it will get us through to the end.
00:20:14 You can be confident that with Jehovah’s help and guidance,
00:20:19 we will continue to organize relief efforts
00:20:23 wherever they are needed.
00:20:25 But remember,
00:20:27 Jehovah may also use you
00:20:30 to come to the aid of others.
00:20:33 Pray for his spirit to guide you.
00:20:37 If you see an opportunity to help,
00:20:40 take action!
00:20:42 Hebrews 13:16 says:
00:20:46 “Do not forget to do good
00:20:49 “and to share what you have with others,
00:20:53 for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”
00:20:58 What a privilege we have to be used by Jehovah
00:21:03 to provide tender care for one another!
00:21:06 On behalf of the Governing Body,
00:21:09 please accept this virtual hug
00:21:14 and know that we love each one of you very much.
00:21:20 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

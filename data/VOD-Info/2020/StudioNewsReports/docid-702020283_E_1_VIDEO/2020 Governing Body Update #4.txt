00:00:01 In the face of this pandemic,
00:00:03 we’ve made dramatic adjustments
00:00:05 to our activities all over the world,
00:00:08 including how we meet, how we preach,
00:00:11 and even how we associate with one another.
00:00:15 We’ve even had to make adjustments to the adjustments
00:00:19 with the changing conditions.
00:00:21 As you know, some of these changes have come very quickly,
00:00:26 and we want to commend you for your obedience to theocratic direction.
00:00:31 We love you all very much and want to keep you safe
00:00:35 while helping you to maintain a good spiritual routine.
00:00:40 As we think about what happens next,
00:00:44 it’s important to remember that we’re not all experiencing
00:00:47 this global crisis the same way.
00:00:51 In some parts of the world,
00:00:53 the coronavirus is just beginning to spread more quickly.
00:00:57 In other places, outbreaks appear to be somewhat contained for now,
00:01:02 and governments are already easing restrictions.
00:01:06 So how will this affect our theocratic activities?
00:01:12 Well, as things open up in various regions,
00:01:16 we’re going to be guided by the principle
00:01:19 in Proverbs 14:16,
00:01:24 Proverbs 14:16,
00:01:28 where it says:
00:01:30 “The wise one is cautious and turns away from evil,
00:01:35 but the stupid one is reckless and overconfident.”
00:01:40 In this pandemic, recklessness and overconfidence
00:01:45 have literally cost people their lives.
00:01:49 But as the proverb says:
00:01:51 “The wise one is cautious.”
00:01:55 So we’ll continue to take a cautious approach.
00:01:58 In general, we’ll allow more time
00:02:01 after the government loosens a particular restriction
00:02:04 before we resume a theocratic activity.
00:02:09 This will allow the organization to monitor the impact
00:02:13 that any lifting of restrictions has
00:02:16 on the spread of the virus.
00:02:20 The Coordinators’ Committee of the Governing Body
00:02:23 recently shared some valuable principles
00:02:26 with Branch Committees around the world
00:02:29 to help guide them as governments ease restrictions
00:02:32 related to the spread of COVID-19.
00:02:36 We’d like to share three of those points with you now.
00:02:41 We are confident that obediently holding to these principles
00:02:45 will not only save lives
00:02:48 but glorify Jehovah.
00:02:51 First, out of respect for our Creator,
00:02:55 we place a high value on life.
00:02:58 Some governments may choose
00:03:00 to lift restrictions and reopen businesses,
00:03:04 in part for economic reasons.
00:03:08 But simply put,
00:03:10 our decisions are motivated by love,
00:03:14 not money.
00:03:16 So we’ll continue to make the safety of our brothers a priority
00:03:21 over personal convenience or preference.
00:03:25 Ecclesiastes 7:12 says this,
00:03:29 Ecclesiastes 7:12:
00:03:31 “Wisdom is a protection
00:03:35 “just as money is a protection,
00:03:37 “but the advantage of knowledge is this:
00:03:41 Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.”
00:03:45 So, in harmony with that,
00:03:48 our aim has been and will continue to be
00:03:51 to make wise, balanced decisions that protect lives.
00:03:56 As an example, back in March we made the decision
00:04:00 to hold the Gilead graduation with no invited guests present.
00:04:05 That was a big change.
00:04:07 But that one decision protected so many lives here at Bethel in New York
00:04:12 and among those who would have been guests.
00:04:15 Little did we know that just a short time later,
00:04:19 New York would become an epicenter of the pandemic.
00:04:23 We thank Jehovah for helping us
00:04:26 to make that wise decision!
00:04:30 What’s the lesson?
00:04:32 Because we place a high value on life,
00:04:35 we need to follow direction
00:04:38 even if it seems overly cautious
00:04:40 or means significant changes in our theocratic activities.
00:04:46 That obedience will help to keep all of us as safe as possible.
00:04:52 In the following video, note how this has proved to be the case
00:04:55 for the brothers in South America,
00:04:58 where the outbreak of COVID-19 cases
00:05:01 has surged in recent weeks.
00:05:04 We’ll hear from Brother Anthony Carvalho,
00:05:06 who serves on the Brazil Branch Committee,
00:05:09 and from Brother Jaime Tamayo,
00:05:11 who serves on the Ecuador Branch Committee.
00:05:14 Their reports show the benefits of obedience
00:05:18 even if at first we don’t understand the reasons for the direction.
00:05:25 The outbreak of COVID-19
00:05:27 has already taken tens of thousands of lives in Brazil,
00:05:32 and so we’ve come to appreciate
00:05:33 how the early direction
00:05:34 we received from the organization
00:05:36 was a real protection.
00:05:38 One example is a sister who is a medical doctor.
00:05:41 She said that when the branch office
00:05:43 gave direction to suspend meetings at the Kingdom Hall,
00:05:46 she honestly did not agree.
00:05:48 There weren’t any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region,
00:05:53 and the local government had not ordered any restrictions.
00:05:57 So she felt the brothers might be exaggerating the threat a bit.
00:06:01 But then she reasoned on how Jehovah had sometimes given his people direction
00:06:06 that didn’t make sense from a human standpoint,
00:06:09 and so she decided to obey.
00:06:13 Well, shortly after congregation meetings were suspended,
00:06:16 the government put restrictions in place.
00:06:20 COVID-19 began to spread rapidly in the region,
00:06:23 and sadly many have died.
00:06:27 Our sister said that she now sees
00:06:29 that the direction from the organization was a real protection.
00:06:33 She related,
00:06:35 “Seeing how Jehovah is caring for us in a loving and tender way,
00:06:38 “even on an individual level,
00:06:40 has increased my confidence in him.”
00:06:44 Well, this is just one example of many here in Brazil,
00:06:47 where we have truly seen the benefits
00:06:50 of obediently following theocratic direction.
00:06:55 There is no question that the early direction
00:06:58 we received in Ecuador saved lives.
00:07:01 For instance, one publisher, Fabricio,
00:07:04 started to have some flulike symptoms,
00:07:07 but his doctor told him
00:07:08 that it was the common flu
00:07:10 and not COVID-19.
00:07:12 Still, Fabricio followed the instructions from the organization
00:07:16 to stay home if you have any symptoms of illness.
00:07:20 Later he said, “All in our family agreed
00:07:23 “that it was important to follow these instructions
00:07:27 since they were given to protect us.”
00:07:30 During the following weeks,
00:07:32 he and his family didn’t allow anyone into the house.
00:07:36 Even when relatives came to visit them,
00:07:39 they received them outside the house to maintain a safe distance.
00:07:44 Around the same time, meetings at the Kingdom Hall were suspended.
00:07:49 Well, several weeks later,
00:07:51 Fabricio tested positive for COVID-19
00:07:54 and so did three family members.
00:07:58 Fabricio’s family are so glad that they followed the instructions
00:08:02 received from the organization.
00:08:04 They maintained distancing protocols
00:08:07 even without a positive diagnosis of COVID-19.
00:08:11 This protected the lives of others,
00:08:14 including their extended family and the congregation.
00:08:18 This really helped us appreciate
00:08:20 the wisdom of suspending congregation meetings when we did.
00:08:24 Doing so prevented the spread of the disease to others.
00:08:31 What a powerful example of how our obedience to direction
00:08:36 is a protection and a blessing!
00:08:41 Our second principle is based on Romans 13:1, 2:
00:08:46 We must listen
00:08:47 to the governmental “superior authorities,”
00:08:50 who are permitted by Jehovah
00:08:52 to care for certain functions.
00:08:54 The importance of listening to these authorities
00:08:57 is emphasized in verse 2, where it says:
00:09:02 “Whoever opposes the authority
00:09:04 “(or, according to the footnote, whoever ‘resists’ the authority)
00:09:08 has taken a stand against the arrangement of God.”
00:09:14 We know that these authorities exist by God’s permission,
00:09:18 and it’s his will that Christians be subject to them,
00:09:22 as long as what they require doesn’t conflict with his law.
00:09:27 News reports are filled with stories
00:09:30 of people ignoring the direction from the authorities
00:09:33 or even protesting against it.
00:09:36 But rebelling against secular authorities
00:09:38 constitutes a rebellion against God.
00:09:43 We love Jehovah,
00:09:45 so we respect the authorities.
00:09:50 We also listen to the authorities because we love our neighbors,
00:09:54 and we’re concerned with how they feel about health and safety.
00:09:59 We know that many people
00:10:01 out of concern for possible infection
00:10:04 are anxious about interacting with others.
00:10:08 Following safety guidelines from the authorities
00:10:11 and adjusting our activities
00:10:13 shows that we really care about our neighbors.
00:10:17 And this can even contribute to a good witness being given.
00:10:21 Here’s an example of that:
00:10:24 In one European country,
00:10:26 local officials visited our branch office
00:10:29 to check on what we were doing to slow the spread of the virus.
00:10:34 When the officials learned that we were holding
00:10:37 all our meetings by videoconference
00:10:39 and had already been in lockdown for over two weeks,
00:10:43 they were amazed!
00:10:45 One of them asked,
00:10:47 “Did you know beforehand that all of this would happen?”
00:10:52 The brothers explained that we’re a global organization
00:10:56 that puts a high value on human life,
00:10:59 so we were following developments on an international level.
00:11:04 That enabled the brothers to take the steps needed
00:11:07 to keep everyone as safe as possible,
00:11:10 even ahead of guidelines from the national and local governments.
00:11:16 The officials were impressed.
00:11:20 Doesn’t that beautifully illustrate
00:11:23 how our obedience reflects favorably
00:11:26 on our organization and our God?
00:11:30 It brings to mind the thought at 1 Peter 2:12.
00:11:35 When people become ‘eyewitnesses of our fine conduct,’
00:11:40 it brings glory to Jehovah.
00:11:45 The third principle we want to share is this:
00:11:48 Do not develop a casual attitude.
00:11:54 As this situation stretches on month after month,
00:11:59 it can be hard to stay vigilant.
00:12:03 We might be inclined to relax,
00:12:06 lower our guard,
00:12:08 especially as certain restrictions are removed.
00:12:12 However, Proverbs 22:3 reminds us:
00:12:17 “The shrewd one sees the danger
00:12:19 “and conceals himself,
00:12:21 “but the inexperienced keep right on going
00:12:25 and suffer the consequences.”
00:12:28 So we need to remain cautious and be ready for additional outbreaks.
00:12:33 Many experts say we may be dealing
00:12:36 with the spread of this virus for some time
00:12:38 until the successful treatments  and vaccinations
00:12:42 become widely available,
00:12:44 possibly in 2021 or beyond.
00:12:49 This means that the adjusted arrangements
00:12:52 we have in place for congregation meetings,
00:12:55 assemblies, and the field ministry
00:12:58 may need to continue for some time.
00:13:03 When we do begin returning to our normal arrangements,
00:13:07 it will be a gradual process,
00:13:09 in accord with what we read
00:13:11 in Proverbs 14:15:
00:13:15 “The naive person believes every word,
00:13:19 but the shrewd one ponders each step.”
00:13:25 You can be assured
00:13:27 that we will prayerfully ponder  each step
00:13:30 and adjust our meeting and service arrangements gradually.
00:13:35 And, of course, we’ll monitor the situation closely
00:13:40 and reinstate certain restrictions if additional outbreaks occur.
00:13:47 So as you face the days ahead,
00:13:51 keep in mind the three principles we’ve talked about:
00:13:55 (1) Place a high value on life,
00:14:01 (2) listen to the authorities,
00:14:05 and (3) guard against developing a casual attitude.
00:14:13 We know that this pandemic has hit some of you very hard.
00:14:18 You’ve lost jobs and income.
00:14:21 You young ones have had your schooling interrupted,
00:14:25 and you haven’t been able to be with your friends.
00:14:28 And tragically, a number of you
00:14:32 have lost family members and friends in death.
00:14:37 Some of you may feel like Job,
00:14:40 who faced one tragedy after another.
00:14:45 It pains our hearts to see what you’re going through,
00:14:51 and we’re praying for you every day.
00:14:56 It’s been a difficult time.
00:14:59 Yet, in many ways,
00:15:01 all of this has been training for the great tribulation ahead.
00:15:07 What we’re learning now about how to adapt our spiritual routines,
00:15:12 to support one another, and to be obedient to direction
00:15:17 is building us up and equipping us
00:15:20 for even bigger challenges in the future.
00:15:26 It’s been very encouraging to hear how our brothers around the world
00:15:31 are helping one another during this unique time
00:15:34 in human history.
00:15:36 Your actions are bringing honor
00:15:39 and praise to Jehovah.
00:15:44 Our brothers and sisters from Brazil and Ecuador
00:15:48 send you their warm greetings.
00:15:52 And on behalf of the Governing Body,
00:15:54 we thank you for all you’re doing,
00:15:57 even under these difficult circumstances.
00:16:01 Please know that we love you very much.

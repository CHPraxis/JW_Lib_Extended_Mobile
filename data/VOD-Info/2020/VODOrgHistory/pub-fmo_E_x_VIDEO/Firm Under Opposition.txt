00:00:08 At John 15:20, Jesus said:
00:00:12 “A slave is not greater than his master.
00:00:15 If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.”
00:00:21 How will we react when we are mistreated?
00:00:24 How will we find the strength to endure?
00:00:28 We have a record of faithful servants of old.
00:00:33 We know that Jehovah’s people can endure.
00:00:38 But we also have the record
00:00:40 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in modern times.
00:00:43 The following video draws on footage
00:00:46 from two previously released videos by the organization.
00:00:51 It highlights two outstanding examples:
00:00:55 our brothers in Germany during World War II
00:00:59 and our brothers in the former Soviet Union
00:01:02 in the years that followed the war.
00:01:05 It also reveals the tactics
00:01:07 that enemies of the truth consistently use
00:01:11 —to no avail—against Jehovah’s people.
00:01:15 Reviewing and meditating on the examples
00:01:19 of these faithful brothers and sisters
00:01:21 will prepare us for what lies ahead,
00:01:25 will fill us with courage, and will strengthen our faith.
00:01:33 On January 30, 1933,
00:01:36 Adolf Hitler comes to power.
00:01:38 Hitler gave the people jobs.
00:01:41 He restored their faith
00:01:44 in the fatherland.
00:01:47 He is hailed as their savior.
00:01:51 But the Witnesses could not give to a man what they believed belonged to God.
00:01:55 Thus, a battle line
00:01:58 was drawn over a simple greeting —“Heil Hitler.”
00:02:05 Jehovah’s Witnesses refused to say “Heil Hitler”
00:02:08 because it meant “Salvation comes from Hitler.”
00:02:13 At his job in a steel mill,
00:02:15 one Witness faced this test.
00:02:18 I was the only one among 2,000
00:02:21 who did not raise my hand
00:02:22 and did not return the German salute
00:02:24 —every day running the gauntlet, since I was required
00:02:27 to give the German salute, and I simply said,
00:02:29 “Good day.”
00:02:31 Children were drawn into the battle.
00:02:34 Six-year-old Paul Gerhard Kusserow,
00:02:39 like other Witness children, was pressured
00:02:41 by students and teachers.
00:02:43 As soon as I entered school,
00:02:46 the head teacher and the pupils confronted me
00:02:49 and tried to make me say, “Heil Hitler.”
00:02:54 More than 800 children were taken away from their Witness parents by the Gestapo.
00:02:59 In one German state after another, the police shut down meetings
00:03:04 of the Witnesses and prohibit their door-to-door preaching.
00:03:10 At first, there were nasty words,
00:03:13 sometimes a beating,
00:03:15 but soon enough, it led to the first arrests.
00:03:24 Starting in 1937, Jehovah’s Witnesses were given a purple triangle
00:03:28 as a sign.
00:03:32 Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:03:35 were the only religious group
00:03:36 that made up a separate category of inmates.
00:03:42 The Jehovah’s Witnesses received especially severe treatment.
00:03:49 The goal was to destroy this religious group;
00:03:52 there were to be no more Witnesses in Germany.
00:03:58 The Nazis, obsessed with breaking the Witnesses’ stubborn commitment,
00:04:03 made them an extraordinary offer.
00:04:06 Each Witness could buy
00:04:08 his freedom for a price: his signature
00:04:11 and his faith.
00:04:13 Witnesses in prisons and camps
00:04:15 were repeatedly handed a piece of paper and a pen.
00:04:17 Very few signed.
00:04:21 When I was to be released from prison,
00:04:24 I was given a paper to sign.
00:04:26 It required that I give up my faith
00:04:29 and recognize the German government as the highest authority,
00:04:32 place myself under the Hitler government,
00:04:35 and consider the Bible as a false doctrine.
00:04:39 I said, “That’s out of the question!”
00:04:44 The unity among the sisters and the brothers
00:04:48 —that gave us so much strength.
00:04:51 It was our aim to endure under all circumstances.
00:04:55 We never prayed to be set free.
00:04:57 We prayed for strength to endure.
00:04:59 Everything else was unimportant.
00:05:01 What mattered was standing up for Jehovah’s name.
00:05:24 On February 19, 1951,
00:05:26 the head of the security police presented a secret plan to Stalin.
00:05:31 All of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:05:34 —including infants and pregnant women— would be exiled.
00:05:37 The plan was code-named “Operation North.”
00:05:41 Stalin approved it.
00:05:46 Interestingly, the Witnesses were offered a way to avoid deportation.
00:05:51 The man in charge of the deportation of our family
00:05:54 tried to persuade Father to sign a paper
00:05:57 renouncing the organization
00:05:58 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:06:00 Few Witnesses, if any, accepted this offer.
00:06:05 Once in Siberia, the Witnesses were dropped off
00:06:07 at settlements along the rail lines.
00:06:09 The majority of the Witnesses
00:06:12 were forced to cut trees.
00:06:15 We recalled the time when the Israelites
00:06:17 lived in Egypt
00:06:18 and how they were forced to work.
00:06:20 We prayed, “God, make our faith stronger so that this work,
00:06:24 which is beyond our strength, will not shake us.”
00:06:28 Stalin’s death in 1953
00:06:30 brought hope of relief.
00:06:32 But relief would be a long time
00:06:35 in coming.
00:06:37 The new regime went on in the same course.
00:06:39 They arrested and sentenced us.
00:06:43 Most arrested Witnesses were sentenced to labor camps.
00:06:47 In court, they could not expect a fair trial.
00:06:51 Guilty verdicts had already been decided upon.
00:06:55 Under the Khrushchev administration,
00:06:58 special “reeducation” camps were set up,
00:07:01 designed to turn inmates from their beliefs.
00:07:05 During this period, propaganda films designed to discredit Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:07:09 were distributed throughout the USSR.
00:07:21 Whoever has studied persecution in the past
00:07:24 has seen that in one way or another,
00:07:26 persecution is always built on a lie.
00:07:29 The victim is slandered.
00:07:33 Besides using propaganda, for many years,
00:07:35 the KGB recruited informers to infiltrate Witness congregations.
00:07:40 For instance, in 1968, the KGB district director
00:07:44 offered Nikolai Bychkov an assignment.
00:07:47 He requested me
00:07:49 to spy on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:07:51 One Witness booklet that compared the teaching of evolution with the Bible
00:07:56 changed the KGB informer’s viewpoint.
00:07:59 No one could answer that question:
00:08:03 how life appeared.
00:08:05 In the Bible,
00:08:07 I could find answers to those questions.
00:08:11 In Khabarovsk in 1984, Nikolai Bychkov,
00:08:14 now a baptized Witness, and several fellow believers
00:08:18 were accused of anti-Soviet activities.
00:08:22 But the all-out attack on the Witnesses’ faith backfired
00:08:25 on the persecutors.
00:08:28 In Germany and in Soviet times,
00:08:31 they thought that you could get rid
00:08:32 of an idea by using extreme violence.
00:08:35 But it turned out that when an idea is strong,
00:08:38 it makes people strong.
00:08:40 So the outcome was just the opposite of what was expected.
00:08:45 In March 1991,
00:08:48 Jehovah’s Witnesses were legally registered in Russia.
00:08:53 I think it is frightening
00:08:55 only if you’ve never faced difficulties.
00:08:58 But once you face them, you know that special strength.
00:09:03 When we rely on Jehovah
00:09:06 —we ask for his guidance; we ask for his help—
00:09:09 we will always get it.
00:09:33 In addition to horrible physical treatment,
00:09:37 God’s people faced slander,
00:09:40 outright lies, and fabrications,
00:09:43 even in the form of propaganda films.
00:09:47 Opposers attempted to infiltrate our brotherhood with informants.
00:09:52 But as we saw in the example of Nikolai Bychkov,
00:09:57 such devious plans are in vain
00:10:00 when pitted against the truth from God’s Word.
00:10:04 As Professor Nikolai Gordienko noted,
00:10:08 “When an idea is strong, it makes people strong.”
00:10:13 What idea can be stronger
00:10:15 than the reality of our Father, Jehovah;
00:10:19 his reigning King, Jesus Christ;
00:10:21 and his Kingdom, now poised to thwart all opposition?
00:10:26 And so, what people can possibly be stronger
00:10:31 than Jehovah’s people?
00:10:33 As our brothers in Russia and other areas of the earth
00:10:37 face renewed opposition
00:10:40 and as we all face the prospect of being mistreated
00:10:44 just as our Master, Jesus, was,
00:10:47 we are determined to stand firm
00:10:50 and remain faithful no matter what the enemies of truth attempt.

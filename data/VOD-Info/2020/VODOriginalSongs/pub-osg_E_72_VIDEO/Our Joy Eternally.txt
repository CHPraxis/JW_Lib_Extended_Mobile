00:00:14 The stars that fill the summer night Look down from above.
00:00:21 The beauty of the day and night You fashioned with love.
00:00:28 Your hands prepared the land and sea, And ev’rything that came to be
00:00:35 Brought joy to your heart.
00:00:42 There is joy in your creation, In the message of salvation,
00:00:49 And the Paradise to come.
00:00:55 But to have your love forever Is a real and lasting treasure.
00:01:02 You alone will prove to be Our joy eternally.
00:01:31 Jehovah, we have all we need To bring us delight—
00:01:39 The things we hear and touch and see And feel deep inside.
00:01:45 You gave us such a perfect start, Eternity in ev’ry heart,
00:01:52 And joy in our lives.
00:01:59 There is joy in your creation, In the message of salvation,
00:02:06 And the Paradise to come.
00:02:13 But to have your love forever Is a real and lasting treasure.
00:02:20 You alone will prove to be Our joy eternally.
00:02:42 This joy could not be ours Without the gift of your Son.
00:02:48 His sacrifice has paid the price So joy could be ours for all time.
00:02:59 There is joy in your creation, In the message of salvation,
00:03:05 And the Paradise to come.
00:03:12 But to have your love forever Is a real and lasting treasure.
00:03:20 You alone will prove to be Our joy eternally.
00:03:33 There is joy in your creation, In the message of salvation,
00:03:40 And the Paradise to come.
00:03:46 But to have your love forever Is a real and lasting treasure.
00:03:54 You alone will prove to be Our joy eternally.

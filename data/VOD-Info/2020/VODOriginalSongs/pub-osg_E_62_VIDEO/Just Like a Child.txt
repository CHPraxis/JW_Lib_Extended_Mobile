00:00:10 Jesus kindly showed us That we must be as young ones,
00:00:20 Remembering that in a world of pride, We need a heart just like a child.
00:00:31 We value others, seeing what God sees through his impartial eyes.
00:00:40 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:00:53 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:01:03 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:01:14 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:01:25 And as we’re getting older In a world that’s getting colder,
00:01:35 We easily could question others’ ways, Their motives, and the things they say.
00:01:46 And seeing others as above us is rare this day and age.
00:01:57 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:02:08 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:02:18 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:02:29 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:02:39 Be just like a child.
00:02:46 While we keep growing, Serving Jehovah,
00:02:53 And finding joy in  The part we’re playing,
00:02:58 We must remember That in a world of pride,
00:03:04 We need a heart like that of a child.
00:03:30 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:03:41 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:03:51 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:04:02 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:04:13 Be just like a child.

Jesus kindly showed us
That we must be as young ones,

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:31.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering that in a world of pride,
We need a heart just like a child.

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:40.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We value others, seeing what God sees
through his impartial eyes.

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:53.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to love one another,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes just seeing
the good in each other.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:14.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to be full of kindness,

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:25.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
not focused on what could divide us.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we’re getting older
In a world that’s getting colder,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We easily could question others’ ways,
Their motives, and the things they say.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:57.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing others as above us
is rare this day and age.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to love one another,

With our eyes
just seeing the good in each other.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:29.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
not focused on what could divide us.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:46.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be just like a child.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we keep growing,
Serving Jehovah,

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:58.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding joy in 
The part we’re playing,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must remember
That in a world of pride,

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:09.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need a heart like that of a child.

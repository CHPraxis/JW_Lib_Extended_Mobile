00:00:01 Take a moment now and picture the scene. Up ahead on the path are what seem to be
00:00:09 Children laughing at play In a world free of the fears we once faced.
00:00:19 And taking care of this beautiful earth Are a people that live by our Father’s words:
00:00:28 “Until the moon is no more”— There is the peace we have been waiting for.
00:00:38 We will feel His love Under the rule of His Son
00:00:47 In the new world to come.
00:00:58 Hope is a fire in our hearts.
00:01:03 Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.
00:01:07 Hope is a light that shines like the sun
00:01:11 As we see ourselves there
00:01:15 In the new world to come.
00:01:26 Take a moment now and think of a place
00:01:30 By the mountains and rivers or wide open plains.
00:01:35 It’s a place to call home.
00:01:39 And now walking in through your front door,
00:01:45 There is someone that you know
00:01:49 Holding out his open arms in hopes
00:01:54 Of a tearful embrace—
00:01:57 Feels like forever since you’ve been face-to-face.
00:02:04 Even death won’t stop
00:02:09 Our God’s outstretched love
00:02:12 In the new world to come.
00:02:23 Hope is a fire in our hearts.
00:02:28 Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.
00:02:32 Hope is a light that shines like the sun
00:02:36 As we see ourselves there
00:02:41 In the new world to come.
00:02:52 And ev’ry word from His mouth
00:02:56 Will do all for which He sent it out.
00:03:01 Jehovah’s will for this earth is
00:03:05 Fulfilling ev’ry living things’ last wish.
00:03:38 Hope is a fire in our hearts. Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.
00:03:47 Hope is a light that shines like the sun As we see ourselves there
00:03:55 In the new world to come, In the new world to come,
00:04:05 In the new world to come, In the new world to come.

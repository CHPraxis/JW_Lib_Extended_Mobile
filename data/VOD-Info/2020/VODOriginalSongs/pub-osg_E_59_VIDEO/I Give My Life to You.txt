00:00:21 In the quiet of the night, With a million stars above,
00:00:37 When I think of you and of all you do, It fills my heart with love.
00:00:57 If I give my life to you, You will always be my guide.
00:01:15 As the days go by, you will see that I Am forever on your side.
00:01:35 Because you gave me hope That changed my life
00:01:43 And strength to help me through,
00:01:50 Because you gave your Son To die for me,
00:01:58 I give my life to you; I give my life to you.
00:02:17 As the sun lights up the sky, Melting warm upon my skin,
00:02:32 How your endless days and your tender ways Stir these feelings deep within!
00:02:51 Because you gave me hope That changed my life
00:03:00 And strength to help me through,
00:03:06 Because you gave your Son To die for me,
00:03:14 I give my life to you; I give my life to you.
00:03:31 Because you gave me hope That changed my life
00:03:40 And strength to help me through,
00:03:46 Because you gave your Son To die for me,
00:03:55 I give my life to you; I give my life to you.

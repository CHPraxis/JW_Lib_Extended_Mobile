00:00:19 We have been working with Jehovah’s Witnesses for 30 years now
00:00:23 and have progressively grown together through this experience.
00:00:28 Jehovah’s Witnesses have led us to be
00:00:31 extremely cautious with the use of blood
00:00:34 through good patient preparation,
00:00:37 careful selection of the patient,
00:00:39 careful management in the operating room
00:00:42 with all the available blood conservation methods,
00:00:45 and correcting anemia prior to surgery.
00:00:49 This has resulted— And I have to say, of course,
00:00:52 thanks to a relationship that has become stronger over the years,
00:00:56 it has resulted in a committee within this hospital
00:00:59 entrusted with limiting the use of blood
00:01:02 even for those who are not bound by these restrictions.
00:01:06 So it has been a beneficial process.
00:01:10 It has also led to a global reduction in the use of blood,
00:01:15 which we know is harmful and can lead to complications, such as those
00:01:20 associated with recovery, as well as avoidable costs.
00:01:32 If anemia is a factor, we treat it beforehand
00:01:35 with all the pharmaceutical means we have available to correct it.
00:01:39 We have a committee in Verona for the best use of blood
00:01:42 that recommends all these procedures,
00:01:45 which we also apply to patients who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:48 This is a beneficial process that your presence has allowed us to make.
00:01:53 With this type of preparation, we can address
00:01:56 even complex cases of pancreatic resection and liver resections.
00:02:01 We do resections of liver tumors and resections of pancreatic tumors.
00:02:04 And we can do these with reasonable —reasonable—
00:02:07 risks and perform them safely.
00:02:17 In gastrointestinal oncology, we have come
00:02:20 from a rate of 50 percent of patients transfused to 15 percent.
00:02:25 So there has been a notable reduction in the use of blood
00:02:28 because we have, on the one hand,
00:02:30 applied more careful surgical techniques and,
00:02:33 on the other, used all the tools available to us for an efficient hemostasis.

00:00:19 I always say that we should be grateful to those who have introduced us
00:00:24 —in this case, Jehovah’s Witnesses—
00:00:27 to bloodless surgery
00:00:30 because by means of the ongoing work on patients
00:00:33 who have refused transfusions over the past 30 years,
00:00:37 we have gained truly valuable information.
00:00:43 The first is that blood transfusions
00:00:46 are not associated with an altogether positive outcome.
00:00:51 The second is that
00:00:53 with a well-thought-out approach and with targeted strategies,
00:00:58 it is possible to perform even major surgeries
00:01:01 without transfusing allogeneic blood.
00:01:15 Well, I’ve been a doctor for 25 years,
00:01:18 so I have witnessed various forms of progress.
00:01:23 The first thing I can say is
00:01:25 that the concept of non-pharmacological therapies
00:01:28 has evolved
00:01:30 —for example, the use of machines to recycle
00:01:34 intraoperative blood.
00:01:36 Techniques of preoperative normovolemic hemodilution
00:01:40 have been developed.
00:01:42 There is medicine that reduces bleeding.
00:01:45 But, above all, surgery has evolved.
00:01:50 I witnessed the birth, so to say, of laparoscopic surgery,
00:01:54 which is an operative technique that enables major surgeries
00:01:58 with minimal, even zero, blood loss.
00:02:03 So we should thank
00:02:06 surgical technologies and developments in anaesthesiology
00:02:10 for the steady decrease in intraoperative bleeding
00:02:14 that we have seen over the years.
00:02:26 I would say the doctor has the absolute duty to respect a patient’s will.
00:02:31 This is also because the patient’s rightful consent is
00:02:34 the only act that authorizes the doctor,
00:02:37 or surgeon, to operate on him.
00:02:40 Otherwise, he would be guilty of an assault.
00:02:50 According to my experience
00:02:53 and what is clear according to international literature,
00:02:57 at least 80-90% of all elective surgeries
00:03:00 can safely be performed without allogeneic blood.

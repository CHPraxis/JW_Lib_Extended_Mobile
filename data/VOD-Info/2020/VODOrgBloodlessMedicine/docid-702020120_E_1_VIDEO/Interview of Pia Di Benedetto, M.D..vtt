I always say that we should be grateful
to those who have introduced us

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in this case, Jehovah’s Witnesses—

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bloodless surgery

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because by means
of the ongoing work on patients

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have refused transfusions
over the past 30 years,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have gained truly valuable information.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is that blood transfusions

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not associated
with an altogether positive outcome.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second is that

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a well-thought-out approach
and with targeted strategies,

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is possible to perform
even major surgeries

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without transfusing allogeneic blood.

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ve been a doctor for 25 years,

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I have witnessed
various forms of progress.

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing I can say is

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the concept
of non-pharmacological therapies

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has evolved

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:34.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, the use of machines to recycle

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intraoperative blood.

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Techniques of preoperative
normovolemic hemodilution

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been developed.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is medicine that reduces bleeding.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, above all, surgery has evolved.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I witnessed the birth, so to say,
of laparoscopic surgery,

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is an operative technique
that enables major surgeries

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with minimal, even zero, blood loss.

00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:06.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we should thank

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:10.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surgical technologies
and developments in anaesthesiology

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the steady decrease
in intraoperative bleeding

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have seen over the years.

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say the doctor has the absolute duty
to respect a patient’s will.

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is also because
the patient’s rightful consent is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only act that authorizes the doctor,

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or surgeon, to operate on him.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, he would be guilty of an assault.

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to my experience

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what is clear according
to international literature,

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least 80-90% of all elective surgeries

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can safely be performed
without allogeneic blood.

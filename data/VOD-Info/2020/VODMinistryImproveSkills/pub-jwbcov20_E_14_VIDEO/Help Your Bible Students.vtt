00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:17.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just sum up the whole article.

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the answers in all that.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more than just the answers.

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:29.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m with it; I’m all about study.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you remember
more from our studies,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers
or the things that touch your heart?

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, like, when we talked about immorality,

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew the answer,

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you didn’t seem
totally convinced in here.

00:00:56.952 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try and find that answer.

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 6?

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure why,

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:25.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it made me think of Mum and Dad

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(his constant cheating, actually),

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:33.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mum’s humiliation,
the divorce, all the misery.

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want that.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:44.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how right Jehovah is

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what Neeta called meditation.

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:55.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about clearing your mind
to find inner peace;

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s totally different.

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:03.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah feels about something

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking what that means for me.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:16.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah,

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister died in that attack;
it was really sad.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s “time and unexpected events”?

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s one of those cases where . . .

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about when someone survives

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’re at the meeting?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s, um—

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t get it.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:37.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Straight answer
—Does Jehovah protect Witnesses or not?

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s funny.

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re really pushing those meetings,
aren’t you?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What time?

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe I missed her part,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t a total loss.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta had said,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the Hall, everyone loves one another.”

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until I’d felt it,

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no idea.

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told her I’d be back.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:36.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, but what are good associations?

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have wholesome gatherings

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers and sisters
from the congregation,

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we eat and talk.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some like to play musical instruments,
and they’ll do

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
renditions of original songs.

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a really nice time.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t do that.

00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not boring.

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure it’s not.

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:09.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you do?

00:05:31.643 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you wouldn’t do that.

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not exactly wholesome.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have to have fun, right?

00:05:39.484 --> 00:05:42.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, and we do.

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:44.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See for yourself.

00:05:44.865 --> 00:05:47.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m having some people over this weekend.

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:23.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t the club,

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:25.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was still fun.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta and I talked about it.

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:50.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of me felt a bit scared,

00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:52.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
part a bit crazy.

00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:55.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me knocking on doors?

00:06:57.562 --> 00:07:00.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew this was the right thing to do.

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A minister should also be free

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:06.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from all nonmedical use
of addictive or mind-altering substances.’

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:09.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonmedical?

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:14.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking something
when I’m feeling a little stressed,

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:20.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like maybe, I don’t know, a little weed

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:24.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s OK, right?

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s for the stress.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I didn’t quite understand
what “medical” meant.

00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:37.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So will we see you during the week?

00:07:37.227 --> 00:07:38.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jade.

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:43.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be back.

00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can guess
what our next few studies were about.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:51.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:53.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing it was wrong was easy.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Figuring out how to cope without it wasn’t.

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it felt impossible.

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:39.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being free of it to serve Jehovah

00:08:39.414 --> 00:08:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt amazing!

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:51.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Mum, listen.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jade, you listen!

00:08:54.262 --> 00:08:56.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this just another one of your phases?

00:08:56.473 --> 00:08:59.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to move on, Love.

00:08:59.393 --> 00:09:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holidays are our time.

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:04.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all I get from you.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:06.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise me you’ll be here.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Promise!

00:09:25.836 --> 00:09:28.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really don’t want to disappoint her,

00:09:28.797 --> 00:09:31.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t disappoint Jehovah.

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:35.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You love them both.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you think he can help you?

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:41.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to him.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent a long time
pouring out my heart to him.

00:09:58.285 --> 00:09:59.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remembered

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something from one of the Psalms:

00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:10.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

00:10:10.464 --> 00:10:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart to fear your name.”

00:11:03.225 --> 00:11:05.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yo, so tell me.

00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:11.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember someone once claiming
to be “all about the promises.”

00:11:11.775 --> 00:11:13.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Made any good ones lately?

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:16.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

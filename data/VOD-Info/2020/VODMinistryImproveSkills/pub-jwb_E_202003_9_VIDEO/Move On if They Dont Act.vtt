Are you going out
in field service after lunch?

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m going to be there, but I’ve got
one return visit that I’ve got to make.

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, see you.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My neighbor lost his job after 20 years,

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
he’s got to move out of his house,

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to move into an apartment.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to go help him out a little bit

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pack up to make it a little easier
for him to make that move.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
won’t it be nice at a time period

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we don’t have to worry
about economic troubles like that?

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:42.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it will.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:44.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know,
that’s why I’m so happy

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my grandchildren
chose to go for higher education.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They both landed good jobs.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that bridge
you cross when you come here.

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve noticed that they’re starting
to do some work on it.

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s pretty extensive work.

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re going to replace that whole bridge.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to the newspaper article,

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to be
like a six to eight month project.

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That is a long time.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know, Chris,

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reason why I came by
is I wanted to show you this magazine.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love these.
These are so well written.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17 is a key scripture here.

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says:

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One teaching you to benefit yourself.”

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s familiar.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think your dad
read that to me once or twice.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s your dad doing anyway?

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing good.

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, you know,
they said they’ve got more Bible studies

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than they can even cover in one week.

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, well, you know, I can remember
when you and your dad came here.

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were a little kid about this high,

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just stayed right by his side.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your dad was so proud.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Chris,
I know my dad had offered

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with you in the past.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, to be honest,

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m too old to change;

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m set in my ways now.

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that God is just going
to have to take me the way I am.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More chocolate?

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, yeah.
I don’t mind.

00:00:10 Why is it so important to help our listeners
00:00:13 grasp the meaning of our message?
00:00:16 The apostle Paul reasoned on the matter
00:00:18 at 1 Corinthians 14:9:
00:00:21 “Unless you with the tongue
00:00:23 “use speech that is easily understood,
00:00:26 “how will anyone know what is being said?
00:00:29 You will, in fact, be speaking into the air.”
00:00:33 In other words, we’d be wasting our time.
00:00:38 How, then, can we make our speech understandable to others?
00:00:43 We must understand our topic well,
00:00:46 use simple expressions,
00:00:48 and explain unfamiliar terms.
00:00:52 In the following scenario, identify the expressions
00:00:55 that are common to us as Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:58 but that are not common to people in general.
00:01:03 I’d like to give you this invitation to our regional convention.
00:01:06 It’s a wonderful event organized each year
00:01:08 by “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:01:10 It’s like our circuit assemblies but larger.
00:01:13 We enjoy it so much!
00:01:15 You can really sense God’s spirit there.
00:01:17 It really helps us to serve Jehovah
00:01:19 and to get the best theocratic teaching there is.
00:01:21 Um . . . maybe not. It doesn’t sound like it’s for me.
00:01:25 Oh, OK. Maybe next time.
00:01:29 Will the householder readily understand the expressions
00:01:32 “regional convention,”
00:01:34 “faithful and discreet slave,”
00:01:36 “circuit assembly,” “God’s spirit,”
00:01:39 or even “Jehovah”
00:01:41 and “theocratic teaching”?
00:01:43 Not likely.
00:01:45 Let’s give the brother another chance.
00:01:48 I’d like to give you this invitation to a special event being held next month.
00:01:52 This year, it’s going to be at the Event Center.
00:01:55 Everyone in the community is invited, and it’s free of charge.
00:01:59 The program moves quickly with talks, interviews, and short films.
00:02:03 This year, there’s a movie that recounts the story of . . .
00:02:06 This time, the publisher kept it simple
00:02:09 and piqued the householder’s curiosity.
00:02:12 What about when we fulfill a speaking assignment in the congregation?
00:02:17 We need to think in advance about our audience.
00:02:20 If we have a conversation assignment on the midweek meeting,
00:02:24 we should use expressions that a householder will be familiar with.
00:02:29 If we’re giving a public talk, it shouldn’t sound like a local needs part.
00:02:34 In the following example,
00:02:36 identify which kind of talk is being given
00:02:40 —a public talk or a local needs part.
00:02:44 “And this good news of the Kingdom
00:02:46 “will be preached in all the inhabited earth
00:02:49 for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”
00:02:54 Friends, what does that verse mean to you personally?
00:02:59 Each of us should ask himself:
00:03:01 ‘Am I having a full share in this never-to-be-repeated work?
00:03:06 ‘Can I arrange my circumstances
00:03:08 ‘to serve as an auxiliary pioneer
00:03:10 ‘or a regular pioneer?
00:03:12 ‘Do I preach with a sense of urgency?
00:03:15 ‘Am I doing my best
00:03:17 to make return visits and conduct Bible studies?’
00:03:21 Did you identify it as a local needs part?
00:03:25 What were some clues?
00:03:27 The speaker used expressions
00:03:29 that aren’t always familiar to non-Witnesses:
00:03:33 “friends,” “auxiliary pioneer,”
00:03:37 “regular pioneer,” and “return visits.”
00:03:41 Now how might you apply Matthew 24:14
00:03:45 to an audience that includes non-Witnesses?
00:03:49 Let’s watch.
00:03:51 “And this good news of the Kingdom
00:03:53 “will be preached in all the inhabited earth
00:03:56 for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”
00:04:01 Speaking about God’s Kingdom
00:04:03 is one way that we can do good to others.
00:04:07 Even if we’ve just begun to learn the truth from the Bible,
00:04:10 we can share what we’ve learned with relatives or workmates.
00:04:15 In this way,  we may even help them
00:04:17 to gain everlasting life!
00:04:20 Be assured that Jehovah God will bless and reward
00:04:25 the goodness you show to others.
00:04:29 By helping our listeners to grasp the meaning of our message,
00:04:33 we’ll be a joy to listen to
00:04:35 and our audience will clearly understand what they need to do.

Jesus’ teaching reached the heart.

00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 24:32 records the reaction

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some of his disciples
following a teaching session:

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Were not our hearts burning within us

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as he was speaking to us on the road,

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he was fully opening up
the Scriptures to us?”

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we teach, how can we reach the heart?

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can (1) use rhetorical questions
to help our listeners think,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) urge listeners
to examine why they perform good works,

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) highlight
how Bible principles and commands

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect God’s qualities and his love for us.

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following example, does the speaker

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help the audience to make a self-examination?

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s one thing
you must do to gain everlasting life?

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 19:21,
Jesus said to a rich young ruler:

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go sell your belongings
and give to the poor,

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will have treasure in heaven;

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come be my follower.”

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, you must
cut out of your life anything

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interferes with your worship of Jehovah.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were the words accurate?

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you moved from the heart?

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably not.

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the speaker
told us what we needed to do,

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t help us
to examine our own feelings on the matter.

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch him try again.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s one thing
we must do to gain everlasting life?

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 19:21, we find Jesus’ response

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this question
as posed by a rich young ruler:

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:52.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go sell your belongings
and give to the poor,

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will have treasure in heaven;

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come be my follower.”

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:02.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although this man had kept the commandments
of the Mosaic Law since his youth,

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus detected that something was missing.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us does well to ask himself:

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What might Jesus detect about me?

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Although Jehovah doesn’t expect me
to part with all of my belongings,

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:20.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is there anything in my life
that interferes with my worship?

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Does my job prevent me
from attending congregation meetings?

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:29.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I catch myself
thinking about material things

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when I’m engaged in sacred service?

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Material things may be valuable,

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but are they worth more
than my everlasting life?’

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well done!

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rhetorical questions
helped us to examine ourselves.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, instead of using
the personal pronoun “you,”

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:53.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker showed respect
for his audience by including himself

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one who needs to apply
the counsel of God’s Word.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to reach the heart,

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:03.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must also appeal to good motives.

00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we should motivate
our audience to act

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:11.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they love Jehovah,
fellow humans, and Bible teachings.

00:03:11.503 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the Bible teacher do that
in the following demonstration?

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:20.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question asks:
“What do we need to avoid?”

00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad habits, like smoking

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and abusing alcohol and drugs.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right,
but I noticed you’re still smoking.

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you need to do?

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I need to quit, but it’s not easy.

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve been studying for over a year.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much more time do you need?

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much time do you think
is left before the end comes?

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the teacher appeal to proper motives?

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:51.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:54.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he tried to pressure
and shame the student.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a better way to motivate.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question asks:
“What do we need to avoid?”

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bad habits, like smoking

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and abusing alcohol and drugs.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:14.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s not always easy
to give up bad habits.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can be a powerful motivator?

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ve got to stop smoking
so I won’t be destroyed at Armageddon.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, there’s a stronger motivation.

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you get up early
every day to go to work?

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide for my family.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do it because I love them.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way, strong love for Jehovah

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help you to break habits
in order to please him.

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:45.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does he provide

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help you
win the battle against smoking?

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Holy spirit?

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:52.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anytime you have the urge to smoke,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can freely call on Jehovah
for his help to resist.

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:04.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now consider five Bible principles
that will help you further.

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did the teacher
appeal to good motives

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also helped the student
to think about how he could please Jehovah.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do our best
to reach the heart of our listeners,

00:05:17.462 --> 00:05:22.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be appealing
to the best of motives: love for God.

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:27.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love for Jehovah will move them
to draw close to him and become his friends.

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:29.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will motivate them to praise him,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just for a short time
but for all eternity!

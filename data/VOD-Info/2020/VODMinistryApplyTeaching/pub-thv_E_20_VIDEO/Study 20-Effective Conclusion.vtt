Toward the end of his life,

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave a moving farewell speech.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In it, he recounted
how Jehovah protected them.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to his conclusion

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Joshua 24:14, 15:

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, fear Jehovah

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and serve him
with integrity and faithfulness,

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and remove the gods
that your forefathers served

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the other side of the River
and in Egypt,

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and serve Jehovah.

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:51.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah,

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“choose for yourselves today
whom you will serve,

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether the gods
that your forefathers served

00:00:57.953 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the other side of the River

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or the gods of the Amorites
in whose land you are dwelling.

00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:06.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as for me and my household,

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will serve Jehovah.”

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Joshua motivate his listeners?

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 16 says:

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this the people answered:

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is unthinkable for us
to abandon Jehovah

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to serve other gods.’”

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 31 adds

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Israel continued to serve Jehovah

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the days of Joshua

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:38.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the days
of the elders who outlived Joshua.”

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This teaches us something

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how we can conclude
a discussion effectively.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our final words
should connect to the overall topic,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivate our listeners,
and be simple and brief.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch
the following conclusion of a public talk.

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:04.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers, during these
“critical times hard to deal with,”

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:06.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s follow the counsel in today’s talk,

00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because with Jehovah’s help,
we can endure life’s challenges.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he brings an end
to this world and all its problems,

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll survive to live forever
in a beautiful Paradise.

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:22.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the speaker connect
his conclusion to the overall topic?

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you identify the theme

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his talk from this conclusion?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it’s good that the speaker

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tried to motivate his audience,

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was he specific?

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he speak with a note of finality?

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give him another chance.

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, brothers,
although we live “in times of distress,”

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we always remember
how Jehovah helps us.

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He offers us his powerful holy spirit,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provides support
through our loving Christian brotherhood,

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he gives us a hope.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, when facing trials,

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:05.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s ‘throw our burdens on Jehovah,’

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that ‘he will sustain us.’

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the speaker rephrased the theme

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where Can You Get Help
in Times of Distress?”

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he restated the talk’s three main points.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:25.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He motivated his listeners by reminding them

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to benefit from Jehovah’s provisions.

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His conclusion was simple and brief.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:40.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might we apply
these principles in the ministry?

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following example,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother named Aaron
is talking to a workmate named Mark,

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who recently attended
his grandfather’s funeral.

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:55.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron sees an opportunity
to witness informally,

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he tells Mark about the resurrection

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows him John 5:28, 29.

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how might Aaron

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
effectively conclude their conversation?

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:13.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus promises
to resurrect those who’ve died.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:21.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I guess we’d better get back to work.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:26.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not much of a conclusion, was it?

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:28.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch him try again.

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:35.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus promises
to resurrect those who’ve died.

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:37.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think
that promise means for your grandfather?

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:45.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his conclusion,

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:49.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron connected the topic
of their conversation

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the death of Mark’s grandfather.

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a good conclusion
should also motivate your listeners

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show them what to do
with the information they learned.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the rest of Aaron’s conclusion.

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Mark, during those times

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:11.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when your grandfather’s death
makes you especially sad,

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:16.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think about Jesus’ promise
that death is not the end.

00:05:16.003 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what it’ll be like
to see your grandfather again.

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helps me when I’m sad
about relatives I’ve lost in death.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing that.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:27.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe when we talk next time,
I’ll show you what Jesus said about . . .

00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well done!

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After repeating the main point
for Mark to remember,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron motivated him to reflect

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:46.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the resurrection hope
during times of sadness.

00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron could have also tried

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to motivate Mark to accept a Bible study,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come with him to a congregation meeting,

00:05:54.625 --> 00:05:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other specific action.

00:05:57.878 --> 00:06:01.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When your conclusion is effective,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your audience
will remember your theme and main points

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:10.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be motivated to apply what they learned.

When Job was at his lowest point in life,

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three of his companions
came to offer him comfort,

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they failed miserably.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if their situations
had been reversed?

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Job have done?

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, as recorded at Job 16:5:

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would strengthen you
with the words of my mouth,

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the consolation of my lips
would bring relief.”

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than ever,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people need encouragement and comfort,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we should always aim
to be upbuilding and positive.

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that take?

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to cultivate
a positive view of our listeners,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:58.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
limit negative material,

00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make good use of God’s Word.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it important to cultivate

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a positive view of our listeners?

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because our viewpoint

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be reflected in our teaching.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch an elder giving

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a local needs talk with the theme

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:20.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate the Habit of Being Punctual.”

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think he views his audience?

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders have chosen this theme

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because many
just don’t seem to understand

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the importance of punctuality

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the habit
of arriving late for meetings.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we will answer these questions:

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does being late show

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:52.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lack of appreciation
for Jehovah’s provisions?

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you are constantly late,

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:58.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how is this inconsiderate of others?

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker seemed to be irritated,
didn’t he?

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he didn’t have
a positive view of the audience,

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:12.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his approach was critical, not constructive.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:15.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a talk wouldn’t be very motivating.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the elder try again.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how a positive view of his audience
affects his teaching.

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders asked me to commend you

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your efforts to be punctual.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme,
“Cultivate the Habit of Being Punctual,”

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was chosen because as busy, imperfect humans,

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we all have a challenge
to be on time for meetings.

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk,
we will answer these questions:

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:54.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it important to be punctual?

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what are some practical suggestions

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us arrive on time?

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that he
first commended the congregation?

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The speaker believed that his audience

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants to be on time and please Jehovah,

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so his approach was positive,

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on how to be punctual,

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than how to avoid being late.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made his talk upbuilding.

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:26.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A positive view of our listeners

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also important when we’re in the ministry.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we believe that behind every door

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a potential fellow believer,

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll preach with enthusiasm.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be upbuilding and positive,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must also limit negative material.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, life in this system of things

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has negative aspects that cannot be ignored.

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when teaching,

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should include negative material

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only when it serves a useful purpose.

00:04:00.177 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
the introduction of a talk

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may call for us to discuss
the failure of human rule,

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reports of crime and violence,

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the shocking prevalence of immorality.

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:15.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we were to consider
such things at length,

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the effect may be depressing.

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The overall tone of the talk
should be positive.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When in the ministry,
we sometimes start a conversation

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by raising a problem that’s on the minds

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those in our territory.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the purpose of our visit

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:36.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to share the good news of the Kingdom.

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:39.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at an early point in the conversation,

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should try to direct attention

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refreshing Bible truths.

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think the publisher
does in the following demonstration?

00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:53.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re making brief visits
to help people manage their stress.

00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it seem to you that people are

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more stressed today
than they were in the past?

00:04:57.734 --> 00:05:00.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.
I think people are more stressed.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Crime is getting worse
and many people are afraid.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people feel pressure to make ends meet.

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then there’s the very real threat
of nuclear war!

00:05:08.996 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not interested.

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conversation ended

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:16.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the publisher spent too much time

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about negative things.

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:21.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch her try again.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re making brief visits
to help people manage their stress.

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:27.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it seem to you that people are

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:30.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more stressed today
than they were in the past?

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:32.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.
I think people are more stressed.

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have found
that the practical advice in the Bible

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps them manage their stress.

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one example.

00:05:39.026 --> 00:05:41.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found at Matthew 6:34.

00:05:41.987 --> 00:05:43.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much better!

00:05:43.697 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of dwelling on the problems,

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publisher directed the householder

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:50.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to something positive.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way to be upbuilding and positive

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:57.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to base our words on the Bible.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So use the Bible
when replying to questions.

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when giving a talk,
teach from the Scriptures.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:08.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our teaching,
we should focus on things

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:13.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will improve a situation
and that inspire confidence.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:17.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,
we’ll be upbuilding and positive.

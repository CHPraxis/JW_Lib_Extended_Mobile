00:00:10 When Job was at his lowest point in life,
00:00:13 three of his companions came to offer him comfort,
00:00:17 and they failed miserably.
00:00:20 But what if their situations had been reversed?
00:00:23 What would Job have done?
00:00:26 He said, as recorded at Job 16:5:
00:00:30 “I would strengthen you with the words of my mouth,
00:00:34 and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.”
00:00:39 Today, more than ever,
00:00:41 people need encouragement and comfort,
00:00:44 so we should always aim to be upbuilding and positive.
00:00:49 What does that take?
00:00:52 We need to cultivate a positive view of our listeners,
00:00:56 limit negative material,
00:00:58 and make good use of God’s Word.
00:01:02 Why is it important to cultivate
00:01:04 a positive view of our listeners?
00:01:06 Because our viewpoint
00:01:08 will be reflected in our teaching.
00:01:12 Let’s watch an elder giving
00:01:14 a local needs talk with the theme
00:01:17 “Cultivate the Habit of Being Punctual.”
00:01:21 How do you think he views his audience?
00:01:25 The elders have chosen this theme
00:01:29 because many just don’t seem to understand
00:01:33 the importance of punctuality
00:01:36 and have the habit of arriving late for meetings.
00:01:41 In this talk, we will answer these questions:
00:01:45 How does being late show
00:01:47 a lack of appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions?
00:01:52 And when you are constantly late,
00:01:55 how is this inconsiderate of others?
00:01:59 The speaker seemed to be irritated, didn’t he?
00:02:04 Because he didn’t have a positive view of the audience,
00:02:07 his approach was critical, not constructive.
00:02:12 Such a talk wouldn’t be very motivating.
00:02:16 Let’s watch the elder try again.
00:02:18 Notice how a positive view of his audience affects his teaching.
00:02:24 The elders asked me to commend you
00:02:27 for your efforts to be punctual.
00:02:31 Our theme, “Cultivate the Habit of Being Punctual,”
00:02:35 was chosen because as busy, imperfect humans,
00:02:40 we all have a challenge to be on time for meetings.
00:02:45 In this talk, we will answer these questions:
00:02:50 Why is it important to be punctual?
00:02:54 And what are some practical suggestions
00:02:59 to help us arrive on time?
00:03:02 Did you notice that he first commended the congregation?
00:03:06 The speaker believed that his audience
00:03:09 wants to be on time and please Jehovah,
00:03:12 so his approach was positive,
00:03:15 focusing on how to be punctual,
00:03:17 rather than how to avoid being late.
00:03:21 This made his talk upbuilding.
00:03:24 A positive view of our listeners
00:03:26 is also important when we’re in the ministry.
00:03:30 If we believe that behind every door
00:03:32 is a potential fellow believer,
00:03:35 we’ll preach with enthusiasm.
00:03:39 To be upbuilding and positive,
00:03:41 we must also limit negative material.
00:03:44 Of course, life in this system of things
00:03:47 has negative aspects that cannot be ignored.
00:03:51 However, when teaching,
00:03:53 we should include negative material
00:03:56 only when it serves a useful purpose.
00:04:00 For example, the introduction of a talk
00:04:02 may call for us to discuss the failure of human rule,
00:04:06 reports of crime and violence,
00:04:08 or the shocking prevalence of immorality.
00:04:11 But if we were to consider such things at length,
00:04:15 the effect may be depressing.
00:04:18 The overall tone of the talk should be positive.
00:04:22 When in the ministry, we sometimes start a conversation
00:04:26 by raising a problem that’s on the minds
00:04:28 of those in our territory.
00:04:30 However, the purpose of our visit
00:04:33 is to share the good news of the Kingdom.
00:04:36 So at an early point in the conversation,
00:04:39 we should try to direct attention
00:04:41 to refreshing Bible truths.
00:04:45 How do you think the publisher does in the following demonstration?
00:04:50 We’re making brief visits to help people manage their stress.
00:04:53 Does it seem to you that people are
00:04:55 more stressed today than they were in the past?
00:04:57 Hmm. I think people are more stressed.
00:05:00 Crime is getting worse and many people are afraid.
00:05:03 Many people feel pressure to make ends meet.
00:05:05 Then there’s the very real threat of nuclear war!
00:05:08 I’m not interested.
00:05:11 The conversation ended
00:05:13 because the publisher spent too much time
00:05:16 talking about negative things.
00:05:19 Let’s watch her try again.
00:05:22 We’re making brief visits to help people manage their stress.
00:05:25 Does it seem to you that people are
00:05:27 more stressed today than they were in the past?
00:05:30 Hmm. I think people are more stressed.
00:05:32 Many have found that the practical advice in the Bible
00:05:35 helps them manage their stress.
00:05:37 Here’s one example.
00:05:39 It’s found at Matthew 6:34.
00:05:41 Much better!
00:05:43 Instead of dwelling on the problems,
00:05:46 the publisher directed the householder
00:05:48 to something positive.
00:05:51 The best way to be upbuilding and positive
00:05:54 is to base our words on the Bible.
00:05:57 So use the Bible when replying to questions.
00:06:00 And when giving a talk, teach from the Scriptures.
00:06:05 In our teaching, we should focus on things
00:06:08 that will improve a situation and that inspire confidence.
00:06:13 In this way, we’ll be upbuilding and positive.

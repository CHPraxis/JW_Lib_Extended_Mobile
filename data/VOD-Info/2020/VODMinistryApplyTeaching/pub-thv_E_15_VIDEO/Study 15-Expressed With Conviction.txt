00:00:10 Why should we speak with conviction?
00:00:13 Because our conviction can convey,
00:00:16 more powerfully than words alone,
00:00:18 how we really feel about our message.
00:00:21 At 1 Thessalonians 1:5, the apostle Paul wrote:
00:00:26 “The good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone
00:00:30 but . . . with strong conviction.”
00:00:33 So how do we show that we’re convinced
00:00:37 that the good news of God’s Kingdom is the most valuable message we could share?
00:00:43 First,
00:00:44 we prepare thoroughly.
00:00:46 In other words, we convince ourselves of the value of our message.
00:00:52 Second,
00:00:53 we choose words that convey our conviction.
00:00:58 And finally,
00:01:00 we express ourselves earnestly and sincerely.
00:01:05 For instance,
00:01:07 how would you express yourself if you were giving a talk about the resurrection?
00:01:11 Let’s watch an example.
00:01:14 Jesus resurrected Lazarus.
00:01:17 How can that Bible account help us?
00:01:20 Well, if we have lost loved ones in death,
00:01:25 we can put our trust in the resurrection.
00:01:29 The speaker is correct,
00:01:32 but did he express firm conviction?
00:01:35 Not really.
00:01:37 We learn how to express ourselves with conviction
00:01:41 from Jesus and Martha in this very Bible account.
00:01:45 John 11:23 records Jesus’ words:
00:01:48 “Your brother will rise.”
00:01:52 With these words, Jesus expressed complete conviction.
00:01:56 Also, verse 24 records Martha’s reply:
00:02:01 “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”
00:02:06 Martha, too, expressed her firm conviction.
00:02:10 Let’s now give our brother another chance.
00:02:14 Jesus resurrected Lazarus.
00:02:17 How does this Bible account help us?
00:02:21 Well, when loved ones fall asleep in death,
00:02:24 we know we’ll see them again.
00:02:27 The fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises
00:02:29 is as sure as the sun rising each day.
00:02:32 Jehovah will awaken our dear loved ones to life in Paradise.
00:02:38 What a difference!
00:02:40 Not only did the speaker express himself earnestly
00:02:44 but he chose words that showed his firm belief in the resurrection hope.
00:02:51 Can we express similar conviction in the ministry?
00:02:55 Yes!
00:02:56 And this is especially important when our faith is challenged.
00:03:01 Imagine, for instance, that a schoolmate,
00:03:04 a teacher, or a workmate expresses surprise
00:03:09 that you don’t join in a certain celebration.
00:03:11 How will you respond?
00:03:14 So you’re coming to the Christmas party next week, right?
00:03:17 Uh. I don’t think I can make it.
00:03:21 What do you mean?
00:03:22 Everybody’s going to be there.
00:03:24 I’m kind of busy.
00:03:26 Plus, I’d feel out of place.
00:03:28 I don’t celebrate Christmas.
00:03:32 Our sister wasn’t prepared to address
00:03:35 a common situation during the holiday season.
00:03:39 With more preparation,
00:03:41 she could have responded with conviction.
00:03:45 Let’s watch.
00:03:47 So you’re coming to the Christmas party next week, right?
00:03:50 While I appreciate the invitation, I won’t be going.
00:03:53 You won’t be going?
00:03:55 Everybody’s going to be there.
00:03:57 I’ve made a personal decision not to celebrate Christmas.
00:04:01 Really? Why?
00:04:03 I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:04:06 and I’ve learned through a study of the Bible
00:04:08 that Jesus wasn’t really born in December
00:04:11 and that Christmas is based on unscriptural customs and ideas.
00:04:17 If you have just a moment,
00:04:19 I’d like to show you a web article
00:04:21 that discusses the origin of some Christmas customs.
00:04:25 Sure.
00:04:27 Because our sister spoke with conviction,
00:04:29 she actually piqued the interest of her coworker.
00:04:33 Of course, expressing ourselves with conviction
00:04:36 should not be confused with being tactless,
00:04:39 opinionated, or pushy.
00:04:44 By appealing to our listeners in a loving manner
00:04:46 expressed with conviction,
00:04:48 we will draw still others to the glorious good news found in God’s Word.

At Hebrews 8:1,
the apostle Paul wrote:

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now this is the main point
of what we are saying.”

00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:23.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we teach,
we want our main points to stand out.

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:26.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, which is easier to listen to?

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A rambling discourse
that outlines seemingly unrelated facts

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an organized presentation

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with main points that relate to the theme?

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we make our main points stand out,

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we help our audience to pay attention,

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:48.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understand, and remember what we say.

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you make
the main points stand out?

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, decide on the objective of your talk.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aim to accomplish something.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t know your objective,
neither will your audience.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to inform, convince,

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourage, motivate, or something else?

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, let’s say
that you’re discussing the resurrection.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:22.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re speaking to a grieving family 
made up of fellow Christians,

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your objective may be
to give encouragement and comfort.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
if you’re speaking about the resurrection

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:33.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to unbelieving relatives
who have questioned your beliefs,

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your objective might be to convince them.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:42.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In each instance,
the main points you choose will be different

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the objective is different.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when preparing,

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
select only main points
that help you achieve your objective

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:54.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you can teach effectively
in the allotted time.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then develop the points in a logical order.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself:

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What questions or objections
might my audience have about this topic?

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what logical order would they
raise those questions or objections?’

00:02:13.862 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, however,
we are given an outline to develop,

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the main points have already
been selected and put in a certain order.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In such a case,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
analyze the outline to have clearly in mind

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the objective of the talk

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the main points
will help you to reach that objective.

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you give the talk,

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t want the audience
to lose sight of your theme.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at various times during your discourse,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
repeat key words
in the theme or use synonyms.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your audience will remember
only a few main points,

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so don’t develop too many.

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if you’re giving a longer talk,

00:02:56.864 --> 00:03:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focus on developing a few points well.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you develop secondary points,

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explain their connection to the main point.

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t add ideas
just because they’re interesting.

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make your main points stand out,

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might repeat in a sentence or two

00:03:16.383 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each main point before going on to the next.

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you might state the main points
in the introduction

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then restate them in the conclusion.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you finish,

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:32.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the audience should be able
to remember the main points.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a brother
who’s in the middle of giving a talk.

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:42.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you can discern the main point
he’s developing and his theme.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Proverbs 28:1.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the righteous are compared
to a very impressive animal.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wicked flee when no one pursues them,

00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the righteous
are as confident as a lion.”

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:03.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and I can be like a lion.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that!

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible writers were familiar with lions

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:10.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were
once plentiful in Israel,

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they are now extinct there.

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:17.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lion’s thunderous roar
can be heard for miles.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:21.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can move at a speed
of 40 miles per hour.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are so powerful

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a single blow from a lion’s paw

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is enough to break the neck
of a small antelope.

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to <i>Insight on the Scriptures,</i>

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lion serves as a fitting symbol
of courageous justice.

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jesus is called

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah.”

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:48.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you tell from that talk
what the theme is?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it something about lions?

00:04:50.811 --> 00:04:53.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus? the righteous?

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, the theme of this talk is

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:59.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Makes Us Bold.”

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:03.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the main point
that the speaker is trying to develop?

00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:07.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the Source of true boldness.

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:10.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the speaker try again.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, notice how he emphasizes

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the theme and main point.

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:19.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Proverbs 28:1.

00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read this verse,
look for the answer to this question:

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:27.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What sort of people can be truly confident?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wicked flee when no one pursues them,

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:36.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the righteous
are as confident as a lion.”

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:41.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who can be confident?

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The righteous.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:46.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who are the righteous?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:49.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have faith in the ransom

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:52.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who strive to adhere
to Jehovah’s requirements.

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the point:

00:05:56.293 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Confidence comes not from natural ability,

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:03.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
education, or riches;

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the source of true boldness

00:06:05.928 --> 00:06:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we go in the ministry,
we don’t need to be afraid.

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re doing what Jehovah requires,
and Jehovah is supporting us.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering this will help us
to preach with boldness.

00:06:25.405 --> 00:06:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the speaker
introduced the scripture in a way

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:31.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that called attention to the main point.

00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:36.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He avoided cluttering his talk
with details that didn’t support his point.

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:39.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to make sure
the audience got the main point,

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told them, “Here’s the point.”

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he connected the point to the theme.

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:49.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether from the platform or in the ministry,

00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:53.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our teaching should be simple and clear.

00:06:53.183 --> 00:06:56.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we group our thoughts
under just a few main points

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that relate to our objective and theme,

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our presentation will be easy to follow

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hard to forget.

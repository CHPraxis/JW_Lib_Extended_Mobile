00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul presented information
that was informative to his audience.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, what he said
to Jews in Jerusalem

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
differed from what he said
to Greeks in Athens.

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote,
as recorded at 1 Corinthians chapter 9:

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the Jews I became as a Jew

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to gain Jews . . .

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To those without law

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I became as without law . . .

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to people of all sorts,

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might by all possible means

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“save some.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I do all things for the sake

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:48.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the good news.”

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we make <i>our</i><i> </i> teaching
informative to our audience?

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we should consider

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what our listeners already know.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if we’re speaking

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a congregation of mature Christians,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we shouldn’t simply repeat

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
basic Bible truths that they’ve heard before.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,
we can help them to look at the topic

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a fresh perspective.

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch the following example.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the presentation informative
to the audience?

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 13:35,

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explained
how to identify his followers.

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“By this all will know

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are my disciples
—if you have love among yourselves.”

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That expression,
“among yourselves,”

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that all true Christians

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be together
in one group or organization.

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this organization
would be identified

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the love its members have
for one another.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:56.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it common during war
for people of the same religion

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who live in opposing countries
to slaughter one another?

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any religion in which
people truly view fellow worshippers

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from another neighborhood,
city, or country as their brother?

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that informative?

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the speaker was talking
to unbelieving relatives or workmates,

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, yes, it was informative.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:25.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s say that he was
giving a talk to mature Christians.

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he spent a lot of time
presenting basic information

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the audience already knew,

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he might quickly lose their attention.

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could he discuss the same scripture,
John 13:35,

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that would be informative
to an audience of fellow believers?

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jesus said that love
would identify his true disciples.

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the setting
for Jesus’ discussion

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:55.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded here in John chapter 13?

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had just instituted
the Lord’s Evening Meal.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that he had very little time left
before his arrest and execution.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The matter of his own integrity
was weighing heavily on his mind.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was so important to Jesus
that his disciples love one another

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he included it
in his parting words to them.

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time, they didn’t know it,
but the “one another” would come to include,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just fellow Jews,
but Samaritans and Gentiles too.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were some obstacles
in the first century

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Christians needed to overcome?

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can their example help us?

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:42.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the speaker was discussing
a well-known truth,

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made it informative to his audience

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by including some historical context

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:51.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his listeners may not have known
or remembered.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He chose a fresh perspective.

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:58.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When preparing
to teach well-known Bible truths,

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can we come up
with a fresh perspective?

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the subject, and do research.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we prepare, we can ask questions,

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as ‘who, what, when,

00:04:13.065 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where, why, and how.’

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:19.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we can answer some

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those questions in our presentation.

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we could include

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
less-familiar facts or current events.

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it’s not enough

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply to present interesting information

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may not be well-known by your listeners.

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must also explain how the information

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help them in their daily life.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That requires being specific.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:47.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we can consider
some realistic situations 

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:49.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then outline how
to apply the information.

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a publisher doing this

00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:53.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a Bible study when discussing

00:04:53.772 --> 00:04:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his student the picture and caption

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:57.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on page 219

00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:00.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Remain in God’s Love </i>book.

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:03.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the illustration on page 219.

00:05:03.907 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the caption say?

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rely on Jehovah when you are sick.”

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:11.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.
“Rely on Jehovah.”

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say you were diagnosed

00:05:15.836 --> 00:05:17.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a serious illness.

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could you rely on Jehovah?

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:22.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the book mentions

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some treatments involve spiritism.

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if I was desperate,

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:29.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t choose them because they’re wrong.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:33.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some other ways

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:35.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rely on Jehovah when we’re sick?

00:05:35.647 --> 00:05:37.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer.

00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,
that’s very important.

00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would that help you if you were sick?

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher took a general statement

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“Rely on Jehovah when you are sick”—

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:53.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped his student to see
how it relates to him personally.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we present information

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is informative to our audience,

00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll stimulate their thinking

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach them something worthwhile.

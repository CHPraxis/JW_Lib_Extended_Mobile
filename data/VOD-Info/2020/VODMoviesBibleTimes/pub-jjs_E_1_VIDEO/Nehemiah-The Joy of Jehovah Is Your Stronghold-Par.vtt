00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we learned in our audio drama,

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews returned to Jerusalem

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rebuild the temple in 537 B.C.E.

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:15.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by 515 B.C.E., it was finally completed.

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the city’s walls were still left in ruins.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s time had now come to rebuild the walls,

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he used the faithful man Nehemiah

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead in this work.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would be a massive undertaking for the Jews.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once again, there were opposers.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah told the nation of Israel

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could he encourage them to be joyful

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite all the opposition?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn from their example?

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many,

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:56.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here are three to think about as you watch:

00:00:57.453 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What role did prayer play in helping Nehemiah

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to direct attacks,

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what schemes did the enemies employ

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose the work?

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite setbacks,

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was Nehemiah’s main source of joy?

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it?

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, then, with that in mind, please sit back

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the following video presentation

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege to have a share

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the restoration of Jehovah’s worship.

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People know we rebuilt the wall,

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is so much more to the story.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start at the beginning.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 20th year of King Artaxerxes Longimanus,

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in Shushan the palace.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was cupbearer to the king.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He trusted me with his life.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I was far from Jerusalem,

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found great joy just thinking

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our people there serving Jehovah

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until one day when I received a visit

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from my brother Hanani.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That visit changed everything.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going on, Hanani?

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our people?

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not good.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the temple?

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stands,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the services are nothing but empty rituals.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:23.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the people and the priests ignore God’s Law.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to return with us.

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For days, my conscience plagued me.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would the king even allow me to go?

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our people had sinned

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not keeping Jehovah’s commandments,

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I felt as if I were sinning

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:05.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not helping them in their time of need.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged Jehovah to grant me success.

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah,

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:24.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are you so gloomy when you’re not sick?

00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be nothing but gloominess of heart.

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I not look gloomy

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the city,

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:35.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the place where my forefathers are buried,

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies in ruins,

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been consumed by fire?

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:41.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speak frankly.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you seeking?

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it pleases the king

00:04:55.274 --> 00:05:00.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if your servant has found favor with you,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send me to Judah,

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the city where my forefathers are buried,

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let me rebuild it.

00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:13.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may go.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with us.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:23.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king gave me supplies,

00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an army,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an appointment as governor.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were on our way to help rebuild Jerusalem’s walls.

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:25.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had seen a portion of the city,

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t until I rose

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by night to inspect the walls

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I saw just how badly God’s city had been treated.

00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:44.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait here.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe the destruction.

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:19.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time had come

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:21.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal Jehovah’s purpose for Jerusalem.

00:07:22.504 --> 00:07:24.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gathered the leaders.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:28.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this man?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m told he’s Nehemiah, cupbearer to the king.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does he want from us?

00:07:37.477 --> 00:07:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men!

00:07:44.318 --> 00:07:48.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holy city is completely vulnerable.

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,

00:07:51.658 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that this disgrace will not continue.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:55.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will our neighbors think?

00:07:55.704 --> 00:07:57.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have many powerful enemies.

00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:01.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes commissioned me

00:08:01.168 --> 00:08:03.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rebuild the walls and the entire city.

00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:05.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Didn’t you see the horsemen he sent

00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:07.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the timber?

00:08:07.883 --> 00:08:10.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave it all!

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:13.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, the good hand of our God was upon me.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one to fear, not men.

00:08:16.516 --> 00:08:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will give us success.

00:08:25.942 --> 00:08:28.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not everyone was happy

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had come to do something good

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the people of Israel.

00:08:33.492 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what this Nehemiah is up to.

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:38.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, do you see what I’m seeing?

00:08:38.914 --> 00:08:41.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a wall,

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:43.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can keep the Jews under control.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they rebuild it,

00:08:45.462 --> 00:08:48.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews won’t need our land or resources.

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:49.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means he’s planning to rebel.

00:08:49.674 --> 00:08:50.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t let him.

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:55.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must act, and act together.

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:56.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you with me?

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:57.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have my support.

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And mine, as always.

00:09:02.396 --> 00:09:03.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good!

00:09:03.313 --> 00:09:06.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:12.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opposers wanted to maintain control

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to profit from Jehovah’s people.

00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:18.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wasted little time trying to intimidate us.

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are these?

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:28.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Sanballat, governor of Samaria.

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:33.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next to him is Tobiah, an Ammonite official

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and landowner to many of our people.

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:36.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all look up to him.

00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Geshem;

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:41.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s a very wealthy Arabian and close ally to Sanballat.

00:09:55.323 --> 00:10:00.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, are you rebelling against the king?

00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:03.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king himself gave us the authority.

00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:05.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To rebuild the city and the wall?

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To rebuild the city and the wall

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:08.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what the king expects us to do.

00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:10.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did you not consult with me?

00:10:10.422 --> 00:10:12.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am the governor of Samaria.

00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:14.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but the king appointed

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:16.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah as governor of Judah.

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why have you not asked for our help?

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:19.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worship Jehovah too.

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve sacrificed to him for generations.

00:10:22.058 --> 00:10:24.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with sacrifices to all of your other gods.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:27.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The God of the heavens

00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the One that will grant us success,

00:10:29.774 --> 00:10:31.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we, his servants,

00:10:31.693 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will get up and build.

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one should let his religious beliefs

00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:38.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come before national unity.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have neither share

00:10:40.952 --> 00:10:43.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor claim nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:53.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat,

00:10:53.757 --> 00:10:55.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could it be you

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is rebelling against the highest King of all?

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite opposition,

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people worked strenuously.

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:12.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, these things have to go somewhere.

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:33.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their struggles went far beyond building a wall.

00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah remembers brothers like Peleth.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:39.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how he dealt with personal challenges

00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened my faith.

00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peleth.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll never finish this work.

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:52.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing but rubble.

00:11:52.232 --> 00:11:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least we’re trying to make a change.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always an optimist.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, you’re late on your rent

00:11:59.864 --> 00:12:02.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:12:02.075 --> 00:12:04.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, I’m sorry;

00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:05.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need more time.

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the work on the wall, . . .

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:09.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enough troubles.

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:10.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, if I don’t get payment

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:12.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the end of the month,

00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:14.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and your family are out.

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:18.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there anything we can do?

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I can work it off till we get caught up.

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:24.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:26.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have time to work it off,

00:12:28.602 --> 00:12:30.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe your daughter can help.

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:32.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She can come stay with us.

00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:34.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a slave?

00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:36.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’ll hire her to help Azubah

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:38.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to pay off your debt.

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:41.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I’m trying to help,

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:44.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you don’t have many options here, my friend.

00:12:44.117 --> 00:12:45.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:13:13.813 --> 00:13:16.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Raham spoke to me today.

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About what?

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:21.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to hire Simcha to help Azubah in the house.

00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:25.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says he’ll care for her like his own daughter.

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:29.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imma, I’ve known Raham and Azubah

00:13:29.287 --> 00:13:31.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever since I came here with Ezra.

00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham helped us.

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:35.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our house belongs to him.

00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t trust him.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants our Simcha to live with him?

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:42.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imma, . . .

00:13:42.092 --> 00:13:43.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Jehovah’s command

00:13:43.635 --> 00:13:46.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that parents raise their own children?

00:13:46.221 --> 00:13:48.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you want her to have a better life?

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I-I cannot agree

00:13:56.314 --> 00:13:58.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to having her live apart from us,

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:01.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we have to survive on gleanings.

00:14:01.319 --> 00:14:03.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know we’ll survive at all?

00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:06.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah always takes care

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:07.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who love and obey him.

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:15.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men like Peleth threw their burden on Jehovah

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept working.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat set up camp near Jerusalem

00:14:31.182 --> 00:14:34.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep an eye on our progress.

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:42.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is it?

00:14:42.902 --> 00:14:44.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes?

00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:45.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall

00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:47.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s up to half its height all around the city.

00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:49.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has gone too far!

00:14:51.244 --> 00:14:52.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, how long will it take

00:14:52.912 --> 00:14:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble an attack force?

00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:57.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attack force?

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:00.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Sanballat, an attack on the Jews

00:15:00.795 --> 00:15:02.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be an attack on the king.

00:15:02.714 --> 00:15:03.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you talking about?

00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s right.

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah has authorization from Artaxerxes himself.

00:15:07.927 --> 00:15:09.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw how many horsemen the king sent with him.

00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:10.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:11.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you be talking like this if those horsemen

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:12.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were still here?

00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:13.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they can come back.

00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:15.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonsense!

00:15:15.101 --> 00:15:17.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind the horsemen.

00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:19.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my province!

00:15:19.606 --> 00:15:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:15:23.443 --> 00:15:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we need to threaten them.

00:15:26.988 --> 00:15:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, you bring Samaritan troops

00:15:28.865 --> 00:15:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come in from this way.

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:32.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re preparing to attack us!

00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:33.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know that?

00:15:33.453 --> 00:15:35.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard them talking.

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:38.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, please.

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:40.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have they attacked anyone yet?

00:15:40.543 --> 00:15:41.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have.

00:15:41.461 --> 00:15:42.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw something.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:46.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:15:46.633 --> 00:15:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:54.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani,

00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:58.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
post men by families at the lowest parts of the wall 

00:15:58.311 --> 00:15:59.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at all the exposed places.

00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:01.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah.

00:16:01.105 --> 00:16:02.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not going to work.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we let mere threats frighten us into stopping,

00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will have achieved their goal.

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:10.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no use. Don’t you see?

00:16:10.073 --> 00:16:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These people hate what we’re doing.

00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:12.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hate us.

00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:14.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to live and work around them like we do.

00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:15.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where is your faith?

00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:20.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah’s will that we build this wall.

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:21.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it is really Jehovah’s will,

00:16:21.626 --> 00:16:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why are we getting all this opposition?

00:16:24.587 --> 00:16:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this isn’t the right time.

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:16:28.424 --> 00:16:29.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re worn out.

00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:31.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:16:36.057 --> 00:16:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect Jehovah’s people.

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:16:42.856 --> 00:16:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not be afraid of them.

00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember Jehovah,

00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:52.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is great and awe-inspiring;

00:16:52.574 --> 00:16:54.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fight for your brothers,

00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your sons and daughters,

00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:03.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your wives and homes.

00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you hear the sound of the horn,

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gather together to where we are.

00:17:12.468 --> 00:17:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our God will fight for us.

00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:20.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen for this signal.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The threats aren’t working.

00:17:30.403 --> 00:17:33.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:17:33.823 --> 00:17:34.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:17:34.532 --> 00:17:36.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already spoke about this.

00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:39.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A direct attack would be seditious.

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:42.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, they’ve armed themselves.

00:17:46.169 --> 00:17:47.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My-my lord,

00:17:49.797 --> 00:17:52.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem is right.

00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d never get away with this.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you recall who commissioned Nehemiah?

00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the king.

00:17:58.097 --> 00:18:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the king of Persia, let me remind you.

00:18:01.601 --> 00:18:04.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is setting himself up as a king.

00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:13.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend we turn the accusation of sedition

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Nehemiah.

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s brilliant!

00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:20.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will beg for our help.

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:25.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to Samaria.

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:55.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani,

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:05.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look like you’ve been working.

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must smell like it too.

00:19:08.209 --> 00:19:09.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:19:09.794 --> 00:19:11.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you do.

00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:14.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers!

00:19:16.676 --> 00:19:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we are well on our way to completing the wall.

00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:22.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is helping us,

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we must not let our hands drop.

00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:29.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From now on,

00:19:29.814 --> 00:19:31.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will all spend the night inside Jerusalem.

00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:34.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will take turns keeping watch.

00:19:34.402 --> 00:19:37.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani will give out assignments.

00:19:37.488 --> 00:19:39.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good work today.

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was working hard on the wall.

00:20:23.785 --> 00:20:26.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there were more issues to contend with.

00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:34.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My brothers, how can I help you?

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:38.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, we, with our sons and daughters, are many.

00:20:38.758 --> 00:20:41.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need food to stay alive.

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gave our fields and vineyards

00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:48.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and houses as security to get grain during

00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:49.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food shortage.

00:20:49.936 --> 00:20:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We borrowed money

00:20:51.687 --> 00:20:54.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our fields and our vineyards to pay the king’s tribute.

00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:58.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had to sell some of our children into slavery.

00:20:58.903 --> 00:21:01.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re powerless to stop this

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:03.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our fields and vineyards belong to others.

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:09.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:10.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must ponder all this.

00:21:10.748 --> 00:21:11.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Nehemiah.

00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:12.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani, please tell all the nobles

00:21:20.216 --> 00:21:22.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deputy rulers to come to me

00:21:22.176 --> 00:21:24.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:27.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With God’s help, we can make this right.

00:21:41.904 --> 00:21:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men of Judah,

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:47.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of you is demanding interest from your brother.

00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:51.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

00:21:51.622 --> 00:21:54.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should you not walk in the fear of our God

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:56.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the nations, our enemies,

00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:59.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot reproach us?

00:21:59.213 --> 00:22:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please, stop this lending on interest.

00:22:04.093 --> 00:22:06.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please restore to them their fields,

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:08.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vineyards, olive groves, houses,

00:22:11.517 --> 00:22:13.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the interest.

00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:20.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, I will restore the fields this day at sunset.

00:22:23.112 --> 00:22:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all will restore these things to our brothers.

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before Jehovah,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you swear to these promises?

00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do!

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May the true God shake out from his house

00:22:36.792 --> 00:22:41.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every man who does not carry out this promise.

00:22:41.214 --> 00:22:42.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meshullam,

00:22:49.347 --> 00:22:53.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must inform Tobiah about this.

00:22:55.353 --> 00:22:57.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be successful.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:23:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless it.

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:11.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:23:11.535 --> 00:23:13.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bring good news.

00:23:13.537 --> 00:23:15.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that so?

00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:16.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:23:16.582 --> 00:23:18.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have your rent.

00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh?

00:23:20.711 --> 00:23:23.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come by anytime and collect it.

00:23:23.297 --> 00:23:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I thought we—

00:23:25.132 --> 00:23:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Simcha?

00:23:32.473 --> 00:23:34.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll be staying with us.

00:23:35.643 --> 00:23:38.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how were you able to put it together so quickly?

00:23:38.813 --> 00:23:40.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always takes care of those

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love and obey him.

00:23:44.986 --> 00:23:46.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since Nehemiah got here,

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things have been getting better and better.

00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:06.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah thinks we’re still as young

00:24:06.507 --> 00:24:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as when we came here with Ezra.

00:24:08.551 --> 00:24:09.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve worked hard.

00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:13.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Nehemiah treats us like it all fell out of heaven,

00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:15.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we just have to pick it up.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked hard for what I have, didn’t I?

00:24:18.477 --> 00:24:19.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you worked hard.

00:24:19.603 --> 00:24:21.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I give back my fields,

00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:23.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what am I to eat?

00:24:23.065 --> 00:24:24.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What am I to drink?

00:24:24.984 --> 00:24:26.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with lending on interest?

00:24:26.485 --> 00:24:29.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You borrow, you pay with interest.

00:24:29.488 --> 00:24:31.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, Jehovah just wants us

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to treat our brothers fairly, doesn’t he?

00:24:33.117 --> 00:24:34.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haven’t you heard a word I said?

00:24:34.535 --> 00:24:35.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I treat everyone fairly!

00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:43.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why are you so angry?

00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:45.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not angry!

00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:49.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you talking to me like this?

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:51.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just feel betrayed.

00:24:53.679 --> 00:24:54.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By whom?

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the people I’ve lent money to!

00:25:00.186 --> 00:25:01.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can I do about it?

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:04.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only what a wife is supposed to do!

00:25:04.607 --> 00:25:06.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give me a son!

00:25:06.692 --> 00:25:08.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not a son, then a daughter.

00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:15.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot give you what Jehovah does not give us.

00:25:15.534 --> 00:25:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,

00:25:17.286 --> 00:25:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be too late.

00:25:30.758 --> 00:25:32.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say we write a letter to the king.

00:25:32.843 --> 00:25:34.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s see what the boy reports when he returns.

00:25:34.845 --> 00:25:36.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Sanballat.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall has no more gaps.

00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:41.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:25:44.021 --> 00:25:47.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can they advance so quickly?

00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:50.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there’s a letter for Tobiah.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is forcing

00:26:06.502 --> 00:26:10.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
landlords to return their fields to the original owners.

00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:11.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re running out of time.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough!

00:26:18.264 --> 00:26:20.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell this to Nehemiah:

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:24.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come, and let us set a time

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet together in the Valley Plain of Ono.”

00:26:28.774 --> 00:26:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to lure me away from Jerusalem

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do me harm.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, tell your master:

00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:43.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am engaged in a great work,

00:26:43.205 --> 00:26:44.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I am not able to go down.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why should the work stop

00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:48.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while I leave it to come to you?”

00:26:48.377 --> 00:26:51.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent me the same message several times.

00:26:53.966 --> 00:26:56.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time I gave them the same response.

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:06.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, he has rejected your offer a fourth time.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem,

00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s time to implement your plan.

00:27:17.239 --> 00:27:19.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:21.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
write this down:

00:27:21.368 --> 00:27:23.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Among the nations it has been heard,

00:27:23.787 --> 00:27:26.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Geshem is also saying it,

00:27:26.832 --> 00:27:30.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you and the Jews

00:27:30.628 --> 00:27:32.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are scheming to rebel.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why you are building the wall.”

00:27:54.568 --> 00:27:55.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes?

00:27:57.112 --> 00:27:59.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give this to Nehemiah.

00:28:21.345 --> 00:28:23.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell your master:

00:28:23.347 --> 00:28:25.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“None of the things you are saying have taken place.

00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:29.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are making them up out of your own imagination.”

00:28:50.207 --> 00:28:52.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re bluffing.

00:28:52.459 --> 00:28:55.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to frighten us into stopping the work.

00:28:55.045 --> 00:28:57.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they know that the king won’t change his decree.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:04.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But believe me, they won’t stop.

00:29:26.577 --> 00:29:29.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I pray,

00:29:29.913 --> 00:29:32.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthen my hands.

00:29:35.878 --> 00:29:38.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to stop him?

00:29:38.297 --> 00:29:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have much time.

00:29:40.633 --> 00:29:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall is almost complete.

00:29:48.057 --> 00:29:49.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat,

00:29:51.518 --> 00:29:53.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I know a way.

00:29:53.437 --> 00:29:55.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah, you called for me.

00:29:55.981 --> 00:29:57.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quickly!

00:30:00.569 --> 00:30:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are in great danger.

00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:04.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so am I because I know about it.

00:30:04.573 --> 00:30:05.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk sense, man!

00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:06.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What danger?

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re coming to kill you—by night!

00:30:09.286 --> 00:30:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:30:12.748 --> 00:30:14.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah,

00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:16.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should a man like me run away?

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t understand.

00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:21.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:30:21.548 --> 00:30:23.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the only safe place.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m not a priest.

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:27.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I entered the temple,

00:30:27.805 --> 00:30:29.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:30:29.515 --> 00:30:32.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not go in.

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:34.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:30:40.693 --> 00:30:42.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see!

00:30:42.152 --> 00:30:46.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah and Sanballat put you up to this,

00:30:46.073 --> 00:30:48.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t they, you hypocrite?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah remember them

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:51.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you false prophets

00:30:51.704 --> 00:30:53.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who keep trying to frighten me.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:55.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, Hanani,

00:30:55.499 --> 00:30:57.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have work to do.

00:31:08.011 --> 00:31:09.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Argh!

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:17.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just kept working day and night.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we knew it,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were finishing the very last section of the wall.

00:31:37.082 --> 00:31:39.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us to achieve the impossible.

00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:48.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were tired,

00:31:48.218 --> 00:31:50.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we discovered something we had lost

00:31:53.515 --> 00:31:55.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:00.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, the wall is complete!

00:32:00.105 --> 00:32:02.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah! Yes!

00:32:03.442 --> 00:32:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:06.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just 52 days.

00:32:13.035 --> 00:32:15.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, it’s from Shemaiah.

00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:31.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it say?

00:32:43.023 --> 00:32:45.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall is complete.

00:32:45.025 --> 00:32:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the doors are left to be put in.

00:32:48.904 --> 00:32:51.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat, we must act quickly.

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:53.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat . . .

00:32:53.158 --> 00:32:55.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop it, Tobiah.

00:32:55.869 --> 00:32:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, there’s still time.

00:32:57.287 --> 00:32:58.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Write that letter to the king.

00:32:58.872 --> 00:33:00.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:33:00.624 --> 00:33:02.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you see?

00:33:02.668 --> 00:33:05.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God must be helping the Jews.

00:33:09.383 --> 00:33:10.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s over.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:14.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll lose all control over them.

00:33:17.057 --> 00:33:19.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t over.

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:13.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebuilding the walls was only the beginning.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would definitely need God’s help

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what was coming next.

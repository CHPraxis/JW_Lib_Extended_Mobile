Grandpa!

00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandpa, what is this?

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did you find this?

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fields.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come along.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show you something.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:27.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve never told you about my past, have I?

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah, you are still young now.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one day you’ll learn more about my life.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did many bad things.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to worship false gods instead of Jehovah.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even brought idols into the temple.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I upset Jehovah very much.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he disciplined me.

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged Jehovah to forgive me.

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he forgive you?

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes. His mercy is great!

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these are the words of Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah:

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All who form carved images

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“amount to nothing,

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and their cherished objects will be of no benefit.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As their witnesses,

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they see nothing

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know nothing.”

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I want you to read

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these words down here about a man who cuts down a tree.

00:03:00.117 --> 00:03:02.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what he does with it.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:06.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Half of it he burns up in a fire;

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with that half

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:13.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he roasts the meat that he e-e-eats,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he is s-s-satisfied.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He also warms himself and says:

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Ah! I am warm as I watch the fire.’”

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that bad, Grandpa?

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, my son.

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s see what he does with the other half.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:38.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the rest of it he makes into a god,

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into his c-c-carved image.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He bows down to it and worships it.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He prays to it and says:

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Save me, for you are my god.’”

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s wrong!

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it wrong, Josiah?

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:04.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s not Jehovah.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a tree.

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:09.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah feel about doing something like that?

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:13.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t want us to serve any other gods?

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, can any other god listen to our prayers?

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Only Jehovah.

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah wants to hear your prayers, Josiah.

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always pray to him.

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to him many times a day

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your heart.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That shows you love him and want to be his friend.

00:04:41.093 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you make a mistake,

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray to Jehovah to forgive you.

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even for a hundred mistakes?

00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even for a hundred.

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:53.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A thousand?

00:04:53.063 --> 00:04:54.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A thousand, thousand?

00:04:56.775 --> 00:05:01.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even that many—if you pray to Jehovah to forgive you

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:06.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you really keep trying to do what is right.

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:18.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah, your grandfather needs to rest.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:13.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finish telling me the story.

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where was I?

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:16.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angel.

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:18.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah’s angel came down,

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:25.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoosh!

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he destroyed 185,000 of Sennacherib’s troops.

00:06:32.162 --> 00:06:33.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Hezekiah learned

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:38.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can always trust in Jehovah.

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like going to the temple with you.

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:44.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah!

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You shouldn’t fill the boy’s head with such stories.

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king told me to take Josiah to the temple.

00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:55.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know where you’re going, and I don’t care what my father told you.

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:56.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boy isn’t—

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t what?

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, what are you doing out of bed?

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah wanted to go to the temple.

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:07.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had Zephaniah take him along ahead of me.

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:11.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not want to join us,

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:15.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will not prevent Josiah from going.

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:24.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you wish.

00:07:38.312 --> 00:07:42.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan, this is a good one.

00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:49.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who should I be this time?

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be King Solomon.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:54.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking I could be King David.

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quick!

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:26.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring the boy!

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:27.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Manasseh is asking for him!

00:08:29.363 --> 00:08:31.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where is Josiah?

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:33.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s on his way, my lord.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandfather!

00:08:38.413 --> 00:08:42.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my son.

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to me.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Grandfather, you have to get better.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m afraid of being alone.

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:55.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:00.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you,

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:05.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so is your cousin Zephaniah.

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:09.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is holy,

00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:12.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you must serve him

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way he wants us to

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:18.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and only that way.

00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:24.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sacrifices and celebrations at the temple,

00:09:24.376 --> 00:09:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they help us be friends with Jehovah.

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:33.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to restore pure worship,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the people still sacrifice on the high places.

00:09:44.604 --> 00:09:49.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s temple—we’ve neglected it.

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:55.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy the people were when they worshipped

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah the right way!

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:03.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s temple and worship

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:06.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be like that again.

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:13.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at me.

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:18.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serve Jehovah, Josiah.

00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All other gods

00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:25.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are powerless.

00:10:57.886 --> 00:11:00.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m afraid of being alone.

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:10.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:17.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:06.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy the people were

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they worshipped Jehovah the right way!

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:17.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s temple

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worship

00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:22.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be like that again.

00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:33.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah!

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, that hurts!

00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is business?

00:13:10.393 --> 00:13:13.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Phoenician models are beautiful,

00:13:13.063 --> 00:13:15.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re selling briskly, Ben-Mattan.

00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent! We’re making a bigger profit on them too.

00:13:18.443 --> 00:13:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will bring blessings from Baal.

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see the crops flourishing already.

00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:29.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t like this.

00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:32.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop it!

00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need the help of all the gods,

00:13:38.588 --> 00:13:40.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just Jehovah.

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:43.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not what Grandfather taught me.

00:13:43.343 --> 00:13:46.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “All other gods are powerless.”

00:13:46.054 --> 00:13:48.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lower your voice.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your grandfather knew Topheth better than anyone.

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:04.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You, my son, can become a mighty man with Jehovah’s help

00:14:04.114 --> 00:14:06.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Baal’s.

00:14:06.408 --> 00:14:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not right;

00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:12.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s not right.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re going to worship Jehovah,

00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:15.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we need to go to the temple.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandfather said that—

00:14:16.501 --> 00:14:19.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind what your grandfather said!

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been dead for two years.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are not to speak of him again. Understand?

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah!

00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:59.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan, let’s get out of here.

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:03.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan.

00:15:11.097 --> 00:15:12.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:15:13.558 --> 00:15:14.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Amon.

00:15:30.408 --> 00:15:31.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah.

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:45.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take it.

00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:47.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make a scene.

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:50.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All other gods are powerless!

00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Agh! Let me go!

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:00.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not here!

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:02.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not standing before Baal!

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:04.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not—

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:30.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if this year Baal gives us no rain,

00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will certainly know why.

00:16:35.557 --> 00:16:40.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the boy did today was blasphemous.

00:16:42.438 --> 00:16:44.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you expect?

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spent all of his time with my father.

00:16:48.444 --> 00:16:50.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must be punished!

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hold your tongue if you want to keep it!

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be a priest of Baal, but do not forget who’s king here!

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:02.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I most certainly will not.

00:17:04.335 --> 00:17:05.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:07.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now go!

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And take that with you.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will remain here for you to reflect upon, my lord the king.

00:17:37.577 --> 00:17:39.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Argh!

00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:49.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help! Help!

00:17:51.466 --> 00:17:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody has murdered the king!

00:18:26.084 --> 00:18:29.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah, you’re not alone.

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:33.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you,

00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:37.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so is your cousin Zephaniah.

00:18:54.237 --> 00:18:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:18:57.115 --> 00:18:59.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:01.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:04.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:04.622 --> 00:19:06.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:13.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:15.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long live the king!

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:26.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan.

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:29.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord

00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:32.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a king.

00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:34.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah,

00:19:34.986 --> 00:19:37.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prophet of Jehovah, so good to see you too.

00:19:37.655 --> 00:19:40.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My king,

00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:43.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you must feel so overwhelmed by all this.

00:19:44.746 --> 00:19:47.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will truly miss your father.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a good, tolerant man

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:53.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who allowed everyone to worship as they wished.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,

00:19:56.007 --> 00:20:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your father consulted with me regularly

00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:02.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on very important matters.

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:05.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah,

00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:09.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we still shoot arrows sometimes?

00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:12.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll leave you, my lord.

00:20:16.444 --> 00:20:20.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, my sincerest condolences for the loss of your father.

00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:24.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m here

00:20:24.702 --> 00:20:26.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever you need me.

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:44.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Let’s try again.

00:20:52.522 --> 00:20:54.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your hand steady—like this.

00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:59.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, don’t focus on the arrow; focus on the target.

00:21:02.031 --> 00:21:03.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like this?

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:04.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:21:15.294 --> 00:21:16.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve improved.

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan,

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d almost given up on you.

00:21:23.177 --> 00:21:25.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re almost done.

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:27.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan, let’s see who can hit center first.

00:21:28.057 --> 00:21:29.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no contest.

00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have more time to practice.

00:21:31.018 --> 00:21:35.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to practice so that I can defeat Jehovah’s enemies.

00:21:35.189 --> 00:21:38.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The history of the kings teaches us

00:21:38.067 --> 00:21:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much about good and bad.

00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:43.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we carefully study their lives,

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:44.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learn that—

00:21:44.991 --> 00:21:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we need to love Jehovah and hate what is bad.

00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:49.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we know.

00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:50.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why does it matter?

00:21:50.705 --> 00:21:52.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Weren’t most kings bad anyway?

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:53.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true, some were.

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:57.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t trust in Jehovah,

00:21:57.378 --> 00:21:59.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they didn’t draw close to him.

00:21:59.547 --> 00:22:02.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the king does not search for Jehovah,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone suffers, even the good people.

00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:09.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the more reason to learn from their mistakes.

00:22:12.351 --> 00:22:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you understand what kind of influence a king has?

00:22:17.398 --> 00:22:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think so.

00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:21.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My grandfather was a great man—

00:22:21.694 --> 00:22:24.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father says that King Manasseh

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have been a little brutal,

00:22:25.656 --> 00:22:28.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was effective, and he was tolerant.

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:29.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave the people many freedoms.

00:22:29.911 --> 00:22:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan, having freedom

00:22:32.246 --> 00:22:34.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means having responsibility.

00:22:34.665 --> 00:22:36.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The responsibility—

00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:38.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we go again.

00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:42.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The responsibility to choose who we will serve

00:22:42.548 --> 00:22:45.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah or other gods.

00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:51.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father says that after the Assyrians released Manasseh,

00:22:51.182 --> 00:22:53.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worshipping only one god weakened him

00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:57.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he started ruling like an old woman.

00:22:57.355 --> 00:22:59.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not true.

00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:01.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My grandfather learned the hard way that Jehovah

00:23:01.692 --> 00:23:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the only true God.

00:23:03.152 --> 00:23:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you just insulted him.

00:23:04.153 --> 00:23:06.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father simply sees the mistakes your grandfather made.

00:23:07.573 --> 00:23:08.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your father should keep his views to himself.

00:23:08.908 --> 00:23:10.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you say that?

00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:11.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your father trusted him,

00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you should too.

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:15.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, you can be loyal to Jehovah

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Baal, Malcam, or any other god at the same time.

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t honestly believe that?

00:23:23.547 --> 00:23:25.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.

00:23:26.592 --> 00:23:29.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your father keeps confusing people.

00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:32.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So are you telling me I should disrespect him?

00:23:32.974 --> 00:23:35.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the proverb that says:

00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:37.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Listen to your father who caused your birth”?

00:23:37.853 --> 00:23:40.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enan, we must respect our parents.

00:23:40.898 --> 00:23:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all of us, including our parents,

00:23:44.318 --> 00:23:46.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
owe our lives to Jehovah.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we just go along with our parents

00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:51.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing something Jehovah hates,

00:23:51.242 --> 00:23:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
aren’t we honoring them more than Jehovah?

00:23:56.539 --> 00:23:58.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just makes me so mad!

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My grandfather was a great man, and you insult him.

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:06.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah is a prophet; you must listen to him!”

00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prophets come and go.

00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:13.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not even old enough to be a real prophet.

00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:17.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is he—25 at the most?

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:19.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do we only need to worship Jehovah?

00:24:19.312 --> 00:24:21.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People worship lots of gods.

00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:23.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful what you say around Josiah.

00:24:23.566 --> 00:24:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His over-righteous spirit may one day turn dangerous.

00:24:28.904 --> 00:24:30.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to help him be more

00:24:30.973 --> 00:24:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
balanced, reasonable.

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:35.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:39.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah says he has a spirit like David.

00:24:41.834 --> 00:24:43.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfaithful David,

00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:47.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who stole another man’s wife.

00:24:51.552 --> 00:24:54.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:24:57.516 --> 00:24:58.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to me.

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:10.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Josiah is right?

00:25:10.154 --> 00:25:12.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right about what?

00:25:14.408 --> 00:25:16.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if there really is only one true God?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Son, Josiah doesn’t see the bigger picture.

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His-his grandfather did before he weakened.

00:25:32.802 --> 00:25:34.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can I do?

00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:36.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to him.

00:25:38.682 --> 00:25:41.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help him to be a good king

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:43.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—tolerant—

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Manasseh was.

00:25:46.065 --> 00:25:48.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what you can tell him.

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah.

00:25:59.328 --> 00:26:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wanted—

00:26:03.999 --> 00:26:06.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to apologize.

00:26:06.377 --> 00:26:09.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that yesterday.

00:26:10.172 --> 00:26:11.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all right.

00:26:11.382 --> 00:26:12.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I forgave you already.

00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want any problems between us.

00:26:14.009 --> 00:26:16.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just,

00:26:16.262 --> 00:26:18.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what if you’re wrong?

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Baal worship is important?

00:26:21.517 --> 00:26:22.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal is the god of the life-giving rains,

00:26:26.772 --> 00:26:31.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your father and grandfather sacrificed on the high places.

00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:34.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if Baal cuts off the rains

00:26:34.697 --> 00:26:36.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you don’t?

00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:41.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crops would die, and the people would starve,

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they would revolt against you.

00:26:48.544 --> 00:26:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know how you feel about Jehovah.

00:26:52.715 --> 00:26:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it better to offer the other sacrifices too

00:26:58.554 --> 00:27:00.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just in case?

00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:08.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I worry about that when it’s only Jehovah

00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:12.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can control the weather,

00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:14.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not some false rain god?

00:27:19.408 --> 00:27:21.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you remember,

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Solomon wrote: “All the streams”—

00:27:24.497 --> 00:27:26.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:32.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full.

00:27:33.547 --> 00:27:36.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the place from which the streams flow,

00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there they return so as to flow again.”

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:42.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right,

00:27:42.097 --> 00:27:45.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Jehovah designed.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We studied that scroll together.

00:27:47.603 --> 00:27:51.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some people say the scrolls have been altered.

00:27:52.691 --> 00:27:54.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe the gods are trying to tell us that—

00:27:54.693 --> 00:27:57.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when we were little,

00:27:57.321 --> 00:27:59.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would play in the fields?

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:01.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:28:02.826 --> 00:28:04.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always wanted to be King Solomon.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom and riches,

00:28:09.917 --> 00:28:13.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do you also remember the end of the story?

00:28:13.212 --> 00:28:17.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His wives inclined his heart to follow other gods.

00:28:17.716 --> 00:28:21.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His heart wasn’t complete with Jehovah like David’s was.

00:28:24.348 --> 00:28:26.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to make that same mistake.

00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:44.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you drawing?

00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:46.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the temple.

00:28:46.412 --> 00:28:49.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My grandfather told me how beautiful the temple was

00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:51.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when people would worship Jehovah properly.

00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:58.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said it could be that way again.

00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:07.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you what I intend to do as king.

00:29:08.684 --> 00:29:10.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t understand!

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:13.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah plans to tear down all the high places!

00:29:16.692 --> 00:29:18.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I understand all right.

00:29:18.986 --> 00:29:22.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When his extremist ideas

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become the law of the land,

00:29:25.659 --> 00:29:28.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there will no longer be any joy,

00:29:28.954 --> 00:29:33.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no tolerance, no freedom of worship

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—only narrow-minded rules

00:29:37.421 --> 00:29:40.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and oppressed people.

00:29:40.257 --> 00:29:42.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you understand that?

00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:47.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not a good sign.

00:30:15.459 --> 00:30:18.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is holy,

00:30:26.011 --> 00:30:30.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you must serve him the way he wants us to

00:30:30.683 --> 00:30:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and only that way.

00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:37.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You, my son,

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can become a mighty man

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:41.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s help

00:30:42.486 --> 00:30:44.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Baal’s.

00:30:45.989 --> 00:30:50.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the king does not search for Jehovah, everyone suffers,

00:30:50.869 --> 00:30:52.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the good people.

00:30:54.623 --> 00:30:56.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’re wrong?

00:30:58.085 --> 00:31:01.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it better to offer the other sacrifices too

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just in case?

00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:17.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serve Jehovah,

00:31:17.896 --> 00:31:19.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All other gods

00:31:25.654 --> 00:31:27.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are powerless.

00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:35.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah!

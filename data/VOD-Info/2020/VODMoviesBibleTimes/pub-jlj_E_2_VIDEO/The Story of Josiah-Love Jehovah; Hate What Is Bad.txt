00:00:04 “Jehovah is great and most worthy of . . .”
00:00:08 “. . . praise”!
00:00:09 Very good.
00:00:11 “. . . worthy of praise in the city of our God,
00:00:14 “in his holy mountain.
00:00:15 “Beautiful in its loftiness,
00:00:17 the joy of the whole earth, is Mount”—
00:00:22 Who can tell me?
00:00:24 “Mount Zion”!
00:00:25 Both of you have been paying good attention.
00:00:29 Now, where is Mount Zion?
00:00:32 Right here, Father. Right here.
00:00:35 Where?
00:00:37 I don’t see it. Are you sure?
00:00:39 No, Father, we live on Mount Zion.
00:00:43 Are you saying we live on a mountain?
00:00:45 Yes.
00:00:48 What is so special about Mount Zion?
00:00:50 I know! I know!
00:00:52 Tell me, my dear.
00:00:53 This is where King David lived.
00:00:55 Jehovah said:
00:00:57 ‘I have put my king upon Zion,
00:00:59 my holy mountain.’
00:01:01 The priests brought the Ark here.
00:01:05 Hamutal, where did we get such studious children?
00:01:07 Just like their father.
00:01:14 Come on, children.
00:01:15 Aw!
00:01:16 Oh!
00:01:41 Zephaniah, today my little son
00:01:45 found this in a field and brought it home.
00:01:52 They’re filling the holy city with their filthy idols.
00:01:57 Everywhere I look, I see Baal images
00:02:00 and smoke on the high places.
00:02:04 The smell of their incense makes me sick!
00:02:10 I’ve been king for 12 years now.
00:02:12 It’s time to act!
00:02:15 I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.
00:02:19 You will need Jehovah’s help.
00:02:23 I know.
00:02:25 I’ve been praying about it day and night.
00:02:27 Good.
00:02:30 I will issue a proclamation:
00:02:33 Let the word go forth that we will rid this land of idolatry!
00:02:42 I’ve seen these cheaper.
00:02:45 Take it or leave it.
00:02:51 You keep raising your prices.
00:02:56 We start here!
00:03:00 No!
00:03:18 This is what we will do to every false god in the land.
00:03:33 Father—
00:03:35 Father, wake up!
00:03:37 Father, come on, this is no time to be sleeping.
00:03:41 Josiah is on a campaign against all the other gods except Jehovah.
00:03:44 What?
00:03:50 Josiah is upending his own kingdom?
00:03:54 This will not go down as easily as they think.
00:03:58 Does he think people will give up their customs?
00:04:02 their rituals? their whole way of life?
00:04:10 He’s a fool.
00:04:13 Baal will rescue us.
00:04:19 Baal will rescue us?
00:04:24 Father, look around!
00:04:27 All over Judah and Jerusalem,
00:04:29 Josiah is destroying Baal images.
00:04:31 They can’t even rescue themselves!
00:04:33 And the people—
00:04:35 The people are supporting him!
00:04:40 Go ahead and doubt, you disrespectful child.
00:04:45 You have become disloyal to Baal and to me,
00:04:49 your father, who gave you life.
00:04:56 Never mind, I’ll come up with a plan.
00:05:47 My lady Hamutal, a word with you, please.
00:05:50 A word with you, please!
00:05:54 Ben-Mattan!
00:05:58 What do you want?
00:06:01 Please, tell the king he must stop what he’s doing.
00:06:06 This is madness.
00:06:08 He’s endangering himself,
00:06:11 his family, and our entire nation.
00:06:19 Josiah’s campaign against Baal worshippers
00:06:24 is a campaign against Baal himself.
00:06:27 Oh, Ben-Mattan, you and your disgusting idols.
00:06:30 Get away from me before I have the guards arrest you.
00:06:32 Forgive me.
00:06:33 I beg you, just another word, please.
00:06:43 Hamutal, I’m only telling you this for your own safety.
00:06:50 It’d be terrible if something were to happen to the king
00:06:55 like what happened to his father.
00:06:59 Hamutal,
00:07:01 think of your children.
00:07:16 Baal worshippers are no match for Jehovah, Hamutal.
00:07:23 Please don’t be fearful.
00:07:26 But this campaign has gone on for a year.
00:07:29 How long do we have to endure this?
00:07:32 However long it takes.
00:07:37 Yes.
00:07:38 My lord, Zephaniah the prophet has arrived.
00:07:41 He brought someone with him.
00:07:42 Thank you.
00:07:43 I’ll see them in the throne room.
00:07:52 Better check on the children.
00:07:54 Please don’t show your concern in front of them.
00:08:20 Jehovah, have I gone too far?
00:08:26 My own grandfather didn’t succeed
00:08:29 in ridding the land of the high places.
00:08:34 How can I do this?
00:08:50 My lord, this is Jeremiah from Anathoth.
00:08:55 The man whom Jehovah has called to be a prophet, welcome.
00:08:59 King Josiah, all the faithful ones
00:09:00 support your campaign against idolatry.
00:09:02 We have done as you directed, my lord.
00:09:05 And since you began this campaign 18 months ago,
00:09:07 you have gained many supporters.
00:09:11 This is true.
00:09:13 Yet, many have continued worshipping Baal.
00:09:17 Men like Ben-Mattan pose a great threat.
00:09:22 The people may even resort to violence
00:09:24 to oppose this great work.
00:09:29 No doubt.
00:09:32 My lord,
00:09:35 do you feel that you may not have
00:09:37 what it takes to complete such a task?
00:09:43 Restoring pure worship will take much more effort,
00:09:50 but it’s the right thing to do.
00:09:52 You’re right, Josiah.
00:09:54 But you’re not doing this in human strength;
00:09:57 Jehovah is on your side.
00:10:00 He will give you the courage, wisdom,
00:10:02 and strength to complete this work.
00:10:05 When I expressed doubt in my own abilities,
00:10:10 Jehovah told me: “Do not say, ‘I am just a boy.’”
00:10:14 But Jehovah spoke to you directly, Jeremiah.
00:10:19 How can I be sure that he’ll back me up that way?
00:10:21 Jeremiah just told me
00:10:23 of a prophecy given hundreds of years ago,
00:10:26 after King Jeroboam set up his own altar in the northern kingdom.
00:10:30 “By the word of Jehovah,
00:10:33 “a man of God came from Judah to Bethel
00:10:36 “while Jeroboam was standing by the altar
00:10:38 “to make sacrificial smoke.
00:10:40 “Then he called out
00:10:41 “against the altar by the word of Jehovah and said:
00:10:46 “‘O altar, altar!
00:10:48 “‘This is what Jehovah says:
00:10:51 “‘“Look! A son named Josiah
00:10:54 “‘“will be born to the house of David!
00:10:57 “‘“He will sacrifice on you the priests of the high places,
00:11:02 “‘“those making sacrificial smoke on you,
00:11:06 and he will burn human bones on you.”’”
00:11:11 So do not waver in a lack of faith, Josiah.
00:11:14 Become powerful by faith,
00:11:18 like our father Abraham.
00:11:21 Jehovah also spoke to me, Josiah.
00:11:23 He said:
00:11:26 “I will wipe out from this place every vestige of Baal,
00:11:30 “the name of the foreign-god priests along with the priests . . .
00:11:35 “I will call to account the princes,
00:11:37 “the sons of the king, and all those wearing foreign clothing.
00:11:42 “. . . Neither their silver nor their gold will . . . save them . . .
00:11:47 He will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth.”
00:12:19 Shaphan, the cleansing campaign has gone well,
00:12:23 but the temple is in disrepair.
00:12:26 It has been neglected for decades.
00:12:29 I heartily agree, my lord.
00:12:32 Go up to Hilkiah, the high priest,
00:12:34 let him collect all the silver
00:12:36 that is brought into the house of Jehovah.
00:12:39 Give it to those appointed over the work
00:12:41 to repair the damage.
00:12:44 Tell them to buy timbers and hewn stones.
00:12:47 Very good, my lord!
00:12:49 And who should keep account of the funds?
00:12:50 Shaphan?
00:12:52 No, Joah, no accounting should be required for the silver.
00:12:56 All these men are trustworthy.
00:12:58 Yes, my lord, as you wish.
00:13:04 The day my grandfather died,
00:13:08 he spoke of the temple.
00:13:09 I kept this safe all these years,
00:13:14 hoping one day I could glorify Jehovah’s house.
00:13:27 Today is that day.
00:15:36 Hilkiah! What’s wrong?
00:15:38 Shaphan, I found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.
00:15:44 The book of the Law?
00:15:50 I’ve never seen these passages before.
00:15:53 Take this scroll to King Josiah immediately.
00:16:00 Materials—as far as that goes,
00:16:03 we are ahead of schedule for the most part.
00:16:05 But there are a few items that just haven’t come in yet.
00:16:09 As long as we get them in the next week or so—
00:16:11 My lord.
00:16:14 Shaphan!
00:16:15 How is the renovation coming?
00:16:17 Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them.
00:16:20 They have poured out the money
00:16:22 that was found in the house of Jehovah,
00:16:24 and they have handed it over
00:16:25 to the appointed men and to those doing the work.
00:16:28 Very well.
00:16:33 Is there something else?
00:16:35 Yes, my lord.
00:16:37 There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me.
00:16:41 What book?
00:16:44 They appear to be the words of Moses, my lord.
00:16:49 Read it to us, then!
00:16:53 “These are the regulations
00:16:55 “and the judicial decisions that you should be careful to carry out . . .
00:17:01 “You should completely destroy all the places
00:17:04 “where the nations you will dispossess have served their gods,
00:17:08 “whether on the high mountains
00:17:10 “or on the hills or under any luxuriant tree.
00:17:16 “You should pull down their altars,
00:17:19 “shatter their sacred pillars,
00:17:22 “burn their sacred poles in the fire,
00:17:24 “and cut down the graven images of their gods,
00:17:27 obliterating their very names from that place.”
00:17:41 Argh!
00:17:52 Go!
00:17:53 All of you along with Hilkiah,
00:17:56 inquire of Jehovah concerning the words
00:17:58 of the book that has been found,
00:17:59 for Jehovah’s rage is great
00:18:02 because our forefathers did not carry out the word of Jehovah
00:18:05 by observing all that is written in this book.
00:18:23 The prophetess Huldah lives nearby in the Second Quarter.
00:18:28 I’ll ask Hilkiah to meet us there.
00:18:58 This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says:
00:19:03 “Tell the man who sent you to me:
00:19:07 “‘. . . I will bring calamity on this place
00:19:10 “‘and its inhabitants,
00:19:12 “‘all the curses that are written in the book
00:19:15 “‘that they read before the king of Judah.
00:19:17 “‘Because they have abandoned me
00:19:20 “‘and are making sacrifices smoke
00:19:22 “‘to other gods in order to offend me . . . ,
00:19:28 “‘my rage will pour out on this place
00:19:31 and it will not be extinguished.’”
00:19:36 But to the king of Judah . . . ,
00:19:40 this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says:
00:19:44 “Because your heart was responsive
00:19:47 “and you humbled yourself before God on hearing his words
00:19:52 “. . . and ripped your garments apart
00:19:56 “and wept before me,
00:19:59 I also have heard you.”
00:20:01 “I also have heard you . . .
00:20:03 “That is why . . . you will be laid in your grave in peace,
00:20:07 “and your eyes will not see all the calamity
00:20:10 that I will bring on this place.”
00:20:15 Praised be Jehovah, our merciful God,
00:20:20 for holding back his wrath.
00:20:24 Summon all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
00:20:27 Have them come up to the house of Jehovah.
00:20:33 “Be careful to obey all these words
00:20:35 “that I am commanding you,
00:20:37 “so that it may always go well with you and your sons after you,
00:20:43 “because you are doing what is good and right
00:20:45 “in the eyes of Jehovah your God.
00:20:48 “When Jehovah your God annihilates
00:20:50 “the nations that you are to dispossess,
00:20:52 “. . . do not ask about their gods, saying,
00:20:56 “‘How were these nations accustomed to serve their gods?’
00:21:00 “. . . Because they do for their gods
00:21:02 “every detestable thing that Jehovah hates,
00:21:06 “even burning their sons and their daughters
00:21:09 in the fire to their gods.”
00:21:14 “If your brother . . . or your son
00:21:18 “or your daughter
00:21:21 “or your cherished wife
00:21:24 “or your closest companion
00:21:26 “should try to entice you in secrecy,
00:21:31 “saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’
00:21:35 “. . . you must not give in to him or listen to him,
00:21:39 “nor should you show pity
00:21:41 “or feel compassion or protect him;
00:21:45 “instead,
00:21:47 you should kill him without fail.”
00:21:56 “Observe the month of Abib,
00:21:58 “and celebrate the Passover to Jehovah your God,
00:22:01 “for in the month of Abib, Jehovah your God
00:22:04 “brought you out of Egypt by night.
00:22:07 “And you should sacrifice the Passover offering
00:22:10 “to Jehovah your God . . . in the place that Jehovah chooses
00:22:14 to have his name reside.”
00:22:17 Please join me in making a covenant
00:22:20 with the one true God, Jehovah,
00:22:22 to carry out all the words of this book.
00:22:29 Jehovah, our God in the heavens . . .
00:22:38 Amen!
00:22:40 Amen!
00:22:59 Bring them down to the Kidron Valley, and burn them there.
00:23:02 And desecrate Topheth,
00:23:05 so that no one can make their son
00:23:07 or their daughter pass through the fire there.
00:23:13 This is only the beginning.
00:23:17 With Jehovah’s help, we will rid the entire land of high places,
00:23:25 every vestige of false worship,
00:23:28 and of everyone who promotes it.
00:23:38 Once we cleanse the land of Judah, we’ll head north again
00:23:43 to the cities of Samaria.
00:23:52 Forward!
00:25:27 To whom do these graves belong?
00:25:30 They belong to the Baal prophets, my lord.
00:25:35 Take their bones and burn them
00:25:37 on the altar of King Jeroboam.
00:25:39 Afterward, tear it down.
00:26:00 What is the grave over there?
00:26:02 It is the grave of the man of the true God
00:26:04 who foretold these things
00:26:06 that you have done against the altar of Bethel.
00:26:16 Let him rest.
00:26:18 Do not let anyone disturb his bones.
00:26:21 Baal, save us! Baal, save us!
00:26:24 Baal! Help us!
00:26:27 Baal! Baal! Hold it!
00:26:35 Baal! Baal! Hold it!
00:26:37 Baal! Help us!
00:26:50 Father.
00:27:00 My lord the king
00:27:03 is a pale imitation of his grandfather.
00:27:07 And now he’s turned my own son against me.
00:27:09 That is not true.
00:27:10 This is about standing up for what is right.
00:27:16 Baal is powerless.
00:27:18 Why can’t you see that?
00:27:22 Powerless?
00:27:29 I wish I had sacrificed you in Topheth!
00:27:43 No one will ever be able to do that again.
00:27:50 Josiah made sure of that.
00:28:41 My lord,
00:28:42 everything has finally been accomplished according to the Law.
00:28:46 There is one thing left for us to make right.
00:28:51 Command the people to hold a Passover to Jehovah
00:28:54 as is written in the book of the covenant.
00:28:58 What if the people can’t afford the Passover sacrifices?
00:29:01 I will contribute cattle to the people, and my own flocks.
00:29:05 With great pleasure.
00:29:07 The Passover has not been held in grand style
00:29:10 since the days of the Judges.
00:30:18 “Be careful to obey all these words that I am commanding you,
00:30:22 “so that it may always go well with you
00:30:25 “and your sons after you,
00:30:37 “because you are doing what is good and right
00:30:40 in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”

I don’t see it. Are you sure?

No, Father, we live on Mount Zion.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you saying we live on a mountain?

Yes.

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is so special about Mount Zion?

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:53.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me, my dear.

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is where King David lived.

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said:

‘I have put my king upon Zion,

Hamutal, where did we get such studious children?

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like their father.

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:15.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!

Zephaniah, today my little son

found this in a field and brought it home.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re filling the holy city with their filthy idols.

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everywhere I look, I see Baal images

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and smoke on the high places.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The smell of their incense makes me sick!

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been king for 12 years now.

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to act!

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to finish the cleansing work my grandfather started.

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will need Jehovah’s help.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know.

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been praying about it day and night.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will issue a proclamation:

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the word go forth that we will rid this land of idolatry!

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen these cheaper.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take it or leave it.

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You keep raising your prices.

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start here!

00:03:00.993 --> 00:03:02.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we will do to every false god in the land.

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father—

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:37.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, wake up!

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:41.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, come on, this is no time to be sleeping.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:44.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah is on a campaign against all the other gods except Jehovah.

00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah is upending his own kingdom?

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will not go down as easily as they think.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:02.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he think people will give up their customs?

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their rituals? their whole way of life?

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:13.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a fool.

00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal will rescue us.

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal will rescue us?

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, look around!

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All over Judah and Jerusalem,

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah is destroying Baal images.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can’t even rescue themselves!

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the people—

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people are supporting him!

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go ahead and doubt, you disrespectful child.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:49.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have become disloyal to Baal and to me,

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your father, who gave you life.

00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind, I’ll come up with a plan.

00:05:47.242 --> 00:05:50.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lady Hamutal, a word with you, please.

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:52.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A word with you, please!

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben-Mattan!

00:05:58.712 --> 00:06:00.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you want?

00:06:01.506 --> 00:06:06.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, tell the king he must stop what he’s doing.

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:08.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is madness.

00:06:08.305 --> 00:06:11.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s endangering himself,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his family, and our entire nation.

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah’s campaign against Baal worshippers

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a campaign against Baal himself.

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:30.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Ben-Mattan, you and your disgusting idols.

00:06:30.118 --> 00:06:32.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get away from me before I have the guards arrest you.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:33.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forgive me.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I beg you, just another word, please.

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:48.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hamutal, I’m only telling you this for your own safety.

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:53.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be terrible if something were to happen to the king

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like what happened to his father.

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:01.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hamutal,

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of your children.

00:07:16.164 --> 00:07:20.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal worshippers are no match for Jehovah, Hamutal.

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:25.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please don’t be fearful.

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:29.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this campaign has gone on for a year.

00:07:29.678 --> 00:07:32.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long do we have to endure this?

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However long it takes.

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:38.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:41.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Zephaniah the prophet has arrived.

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:42.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He brought someone with him.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:43.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:45.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll see them in the throne room.

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:54.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Better check on the children.

00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please don’t show your concern in front of them.

00:08:20.896 --> 00:08:23.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, have I gone too far?

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My own grandfather didn’t succeed

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:34.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ridding the land of the high places.

00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:37.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I do this?

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:55.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, this is Jeremiah from Anathoth.

00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:59.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man whom Jehovah has called to be a prophet, welcome.

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:00.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Josiah, all the faithful ones

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
support your campaign against idolatry.

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have done as you directed, my lord.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since you began this campaign 18 months ago,

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:10.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have gained many supporters.

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is true.

00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, many have continued worshipping Baal.

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:21.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men like Ben-Mattan pose a great threat.

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people may even resort to violence

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose this great work.

00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:31.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt.

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord,

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you feel that you may not have

00:09:37.472 --> 00:09:40.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it takes to complete such a task?

00:09:43.437 --> 00:09:48.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Restoring pure worship will take much more effort,

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s the right thing to do.

00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:54.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right, Josiah.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re not doing this in human strength;

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is on your side.

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:02.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will give you the courage, wisdom,

00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:05.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strength to complete this work.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I expressed doubt in my own abilities,

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:14.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told me: “Do not say, ‘I am just a boy.’”

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:17.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah spoke to you directly, Jeremiah.

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I be sure that he’ll back me up that way?

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah just told me

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a prophecy given hundreds of years ago,

00:10:26.813 --> 00:10:30.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after King Jeroboam set up his own altar in the northern kingdom.

00:11:11.233 --> 00:11:14.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do not waver in a lack of faith, Josiah.

00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:18.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Become powerful by faith,

00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like our father Abraham.

00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:23.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also spoke to me, Josiah.

00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:26.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:11:26.414 --> 00:11:30.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will wipe out from this place every vestige of Baal,

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:35.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the name of the foreign-god priests along with the priests . . .

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will call to account the princes,

00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:42.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sons of the king, and all those wearing foreign clothing.

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:47.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . Neither their silver nor their gold will . . . save them . . .

00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will bring to nothing all the gods of the earth.”

00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:22.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shaphan, the cleansing campaign has gone well,

00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:26.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the temple is in disrepair.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been neglected for decades.

00:12:29.894 --> 00:12:32.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heartily agree, my lord.

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:34.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go up to Hilkiah, the high priest,

00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let him collect all the silver

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is brought into the house of Jehovah.

00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:41.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give it to those appointed over the work

00:12:41.948 --> 00:12:44.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to repair the damage.

00:12:44.242 --> 00:12:47.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell them to buy timbers and hewn stones.

00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:49.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good, my lord!

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who should keep account of the funds?

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shaphan?

00:12:52.208 --> 00:12:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Joah, no accounting should be required for the silver.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All these men are trustworthy.

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:01.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my lord, as you wish.

00:13:04.262 --> 00:13:08.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day my grandfather died,

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he spoke of the temple.

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:12.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept this safe all these years,

00:13:14.814 --> 00:13:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hoping one day I could glorify Jehovah’s house.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today is that day.

00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:38.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hilkiah! What’s wrong?

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:43.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shaphan, I found the book of the Law in the house of Jehovah.

00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:48.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of the Law?

00:15:50.887 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve never seen these passages before.

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take this scroll to King Josiah immediately.

00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:03.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Materials—as far as that goes,

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are ahead of schedule for the most part.

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are a few items that just haven’t come in yet.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as we get them in the next week or so—

00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:13.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord.

00:16:14.577 --> 00:16:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shaphan!

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:17.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is the renovation coming?

00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your servants are doing everything that was assigned to them.

00:16:20.708 --> 00:16:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have poured out the money

00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was found in the house of Jehovah,

00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have handed it over

00:16:25.922 --> 00:16:28.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the appointed men and to those doing the work.

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very well.

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:35.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there something else?

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:36.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my lord.

00:16:37.308 --> 00:16:40.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a book that Hilkiah the priest has given me.

00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:43.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What book?

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They appear to be the words of Moses, my lord.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read it to us, then!

00:16:53.074 --> 00:16:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These are the regulations

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the judicial decisions that you should be careful to carry out . . .

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:04.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You should completely destroy all the places

“where the nations you will dispossess have served their gods,

“whether on the high mountains

00:17:10.717 --> 00:17:15.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or on the hills or under any luxuriant tree.

00:17:16.764 --> 00:17:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You should pull down their altars,

“shatter their sacred pillars,

“burn their sacred poles in the fire,

“and cut down the graven images of their gods,

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obliterating their very names from that place.”

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:43.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Argh!

00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:53.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go!

00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:56.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you along with Hilkiah,

00:17:56.179 --> 00:17:58.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inquire of Jehovah concerning the words

00:17:58.389 --> 00:17:59.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the book that has been found,

00:17:59.891 --> 00:18:02.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s rage is great

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our forefathers did not carry out the word of Jehovah

00:18:05.271 --> 00:18:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by observing all that is written in this book.

00:18:23.957 --> 00:18:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophetess Huldah lives nearby in the Second Quarter.

00:18:28.002 --> 00:18:31.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll ask Hilkiah to meet us there.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says:

00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:06.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Tell the man who sent you to me:

this is what Jehovah the God of Israel says:

and of everyone who promotes it.

Once we cleanse the land of Judah, we’ll head north again

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:47.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the cities of Samaria.

00:23:52.994 --> 00:23:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forward!

00:25:27.671 --> 00:25:30.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To whom do these graves belong?

00:25:30.966 --> 00:25:34.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They belong to the Baal prophets, my lord.

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:37.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take their bones and burn them

00:25:37.556 --> 00:25:39.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the altar of King Jeroboam.

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward, tear it down.

00:26:00.287 --> 00:26:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the grave over there?

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the grave of the man of the true God

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:06.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who foretold these things

00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:09.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have done against the altar of Bethel.

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:18.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let him rest.

00:26:18.055 --> 00:26:21.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not let anyone disturb his bones.

00:26:21.725 --> 00:26:24.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal, save us! Baal, save us!

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal! Help us!

00:26:27.565 --> 00:26:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal! Baal! Hold it!

00:26:35.906 --> 00:26:37.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal! Baal! Hold it!

00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:39.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal! Help us!

00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:51.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father.

00:27:00.097 --> 00:27:02.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord the king

00:27:03.476 --> 00:27:05.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a pale imitation of his grandfather.

00:27:07.354 --> 00:27:09.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now he’s turned my own son against me.

00:27:09.648 --> 00:27:10.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is not true.

00:27:10.941 --> 00:27:12.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is about standing up for what is right.

00:27:16.405 --> 00:27:18.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Baal is powerless.

00:27:18.407 --> 00:27:20.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t you see that?

00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:24.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Powerless?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:34.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I had sacrificed you in Topheth!

00:27:43.265 --> 00:27:48.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will ever be able to do that again.

00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:53.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josiah made sure of that.

00:28:41.574 --> 00:28:42.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything has finally been accomplished according to the Law.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is one thing left for us to make right.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Command the people to hold a Passover to Jehovah

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as is written in the book of the covenant.

00:28:58.048 --> 00:29:00.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if the people can’t afford the Passover sacrifices?

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:03.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will contribute cattle to the people, and my own flocks.

00:29:05.347 --> 00:29:07.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With great pleasure.

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:10.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Passover has not been held in grand style

00:29:10.853 --> 00:29:13.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the days of the Judges.

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be careful to obey all these words that I am commanding you,

00:30:22.675 --> 00:30:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that it may always go well with you

00:30:25.094 --> 00:30:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your sons after you,

00:30:37.022 --> 00:30:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you are doing what is good and right

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:45.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”

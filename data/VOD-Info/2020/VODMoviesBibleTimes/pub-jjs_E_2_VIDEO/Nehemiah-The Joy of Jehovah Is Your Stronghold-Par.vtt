It was now Tishri, the start of a month-long festival.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had just rebuilt the wall of Jehovah’s great city.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was time to rebuild

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spirituality of his chosen people.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many did not know God’s Law.

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to help us gain understanding

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a man who had come before me—Ezra?

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the regulations and judicial decisions of Jehovah.

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and other Levites read aloud

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Law of Moses.

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They not only read it but they explained it,

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting meaning into it.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a people, we began to understand

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how badly we had disappointed Jehovah

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working on the Sabbath,

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offering lame sacrifices,

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and divorcing our wives to marry foreign women.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:16.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It hurt our hearts, but by reading God’s Law,

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were learning to be Jehovah’s people again.

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:22.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not mourn or weep.

00:01:22.227 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that you know what displeases God,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can do what pleases him.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So go.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eat the choice things, and drink what is sweet,

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send a portion to those who have nothing.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not feel sad,

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed Jehovah’s instructions

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to observe the Festival of Booths.

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent days rejoicing and giving thanks 

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s blessing.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then on the 24th day,

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we assembled to read God’s Law,

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to confess our sins,

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weep over our wrongdoing.

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made a binding agreement in writing.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We resolved to obey Jehovah’s Law.

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some soon forgot their promise.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peleth!

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reham,

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s our rent payment.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put them in a bag.

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basket is hard to carry.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear about Nehemiah’s latest idea?

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You mean the plan to repopulate Jerusalem?

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean his ridiculous proposal to force families

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to move into the city—1 out of 10 by lot.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I heard.

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I had to be one who was chosen.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why me?

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t he care what this does to landholders like me?

00:03:45.913 --> 00:03:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when are you supposed to move?

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move?

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not moving anywhere.

00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:03:58.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t selected.

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not yet, you mean.

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:01.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you are,

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king sent Nehemiah here to rebuild the city.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is the governor.

00:04:16.985 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Governors come, governors go.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king is waiting for Nehemiah to return,

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:23.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when he does, things will get back to normal.

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:25.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when Nehemiah goes back,

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:27.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will still be here.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is his will that Jerusalem be rebuilt.

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you believe that?

00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you would go along with Nehemiah?

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:39.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so ungrateful?

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:47.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your rent!

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that all about?

00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham refuses to move into Jerusalem,

00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants us to support him.

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you say?

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:17.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him Nehemiah is doing Jehovah’s will.

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:20.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham doesn’t understand how happy

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be if-if he would just follow Jehovah’s direction.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we will move if we are selected?

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:39.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d rather be like Nehemiah than like Raham.

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You agree?

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:42.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:44.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me too.

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:53.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the inauguration of the walls,

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we filled Jerusalem with songs of praise 

00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thanksgiving to God.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:07.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our great joy could be heard from far away.

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally returned to the king,

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about that day often.

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:20.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what I know now, I wish I had never left.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah raised up a messenger

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who chronicled the things that happened

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:39.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jerusalem during my absence.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name was Malachi.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:51.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite not being a Jew,

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:53.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still found his way into the temple.

00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He utilized his Jewish family ties

00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take advantage of the other Jews.

00:07:01.817 --> 00:07:03.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What brings you to the temple?

00:07:03.777 --> 00:07:04.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been some time.

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wanted to see you,

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:09.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oh, and to bring you this small gift.

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:14.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, you are always so generous.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:16.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing, really.

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:19.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Umm, is there nothing I can do for you?

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since you asked,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s one little thing you could do.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me. What can I do for you?

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, speaking of family . . .

00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our relatives, yours and mine, I mean,

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:34.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visit from Samaria, it would be so nice

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:36.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a place to eat with them.

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, right here in the temple, that is.

00:07:40.105 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, they worship Jehovah too—often.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:46.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, well, sometimes.

00:07:46.987 --> 00:07:49.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A room in the temple?

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:51.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know I can’t do that.

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is, all the rooms are in use.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:58.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them?

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:00.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t some of them just storerooms?

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:03.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those are provisions for the Levites.

00:08:03.337 --> 00:08:07.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can’t you clear one out for me? just one?

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:08.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only need one.

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will Nehemiah say?

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What difference does it make?

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:08:17.726 --> 00:08:19.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if he finds out?

00:08:19.478 --> 00:08:21.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is going to tell him?

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:23.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to tell him?

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:24.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no!

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:25.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why worry?

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:42.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once again our high priest has given in to Tobiah.

00:08:44.753 --> 00:08:46.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where should I put this grain?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s room here.

00:08:47.714 --> 00:08:49.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful! I’ve got it.

00:08:51.843 --> 00:08:53.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look who’s coming.

00:08:58.308 --> 00:08:59.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you hurry, please?

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:02.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once they get out of our way, let’s, uh,

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:05.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s set the table here and then the chairs 

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:07.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kind of along the wall.

00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:09.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, tell me, please,

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:11.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where should we store our provisions now?

00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever you want.

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s your problem.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now move along,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like now, please.

00:09:18.286 --> 00:09:21.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, so we’ll unload here,

00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:23.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then like I said, chairs there, table here.

00:09:25.877 --> 00:09:29.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could Eliashib let anyone,

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let alone a man like Tobiah,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take over a room for his own use

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:35.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after all that Nehemiah did

00:09:35.387 --> 00:09:37.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preserve the sacredness of the temple?

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:40.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most people don’t give tithes anymore anyway.

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:42.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to eat,

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:44.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to go tend our own flocks and fields.

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of no value to serve God.

00:09:47.524 --> 00:09:49.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, brothers!

00:09:49.693 --> 00:09:52.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t let their wrong acts take away our joy.

00:09:52.696 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:55.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have we benefited from serving Jehovah?

00:09:55.907 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes. And doesn’t the scripture say:

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take good care of your sheep”?

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also says:

00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:06.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings.”

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:09.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must wait on Jehovah.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, he will straighten everything out.

00:10:15.177 --> 00:10:17.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi saw how far the people had fallen.

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:20.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Levites,

00:10:20.223 --> 00:10:23.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once the proud keepers of Jehovah’s standards,

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now found themselves questioning

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:26.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the value of their own service.

00:10:53.965 --> 00:10:55.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young man!

00:10:56.718 --> 00:10:57.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not offer a sheep?

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:01.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bigger the offering,

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the bigger the blessings.

00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:05.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides,

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:08.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know it’s more impressive to the neighbors, huh?

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:12.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I already have an offering.

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:14.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, yes, but look!

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:16.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You seem like a nice man.

00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:19.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So today, for you, a special price—huh?—

00:11:19.908 --> 00:11:22.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hardly more than you paid for these doves.

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:23.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come take a look.

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:27.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sheep is blind!

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at how it walks!

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:32.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young man, that’s absolutely normal for this breed.

00:11:32.587 --> 00:11:36.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says not to offer blind, lame, or sick animals.

00:11:38.343 --> 00:11:40.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If ever I can afford to offer a sheep, it’ll be a sound one.

00:11:40.887 --> 00:11:42.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste your money!

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s a fine sheep at a fine price.

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:45.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:47.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be practical!

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it’s only a tradition.

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:50.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bah!

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:54.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Temple services are not the same.

00:11:55.944 --> 00:11:58.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if they don’t even think about Jehovah.

00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:04.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azubah!

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong?

00:12:08.665 --> 00:12:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azubah, what happened?

00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:14.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s Raham?

00:12:23.179 --> 00:12:24.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A certificate of divorce?

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to be a good wife,

00:12:30.437 --> 00:12:32.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t enough.

00:12:35.692 --> 00:12:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham sent me away.

00:12:37.485 --> 00:12:38.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t fear, Azubah.

00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:41.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can live here with us.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can all share.

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:46.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, God!

00:12:46.286 --> 00:12:47.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all my fault.

00:12:47.912 --> 00:12:49.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You mustn’t think that way.

00:12:50.707 --> 00:12:53.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t give him children.

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:56.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With or without children,

00:12:56.129 --> 00:12:58.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
marriage is sacred.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:03.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will never send you away.

00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:10.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:37.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:41.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a visitor last night.

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:45.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was your wife,

00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or should I say your former wife.

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you care how you’ve hurt your innocent mate?

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be so hard-hearted?

00:13:57.732 --> 00:13:59.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look! Moses said if you find something

00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:02.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indecent with your wife, a man must write 

00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:04.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certificate of divorce, hand it to her,

00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dismiss her.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If giving me no children isn’t indecent, then what is?

00:14:09.577 --> 00:14:11.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m tired of living with her.

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:13.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m marrying Gizla today.

00:14:13.373 --> 00:14:15.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gizla?

00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:17.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That Moabite girl?

00:14:18.545 --> 00:14:20.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you bind yourself with an oath and a curse

00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:22.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to take a wife from the nations!

00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:25.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Law says: “They will turn your sons away

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:27.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from following me to serve other gods;

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah’s anger will blaze against you”!

00:14:30.473 --> 00:14:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are you to counsel me?

00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:34.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find his own joy,

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:37.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I intend to find mine.

00:14:37.105 --> 00:14:41.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, only Jehovah can give true joy.

00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:43.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really think you can give

00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:44.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yourself more joy than he can?

00:15:06.843 --> 00:15:08.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah,

00:15:08.386 --> 00:15:12.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do we treat each other so treacherously,

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
profaning your covenant?

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi!

00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:33.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say to the priests who are despising my name:

00:15:33.244 --> 00:15:37.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A son honors a father, and a servant his master.

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:42.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So if I am a father, where is the honor due me?

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I am a master, where is the fear due me?”

00:15:58.895 --> 00:15:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My good man!

00:16:01.606 --> 00:16:03.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My good man, I see you have no offering.

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:31.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you Levites despised Jehovah’s name?

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despised it?

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:34.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:16:34.514 --> 00:16:38.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You present a blind, lame, or sick animal

00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:41.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a sacrifice and say that it is nothing bad.

00:16:41.187 --> 00:16:43.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should Jehovah accept it from your hand?

00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:45.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the meat is in our pot,

00:16:45.066 --> 00:16:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no one can tell if it was lame or sound.

00:16:47.902 --> 00:16:50.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Jehovah? Can he tell the difference?

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:53.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day Jehovah will come to his temple.

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will cleanse you sons of Levi by fire.

00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi, what’s gotten into you?

00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:00.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should you complain

00:17:00.373 --> 00:17:02.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:18:08.691 --> 00:18:10.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So guard yourselves respecting your spirit,

00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not deal treacherously

00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the wife of your youth.

00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:20.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For I hate divorce,’ says Jehovah the God of Israel.”

00:18:20.203 --> 00:18:23.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lips of a priest should safeguard knowledge,

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:26.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people should seek the law from his mouth.

00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:28.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you,

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have made many stumble.

00:18:39.555 --> 00:18:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s message revealed that the problem

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was in their hearts.

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of that,

00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi sought out those who found joy

00:18:49.649 --> 00:18:51.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing what was right.

00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:02.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peleth.

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malachi.

00:19:04.247 --> 00:19:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are you?

00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:07.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azubah,

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t despair.

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will see the distinction

00:19:11.045 --> 00:19:13.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the righteous and the wicked,

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:16.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between one who serves God

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one who doesn’t.

00:19:18.177 --> 00:19:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must be a prophet.

00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:21.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I serve Jehovah as you do.

00:19:21.389 --> 00:19:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can tell you that when you speak with one another

00:19:24.434 --> 00:19:27.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah, he pays attention.

00:19:28.187 --> 00:19:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A book is written before him of those

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who fear him and meditate on his name.

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:39.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah be with you.

00:19:53.463 --> 00:19:56.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, I was away from Jerusalem,

00:19:57.717 --> 00:20:00.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my heart was always with my people.

00:20:00.762 --> 00:20:02.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I requested to return to them.

00:20:04.682 --> 00:20:07.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I found shocked me.

00:20:07.268 --> 00:20:08.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib!

00:20:09.896 --> 00:20:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

00:20:11.814 --> 00:20:13.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah!

00:20:13.274 --> 00:20:15.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t expecting . . .

00:20:15.693 --> 00:20:17.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are all the Levites and the singers?

00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:20.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are away right now.

00:20:20.406 --> 00:20:21.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Away?

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:23.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are they away?

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah is here!

00:20:26.662 --> 00:20:27.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah,

00:20:27.413 --> 00:20:30.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show Governor Nehemiah around.

00:20:33.628 --> 00:20:35.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excuse me, please.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:37.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:20:43.304 --> 00:20:44.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah,

00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:46.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell me about the temple services.

00:20:46.808 --> 00:20:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have all the provisions that you need?

00:20:49.018 --> 00:20:50.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Governor Nehemiah,

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have nearly no provisions at all.

00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:52.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can that be?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a long time, the priests and the Levites

00:20:54.774 --> 00:20:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not taken their duties seriously.

00:20:56.984 --> 00:20:58.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the people saw that,

00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:00.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they stopped bringing in tithes.

00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:02.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the tithes,

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most Levites and singers returned to their fields.

00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you not returned?

00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:10.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, I’m getting by.

00:21:10.581 --> 00:21:12.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always believed that Jehovah helps

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:13.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who trust in him.

00:21:14.877 --> 00:21:17.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know he will correct things in his time.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Eliashib not tell the people to bring your provisions?

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:22.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your absence,

00:21:22.885 --> 00:21:25.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Malachi warned him and all the priests.

00:21:27.014 --> 00:21:29.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Eliashib—

00:21:29.183 --> 00:21:32.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took our storeroom and emptied it of our provisions.

00:21:32.687 --> 00:21:35.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave it to Tobiah to use as a dining hall.

00:21:48.202 --> 00:21:50.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah, help us get rid of these things.

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:58.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib!

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have you been doing?

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you and the deputy rulers

00:22:05.928 --> 00:22:07.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neglected the house of God?

00:22:07.555 --> 00:22:08.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah.

00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and they,

00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:10.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please cleanse this room

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replace the utensils.

00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:12.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my lord.

00:22:12.727 --> 00:22:13.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gather all the Levites,

00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the singers, and the deputy rulers to me.

00:22:15.354 --> 00:22:17.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m assigning them all back to their posts.

00:22:17.982 --> 00:22:21.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pedaiah, I’m placing you, Shelemiah,

00:22:21.277 --> 00:22:22.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zadok in charge of the storerooms.

00:22:22.737 --> 00:22:24.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanan will be your assistant.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your responsibility

00:22:25.698 --> 00:22:27.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distribute provisions to your brothers.

00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:28.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah,

00:22:28.826 --> 00:22:30.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wait-wait a second.

00:22:30.328 --> 00:22:31.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me explain this.

00:22:31.412 --> 00:22:33.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I will tell all Judah

00:22:33.247 --> 00:22:35.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring in the tenth of the grain,

00:22:35.416 --> 00:22:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new wine, and the oil.

00:22:37.627 --> 00:22:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can explain this.

00:22:40.213 --> 00:22:42.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no, wait.

00:22:54.268 --> 00:22:56.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do remember me, O my God,

00:22:57.855 --> 00:23:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not wipe out my acts of loyal love

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the house of my God.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only had they neglected Jehovah’s house

00:23:11.827 --> 00:23:13.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of the Jews

00:23:13.246 --> 00:23:15.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continued to conduct business on the Sabbath

00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:19.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a day Jehovah had declared as holy.

00:23:22.797 --> 00:23:24.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you selling today?

00:23:24.215 --> 00:23:27.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the best quality fish from Tyre.

00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:30.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:33.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you not care that this is the Sabbath?

00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:34.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah.

00:23:38.271 --> 00:23:40.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is this evil thing you’re doing?

00:23:40.815 --> 00:23:42.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why God brought disaster on this city!

00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people think it’s acceptable now.

00:23:44.443 --> 00:23:45.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah think?

00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:49.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped the buying and selling

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ordered the doors closed

00:23:51.492 --> 00:23:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to keep the Sabbath day holy.

00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:05.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the following week, the merchants tried again.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:08.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the meaning of this?

00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:10.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to sleep on the ground last night.

00:24:11.846 --> 00:24:15.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know God’s Law: No work, 

00:24:15.141 --> 00:24:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no business on the Sabbath!

00:24:17.184 --> 00:24:18.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go!

00:24:18.144 --> 00:24:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and all the Levites, guard the gates 

00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:21.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep the Sabbath holy.

00:24:21.939 --> 00:24:23.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let anyone in!

00:24:32.283 --> 00:24:36.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, too, remember to my credit, O my God,

00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show me pity 

00:24:38.748 --> 00:24:41.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your abundant loyal love.

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:48.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was another thing that I had to do.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come along.

00:24:49.342 --> 00:24:51.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Ana la mitbayen.</i>

00:24:51.969 --> 00:24:54.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here!

00:24:54.013 --> 00:24:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to listen to me. I’m your father!

00:24:55.765 --> 00:24:57.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with your children?

00:24:58.684 --> 00:25:01.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t like coming to the temple.

00:25:01.187 --> 00:25:05.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sweetie, why don’t you like it?

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:06.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Shvok Y-ati!</i>

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:08.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back here now!

00:25:13.074 --> 00:25:15.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry, my lord.

00:25:15.076 --> 00:25:17.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife speaks very little Hebrew.

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:25:21.248 --> 00:25:22.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:25:22.708 --> 00:25:24.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, nobody cares.

00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:27.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not?

00:25:27.213 --> 00:25:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Yes!

00:25:28.297 --> 00:25:30.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:32.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:33.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me go!

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:36.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder your children don’t love Jehovah.

00:25:36.263 --> 00:25:37.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aah!

00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:38.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you imagine that you could succeed

00:25:38.974 --> 00:25:40.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without Jehovah’s blessing?

00:25:40.976 --> 00:25:42.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for Jehovah’s blessing!

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:43.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you?

00:25:43.229 --> 00:25:45.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you didn’t obey him.

00:25:45.189 --> 00:25:48.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, how can Jehovah bless something 

00:25:48.442 --> 00:25:50.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is against his will?

00:25:53.155 --> 00:25:55.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was I surprised?

00:25:55.366 --> 00:25:56.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people were just following

00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:59.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the bad example of those taking the lead.

00:26:00.913 --> 00:26:02.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eliashib’s grandson married a Horonite,

00:26:02.957 --> 00:26:05.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the daughter of Sanballat.

00:26:15.177 --> 00:26:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you no respect for God’s Law?

00:26:19.557 --> 00:26:21.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should not give your daughters to their sons

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:24.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or accept any of their daughters for your sons

00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:27.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or yourselves!

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it not because of these that King Solomon sinned?

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:36.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Grandfather, say something.

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be still, my son.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it not something unheard of

00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:42.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to commit this great evil

00:26:42.955 --> 00:26:44.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by marrying foreign women?

00:26:49.086 --> 00:26:51.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have defiled the priesthood!

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not serve as a priest or remain in Jerusalem.

00:27:00.973 --> 00:27:02.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine.

00:27:02.391 --> 00:27:04.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go to Samaria.

00:27:04.852 --> 00:27:06.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re more tolerant there.

00:27:10.816 --> 00:27:13.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he’s my grandson.

00:27:13.152 --> 00:27:15.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why did you allow him

00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:17.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to disregard Jehovah’s laws?

00:27:19.283 --> 00:27:22.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know our temple services

00:27:22.495 --> 00:27:24.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are what preserve our relationship with God!

00:27:26.332 --> 00:27:28.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as I left,

00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of you,

00:27:31.962 --> 00:27:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you let it fall apart.

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:50.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time, but true worship was restored.

00:28:04.578 --> 00:28:06.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look back on all

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:08.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah enabled us to do

00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:15.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the opposition we faced, . . .

00:28:15.214 --> 00:28:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend

00:28:16.966 --> 00:28:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we turn the accusation of sedition

00:28:19.134 --> 00:28:21.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Nehemiah.

00:28:21.262 --> 00:28:23.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next sound they hear

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be our battle cry.

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:30.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the bad influences we avoided, . . .

00:28:30.854 --> 00:28:33.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose, and so do you.

00:28:33.148 --> 00:28:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need you to join me in refusing to move.

00:28:35.317 --> 00:28:36.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste your money!

00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:37.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be practical!

00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:39.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it’s only a tradition.

00:28:39.738 --> 00:28:41.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to eat,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to go tend our own flocks and fields.

00:28:43.367 --> 00:28:45.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of no value to serve God.

00:28:45.411 --> 00:28:48.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the sleepless nights, . . .

00:28:48.414 --> 00:28:51.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:52.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you see? These people hate what we’re doing.

00:28:52.459 --> 00:28:53.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hate us.

00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:56.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to live and work around them like we do.

00:28:56.046 --> 00:28:57.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the sweat and toil, . . .

00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:00.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re worn out.

00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:29:04.722 --> 00:29:06.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . I just remember the joy we felt

00:29:08.225 --> 00:29:10.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we were serving Jehovah the right way.

00:29:12.688 --> 00:29:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought we were just working on a wall,

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah was rebuilding our faith.

00:29:28.454 --> 00:29:31.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never forget how Jehovah

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought us together to accomplish his will.

00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:39.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He taught us to rely on him,

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:44.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he strengthened us.

00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:47.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eat the choice things, and drink what is sweet,

00:29:47.806 --> 00:29:50.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send a portion to those who have nothing.

00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:52.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not feel sad,

00:29:52.686 --> 00:29:55.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:10.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do remember me favorably, O my God.

00:30:22.883 --> 00:30:25.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah was a man of courage.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have stayed in the luxurious palace

00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:31.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Shushan and served Jehovah from there.

00:30:31.517 --> 00:30:32.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t.

00:30:32.726 --> 00:30:34.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a need arose,

00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:37.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was ready to make the long journey

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jerusalem to support his brothers.

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:42.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wouldn’t be easy.

00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:46.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he had to ask the king of Persia to let him go.

00:30:46.198 --> 00:30:48.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Nehemiah

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he rely on his personality

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:56.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or his good record with the king?

00:30:56.417 --> 00:30:58.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch this part again.

00:31:00.254 --> 00:31:03.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The place where my forefathers are buried lies in ruins,

00:31:03.465 --> 00:31:05.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been consumed by fire.

00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:07.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:31:07.553 --> 00:31:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speak frankly.

00:31:09.012 --> 00:31:10.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you seeking?

00:31:12.307 --> 00:31:16.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it pleases the king

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:26.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if your servant has found favor with you,

00:31:26.822 --> 00:31:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send me to Judah,

00:31:28.824 --> 00:31:31.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the city where my forefathers are buried,

00:31:31.118 --> 00:31:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let me rebuild it.

00:31:39.585 --> 00:31:40.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may go.

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:43.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with us.

00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:51.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah immediately and humbly prayed to Jehovah,

00:31:51.472 --> 00:31:53.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the true Source of courage.

00:31:53.432 --> 00:31:55.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he prayed repeatedly

00:31:55.976 --> 00:31:58.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout his assignment,

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah blessed his efforts.

00:32:01.148 --> 00:32:04.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So lesson number one for us today:

00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:05.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When times are hard,

00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:08.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be quick to lean on Jehovah.

00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:10.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if things are going well?

00:32:10.866 --> 00:32:13.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still reliant on Jehovah?

00:32:13.494 --> 00:32:15.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or might we find ourselves

00:32:15.954 --> 00:32:19.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becoming complacent, perhaps even saying:

00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Things are good in my life now.

00:32:22.711 --> 00:32:25.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know there’s a need to get to work,

00:32:25.756 --> 00:32:29.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I’ve been serving Jehovah for many years now.

00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:32.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ve done my part.

00:32:32.054 --> 00:32:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let someone else do it”?

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:37.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah bless such an attitude?

00:32:37.684 --> 00:32:41.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be better to turn to Jehovah in prayer,

00:32:41.772 --> 00:32:45.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him to give you the courage and joy

00:32:45.776 --> 00:32:50.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to reach out in your service to him?

00:32:50.364 --> 00:32:53.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just might be surprised

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the doors Jehovah opens for you.

00:32:57.996 --> 00:33:01.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, once Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem,

00:33:01.124 --> 00:33:04.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t just give orders, did he?

00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:07.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that he daily worked

00:33:07.673 --> 00:33:09.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
alongside his fellow Israelites

00:33:09.508 --> 00:33:11.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the break of dawn

00:33:11.343 --> 00:33:15.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the stars came out.”

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we show a self-sacrificing spirit,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give us the energy needed

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:25.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out the task at hand.

00:33:25.983 --> 00:33:28.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Israelites completed

00:33:28.861 --> 00:33:31.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wall-building project in just 52 days!

00:33:31.738 --> 00:33:34.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing feat,

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:38.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the face of continual opposition!

00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:43.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it came in the form of mocking.

00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:45.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the opposers threatened to attack!

00:33:46.962 --> 00:33:49.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were Samaritans in the north,

00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:53.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ammonites in the east, Arabs in the south,

00:33:53.594 --> 00:33:56.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ashdodites in the west.

00:33:56.221 --> 00:34:00.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem was surrounded by enemies.

00:34:00.267 --> 00:34:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could have been easy to feel trapped

00:34:02.352 --> 00:34:04.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give in to fear.

00:34:04.479 --> 00:34:06.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Nehemiah do?

00:34:06.398 --> 00:34:08.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was his pattern?

00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:11.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his own words, he says:

00:34:11.486 --> 00:34:14.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We prayed to our God.”

00:34:14.948 --> 00:34:18.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Nehemiah strengthened the people

00:34:18.452 --> 00:34:19.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling them:

00:34:19.786 --> 00:34:23.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid of them.

00:34:23.457 --> 00:34:28.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember Jehovah, who is great and awe-inspiring.”

00:34:28.086 --> 00:34:30.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they kept building.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Nehemiah’s enemies

00:34:32.382 --> 00:34:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
realized that their open threats had failed,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did they give up?

00:34:37.804 --> 00:34:38.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:34:38.555 --> 00:34:42.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They now turned to other forms of opposition.

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:46.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they tried three different schemes

00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sidetrack Nehemiah from the work.

00:34:49.358 --> 00:34:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice them?

00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:53.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the video again.

00:34:55.238 --> 00:34:58.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked to meet Nehemiah halfway.

00:35:01.954 --> 00:35:03.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell this to Nehemiah:

00:35:05.207 --> 00:35:06.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come,

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:08.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let us set a time to meet together

00:35:08.835 --> 00:35:10.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Valley Plain of Ono.”

00:35:10.963 --> 00:35:12.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to lure me away

00:35:12.631 --> 00:35:14.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jerusalem to do me harm.

00:35:17.469 --> 00:35:19.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spread false rumors.

00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:24.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, it’s time to implement your plan.

00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:27.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah, write this down:

00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:31.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Among the nations it has been heard,

00:35:31.149 --> 00:35:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Geshem is also saying it,

00:35:34.403 --> 00:35:37.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you and the Jews

00:35:37.906 --> 00:35:40.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are scheming to rebel.

00:35:40.158 --> 00:35:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why you are building the wall.”

00:35:44.287 --> 00:35:49.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they used a traitor to try and trick Nehemiah.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:52.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re coming to kill you—by night!

00:35:52.087 --> 00:35:54.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go into the temple

00:35:54.047 --> 00:35:55.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and close the doors.

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:57.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah,

00:35:57.342 --> 00:35:59.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should a man like me run away?

00:35:59.511 --> 00:36:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t understand.

00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:36:04.224 --> 00:36:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the only safe place.

00:36:06.643 --> 00:36:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m not a priest.

00:36:08.645 --> 00:36:10.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I entered the temple,

00:36:10.564 --> 00:36:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:36:12.315 --> 00:36:14.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not go in.

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:17.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:36:23.243 --> 00:36:24.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see!

00:36:24.953 --> 00:36:28.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah and Sanballat put you up to this,

00:36:28.874 --> 00:36:31.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t they, you hypocrite?

00:36:31.001 --> 00:36:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah remember them

00:36:32.919 --> 00:36:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you false prophets

00:36:34.504 --> 00:36:36.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who keep trying to frighten me.

00:36:36.131 --> 00:36:38.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, Hanani,

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have work to do.

00:36:44.014 --> 00:36:47.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three schemes, three failures

00:36:47.642 --> 00:36:50.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so lesson number two:

00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:54.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Nehemiah, we might encounter opposers

00:36:54.733 --> 00:36:58.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who scheme to bring our loyal service to a halt.

00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:03.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may invite us to meet them halfway, so to speak.

00:37:03.575 --> 00:37:06.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may try to convince us that if we serve Jehovah

00:37:06.912 --> 00:37:08.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with just a little less zeal,

00:37:08.872 --> 00:37:11.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could pursue

00:37:11.208 --> 00:37:14.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worldly goals at the same time.

00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:16.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because God’s Kingdom

00:37:16.004 --> 00:37:18.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes first in our lives,

00:37:18.215 --> 00:37:22.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be like Nehemiah and refuse to compromise.

00:37:22.469 --> 00:37:25.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know where this world is headed.

00:37:27.474 --> 00:37:31.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opposers also spread false accusations against us.

00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:33.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands, we’re accused

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of posing a threat to the State.

00:37:35.732 --> 00:37:38.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some accusations have been successfully

00:37:38.193 --> 00:37:39.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rebutted in court.

00:37:39.945 --> 00:37:41.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever the outcome,

00:37:41.863 --> 00:37:45.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re confident that Jehovah will direct matters

00:37:45.075 --> 00:37:47.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to his will.

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:50.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Opposition may also come from those

00:37:50.914 --> 00:37:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who pretend to serve Jehovah.

00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:57.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a fellow Jew tried to get Nehemiah

00:37:57.379 --> 00:37:59.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to break God’s Law to save his life,

00:37:59.214 --> 00:38:02.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so former Witnesses may try

00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:06.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get us to compromise in one way or another.

00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:10.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we reject apostates because we know

00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:13.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our lives are saved,

00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:17.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by breaking God’s laws, but by keeping them.

00:38:19.025 --> 00:38:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time, Nehemiah refused to fall into their trap.

00:38:22.904 --> 00:38:24.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:38:24.364 --> 00:38:26.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he had a brilliant mind?

00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:31.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because he relied on Jehovah,

00:38:31.037 --> 00:38:35.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave him the insight needed

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:38.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see through their deceptions.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the wall was built,

00:38:40.505 --> 00:38:43.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah left Jerusalem for a while.

00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:46.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did he find on his return?

00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:50.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of coming back to find true worship thriving,

00:38:50.849 --> 00:38:54.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he found it barely surviving.

00:38:54.227 --> 00:38:57.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the work that he had done

00:38:57.022 --> 00:39:00.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the people to trust in Jehovah

00:39:00.525 --> 00:39:03.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how do you think he felt?

00:39:03.111 --> 00:39:05.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have said: “That’s it!

00:39:05.947 --> 00:39:07.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m out!

00:39:07.574 --> 00:39:11.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let someone else clean this up,” and walked away.

00:39:11.494 --> 00:39:12.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did he?

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:14.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch again.

00:39:14.789 --> 00:39:16.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you and the deputy rulers

00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:18.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neglected the house of God?

00:39:18.126 --> 00:39:20.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and they, please cleanse this room.

00:39:20.879 --> 00:39:23.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know God’s Law:

00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No work, no business

00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:27.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Sabbath!

00:39:27.052 --> 00:39:28.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go!

00:39:28.345 --> 00:39:31.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not swear never to marry someone

00:39:31.264 --> 00:39:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who doesn’t serve Jehovah?

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why have you ignored the command of Jehovah

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your own oath?

00:39:38.605 --> 00:39:42.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Eliashib’s grandson married a Horonite,

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:44.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the daughter of Sanballat.

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:50.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should not give your daughters to their sons

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or accept any of their daughters for your sons!

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:54.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have defiled the priesthood!

00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:56.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not serve as a priest

00:39:56.581 --> 00:39:58.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or remain in Jerusalem.

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time

00:40:01.711 --> 00:40:05.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but true worship was restored.

00:40:10.595 --> 00:40:13.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah didn’t walk away, did he?

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he persevered in his assignment.

00:40:16.643 --> 00:40:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:40:17.727 --> 00:40:21.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he held on to his joy.

00:40:21.106 --> 00:40:24.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, his main source of joy came,

00:40:24.859 --> 00:40:27.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not from his accomplishments,

00:40:27.904 --> 00:40:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not from the security of walls,

00:40:30.573 --> 00:40:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even from what others were doing.

00:40:33.576 --> 00:40:36.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From where does true joy come?

00:40:36.955 --> 00:40:39.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah himself told us:

00:40:39.833 --> 00:40:44.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:47.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is lesson number three for us:

00:40:47.966 --> 00:40:50.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite challenges and setbacks,

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:53.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be joyful because true joy comes

00:40:53.888 --> 00:40:57.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a good relationship with Jehovah.

00:40:57.309 --> 00:41:00.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah was a man like you and me.

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:03.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, he didn’t have Jehovah’s power

00:41:03.898 --> 00:41:05.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
displayed supernaturally to him

00:41:05.942 --> 00:41:08.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Moses and Joshua did.

00:41:08.236 --> 00:41:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did he have?

00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:14.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had prayer, he had faith,

00:41:14.576 --> 00:41:17.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had trust.

00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:19.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those were his tools.

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:22.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is no doubt that Jehovah

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was active on behalf of Nehemiah,

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:27.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guiding and blessing his efforts.

00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:31.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have those same tools today.

00:41:31.009 --> 00:41:34.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah, put faith in him,

00:41:34.804 --> 00:41:38.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust that he will bless your self-sacrificing efforts.

00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:41.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah gave Nehemiah 

00:41:41.311 --> 00:41:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the courage, the energy, the insight, 

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:48.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the perseverance to carry out his assignment,

00:41:48.068 --> 00:41:50.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll do the same for you.

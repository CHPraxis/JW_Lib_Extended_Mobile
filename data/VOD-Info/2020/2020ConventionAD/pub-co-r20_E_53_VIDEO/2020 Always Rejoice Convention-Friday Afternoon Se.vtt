00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you enjoy
examining Jehovah’s creations.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can creation teach us
about Jehovah and about finding joy?

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we apply what we learn?

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take note of the lessons
in the upcoming six-part symposium.

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:52.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will deliver the first talk, entitled

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah
Wants Us to Rejoice

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Exquisite Flowers.”

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:10.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you convinced
that Jehovah wants you to rejoice?

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many reasons to believe that.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Creation is one such proof.

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the beginning, the Bible teaches
that Jehovah worked very hard

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our home a delightful place
to live here on planet Earth.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:28.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This included his creating millions

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:31.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of different species of plants and animals.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he finished
with all this amazing activity,

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know what our Creator did next?

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the sixth creative day,

00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:45.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us at Genesis 1:31:

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:47.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God saw everything he had made,

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:51.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look! it was very good.”

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about that.

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:58.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After working hard over perhaps
the course of thousands of years,

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:02.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Father paused, he inspected everything,

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he rejoiced in all that he had made.

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
the beauty and wisdom in creation

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:17.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that our heavenly Father
wants us to enjoy life on planet Earth.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he wants us to join him in rejoicing

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:24.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over all that he has made.

00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:26.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we do that?

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:31.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible gives us a clue at Psalm 111:2.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you, please, to open your Bible

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:38.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read along with all of us—Psalm 111:2.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The works of Jehovah are great;

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:49.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are studied by all those
finding pleasure in them.”

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:53.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see clearly in the Bible
that Jehovah invites us 

00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:58.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look closely at the things
he has made so that we can learn from them.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doing so is a delightful experience.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that together.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:06.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will examine six of Jehovah’s many works

00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:14.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our God-given ability to enjoy them all.

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:19.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll focus our attention
on exquisite flowers.

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:22.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, our next speaker
will talk about one of our favorite things

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—delicious food.

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we will discuss beautiful colors,

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:30.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our well-designed bodies,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delightful sounds and,
lastly, fascinating animals.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk in this series

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also teach us
Scriptural lessons from creation

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us rejoice in life

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even now in these difficult last days.

00:03:46.206 --> 00:03:48.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, are you as ready as I am?

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by looking closely
at exquisite flowers.

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:54.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:58.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to look
for the answers to these three questions:

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:02.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, how many species
of flowering plants are there?

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, what practical needs
do flowers serve?

00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:10.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, how can flowers help us

00:04:10.355 --> 00:04:12.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we get anxious?

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the video.

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth has more than 350,000 species

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:24.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flowering plants.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:37.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:41.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:46.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pollination produces nutritious seeds,

00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:49.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fruits, and vegetables.

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:55.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beautiful flower we see
may look like this to a bee.

00:04:55.734 --> 00:04:59.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light

00:04:59.154 --> 00:05:02.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that create a hard-to-miss target.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy more than
the flower’s beauty and aroma.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, some plants do not need
beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers, pollen,

00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:19.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nectar, and aromas

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:22.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are costly for plants to produce.

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those resources could be used
for other purposes.

00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:32.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, plants make flowers
in breathtaking abundance.

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:51.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings us joy

00:05:51.707 --> 00:05:54.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reminds us
to trust him when we are anxious.

00:05:57.588 --> 00:05:58.672 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Take a lesson

00:05:58.672 --> 00:06:00.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“from the lilies of the field,

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:02.760 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“how they grow;

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.428 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“they do not toil,

00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:05.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“nor do they spin;

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“but . . . not even Solomon

00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:09.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“in all his glory

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:12.353 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was arrayed as one of these.”

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that video stir within you a desire

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to know Jehovah’s creative works
even better?

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:29.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah designed us
to enjoy the beauty of flowers

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their lovely fragrances.

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine trying to study

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:39.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all 350,000 species of flowering plants

00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:42.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—admiring their beauty, smelling them,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even making a drawing
or taking a photo of each one?

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, if you started today
and spent a little time every day

00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:54.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting to know a different flower,

00:06:54.687 --> 00:06:59.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your study project
would take a little over 958 years.

00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:03.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good thing
we’re going to live forever, isn’t it?

00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:07.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in addition
to seeing the beauty in flowers,

00:07:07.658 --> 00:07:09.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we’ve learned in the video,

00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:13.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flowers play
an important role in our ecosystem.

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:16.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce

00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:21.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nectar for creatures like the bees
that spread pollen.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn,
pollination produces nutritious seeds,

00:07:24.425 --> 00:07:26.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fruits, and vegetables.

00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the flowers, we have food to eat.

00:07:30.473 --> 00:07:33.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we marvel at the ingenious design

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:37.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s evident in all things in creation!

00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people today enjoy looking at creation,

00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:44.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but few realize that when they do so,

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re actually getting
a glimpse into the mind and heart

00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:51.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our loving Creator, Jehovah.

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:54.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not true of us, though
—is it?—

00:07:54.414 --> 00:07:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know who Jehovah is.

00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we carefully observe
all of the things he has made,

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we naturally think of him

00:08:02.172 --> 00:08:06.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are drawn closer to him
and to his beautiful qualities.

00:08:06.843 --> 00:08:10.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point in life, the faithful man Job

00:08:10.054 --> 00:08:12.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was reminded by his friend Elihu

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “stop and consider carefully
the wonderful works of God.”

00:08:18.271 --> 00:08:20.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how that advice helped Job?

00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:22.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Job learned,

00:08:22.776 --> 00:08:26.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy increases
when we’re focused on Jehovah

00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:30.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on his works instead of on ourselves.

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:35.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents and young ones,
this is a good lesson for all of us.

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:40.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following the advice given to Job
can also draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better that is than spending time

00:08:43.213 --> 00:08:47.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with much of the world’s entertainment
that is debased!

00:08:47.467 --> 00:08:50.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such prepackaged entertainment
is often designed

00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:54.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to turn us away from Jehovah,
not draw us closer to him.

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:58.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about spending time
observing Jehovah’s works?

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:03.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a wholesome pastime
with a future.

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:08.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Observing flowers
may also bring to our mind another lesson,

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:11.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that Jesus taught.

00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:14.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible again
to Matthew chapter 6,

00:09:14.619 --> 00:09:18.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read together verses 28-30.

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:21.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the reading, look for the answer
to the following question:

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:09:26.173 --> 00:09:30.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Matthew 6:28-30.

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:32.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:36.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:40.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,
how they grow;

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they do not toil, nor do they spin;

00:09:43.106 --> 00:09:46.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I tell you
that not even Solomon in all his glory

00:09:46.944 --> 00:09:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was arrayed as one of these.

00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:52.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if this is how God clothes
the vegetation of the field

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is here today and tomorrow
is thrown into the oven,

00:09:55.786 --> 00:10:00.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will he not much rather clothe you,
you with little faith?”

00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How heartwarming!

00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:06.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been anxious
about food and clothing?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you’re not alone.

00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:11.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among those listening
to Jesus on this occasion

00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:15.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were many poor people
who had the same natural concerns.

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:17.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus encouraged them.

00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:19.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:23.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By reminding them
to take a lesson from the flowers.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:26.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew what we know:

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:29.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way

00:10:29.153 --> 00:10:32.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings us joy and reminds us

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trust Him when we are anxious.

00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:39.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see how well
Jehovah takes care of all the flowers,

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re reminded of how generous he is

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of his loving care of humans.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:49.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Jehovah,
when we give generously to others

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:53.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help care for their needs when it’s
“within the power of [our] hand” to do so,

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:57.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too will experience
the joy that comes from giving.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear ones, may we never forget

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was Jehovah who gave us the ability

00:11:04.813 --> 00:11:08.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appreciate exquisite flowers.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May doing just that bring you joy

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:16.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and add to your praise of Jehovah forever.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ralph Walls,

00:11:19.286 --> 00:11:21.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a helper
to the Personnel Committee,

00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:25.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:28.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves
That Jehovah Wants Us to Rejoice

00:11:28.462 --> 00:11:30.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Delicious Food.”

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:39.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rice and beans

00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:42.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you can eat them with just about anything,

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will be delicious.

00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about kimchi?

00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:49.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a dish of fermented vegetables

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a variety of seasonings,

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:55.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
producing a complex taste of sour and spicy.

00:11:55.573 --> 00:11:57.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And jollof rice?

00:11:57.783 --> 00:11:59.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So flavorsome!

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:04.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is cooked in an appetizing tomato
and pepper puree

00:12:04.624 --> 00:12:08.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
laced with chili for a zesty taste.

00:12:08.044 --> 00:12:11.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of a day of hard work,

00:12:11.923 --> 00:12:16.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how about a piece of sweet,
fruity, cool watermelon?

00:12:16.928 --> 00:12:20.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderfully refreshing.

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All over planet Earth,

00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are a vast variety of nutritious,

00:12:25.937 --> 00:12:28.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delicious, and refreshing foods.

00:12:28.773 --> 00:12:31.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what God has provided.

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is just as the Bible says.

00:12:33.736 --> 00:12:35.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read along with me

00:12:35.822 --> 00:12:38.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes chapter 3,

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:42.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 12 and 13:

00:12:42.328 --> 00:12:45.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have concluded
that there is nothing better

00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:50.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for them than to rejoice
and to do good during their life,

00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:54.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“also that everyone should eat and drink

00:12:54.632 --> 00:12:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:02.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:13:02.473 --> 00:13:06.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, you enjoy your favorite foods.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:09.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mouth may be watering
just from thinking about it.

00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:13.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as we enjoy eating individually,

00:13:13.443 --> 00:13:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we share a good meal
with family and friends,

00:13:17.113 --> 00:13:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a special time.

00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Jehovah’s provision of food

00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:27.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives evidence
that he wants us to enjoy life.

00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:36.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:13:38.468 --> 00:13:40.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are sweet, . . .

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:44.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
salty, . . .

00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:48.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sour, . . .

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:53.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bitter, . . .

00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a rich, savory taste called umami.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we enjoy not just five flavors

00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:06.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but possibly over 100,000.

00:14:08.206 --> 00:14:10.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:14.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:14:16.381 --> 00:14:18.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chewing releases aromas

00:14:18.508 --> 00:14:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that pass up into our nose
through the back of our throat.

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:27.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taste and smell then combine
to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:14:36.735 --> 00:14:40.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our taste buds develop before we’re born.

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:44.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid,

00:14:44.826 --> 00:14:46.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may taste what its mother eats

00:14:49.498 --> 00:14:52.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is more likely
to enjoy the same foods she does.

00:14:56.088 --> 00:14:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just eat to survive.

00:14:59.883 --> 00:15:02.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to eat!

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us happy.

00:15:10.102 --> 00:15:12.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says why:

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:18.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That everyone should eat and drink

00:15:18.277 --> 00:15:21.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:15:21.446 --> 00:15:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:15:31.123 --> 00:15:33.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made so that we must take in

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical food regularly in order to survive.

00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, how grateful we are that our Creator

00:15:40.924 --> 00:15:43.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made eating so enjoyable.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That reflects the way of Jehovah;

00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:51.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling our needs creates joy not dread.

00:15:51.727 --> 00:15:54.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would not find a normal individual

00:15:54.354 --> 00:15:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complaining about eating a good dinner.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, rather, it’s enjoyable.

00:16:00.903 --> 00:16:05.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now turn with me, please,
to Matthew chapter 4,

00:16:05.407 --> 00:16:08.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice another vital need we have

00:16:08.494 --> 00:16:10.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that relates to food

00:16:10.996 --> 00:16:13.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 4:4.

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:20.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “It is written: ‘Man must live,

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:22.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘not on bread alone,

00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:27.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on every word
that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.’”

00:16:27.346 --> 00:16:32.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need physical food
to stay alive, and we enjoy doing so.

00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:36.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the same is true with spiritual food;

00:16:36.355 --> 00:16:39.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need it to stay alive spiritually.

00:16:39.525 --> 00:16:43.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, just as is true with physical food,

00:16:43.529 --> 00:16:48.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we partake of spiritual food,
we find true joy.

00:16:48.534 --> 00:16:50.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that what Jesus said

00:16:50.578 --> 00:16:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his introduction
to the Sermon on the Mount?

00:16:53.456 --> 00:16:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are those conscious
of their spiritual need.”

00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:01.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beauty of Jehovah’s way

00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:06.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that he has made the satisfying
of our spiritual need enjoyable.

00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:09.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:13.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because God’s Word, the Bible,

00:17:13.017 --> 00:17:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is written in a way that is appealing to us.

00:17:17.146 --> 00:17:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his great wisdom,
he used humans to write the Bible.

00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:17:22.818 --> 00:17:24.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If, for example, he had used angels,

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:26.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would they have been able to convey

00:17:26.947 --> 00:17:30.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the emotions and feelings
with a human touch?

00:17:30.868 --> 00:17:35.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Words convey
not just information but emotions,

00:17:35.456 --> 00:17:40.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as fear, sorrow, and disappointment.

00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:43.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By allowing imperfect men
to choose the wording

00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the ideas they received
through holy spirit,

00:17:46.842 --> 00:17:50.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God conveyed his message with warmth,

00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:55.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
variety, and the appeal
of human emotions and feelings.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes his Word appealing to us humans.

00:17:59.856 --> 00:18:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to that, Jehovah provides

00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:07.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a variety of spiritual food in abundance.

00:18:07.905 --> 00:18:12.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking in spiritual food requires effort,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as it takes in preparing
and eating a delicious meal

00:18:17.915 --> 00:18:22.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—rice and beans, kimchi, and jollof rice.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each take time and effort to prepare.

00:18:25.298 --> 00:18:29.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes effort to plant,
cultivate, and pick watermelons.

00:18:29.427 --> 00:18:34.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a joy it is to experience
the results of such efforts!

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to make

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the study of God’s Word more enjoyable?

00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:42.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When reading the Bible,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do so aloud in a lively manner.

00:18:47.237 --> 00:18:49.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do that,

00:18:49.239 --> 00:18:53.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience what Psalm 1:2 says:

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:18:58.665 --> 00:19:03.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he reads His law
in an undertone day and night.”

00:19:05.004 --> 00:19:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to do research and to meditate.

00:19:08.383 --> 00:19:10.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being creative,
you can make personal study

00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:14.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and family study meaningful and satisfying.

00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When reading the Bible, imagine the sounds,

00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:23.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sights, the smells,
and the appearance of the events.

00:19:24.983 --> 00:19:29.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The August 15, 2011, <i>Watchtower</i> said:

00:19:29.988 --> 00:19:33.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is not the intention
of the Governing Body

00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:37.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to establish one format for all families.

00:19:37.162 --> 00:19:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since circumstances vary,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is appropriate
for each family head or individual

00:19:43.877 --> 00:19:46.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to evaluate how this weekly occasion

00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:48.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be used in the best way.”

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,

00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:55.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make family and personal worship
an enjoyable time.

00:19:55.013 --> 00:19:58.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not always be
necessary or even desirable

00:19:58.391 --> 00:20:01.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use a question-and-answer method.

00:20:01.436 --> 00:20:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A relaxed atmosphere is more conducive

00:20:04.147 --> 00:20:07.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a lively and stimulating discussion.

00:20:07.984 --> 00:20:10.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It promotes creative thinking.

00:20:10.862 --> 00:20:14.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We marvel at Jehovah’s love and wisdom.

00:20:14.741 --> 00:20:19.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only has he given us life
and the means to sustain it

00:20:19.704 --> 00:20:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he has also given us the ability

00:20:21.998 --> 00:20:25.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find pleasure in doing so.

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of human rulership,

00:20:27.838 --> 00:20:32.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many today do not receive
adequate amounts of physical food.

00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the day is near when our loving Creator

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will see to it that everyone alive will have

00:20:39.349 --> 00:20:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an abundance of food and drink.

00:20:42.936 --> 00:20:47.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
may all of us discern Jehovah’s love for us

00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:50.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the food and drink that we do have

00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:54.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the abundance of spiritual food.

00:20:54.364 --> 00:20:57.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With such perfect gifts,

00:20:57.034 --> 00:21:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look forward to enjoying life forever.

00:21:03.165 --> 00:21:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Harold Corkern,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium:

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah Wants Us
to Rejoice—Beautiful Colors.”

00:21:22.392 --> 00:21:24.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most precious gifts

00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:28.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoy as humans is the gift of sight.

00:21:28.774 --> 00:21:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sight is possible because of the way

00:21:31.652 --> 00:21:35.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our eyes and our brain work together.

00:21:35.656 --> 00:21:39.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The complexity of our eyes

00:21:39.284 --> 00:21:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their connectivity with our brain

00:21:42.204 --> 00:21:46.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give strong evidence of a very wise Designer.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:51.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that Designer
is clearly identified for us in the Bible.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to the book of Psalms,

00:21:54.883 --> 00:21:59.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at Psalm 94:9.

00:21:59.638 --> 00:22:02.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads this way:

00:22:02.516 --> 00:22:05.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:22:05.978 --> 00:22:10.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The One who formed the eye,
can he not see?”

00:22:10.983 --> 00:22:15.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah created the eye
and our ability to see.

00:22:15.404 --> 00:22:17.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re very grateful for that.

00:22:17.948 --> 00:22:21.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t make it
just so that we see in one color,

00:22:21.535 --> 00:22:26.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just so that we can move around and work
and function safely and efficiently.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave us the ability to see

00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wide variety of colors
that enrich our lives.

00:22:33.589 --> 00:22:37.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We very much appreciate the brilliant colors

00:22:37.009 --> 00:22:41.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of butterflies, birds, fishes, and flowers.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your favorite color?

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it red, blue, green?

00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:52.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may say,
‘You’ve only given me three choices.’

00:22:52.274 --> 00:22:54.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true.

00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:58.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many color possibilities
are there that we can see?

00:22:58.489 --> 00:23:02.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do our eyes
and our brain work together

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:04.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to produce this variety of colors?

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:09.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what role
does light play in this process?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These questions will be answered
in the following video.

00:23:12.628 --> 00:23:17.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please take note of how all
of this wonderful design by Jehovah

00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:21.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reassures us that our Creator
wants us to rejoice.

00:23:23.598 --> 00:23:25.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is color?

00:23:28.936 --> 00:23:32.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:42.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Objects that reflect all wavelengths
of visible light appear white.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an object reflects
only some wavelengths,

00:23:47.246 --> 00:23:49.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see color.

00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:53.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cells in our eye detect light

00:23:53.461 --> 00:23:55.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send signals to our brain.

00:23:57.507 --> 00:24:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three kinds of color-sensing cells:

00:24:01.886 --> 00:24:05.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those that detect red,

00:24:05.139 --> 00:24:08.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
green,

00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blue.

00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:13.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we perceive other colors?

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:18.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mixing red, green, and blue light

00:24:18.236 --> 00:24:21.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changes the color we see.

00:24:24.284 --> 00:24:27.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This flower is yellow because it reflects

00:24:27.245 --> 00:24:30.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
red and green light into our eye.

00:24:31.332 --> 00:24:33.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just three kinds

00:24:33.376 --> 00:24:37.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of color receptors,
we can distinguish some ten million colors.

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:44.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Color triggers our emotions.

00:24:45.764 --> 00:24:48.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue and green can calm us.

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:52.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Red and orange can excite!

00:24:53.646 --> 00:24:56.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, descriptions that include

00:24:56.316 --> 00:24:58.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
color help us learn.

00:24:58.777 --> 00:25:00.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any doubt

00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:03.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God gave us
the gift of color for our joy? 

00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I put my rainbow in the cloud,

00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will serve as a sign of the covenant

00:25:13.375 --> 00:25:15.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between me and the earth.”

00:25:23.134 --> 00:25:25.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are that Jehovah

00:25:25.512 --> 00:25:29.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave us this ability
to see a variety of colors!

00:25:29.683 --> 00:25:33.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And color has an impact on our emotions.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the color red

00:25:37.274 --> 00:25:42.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s a very highly visible color,
and it’s filled with energy.

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:45.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s associated with danger.

00:25:45.407 --> 00:25:49.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And red, it’s said,
can actually make us breathe faster

00:25:49.661 --> 00:25:52.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even raise our blood pressure.

00:25:52.497 --> 00:25:57.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the other hand,
green is a very calming color.

00:25:57.127 --> 00:25:59.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very tranquil,

00:25:59.129 --> 00:26:02.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why when we look
at a beautiful green garden

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:04.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a beautiful hillside,

00:26:04.468 --> 00:26:07.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, we feel very relaxed.

00:26:07.804 --> 00:26:11.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides affecting our emotions,

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:14.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has used color in the Scriptures

00:26:14.394 --> 00:26:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us Bible truths
and to help us remember them.

00:26:18.982 --> 00:26:21.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate,

00:26:21.026 --> 00:26:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think of
when I mention the following:

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a white horse, a red horse,

00:26:28.492 --> 00:26:31.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a black horse, a pale horse?

00:26:31.745 --> 00:26:36.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, right away your minds
went to the book of Revelation, didn’t they?

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you understand
what these four horses picture.

00:26:40.963 --> 00:26:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The white horse pictures Jesus Christ

00:26:43.966 --> 00:26:48.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the enthroned King,
riding in righteous warfare;

00:26:48.053 --> 00:26:51.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the red horse pictures the bloody warfare

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the nations in these last days;

00:26:54.434 --> 00:26:57.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the black horse, stark famine;

00:26:57.271 --> 00:26:59.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the pale horse

00:26:59.314 --> 00:27:02.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we’re quite familiar
with these days, aren’t we?),

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:05.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pale horse pictures dreaded disease

00:27:05.946 --> 00:27:09.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pandemics leading to death.

00:27:09.283 --> 00:27:12.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see how Jehovah used color

00:27:12.244 --> 00:27:16.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach us Bible truths
and to help us remember them.

00:27:16.915 --> 00:27:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s another way
that Jehovah has used scriptures

00:27:20.711 --> 00:27:24.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and color
to teach us about him.

00:27:24.465 --> 00:27:29.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of this is at Ezekiel 1:26-28,

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah gives Ezekiel

00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:36.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful, brilliant view of his throne.

00:27:36.685 --> 00:27:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And among all this glory,
there is a beautiful rainbow.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does a rainbow picture?

00:27:44.652 --> 00:27:47.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rainbow denotes peacefulness,

00:27:47.613 --> 00:27:52.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calmness, tranquility
—indicating what?

00:27:52.076 --> 00:27:54.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That with all of his dynamic energy,

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a calm, peaceful God.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s very reassuring to us,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are endeared to him.

00:28:04.588 --> 00:28:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, earlier we talked
about the association of light with color.

00:28:09.135 --> 00:28:13.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the Scriptures,
Jehovah uses light to depict something

00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how he increases
our understanding of Bible truths.

00:28:18.185 --> 00:28:22.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 4:18, the Bible says:

00:28:22.023 --> 00:28:25.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the path of the righteous
is like the bright morning light

00:28:25.943 --> 00:28:29.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grows brighter and brighter
until full daylight.”

00:28:30.865 --> 00:28:35.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this applies spiritually,
but we can understand it literally, can’t we?

00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:39.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re taking
an early morning walk in the countryside

00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sun has not come up yet,

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see things
but you’re not quite sure what you see.

00:28:45.087 --> 00:28:47.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps you
don’t even know what color they are.

00:28:47.673 --> 00:28:49.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the sun comes up,

00:28:49.675 --> 00:28:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you see clearly
what you were looking at:

00:28:52.094 --> 00:28:54.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful white fence, a green pasture,

00:28:54.597 --> 00:28:57.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a big, stately red barn in the distance.

00:28:57.642 --> 00:29:02.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now your appreciation
for your walk has been enhanced.

00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:07.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise,
the Bible tells us at 2 Corinthians 4:6:

00:29:07.318 --> 00:29:10.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let the light shine out of darkness,’

00:29:10.988 --> 00:29:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he has shone on our hearts

00:29:13.116 --> 00:29:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to illuminate them
with the glorious knowledge of God.”

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides his servants
with spiritual enlightenment,

00:29:21.457 --> 00:29:23.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps us to understand

00:29:23.543 --> 00:29:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deeply appreciate Bible truths even more.

00:29:27.463 --> 00:29:30.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result, we understand them,

00:29:30.508 --> 00:29:32.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re motivated to apply them,

00:29:32.802 --> 00:29:36.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this draws us closer
to our heavenly Father.

00:29:36.139 --> 00:29:40.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how thankful we are
that Jehovah created us

00:29:40.226 --> 00:29:42.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the ability to see color!

00:29:42.937 --> 00:29:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It enriches our lives, touches our emotions,

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to learn and remember Bible truths,

00:29:49.986 --> 00:29:52.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to understand
our heavenly Father better.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the light that he provides
gives us a progressive improvement

00:29:57.076 --> 00:29:59.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our Bible understanding.

00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:04.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thankful we are for the gift
that Jehovah has given us to see color!

00:30:04.584 --> 00:30:06.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is strong evidence

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he really wants us
to enjoy life to the full.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:16.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now let’s give our attention
to Brother Robert Luccioni,

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will now present
the next talk of this symposium:

00:30:20.475 --> 00:30:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah Wants Us
to Rejoice

00:30:24.187 --> 00:30:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Our Well-Designed Bodies.”

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:37.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our previous parts have reminded us
that Jehovah’s creation

00:30:37.784 --> 00:30:41.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flowers and food
and colors all demonstrate

00:30:41.788 --> 00:30:45.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us to be happy
—to be joyful.

00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this part, we’re going to see
that Jehovah designed our bodies

00:30:49.546 --> 00:30:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that shows that he wants
us to be happy as well.

00:30:53.133 --> 00:30:55.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah designed us

00:30:55.176 --> 00:30:58.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the amazing capacity
for motion.

00:30:58.096 --> 00:31:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans can walk.
We can run.

00:31:00.223 --> 00:31:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can swim.
We can dance.

00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:04.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
if you turn in your Bibles

00:31:04.227 --> 00:31:07.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Acts 17:28,

00:31:07.522 --> 00:31:11.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will see that this
is a God-given ability.

00:31:11.526 --> 00:31:14.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:28:

00:31:14.988 --> 00:31:16.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For by him

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have life
and move and exist.”

00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This word here “move”

00:31:23.205 --> 00:31:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refers to the ability
from Jehovah for us to be active.

00:31:27.501 --> 00:31:30.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with that in mind,
we have two questions:

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Are there lessons
that we can learn

00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:38.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from how Jehovah designed us
that can help us to rejoice?

00:31:38.178 --> 00:31:42.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And (2) are there lessons
that we can learn that can help us

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our worship of Jehovah?

00:31:44.643 --> 00:31:46.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider
those two points.

00:31:46.728 --> 00:31:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s watch
the following video

00:31:49.815 --> 00:31:52.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us appreciate
the marvelous way

00:31:52.818 --> 00:31:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we were designed.

00:31:58.031 --> 00:32:00.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:32:06.456 --> 00:32:09.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way we move can be complex

00:32:12.963 --> 00:32:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or precise.

00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:18.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could require strength

00:32:22.723 --> 00:32:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stamina.

00:32:29.813 --> 00:32:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Walking involves the coordination
of dozens of muscles.

00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:39.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Muscles are controlled
by our brain and nervous system.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support and move our bones

00:32:43.702 --> 00:32:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are powered by the food we eat
and the oxygen we breathe.

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:54.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every body part is a marvel of engineering.

00:33:01.929 --> 00:33:04.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The knee is designed 
to withstand repeated impact.

00:33:08.894 --> 00:33:12.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:33:12.606 --> 00:33:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Findings suggest that regular movement

00:33:16.318 --> 00:33:18.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps prevent joint damage.

00:33:21.574 --> 00:33:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a machine
that strengthens as we use it.

00:33:28.164 --> 00:33:31.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Movement helps us
to stay healthy and feel good.

00:33:35.296 --> 00:33:38.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a credit to its Creator.

00:33:39.758 --> 00:33:42.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For by him we have life

00:33:42.928 --> 00:33:46.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move and exist.”

00:33:50.853 --> 00:33:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The makeup of the human body

00:33:52.855 --> 00:33:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proves that Jehovah wants us
not just to exist but to be happy.

00:33:57.401 --> 00:33:59.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you remember
our first question:

00:33:59.403 --> 00:34:01.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn?

00:34:01.447 --> 00:34:03.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are two of them.

00:34:03.449 --> 00:34:08.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, as the video highlighted,
Jehovah designed our bodies to move.

00:34:08.162 --> 00:34:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the comment,
“Movement helps us

00:34:10.873 --> 00:34:13.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay healthy
and feel good”?

00:34:13.501 --> 00:34:17.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Research has established
that leading a physically active life

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:21.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us to think clearly,
feel happier,

00:34:21.884 --> 00:34:24.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have more energy,
be more productive.

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:26.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an incredible gift
from Jehovah!

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:29.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He created us to move.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:33.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also he created us in a way
that the more we move

00:34:33.688 --> 00:34:36.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the more we exercise,
we work, we do things for others—

00:34:36.941 --> 00:34:39.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the happier we are.

00:34:39.235 --> 00:34:42.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second point
is that Jehovah designed our bodies

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many different parts,
but it works as one unit.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the coordination
needed just to walk?

00:34:49.662 --> 00:34:51.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something
we take for granted.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:53.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about our knee?

00:34:53.833 --> 00:34:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine if our knee did not work
in harmony with the rest of the body?

00:34:57.587 --> 00:35:01.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if every time we stood up,
we weren’t sure which way it would bend.

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How complicated
that would be!

00:35:03.843 --> 00:35:08.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, Jehovah created our bodies
to work as one complete unit.

00:35:08.848 --> 00:35:11.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you notice also
that the video stated

00:35:11.851 --> 00:35:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our body
is like a machine

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:18.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many different moving parts
and that it all works together?

00:35:18.524 --> 00:35:23.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a unique difference
between a machine and our body

00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:25.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that our body
strengthens as we use it.

00:35:25.615 --> 00:35:27.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you think about that.

00:35:27.617 --> 00:35:30.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go out and you
buy a car or you buy a bicycle,

00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:35.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may think that’s a successful purchase
if it operates as intended.

00:35:35.708 --> 00:35:38.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you would never expect
that car or bicycle

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve and grow stronger
every time you use it.

00:35:42.131 --> 00:35:44.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s what happens
to our body.

00:35:44.384 --> 00:35:47.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that allows us to exercise,

00:35:47.387 --> 00:35:50.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
walk, run, swim,
dance, even more.

00:35:50.723 --> 00:35:54.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more we move,
the happier we are.

00:35:54.227 --> 00:35:56.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an incredible design!

00:35:56.271 --> 00:36:00.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we appreciate our bodies
—this wonderful gift from Jehovah!

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:03.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember
our second question:

00:36:03.445 --> 00:36:06.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there lessons
that we can learn from the body

00:36:06.823 --> 00:36:10.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to be happy
in our worship of Jehovah?

00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider
those same two points again.

00:36:13.496 --> 00:36:17.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we said that Jehovah
designed our bodies to move.

00:36:17.751 --> 00:36:19.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what should we do?

00:36:19.794 --> 00:36:24.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look together
to 1 Corinthians 15:58

00:36:26.343 --> 00:36:28.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 15:58.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:33.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Therefore, my beloved brothers,
be steadfast, immovable,

00:36:33.266 --> 00:36:37.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“always having plenty to do
in the work of the Lord,

00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:41.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that your labor is not in vain
in connection with the Lord.”

00:36:41.775 --> 00:36:43.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?

00:36:43.777 --> 00:36:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move, stay busy, have “plenty
to do in the work of the Lord.”

00:36:48.698 --> 00:36:51.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah gave us
further reason for rejoicing

00:36:51.618 --> 00:36:54.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving us
meaningful work to do.

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:57.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of you dear brothers
and sisters have said

00:36:57.582 --> 00:37:01.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never felt
busier than you do now.

00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think
that’s a coincidence?

00:37:03.713 --> 00:37:05.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think it’s a coincidence
that the darker

00:37:05.966 --> 00:37:08.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more depressing
these last days have become

00:37:08.635 --> 00:37:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are busier
than ever in Jehovah’s work?

00:37:10.887 --> 00:37:12.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:37:12.347 --> 00:37:15.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that is one of the ways
that Jehovah uses

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:19.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to be happy and healthy
in these last days.

00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:22.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know
that our primary work

00:37:22.149 --> 00:37:25.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:37:25.027 --> 00:37:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we do that
through the house-to-house preaching work.

00:37:27.696 --> 00:37:31.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do that through public witnessing
and through Bible studies.

00:37:31.575 --> 00:37:35.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even when this work
is restricted because of world events,

00:37:35.746 --> 00:37:38.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we still find ways to preach.

00:37:38.707 --> 00:37:41.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we
have “plenty to do

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the work of the Lord”
(in the preaching work),

00:37:44.796 --> 00:37:49.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re happy and we’re better able
to put our troubles into perspective.

00:37:49.384 --> 00:37:54.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, others of you support
the Kingdom work by serving at Bethel

00:37:54.056 --> 00:37:57.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by constructing and renovating
theocratic facilities.

00:37:57.768 --> 00:38:01.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you share in relief work
or whatever you do;

00:38:01.688 --> 00:38:05.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it brings joy,
and it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:38:05.818 --> 00:38:07.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s a question:

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you staying
as busy as you can

00:38:11.365 --> 00:38:15.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your circumstances allow
in Jehovah’s work?

00:38:15.369 --> 00:38:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to have “plenty
to do in the work of the Lord.”

00:38:18.664 --> 00:38:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be happy,
and you’ll never regret it.

00:38:22.209 --> 00:38:24.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, our second point,

00:38:24.294 --> 00:38:27.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also established
that Jehovah designed our body

00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many parts
but to work as one unit.

00:38:31.135 --> 00:38:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what lessons
do we learn from that?

00:38:33.429 --> 00:38:38.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look over
to Ephesians 4:16

00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ephesians 4:16,

00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it says: “From him all the body
is harmoniously joined together

00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and made to cooperate through every joint
that gives what is needed.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When each respective member
functions properly,

00:38:56.785 --> 00:38:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“this contributes
to the growth of the body

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it builds itself up in love.”

00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we
learn from this?

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay united,
cooperate together,

00:39:07.546 --> 00:39:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
function properly.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn that every part
of the human body

00:39:11.926 --> 00:39:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is necessary and that it
must work together.

00:39:14.261 --> 00:39:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, similarly,
the congregation

00:39:16.847 --> 00:39:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up
of many different members.

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each member, each of you
(whether young or old, strong or frail

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you) contributes to the whole
and the beauty of the congregation.

00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each one of you is needed.

00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are special to Jehovah
and your brothers and sisters.

00:39:35.157 --> 00:39:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you see
when the congregation

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:39.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “harmoniously joined together”
what happens?

00:39:39.954 --> 00:39:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation
is built up.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, again,
many of you have said

00:39:44.834 --> 00:39:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never felt
closer to each other

00:39:47.753 --> 00:39:51.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Jehovah’s organization
than you do now.

00:39:51.048 --> 00:39:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s no coincidence.

00:39:54.093 --> 00:39:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the end draws near,
Jehovah is gathering us closer

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and closer together in unity,
and those bonds among us

00:40:01.684 --> 00:40:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to grow even stronger.

00:40:04.103 --> 00:40:08.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, how much we appreciate
and how much we can learn

00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:11.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wonderful way
in which we are made!

00:40:11.694 --> 00:40:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us
remember those two points:

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Be determined to be
as active as possible

00:40:17.116 --> 00:40:19.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—move in Jehovah’s service,

00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (2) may each of us do

00:40:21.704 --> 00:40:24.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that we can
to promote unity.

00:40:24.749 --> 00:40:28.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do,
you will be happy

00:40:28.586 --> 00:40:31.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not only will you
bring joy to yourself

00:40:31.005 --> 00:40:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll bring joy
to others as well.

00:40:34.217 --> 00:40:39.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:40:39.055 --> 00:40:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:40:42.016 --> 00:40:45.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves That Jehovah
Wants Us to Rejoice

00:40:45.687 --> 00:40:47.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Delightful Sounds.”

00:40:54.779 --> 00:40:59.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A well-designed body
is indeed a reason for us to rejoice.

00:40:59.284 --> 00:41:03.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certain body parts
help us to perceive the world around us.

00:41:03.037 --> 00:41:08.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
please turn with me to Proverbs 20:12.

00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:13.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us see what the Scriptures say
in connection with two sensory organs.

00:41:13.006 --> 00:41:16.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Proverbs 20:12, we read:

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The hearing ear and the seeing eye

00:41:20.263 --> 00:41:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah has made both of them.”

00:41:23.057 --> 00:41:28.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our ability
to hear and see is from Jehovah.

00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are
that he has given us the senses!

00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:35.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They allow us to enjoy life more fully.

00:41:35.195 --> 00:41:40.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ear, for example,
allows us to hear delightful sounds.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does it make you feel
when you hear birds chirping

00:41:44.287 --> 00:41:47.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the relaxing sound of a babbling brook?

00:41:47.707 --> 00:41:51.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we cherish
hearing the voice of a loved one

00:41:51.586 --> 00:41:56.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe your mate,
your father or mother, or your child!

00:41:56.591 --> 00:41:59.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also enjoy beautiful music.

00:41:59.469 --> 00:42:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even those who cannot hear can enjoy music.

00:42:03.139 --> 00:42:07.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some connect with a song’s bass notes
or its speed rather than its melody.

00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:13.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note how Jehovah created us

00:42:13.024 --> 00:42:16.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy a wide variety of sounds.

00:42:27.038 --> 00:42:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is full of sounds.

00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:42.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are natural.

00:42:47.726 --> 00:42:49.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others we create.

00:42:53.065 --> 00:42:55.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hear music before we’re born

00:42:57.361 --> 00:43:00.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:04.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can compose music,

00:43:06.078 --> 00:43:09.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moved by it,

00:43:09.206 --> 00:43:11.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replay it in our minds.

00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:13.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Musical instruments 

00:43:13.627 --> 00:43:17.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
typically combine a sound generator,
which produces tones

00:43:17.839 --> 00:43:20.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a resonator,
such as wood or metal,

00:43:20.634 --> 00:43:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which adds volume.

00:43:22.886 --> 00:43:26.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:43:27.808 --> 00:43:29.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But few instruments 

00:43:29.893 --> 00:43:33.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:43:34.982 --> 00:43:37.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:43:40.863 --> 00:43:44.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can listen to things
that draw us closer to God

00:43:46.118 --> 00:43:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use the voice he gave us

00:43:48.704 --> 00:43:51.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to praise him with joy.

00:43:52.541 --> 00:43:56.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praise Jah, for Jehovah is good.

00:43:56.045 --> 00:43:58.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sing praises to his name,

00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:01.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for it is pleasant.”

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, sounds definitely enrich our life;

00:44:11.393 --> 00:44:14.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they make our life more enjoyable.

00:44:14.188 --> 00:44:18.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this not instill in us
the desire to praise Jehovah?

00:44:18.484 --> 00:44:23.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us, please, open to Isaiah 30:21.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we see that ears and hearing

00:44:25.783 --> 00:44:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sometimes used
in a figurative way in the Bible.

00:44:29.245 --> 00:44:32.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:21 reads:

00:44:32.831 --> 00:44:36.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And your own ears
will hear a word behind you saying,

00:44:36.335 --> 00:44:38.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the way.

00:44:38.003 --> 00:44:40.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Walk in it,’
in case you should go to the right

00:44:40.798 --> 00:44:43.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hear Jehovah’s figurative voice
from his Word, the Bible,

00:44:48.597 --> 00:44:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from his guidance
through the holy spirit in the congregation.

00:44:52.268 --> 00:44:54.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s guidance is so clear

00:44:54.311 --> 00:44:58.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is as if we could hear him
speaking to us.

00:44:58.899 --> 00:45:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me ask you a question:

00:45:01.235 --> 00:45:05.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the sound of Jehovah’s voice
make you enjoy life?

00:45:05.031 --> 00:45:07.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it make you rejoice?

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose you would all answer
with a clear yes.

00:45:11.412 --> 00:45:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s voice is a delightful sound.

00:45:15.291 --> 00:45:17.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know how good it feels

00:45:17.835 --> 00:45:21.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we apply Jehovah’s guidance
and enjoy success in life.

00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:26.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think again about our literal ears.

00:45:26.802 --> 00:45:30.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are very sensitive,
so we need to protect them.

00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:34.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certain sounds, or noise,
can even damage them.

00:45:34.518 --> 00:45:36.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to protect our hearing,

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might use acoustic earmuffs
to block out harmful noise.

00:45:42.902 --> 00:45:45.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about our figurative ears?

00:45:45.947 --> 00:45:48.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to protect them too?

00:45:48.282 --> 00:45:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there sounds out there that can harm us?

00:45:51.035 --> 00:45:53.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are.

00:45:53.037 --> 00:45:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reality is that we live in a world

00:45:55.998 --> 00:45:59.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full of damaging and unpleasant noise.

00:45:59.794 --> 00:46:03.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, how can we protect ourselves?

00:46:03.798 --> 00:46:07.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are three measures we need to take.

00:46:07.218 --> 00:46:12.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, block out the harmful noise around us.

00:46:12.223 --> 00:46:16.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can put on noise-canceling headphones.

00:46:16.686 --> 00:46:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
we refuse to listen to anything

00:46:19.689 --> 00:46:22.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can distance us from Jehovah.

00:46:22.275 --> 00:46:24.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like what?

00:46:24.277 --> 00:46:28.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceptive reasoning and false accusations,
for example, are very dangerous.

00:46:28.948 --> 00:46:33.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They undermine our trust
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who were once part
of the Christian congregation

00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:38.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now attempt to mislead us.

00:46:38.499 --> 00:46:43.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spread half-truths and outright lies
about Jehovah’s organization.

00:46:44.422 --> 00:46:48.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Harmful sounds might also come
from non-Christian workmates,

00:46:48.968 --> 00:46:53.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
schoolmates, or contacts on social media.

00:46:53.097 --> 00:46:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not share our beliefs,

00:46:55.558 --> 00:46:59.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so conversations with them
are rarely faith-strengthening.

00:46:59.437 --> 00:47:01.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might weaken our faith,

00:47:01.898 --> 00:47:05.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making our Christian life course
more difficult.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we need to protect our ears
from damaging noise

00:47:09.823 --> 00:47:12.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not listening to it.

00:47:14.411 --> 00:47:18.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the second way
to protect ourselves from damaging sounds?

00:47:20.208 --> 00:47:24.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Headphones can help us
block out the noise around us

00:47:24.087 --> 00:47:28.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replace it with something delightful
—maybe a favorite song.

00:47:29.509 --> 00:47:33.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So put on our figurative headphones

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen to wholesome things

00:47:36.057 --> 00:47:40.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our favorite sounds,
delightful sounds from Jehovah.

00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:44.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we hear
at our Christian meetings.

00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:48.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we sing at our Christian meetings,
like we’ve seen in the video,

00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:51.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our sounds praise Jehovah.

00:47:51.865 --> 00:47:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we read in our publications,
what we see on our website,

00:47:56.286 --> 00:48:00.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we hear in upbuilding conversations
with our brothers and sisters

00:48:00.415 --> 00:48:04.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of these beautiful sounds
protect our ears.

00:48:07.214 --> 00:48:12.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third aid for protecting our ears
is Jehovah’s help.

00:48:12.219 --> 00:48:16.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we might not feel like
putting on our headphones.

00:48:16.264 --> 00:48:18.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might argue:

00:48:18.266 --> 00:48:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It is so much more comfortable without them.

00:48:21.895 --> 00:48:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The damage to my ears
will not be that serious.’

00:48:25.774 --> 00:48:29.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is where Jehovah comes into play.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will help us listen to his voice

00:48:32.781 --> 00:48:35.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we ask him for his help in prayer.

00:48:35.367 --> 00:48:39.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will motivate us
to put on our headphones, so to speak.

00:48:39.538 --> 00:48:42.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives us the inner strength
to stop listening

00:48:42.624 --> 00:48:46.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sounds that might be tempting
and yet are so dangerous.

00:48:47.921 --> 00:48:52.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are the three ways
to protect our figurative ears?

00:48:53.886 --> 00:48:57.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stop listening to damaging sounds,

00:48:57.222 --> 00:49:00.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we listen to wholesome things,

00:49:00.184 --> 00:49:03.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pray for Jehovah’s help.

00:49:03.604 --> 00:49:07.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
Jehovah created sounds

00:49:07.608 --> 00:49:10.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he wants us to enjoy life.

00:49:10.777 --> 00:49:15.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please let us continue
to make wise use of our hearing,

00:49:15.115 --> 00:49:20.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we will rejoice
in hearing delightful sounds forever.

00:49:22.206 --> 00:49:24.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother John Ekrann,

00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:26.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:49:26.335 --> 00:49:29.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the last talk of this symposium:

00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:33.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Creation Proves
That Jehovah Wants Us to Rejoice

00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:36.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Fascinating Animals.”

00:49:43.519 --> 00:49:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s your favorite animal?

00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:48.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My favorite animal is a dolphin.

00:49:48.315 --> 00:49:50.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I was snorkeling in the ocean,

00:49:50.859 --> 00:49:53.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a pod of dolphins came by.

00:49:53.445 --> 00:49:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, with the mask on,
I could see underwater.

00:49:56.365 --> 00:49:59.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was beautiful to watch
how they could swim

00:49:59.451 --> 00:50:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how sleek they were in the water.

00:50:01.704 --> 00:50:04.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I watched as one of them
used his powerful tail

00:50:04.123 --> 00:50:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shoot up to the surface of the water.

00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:09.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lifted my head up
and watched him jump out of the water

00:50:09.253 --> 00:50:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gracefully go right back in.

00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a sight I won’t forget.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that if we talked
to each of you watching this,

00:50:17.761 --> 00:50:22.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could tell some really good story
about your favorite animal.

00:50:23.058 --> 00:50:26.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our beautiful planet Earth
is full of animals.

00:50:26.979 --> 00:50:30.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, though,
for many of us in modern-day life,

00:50:30.524 --> 00:50:34.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t get a chance
to interact with animals that much.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of our interaction with animals
is second hand

00:50:36.781 --> 00:50:38.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through books or videos.

00:50:38.783 --> 00:50:43.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Internet is full of videos,
especially of cats.

00:50:43.287 --> 00:50:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People share these videos.
Why?

00:50:45.748 --> 00:50:50.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it makes them smile.
They enjoy watching them.

00:50:50.002 --> 00:50:52.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, many of you are probably thinking

00:50:52.463 --> 00:50:56.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some video you just watched about animals.

00:50:56.884 --> 00:51:00.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah created animals

00:51:00.179 --> 00:51:04.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with qualities to bring us joy,
to make us happy.

00:51:04.767 --> 00:51:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watching them in person or in video
can cultivate our interest.

00:51:09.772 --> 00:51:14.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can entertain us
and make us feel good.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see Jehovah’s sense of humor

00:51:16.529 --> 00:51:19.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how the animals interact
and play with one another.

00:51:19.657 --> 00:51:23.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can also learn lessons
from the animals.

00:51:23.202 --> 00:51:27.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 6:6 is an example of that.

00:51:27.707 --> 00:51:31.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 6:6:

00:51:31.002 --> 00:51:33.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go to the ant, you lazy one;

00:51:33.421 --> 00:51:36.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe its ways and become wise.”

00:51:36.674 --> 00:51:40.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can remember as a young boy,
I was fascinated with ants

00:51:40.344 --> 00:51:44.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so many of them,
and yet they all knew what to do.

00:51:44.474 --> 00:51:49.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they could carry these really big leaves
and other things for their size.

00:51:49.103 --> 00:51:53.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to see what they could do
—even the building of their tunnels.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As children, many of us

00:51:55.818 --> 00:51:59.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were interested in animals
—fascinated with them.

00:51:59.322 --> 00:52:03.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as we got older,
we became more fascinated with technology

00:52:03.952 --> 00:52:06.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or things that man has made.

00:52:06.704 --> 00:52:09.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really the things that man has made

00:52:09.415 --> 00:52:12.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot compare to the things
Jehovah has made,

00:52:12.877 --> 00:52:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the animals.

00:52:14.879 --> 00:52:17.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design and wonder you feel

00:52:17.966 --> 00:52:20.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you watch your favorite animal

00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:24.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in a category all by itself.

00:52:24.055 --> 00:52:26.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in the following video,
we’re going to see

00:52:26.558 --> 00:52:29.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some really beautiful animals.

00:52:29.352 --> 00:52:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you will see your favorite animal.

00:52:36.276 --> 00:52:38.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals fascinate us.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We marvel at their speed,

00:52:42.907 --> 00:52:45.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their agility,

00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:51.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their strength.

00:52:54.335 --> 00:52:57.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their beauty and behavior
are a pleasure to watch.

00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:04.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like us, they play.

00:53:07.432 --> 00:53:10.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even dance!

00:53:15.649 --> 00:53:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are industrious.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A beaver dam can extend hundreds of meters.

00:53:24.658 --> 00:53:27.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some can even be seen from space!

00:53:27.619 --> 00:53:32.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we observe animals,
we learn more about the Creator.

00:53:36.586 --> 00:53:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is caring and generous.

00:53:48.432 --> 00:53:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he is a happy God.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:57.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals fascinate us
because we are made in God’s image.

00:53:59.985 --> 00:54:03.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy what He enjoys,

00:54:04.489 --> 00:54:08.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially our earth and its amazing animals.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are his gift to us.

00:54:11.538 --> 00:54:14.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us make man in our image,

00:54:14.499 --> 00:54:16.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to our likeness,

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let them have in subjection

00:54:19.379 --> 00:54:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the fish of the sea

00:54:20.797 --> 00:54:23.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the flying creatures of the heavens

00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:25.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the domestic animals

00:54:25.177 --> 00:54:28.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the earth.”

00:54:35.896 --> 00:54:39.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you and the others with you
watching that video smiling

00:54:39.274 --> 00:54:41.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even laughing a little bit

00:54:41.276 --> 00:54:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you saw the little dog
jumping back and forth?

00:54:44.988 --> 00:54:48.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the design of animals
to bring us joy

00:54:48.367 --> 00:54:51.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not an evolutionary accident.

00:54:51.578 --> 00:54:55.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus, his “master worker,”

00:54:55.082 --> 00:54:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found joy in creating and designing
animal life

00:54:58.961 --> 00:55:00.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to delight us.

00:55:00.963 --> 00:55:03.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine Jehovah and Jesus

00:55:03.507 --> 00:55:07.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussing designing an elephant?

00:55:07.302 --> 00:55:09.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elephant trunk is a nose,

00:55:09.722 --> 00:55:11.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s an arm,

00:55:11.724 --> 00:55:15.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a showerhead,
it’s a straw,

00:55:15.227 --> 00:55:18.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can even be a snorkel.

00:55:18.272 --> 00:55:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that their feet
are so well-padded

00:55:21.483 --> 00:55:23.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can hardly hear them coming?

00:55:23.944 --> 00:55:28.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Jehovah and Jesus
making this huge elephant and saying,

00:55:28.032 --> 00:55:31.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re going to make it really quiet.”

00:55:31.535 --> 00:55:34.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or can you imagine what the angels thought

00:55:34.663 --> 00:55:37.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they first saw a lemur dancing

00:55:38.667 --> 00:55:42.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a hummingbird hovering in the air

00:55:42.379 --> 00:55:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a little puppy chasing its tail?

00:55:45.841 --> 00:55:48.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or can you imagine being Adam,

00:55:48.761 --> 00:55:53.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first human being,
amongst all of these animals?

00:55:53.307 --> 00:55:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Adam must have thrilled
to watch the animals and name them!

00:55:59.438 --> 00:56:03.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you have called an animal
with a funny hump on its back

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:08.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a bird that could mimic
the sounds you made

00:56:09.573 --> 00:56:13.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a lizard that could change colors,

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:17.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even looking at it as it moved,
changing colors, wondering,

00:56:17.581 --> 00:56:19.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How did it do that?’

00:56:21.168 --> 00:56:23.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assigned Adam

00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:26.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not only name the animals
but to care for them.

00:56:26.257 --> 00:56:29.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the scripture
that was highlighted in our video

00:56:29.427 --> 00:56:34.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Genesis 1:26.

00:56:34.098 --> 00:56:36.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:26:

00:56:38.019 --> 00:56:42.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then God said:
‘Let us make man in our image,

00:56:42.064 --> 00:56:44.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘according to our likeness,

00:56:44.066 --> 00:56:47.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and let them have in subjection
the fish of the sea

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the flying creatures of the heavens

00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:52.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the domestic animals
and all the earth

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:56.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every creeping animal
that is moving on the earth.’”

00:56:56.496 --> 00:56:58.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah God wanted Adam

00:56:58.873 --> 00:57:00.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his descendants
—that’s us—

00:57:00.958 --> 00:57:05.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take care of the animals
and to take delight in them.

00:57:06.297 --> 00:57:09.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we take time to enjoy animal life,

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can make
some very fascinating discoveries.

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see in the video
the lemurs of Madagascar?

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:22.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know
how many varieties of lemurs there are?

00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what lemurs eat?

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen lemurs play?

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:29.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:34.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I guarantee you,
you will enjoy it and smile when you do.

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:37.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made one discovery about dolphins.

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:40.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dolphins can blow under water

00:57:40.832 --> 00:57:43.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a perfect circle of air,

00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:47.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they like to play with it afterward.

00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:51.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time I saw that video,
I could hardly believe my eyes.

00:57:51.926 --> 00:57:55.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends, today we can only imagine

00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it will be like in the future Paradise

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:03.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we can really enjoy animal life
the way Jehovah truly intended.

00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:07.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, this symposium 

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:10.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been about Jehovah’s creative works

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:13.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—exquisite flowers,

00:58:13.782 --> 00:58:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delicious food,

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beautiful colors,

00:58:18.203 --> 00:58:20.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our well-designed bodies,

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delightful sounds,
and fascinating animals

00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:26.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of which convince us

00:58:26.795 --> 00:58:30.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:35.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a time when many people
are not finding meaning or joy

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the things that man has made,

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe and rejoice in the gift of the things
that Jehovah has made

00:58:42.936 --> 00:58:44.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given to us.

00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:49.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make them a source of true joy in your life.

00:58:50.735 --> 00:58:54.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for sharing those
thought-provoking lessons from creation.

00:58:56.157 --> 00:59:00.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Christian brothers and sisters
also bring us great joy.

00:59:00.495 --> 00:59:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we safeguard and strengthen
our relationships with them?

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:10.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body
will direct us to the Bible’s wise counsel.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:12.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is

00:59:12.132 --> 00:59:15.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Those Who Promote Peace Have Joy’—Why?”

00:59:22.559 --> 00:59:27.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ravens brought Elijah bread
and meat morning and evening.

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:31.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus transformed
a hundred gallons of water

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into very fine wine.

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:35.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A hundred and twenty Christians

00:59:35.989 --> 00:59:39.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suddenly could speak
different languages.

00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:43.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did those three events
have in common?

00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:47.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all three miracles
produced by holy spirit.

00:59:47.793 --> 00:59:50.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But miracles
are no longer happening today.

00:59:50.504 --> 00:59:52.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that right?

00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:54.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really, if you think about it.

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:57.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we think about it,
the peace, the love,

00:59:57.219 --> 01:00:01.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the harmony of Jehovah’s people
in a world that is so divided

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:04.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a modern-day miracle.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast,
Satan’s world around us

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is becoming more divided by race,

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:14.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ethnicity, religion,
political affiliation, and so forth.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:17.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah’s people
are more united than ever.

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we attend
our assemblies and conventions,

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:23.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we especially see this.

01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:27.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see different races
and nationalities enjoying

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:32.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a genuinely peaceful,
joyful gathering.

01:00:32.463 --> 01:00:35.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, looking at a world map,

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:39.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Lett and I were able to calculate
that during the past 20 years,

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:43.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve attended assemblies,
conventions, large gatherings

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:46.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in at least 82 different countries;

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every one of them

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:52.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overflowed with love and joy;

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:56.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every one of them
convinced us even more

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:59.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these are Jehovah’s people

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:03.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people he’s gathered from all nations,
tribes, peoples, and tongues

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:08.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into his organization
and is preparing for the new world.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:13.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,
What makes this modern-day miracle possible?

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:17.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is,
it stems from a peaceful relationship

01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:20.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have with our Father, Jehovah,

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:23.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was called
at 1 Thessalonians 5:23,

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the God of peace.”

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:29.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As his children,
we strive to imitate him.

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:32.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all brothers and sisters
—we have the same father—

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:37.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we are ones who show peace
and love like our Father.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s another question:

01:01:39.447 --> 01:01:43.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is maintaining this peace
and harmony automatic?

01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:48.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is maintaining a garden,
an automobile, our health automatic?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it takes effort,
doesn’t it?

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all imperfect, so we have to work

01:01:53.336 --> 01:01:56.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at maintaining peace every day.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:00.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the thought if you go
to 1 Peter chapter 3, please.

01:02:00.426 --> 01:02:02.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does take effort.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:06.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:10:

01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:10.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For ‘whoever would love life
and see good days

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:13.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘must guard his tongue from bad

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and his lips from speaking deception.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:21.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let him turn away
from what is bad and do what is good;

01:02:21.072 --> 01:02:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[now notice] let him seek

01:02:24.033 --> 01:02:27.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace and pursue it.’”

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:30.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, effort is needed
to turn from bad and do good.

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:35.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seek peace and pursue it”
—two action verbs.

01:02:35.837 --> 01:02:38.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to illustrate that,
think of a policeman

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeking, pursuing, a criminal.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The criminal is trying
to get away, isn’t he?

01:02:43.553 --> 01:02:46.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, peace tries to get away
from us because of imperfection,

01:02:46.848 --> 01:02:49.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to pursue it.

01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, the Bible links

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace to happiness.

01:02:54.439 --> 01:02:59.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 12:20,
the theme scripture for this talk, says:

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:04.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who promote peace have joy.”

01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:08.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 5:9:
“Happy are the peacemakers,

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they will be called sons of God.”

01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:14.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it didn’t say,
“Happy are the peaceful.”

01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:17.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just tranquil, passive

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:19.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even a dead body is peaceful.

01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:23.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, “happy are the peacemakers.”

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:26.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A peacemaker
actively promotes peace.

01:03:26.638 --> 01:03:29.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes peace
where it previously was lacking.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about cows,
they make milk;

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:37.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bees make honey;
a cheesemaker makes cheese;

01:03:37.482 --> 01:03:39.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a peacemaker makes peace.

01:03:39.692 --> 01:03:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s been lost;
it’s been disturbed;

01:03:42.237 --> 01:03:46.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he has skill in restoring it and,
of course, a peacemaker

01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:51.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoids doing anything that would disturb
the peace in the first place.

01:03:51.454 --> 01:03:55.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He works very hard
to create an environment

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where peace can prevail.

01:03:58.628 --> 01:04:02.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now that leads us into the discussion
about how peacemakers

01:04:02.924 --> 01:04:06.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoid the two peace destroyers:

01:04:06.553 --> 01:04:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jealousy and contentiousness.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these two peace disturbers
are identified

01:04:14.477 --> 01:04:16.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in James chapter 3.

01:04:16.646 --> 01:04:18.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go there, please.

01:04:18.648 --> 01:04:20.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In James chapter 3,

01:04:20.692 --> 01:04:24.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together
verses 14 and 15:

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:29.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But if you have bitter jealousy

01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:32.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and contentiousness in your hearts,

01:04:32.162 --> 01:04:35.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not be bragging
and lying against the truth.

01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:40.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not the wisdom
that comes down from above;

01:04:40.462 --> 01:04:44.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is earthly,
animalistic, demonic.”

01:04:44.633 --> 01:04:47.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice first
that jealousy is identified.

01:04:47.886 --> 01:04:49.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is jealousy?

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:54.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to resent someone
because of his possessions,

01:04:54.017 --> 01:04:56.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talents, or position.

01:04:56.478 --> 01:05:01.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than be happy for him,
we resent him,

01:05:01.024 --> 01:05:06.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe even dislike him for what he has
—usually things that we don’t have.

01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:10.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what makes this very serious
is that jealousy can escalate

01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:13.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being envy.

01:05:13.537 --> 01:05:18.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is envy, and what’s the difference
between envy and jealousy?

01:05:18.166 --> 01:05:21.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Biblical reference work says this:

01:05:21.253 --> 01:05:24.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jealousy’ . . . refers to the desire

01:05:24.798 --> 01:05:27.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be as well off as another,

01:05:27.467 --> 01:05:31.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . [but] ‘envy’ refers

01:05:31.054 --> 01:05:35.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the desire to deprive
another of what he has.”

01:05:35.434 --> 01:05:39.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the envious person
not only begrudges what someone has

01:05:39.813 --> 01:05:42.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he actually wants
to take it away from him.

01:05:42.399 --> 01:05:46.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That second peace destroyer
is contentiousness.

01:05:46.778 --> 01:05:48.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:53.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being disagreeable, argumentative,
competitive—a terrible quality.

01:05:53.327 --> 01:05:56.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the product of pride
and selfish ambition.

01:05:56.371 --> 01:05:59.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read earlier
at James 3:14, 15,

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:03.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s certainly not part of that “wisdom
that comes down from above,”

01:06:03.378 --> 01:06:05.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, it is “earthly,”

01:06:05.714 --> 01:06:10.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of earthly humans
who are alienated from God.

01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:12.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is animalistic,

01:06:12.679 --> 01:06:16.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of animals
who lack spirituality

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:19.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are often contentious
with each other.

01:06:19.311 --> 01:06:21.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is even demonic,

01:06:21.438 --> 01:06:24.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
characteristic of the wicked spirits

01:06:24.316 --> 01:06:27.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are very proud and ambitious.

01:06:27.486 --> 01:06:30.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But genuine peacemakers
work very hard

01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:34.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid
these two peace disturbers:

01:06:34.868 --> 01:06:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jealousy and contentiousness.

01:06:37.454 --> 01:06:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They neither flaunt their talents
nor do they feel threatened

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:44.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if others
are more skilled preachers, teachers,

01:06:44.837 --> 01:06:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
organizers, or shepherds.

01:06:47.756 --> 01:06:51.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re very happy
to be considered “a lesser one,”

01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:55.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus encouraged
at Luke 9:48.

01:06:55.347 --> 01:07:00.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true that a peacemaker
may desire certain privileges of service,

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he is not consumed with ambition.

01:07:02.897 --> 01:07:05.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s balanced in his approach,

01:07:05.357 --> 01:07:08.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it says at 1 Timothy 3:1:

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a man is reaching out
to be an overseer,

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is desirous of a fine work.”

01:07:15.785 --> 01:07:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t say that he
should ambitiously “grab”

01:07:19.455 --> 01:07:22.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be an overseer; he’s balanced.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:24.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate this

01:07:24.168 --> 01:07:27.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reaching out for a nice,
tasty piece of fruit on a tree.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think of a small boy

01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:34.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively grabbing for a toy,

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:37.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps to try to take it
away from another boy.

01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:40.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a real difference,
isn’t there?

01:07:40.184 --> 01:07:43.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, how does
a peacemaker reach out

01:07:43.187 --> 01:07:45.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to qualify
for privileges of service?

01:07:45.898 --> 01:07:47.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he just works hard

01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop Christian qualities
within himself,

01:07:51.112 --> 01:07:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he just works hard
in behalf of Kingdom interests.

01:07:54.824 --> 01:07:58.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s guided by Galatians 6:4,

01:07:58.494 --> 01:08:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“He will have cause for rejoicing

01:08:01.664 --> 01:08:04.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in regard to himself alone,

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:08.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not in comparison
with the other person.”

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:12.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, a real peacemaker
humbly waits on Jehovah

01:08:12.967 --> 01:08:17.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to determine when he’s qualified
to receive a certain privilege.

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:19.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows, doesn’t he?

01:08:19.932 --> 01:08:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love the account about Moses,

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:25.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how when he was 40 years old,

01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:27.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really thought
he was qualified

01:08:27.273 --> 01:08:31.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ready to lead
the Israelites out of Egypt—

01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:34.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah knew
he wasn’t ready yet.

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:37.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, after tending flocks

01:08:37.408 --> 01:08:41.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 40 years in Midian,
when he was now 80 years old,

01:08:41.704 --> 01:08:44.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knew
that now he was ready.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:48.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, at this point,
Moses thought he wasn’t ready,

01:08:48.252 --> 01:08:51.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah
assured him that he was.

01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:55.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when a peacemaker
does receive a privilege of service,

01:08:55.593 --> 01:08:59.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he credits receiving it to Jehovah

01:08:59.514 --> 01:09:02.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not as a personal achievement.

01:09:02.934 --> 01:09:06.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to conclude this portion
of our talk about avoiding

01:09:06.688 --> 01:09:10.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these peace disturbers, we say,

01:09:10.316 --> 01:09:14.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May we all strive
to be genuine peacemakers,

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“analyzing ourselves and praying
for Jehovah’s spirit

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to help us to avoid
any tendency to be jealous,

01:09:22.745 --> 01:09:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to envy, or to be contentious
with our brothers.”

01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:31.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s talk about some things
we can do personally

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to promote peace and joy.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s talk quickly
about six things we can do.

01:09:37.677 --> 01:09:42.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
Cultivate humility and modesty.

01:09:42.682 --> 01:09:47.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility means to consider others
superior to ourselves.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:51.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Modesty means to be aware
of our own limitations.

01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:55.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we have
those two closely related qualities,

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:59.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to apply Romans 12:3,

01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:02.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that we
should not ‘think more of ourselves

01:10:02.827 --> 01:10:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘than it is necessary to think,

01:10:05.247 --> 01:10:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to think
so as to have a sound mind.’

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the second thing
we can do to promote joy and peace:

01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:15.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate and value

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good qualities
and talents of others.

01:10:19.886 --> 01:10:23.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on their good points,
not their flaws.

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:27.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how thankful we can be
that Jehovah does that with us.

01:10:27.018 --> 01:10:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we’d be doomed,
wouldn’t we?

01:10:29.563 --> 01:10:33.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe you heard
the illustration of a brother

01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:36.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding up a white piece of paper

01:10:36.194 --> 01:10:39.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a red spot in the middle

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asking an audience
what they see.

01:10:42.534 --> 01:10:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, most say
that they see a red spot.

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:47.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he points out
that actually 99 percent

01:10:47.998 --> 01:10:51.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they’re looking at
is white paper.

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:54.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we tend to notice the spot.

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:56.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we’re not careful,
that’s what we can do with our brothers

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—notice that flaw
rather than all the good qualities.

01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:02.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But may all of us cultivate

01:11:02.763 --> 01:11:05.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jehovahlike quality

01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:10.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of noticing,
appreciating, and valuing

01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:14.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good qualities of our brothers.

01:11:14.024 --> 01:11:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a third thing we can do:

01:11:16.026 --> 01:11:19.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never presume that fellow Christians

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are trying to outdo us.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:25.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 13:7 says
that love “believes”

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love “hopes all things.”

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:29.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we believe (we hope)

01:11:29.456 --> 01:11:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers are doing
what they’re doing out of a good motive

01:11:33.418 --> 01:11:36.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to please Jehovah,
not to outdo us.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we remember, Jehovah
has appointed only one Judge, Jesus.

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:42.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are no judge.

01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:47.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have no right
to negatively judge our brothers’ motives.

01:11:47.725 --> 01:11:52.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a fourth thing we can do:
Strive to always rejoice

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:56.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over our brothers’ privileges
and successes.

01:11:56.942 --> 01:12:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:15:
“Rejoice with those who rejoice;

01:12:01.697 --> 01:12:04.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weep with those who weep.”

01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:06.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, which is easier?

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, generally, it’s not so hard

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to weep with someone
who’s had some tragedy.

01:12:11.749 --> 01:12:13.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what if some really good things

01:12:13.834 --> 01:12:16.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happen to them
and it hasn’t happened to us? 

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:18.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m so happy.

01:12:18.047 --> 01:12:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just got appointed
as a regular pioneer.’

01:12:20.883 --> 01:12:24.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we were really hoping
to get into the pioneer work ourself,

01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:26.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we haven’t been able to do it.

01:12:26.597 --> 01:12:30.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we going to really be happy
from our heart with our brother?

01:12:30.768 --> 01:12:34.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we love our brother
and we love Jehovah,

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re going to work really hard
to have that right attitude from our heart.

01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:43.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will smash
any hint of jealousy;

01:12:43.364 --> 01:12:46.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll smash it with love.

01:12:46.492 --> 01:12:49.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s a fifth thing we can do:

01:12:49.286 --> 01:12:51.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithfully support those

01:12:51.831 --> 01:12:56.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve in responsible positions,
such as the elders.

01:12:56.711 --> 01:12:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And obviously doing that,

01:12:59.046 --> 01:13:01.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
supporting these ones
that are taking the lead,

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:06.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
definitely promotes peace
and joy in the congregation.

01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:11.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one more thing:
Center your life on serving Jehovah

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping others

01:13:13.102 --> 01:13:16.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than focusing on ourselves,

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:19.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe our feelings,

01:13:19.025 --> 01:13:21.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our perceived reputation.

01:13:21.944 --> 01:13:24.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we focus on serving Jehovah

01:13:24.989 --> 01:13:27.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping our brothers,
we’ll truly be

01:13:27.909 --> 01:13:31.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace promoters
in the congregation.

01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:34.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing those six things, we’ll prove

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re peacemakers
(peace promoters)

01:13:37.126 --> 01:13:40.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are reflecting
the wisdom from above.

01:13:40.004 --> 01:13:41.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the thought again.

01:13:41.506 --> 01:13:43.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to James chapter 3

01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:46.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that wisdom from above.

01:13:46.219 --> 01:13:48.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s what
we want to reflect on.

01:13:48.846 --> 01:13:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In James chapter 3,

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s take a look
this time at verse 13:

01:13:55.019 --> 01:13:58.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who is wise
and understanding among you?

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:01.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let him by his fine conduct

01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:05.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“demonstrate works
performed with a mildness

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from wisdom.”

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then drop down to verse 17:

01:14:10.368 --> 01:14:14.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the wisdom
from above is first of all pure,

01:14:14.956 --> 01:14:18.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then [now notice] peaceable

01:14:18.293 --> 01:14:23.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[It didn’t say peaceful, passive
but peaceable—that means a peacemaker.],

01:14:23.298 --> 01:14:26.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reasonable, ready to obey,

01:14:26.134 --> 01:14:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“full of mercy and good fruits,
impartial, not hypocritical.

01:14:31.139 --> 01:14:34.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, the fruit
of righteousness is sown

01:14:34.893 --> 01:14:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in peaceful conditions

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who are making peace.”

01:14:41.316 --> 01:14:45.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’re encouraged
to be a peacemaker.

01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this,
we bring joy to ourselves

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:51.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we impart joy to others and,

01:14:51.576 --> 01:14:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most importantly,
we make Jehovah rejoice.

01:14:56.372 --> 01:15:00.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think about this:
Once a peacemaker

01:15:00.543 --> 01:15:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean
always a peacemaker.

01:15:03.713 --> 01:15:06.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to keep working
at this quality.

01:15:06.883 --> 01:15:09.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this will be well-illustrated

01:15:09.219 --> 01:15:13.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following video interview.

01:15:16.267 --> 01:15:18.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got married in 2002.

01:15:18.269 --> 01:15:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around that time,

01:15:19.521 --> 01:15:21.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed a ministerial servant,

01:15:21.272 --> 01:15:24.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my wife and I
were serving as regular pioneers.

01:15:25.819 --> 01:15:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2004,

01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:30.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were given the opportunity
to serve as special pioneers.

01:15:31.866 --> 01:15:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was something that we really wanted

01:15:35.078 --> 01:15:37.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we got that assignment,

01:15:38.623 --> 01:15:40.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were delighted.

01:15:41.459 --> 01:15:44.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in the congregation
were also very happy for us.

01:15:49.092 --> 01:15:51.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But everything did not go smoothly.

01:15:51.469 --> 01:15:54.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As time went on,
I faced some difficult situations.

01:15:56.141 --> 01:16:00.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact that I was not appointed
as an elder made me feel disappointed.

01:16:02.647 --> 01:16:04.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation,

01:16:04.274 --> 01:16:07.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two brothers who had served
as ministerial servants

01:16:07.444 --> 01:16:10.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a shorter time than I had
were appointed as elders.

01:16:12.657 --> 01:16:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that those brothers 
did not have as much experience as I had.

01:16:16.912 --> 01:16:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘I am the one with the experience,

01:16:19.456 --> 01:16:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so why didn’t I get appointed?’

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to question my own qualifications,

01:16:23.877 --> 01:16:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this made me very sad.

01:16:27.297 --> 01:16:29.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the two brothers were appointed,

01:16:29.299 --> 01:16:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to dislike them.

01:16:32.469 --> 01:16:34.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also angry with them,

01:16:34.638 --> 01:16:36.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the anger even progressed

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little toward hatred.

01:16:40.727 --> 01:16:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a real challenge for me
to serve in that congregation.

01:16:43.897 --> 01:16:46.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attending meetings was difficult;

01:16:46.441 --> 01:16:48.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would go with a heavy heart.

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I put a lot of effort
into making personal changes

01:16:53.115 --> 01:16:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—changing my attitude
and getting rid of my negative traits.

01:16:56.702 --> 01:16:59.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if I did nothing,

01:16:59.371 --> 01:17:01.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to affect the worship
I gave to Jehovah

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the relationship with my brothers.

01:17:05.377 --> 01:17:09.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
could end up completely losing our joy.

01:17:09.882 --> 01:17:13.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to make things right,
I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spent time in deep, personal Bible study.

01:17:17.598 --> 01:17:19.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife would also find articles

01:17:19.641 --> 01:17:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about maintaining peace with the brothers

01:17:21.685 --> 01:17:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would give them to me to read.

01:17:23.854 --> 01:17:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She even selected Kingdom songs
that dealt with maintaining peace,

01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she would sing them to me.

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a lot of changes to my attitude
and worked hard to progress

01:17:35.658 --> 01:17:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a person whom Jehovah would approve.

01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to view my brothers

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:43.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same way Jehovah did
and to serve him with joy.

01:17:46.794 --> 01:17:50.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wanted to give
my best to Jehovah and to the brothers.

01:17:51.465 --> 01:17:53.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, I did not want

01:17:53.676 --> 01:17:56.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those wrong thoughts
to ever come back into my heart.

01:18:00.516 --> 01:18:02.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The valuable lesson that I have learned

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:05.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that privileges are not most important.

01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is serving Jehovah
that brings genuine happiness.

01:18:09.024 --> 01:18:12.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now I am finding
real joy and satisfaction

01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my service to Jehovah.

01:18:16.198 --> 01:18:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may each of us
prayerfully work to have the attitude

01:18:21.203 --> 01:18:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of wanting
to be a peacemaker.

01:18:24.415 --> 01:18:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do this,
we prove to Jehovah

01:18:28.085 --> 01:18:32.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re the kind of person
that he wants in his new world.

01:18:32.673 --> 01:18:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 37:11,
it says of the new world:

01:18:36.677 --> 01:18:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The meek will possess the earth,
and they will find [their] exquisite delight

01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

01:18:44.477 --> 01:18:47.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the new world
will be a very peaceful place.

01:18:47.438 --> 01:18:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re a peace promoter now,
we will convince Jehovah

01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:56.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will be an asset
toward that peace of his new world.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:19:01.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
In the new world, it will be natural

01:19:01.035 --> 01:19:05.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for perfect people to just display peace

01:19:05.122 --> 01:19:07.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this beautiful aspect

01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fruitage of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:12.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right now,
we have to work at it, don’t we?

01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to seek peace; pursue it.

01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:18.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re a peace pursuer now,

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will convince Jehovah

01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will be a peace displayer

01:19:23.891 --> 01:19:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his righteous new world,
and he’ll want us to be there.

01:19:28.104 --> 01:19:31.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s diligently promote peace

01:19:31.482 --> 01:19:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute toward the strength
and the happiness

01:19:36.446 --> 01:19:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s beautiful organization
(which really is a modern-day miracle),

01:19:41.325 --> 01:19:46.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering that those
who promote peace have joy

01:19:46.164 --> 01:19:48.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and impart joy to others.

01:19:48.875 --> 01:19:52.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they make
Jehovah’s heart rejoice,

01:19:52.045 --> 01:19:57.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all that rejoicing
will last forever.

01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:02.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lett, for helping us
to see how we can contribute

01:20:02.388 --> 01:20:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to peace and joy among our brotherhood.

01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:10.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now come to the final talk
of today’s program.

01:20:10.063 --> 01:20:15.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we truly be joyful
in these difficult last days?

01:20:15.068 --> 01:20:18.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can Jesus’ example help us to find joy?

01:20:18.696 --> 01:20:20.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give your full attention

01:20:20.698 --> 01:20:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother Anthony Morris
of the Governing Body

01:20:23.117 --> 01:20:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he presents the talk

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close Friendship With Jehovah
Brings the Greatest Joy!”

01:20:37.507 --> 01:20:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you look forward to?

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:43.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:46.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look forward to perfection.

01:20:46.391 --> 01:20:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look forward to eternal life

01:20:49.853 --> 01:20:53.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a beautiful paradise earth.

01:20:54.941 --> 01:20:59.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, with all of this
wonderful future before us,

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about in the meantime?

01:21:03.241 --> 01:21:05.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suffer from crime.

01:21:05.285 --> 01:21:08.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suffer from natural disasters,

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:11.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this pandemic we suffer from,

01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:16.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sickness, poverty, war,
and other calamities.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, as the Scriptures
mention in Romans:

01:21:19.424 --> 01:21:23.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All creation
keeps on groaning together.”

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up,

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is something
we want you to reflect on.

01:21:29.309 --> 01:21:31.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a thought-provoking question:

01:21:31.812 --> 01:21:36.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should the rest of our days
in this wicked system of things

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:40.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be defined by grief?

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

01:21:42.489 --> 01:21:45.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not.

01:21:45.617 --> 01:21:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want
the remainder of our time

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:53.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be controlled
by all the problems and the grief

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:56.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mankind is suffering.

01:21:56.128 --> 01:22:00.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us,
even during these times,

01:22:00.424 --> 01:22:04.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy our lives while we wait

01:22:04.177 --> 01:22:06.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the fulfillment

01:22:06.179 --> 01:22:09.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his prophecies
and his promises to us

01:22:11.018 --> 01:22:16.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(now, we’re going to establish
that for you Scripturally),

01:22:16.023 --> 01:22:18.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though hardship befalls us

01:22:18.692 --> 01:22:22.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation
and during the great tribulation.

01:22:22.988 --> 01:22:25.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this Scriptural counsel found

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible book of Habakkuk.

01:22:28.785 --> 01:22:32.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk chapter 3,

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read

01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:39.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 17 and 18:

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although the fig tree may not blossom,

01:22:44.384 --> 01:22:47.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there may be no fruit on the vines;

01:22:47.805 --> 01:22:50.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although the olive crop may fail,

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:53.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the fields may produce no food;

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“although the flock
may disappear from the pen,

01:22:57.189 --> 01:23:00.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there may be no cattle in the stalls;

01:23:02.069 --> 01:23:06.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[dire circumstances
—don’t you agree?—but notice verse 18]

01:23:06.657 --> 01:23:10.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yet, as for me,

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will exalt in Jehovah;

01:23:13.038 --> 01:23:17.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will be joyful
in the God of my salvation.”

01:23:18.419 --> 01:23:22.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even during these dire circumstances,

01:23:22.256 --> 01:23:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was able to say

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(with all of this going on):
“As for me, I <i>will</i> exalt in Jehovah.”

01:23:29.763 --> 01:23:31.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And not, “I hope I can,”

01:23:31.891 --> 01:23:35.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “I <i>will</i> exult in Jehovah;

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I <i>will</i> be joyful
in the God of my salvation.”

01:23:40.483 --> 01:23:44.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s, really, his close friendship

01:23:44.236 --> 01:23:47.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God that enables him

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:49.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to still have joy.

01:23:49.909 --> 01:23:51.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the theme of this talk,

01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:56.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close Friendship With Jehovah
Brings the Greatest Joy!”

01:23:56.916 --> 01:24:00.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we’re waiting patiently,

01:24:00.544 --> 01:24:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to rejoice.

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:07.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world can’t understand that reasoning,

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:11.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s what Jehovah wants for his people

01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:16.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just a wonderful promise for us to focus on.

01:24:16.477 --> 01:24:19.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the psalmist helps us to appreciate

01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:22.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this isn’t just some dream

01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:24.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have a close friendship

01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:28.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Sovereign of the universe,
the Almighty God.

01:24:28.489 --> 01:24:32.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, notice here in Psalm 25.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:36.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll read that together,

01:24:36.122 --> 01:24:38.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 25,

01:24:38.624 --> 01:24:42.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is a Scriptural assurance.

01:24:42.795 --> 01:24:45.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 14:

01:24:47.091 --> 01:24:51.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah
belongs to those who fear him,

01:24:51.637 --> 01:24:54.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he makes his covenant
 known to them.”

01:24:54.599 --> 01:24:56.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

01:24:56.976 --> 01:25:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah”

01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s possible.

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:04.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a reality.

01:25:04.275 --> 01:25:05.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us.

01:25:05.693 --> 01:25:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not just dreaming when we speak
about having this close friendship

01:25:10.698 --> 01:25:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God.

01:25:12.742 --> 01:25:16.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful,
wonderful reality that we enjoy.

01:25:16.371 --> 01:25:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it brings such joy

01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:22.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have this closeness with Jehovah God.

01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what helps with this

01:25:25.004 --> 01:25:29.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(being able to make sure
we have this close friendship)

01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes down to acquiring

01:25:32.595 --> 01:25:36.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “mental disposition” of Jesus.

01:25:36.266 --> 01:25:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has ever been closer
to Jehovah than Jesus

01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:43.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—prehuman existence,
during his earthly ministry,

01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:47.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and upon his resurrection
—so close to Jehovah.

01:25:47.527 --> 01:25:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for us to really capture
how we can have

01:25:50.029 --> 01:25:54.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a close friendship with Jehovah,
we need to learn to think

01:25:54.701 --> 01:25:59.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel like Jesus did and still does.

01:25:59.664 --> 01:26:02.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we imitate his example,

01:26:02.584 --> 01:26:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it increases our joy.

01:26:05.628 --> 01:26:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this talk, we’re going to discuss

01:26:10.133 --> 01:26:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two aspects of Jesus’ mental disposition.

01:26:15.138 --> 01:26:17.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first aspect

01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:20.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how Jesus
showed unselfish love

01:26:20.393 --> 01:26:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that drew him close to his Father.

01:26:22.604 --> 01:26:26.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He found absolute joy
in showing neighborly love

01:26:26.566 --> 01:26:29.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing good to others.

01:26:29.277 --> 01:26:32.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this artwork here, please.

01:26:34.699 --> 01:26:39.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave from his heart unselfishly.

01:26:44.167 --> 01:26:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Jesus’ feelings
when he met someone who needed help.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:37.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Jesus and the joy of helping others.

01:27:37.304 --> 01:27:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just very evident.

01:27:39.348 --> 01:27:42.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the closeness with his Father
—they could see it.

01:27:42.059 --> 01:27:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disciples rejoiced.

01:27:44.227 --> 01:27:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a perfect example
of being close to Jehovah!

01:27:49.232 --> 01:27:53.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result?
Joy.

01:27:53.195 --> 01:27:55.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what we want to keep in mind.

01:27:55.906 --> 01:27:59.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus set that example for us.

01:28:01.078 --> 01:28:06.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By being generous, Jesus taught us

01:28:06.083 --> 01:28:11.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to practice what he did,
practice what he preached and taught.

01:28:11.088 --> 01:28:14.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice here in Luke chapter 6,

01:28:14.842 --> 01:28:17.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we learn because he lived this.

01:28:17.636 --> 01:28:22.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had such freeness of speech
to make these things

01:28:24.184 --> 01:28:27.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clear to those who listened to him.

01:28:27.104 --> 01:28:29.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke chapter 6

01:28:29.314 --> 01:28:32.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and talk about being generous!

01:28:32.609 --> 01:28:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus obviously was.

01:28:34.403 --> 01:28:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verse 38 of Luke chapter 6:

01:28:40.367 --> 01:28:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Practice giving,
and people will give to you.

01:28:44.038 --> 01:28:48.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will pour into your laps
a fine measure, pressed down,

01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:51.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“shaken together, and overflowing.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For with the measure
that you are measuring out,

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will measure out to you in return.”

01:28:59.303 --> 01:29:03.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, a beautiful lesson here:

01:29:03.307 --> 01:29:05.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be generous.

01:29:05.309 --> 01:29:08.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was so generous with his time

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:11.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the things he did with his disciples.

01:29:11.273 --> 01:29:13.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the lesson being:

01:29:13.859 --> 01:29:16.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The measure you show
in the way of being generous

01:29:16.987 --> 01:29:19.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it comes in return.

01:29:19.323 --> 01:29:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sometimes people in the world

01:29:22.451 --> 01:29:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they have stated things.

01:29:25.788 --> 01:29:30.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I heard these things when I
first became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses:

01:29:30.334 --> 01:29:33.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You people—you don’t celebrate holidays.

01:29:33.671 --> 01:29:35.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re stingy.”

01:29:35.881 --> 01:29:38.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:29:38.259 --> 01:29:42.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t celebrate holidays
that offend our God,

01:29:42.847 --> 01:29:45.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one we love and worship.

01:29:45.224 --> 01:29:48.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just because we
don’t celebrate these holidays

01:29:48.769 --> 01:29:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there’s gift-giving
doesn’t mean we’re not generous.

01:29:52.481 --> 01:29:55.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to give gifts.

01:29:55.443 --> 01:29:57.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy giving

01:29:57.903 --> 01:30:01.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s what Jehovah
wants us to do.

01:30:01.157 --> 01:30:05.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look for opportunities to be generous.

01:30:05.161 --> 01:30:10.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, keep your Bibles here at Luke chapter 6.

01:30:10.166 --> 01:30:13.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient with each other.

01:30:13.794 --> 01:30:16.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are some things
we’re going to discuss here.

01:30:16.547 --> 01:30:21.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to apply the counsel,
and we’re passing this on for your benefit

01:30:21.552 --> 01:30:24.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(some things to think about),
and if you see an area where you’d need

01:30:24.931 --> 01:30:29.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make improvement,
well, by all means, do so.

01:30:29.811 --> 01:30:34.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll keep you close to Jehovah,
and you’ll have abundant,

01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:38.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great joy as a result
of applying his counsel.

01:30:38.403 --> 01:30:42.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 37
(right before verse 38)

01:30:42.407 --> 01:30:46.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice: “Moreover,

01:30:46.369 --> 01:30:50.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stop judging, and you
will by no means be judged;

01:30:50.915 --> 01:30:55.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and stop condemning,
and you will by no means be condemned.

01:30:55.586 --> 01:31:00.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep on forgiving,
and you will be forgiven.”

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:05.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very priceless counsel
on the need to be forgiving

01:31:05.305 --> 01:31:07.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah and Jesus certainly are.

01:31:07.432 --> 01:31:10.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also (you’ll notice in verse 37)

01:31:10.602 --> 01:31:14.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stated: “Stop judging.”

01:31:14.898 --> 01:31:16.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just stop it!

01:31:16.983 --> 01:31:19.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t say: “Don’t judge.”

01:31:19.611 --> 01:31:21.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Stop judging.”

01:31:21.946 --> 01:31:23.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:31:23.615 --> 01:31:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that’s imperfect human inclination

01:31:27.869 --> 01:31:31.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to judge, to judge others.

01:31:31.247 --> 01:31:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes even in the congregation,

01:31:34.501 --> 01:31:37.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some can become overly critical.

01:31:37.337 --> 01:31:41.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can become resentful, envious.

01:31:41.883 --> 01:31:45.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And envy is so destructive.

01:31:45.637 --> 01:31:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody might have materialistic prosperity;

01:31:48.723 --> 01:31:53.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they might enjoy privileges
that you don’t have in the congregation;

01:31:53.478 --> 01:31:56.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others might find them very endearing,

01:31:56.481 --> 01:31:59.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so envy can creep in.

01:31:59.609 --> 01:32:03.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, frankly, it’s unhealthy physically

01:32:03.571 --> 01:32:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritually.

01:32:05.782 --> 01:32:09.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what I
mean by that with this proverb.

01:32:09.035 --> 01:32:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Proverbs, if you would, please.

01:32:12.622 --> 01:32:16.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the inspired counsel

01:32:16.334 --> 01:32:18.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very, very clear.

01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:23.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 14 and the 30th verse:

01:32:24.342 --> 01:32:27.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A calm heart gives life
to the body, [now notice]

01:32:27.846 --> 01:32:30.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but jealousy
[or envy, these other things]

01:32:30.765 --> 01:32:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is rottenness to the bones.”

01:32:33.476 --> 01:32:37.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If your bones are rotten
and the bone is so important

01:32:37.564 --> 01:32:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(all the bones in our body)
toward good physical health,

01:32:41.151 --> 01:32:43.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the same thing spiritually.

01:32:43.528 --> 01:32:46.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re jealous,

01:32:46.364 --> 01:32:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s rottenness to us
in a spiritual way as well.

01:32:51.161 --> 01:32:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing is that Jehovah doesn’t feel

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:59.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would be wanting
this close friendship with somebody

01:32:59.628 --> 01:33:02.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has this issue and doesn’t work on it,

01:33:02.464 --> 01:33:05.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t work to correct it.

01:33:05.175 --> 01:33:10.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we work on thinking
about some of these things,

01:33:10.097 --> 01:33:12.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can actually personally increase

01:33:12.975 --> 01:33:15.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy in our congregation.

01:33:15.519 --> 01:33:19.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that takes us
to another Scriptural thought

01:33:19.398 --> 01:33:21.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to address here in this talk

01:33:21.817 --> 01:33:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about having a close friendship with Jehovah.

01:33:24.861 --> 01:33:28.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice 1 Peter chapter 4,

01:33:28.699 --> 01:33:32.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll remember this verse
(most of you listening),

01:33:32.786 --> 01:33:34.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter chapter 4,

01:33:34.872 --> 01:33:38.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 15,

01:33:39.751 --> 01:33:42.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter 4:15:

01:33:42.087 --> 01:33:46.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, let none of you
suffer as a murderer

01:33:46.675 --> 01:33:50.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or a thief or a wrongdoer
[now notice]

01:33:50.512 --> 01:33:55.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a busybody
in other people’s matters.”

01:33:55.267 --> 01:33:58.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously,
murder and being a thief

01:33:58.771 --> 01:34:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these are terrible sins
against Jehovah God.

01:34:02.191 --> 01:34:06.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right after that,
he mentions “a busybody.”

01:34:06.570 --> 01:34:09.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, literally in the original language

01:34:09.698 --> 01:34:13.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and this has always helped me
with this inspired thought),

01:34:13.911 --> 01:34:17.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a busybody” is literally “overseer

01:34:17.915 --> 01:34:21.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what is another’s.”

01:34:21.126 --> 01:34:23.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that tell you?

01:34:23.587 --> 01:34:28.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if it’s
not your responsibility to oversee

01:34:28.342 --> 01:34:30.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this particular issue,

01:34:30.386 --> 01:34:34.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you can keep in mind the need

01:34:34.014 --> 01:34:38.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mind your own business.

01:34:38.018 --> 01:34:42.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are against busybodies.

01:34:42.648 --> 01:34:45.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They disturb the peace of congregations;

01:34:45.734 --> 01:34:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they interfere with the congregations
enjoying the joy.

01:34:49.905 --> 01:34:53.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we refrain from imposing

01:34:53.033 --> 01:34:56.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our uninspired opinions on others

01:34:56.162 --> 01:35:01.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or debating about matters of personal choice.

01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:04.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have some concerns?
Talk to Jehovah God about it.

01:35:04.295 --> 01:35:09.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if it’s a personal concern,
don’t be a busybody.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are very clear.

01:35:11.552 --> 01:35:16.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay away from that
—developing this negative spirit

01:35:16.557 --> 01:35:20.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could disrupt the peace
of the congregation.

01:35:20.144 --> 01:35:23.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you watch the following video,

01:35:23.356 --> 01:35:28.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our sister
worked at becoming more positive

01:35:28.361 --> 01:35:33.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that by doing so,
she increased her joy.

01:35:34.867 --> 01:35:39.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had a lifelong struggle
with a negative attitude.

01:35:39.288 --> 01:35:41.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My negative disposition

01:35:41.916 --> 01:35:44.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made me a very impatient,

01:35:44.043 --> 01:35:46.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sarcastic, and demanding person.

01:35:46.921 --> 01:35:51.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, out in field service,
I had insulted a partner of mine,

01:35:51.676 --> 01:35:54.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the entire day was ruined.

01:35:54.804 --> 01:35:57.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother was in the car.

01:35:57.765 --> 01:36:01.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very upset with the situation.

01:36:01.102 --> 01:36:04.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She told me that I had a negative attitude

01:36:04.355 --> 01:36:08.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was not allowed inside the house
until that sister forgave me.

01:36:08.693 --> 01:36:12.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked the sister to lunch.

01:36:12.029 --> 01:36:17.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one of the most difficult
and uncomfortable situations I have been in.

01:36:17.034 --> 01:36:21.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to make a self-examination.

01:36:21.873 --> 01:36:25.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was I negative?
Why was I so unhappy?

01:36:25.752 --> 01:36:27.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because I stopped pioneering

01:36:27.795 --> 01:36:31.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my friends continued
in their full-time service to Jehovah.

01:36:31.591 --> 01:36:33.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that made me very frustrated,

01:36:33.885 --> 01:36:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them continue this while I was stuck.

01:36:36.846 --> 01:36:40.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I acknowledged
that I had this negative attitude,

01:36:40.475 --> 01:36:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prompted me to beg Jehovah
to help me to make changes.

01:36:44.687 --> 01:36:49.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The friends in the congregation who I spent
a lot of time with were not bad people.

01:36:49.484 --> 01:36:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their imperfection
fueled my negative attitude,

01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:56.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really had to put that fire out.

01:36:58.284 --> 01:37:02.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personal study was a major help,
along with my prayers to Jehovah,

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make these changes.

01:37:04.374 --> 01:37:09.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that I meditated on
was how Jesus acted with his disciples.

01:37:09.129 --> 01:37:11.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was hungry and he was tired,

01:37:11.965 --> 01:37:14.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was still very loving and kind.

01:37:14.676 --> 01:37:18.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I saw for myself
that when I was spiritually hungry,

01:37:18.012 --> 01:37:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affected my words and my actions
toward the brothers and sisters.

01:37:22.225 --> 01:37:27.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The keys to maintaining
Jesus’ mental disposition are prayer,

01:37:27.105 --> 01:37:29.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gratitude, and contentment.

01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:31.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My goal is to show

01:37:31.443 --> 01:37:34.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a grateful attitude
for the blessings that I receive

01:37:34.738 --> 01:37:37.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day and also to look

01:37:37.157 --> 01:37:40.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the good in people
—to show them that I care and I love them.

01:37:40.410 --> 01:37:43.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve learned that the more that I
give to the friends

01:37:43.246 --> 01:37:46.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to my family,
the happier that makes Jehovah,

01:37:46.833 --> 01:37:50.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Acts 20:35
and Hebrews 13:16 mention.

01:37:50.462 --> 01:37:54.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jehovah is happy,
that really makes me happy.

01:37:57.677 --> 01:38:01.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very thought-provoking video,
don’t you agree?

01:38:01.681 --> 01:38:05.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice
what lessons she learned

01:38:05.018 --> 01:38:08.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and we all benefit from it):
prayer,

01:38:08.021 --> 01:38:11.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gratitude, contentment

01:38:11.775 --> 01:38:14.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful that she could see that.

01:38:14.653 --> 01:38:19.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you have prayer
coupled with gratitude,

01:38:19.491 --> 01:38:24.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you show and display contentment,
you stay close to Jehovah.

01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:26.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that brings great joy

01:38:26.998 --> 01:38:30.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we applied the counsel.

01:38:30.377 --> 01:38:35.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second point
that we’re going to discuss in this talk is:

01:38:35.048 --> 01:38:37.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using practical wisdom

01:38:37.843 --> 01:38:40.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
increases our joy.

01:38:40.929 --> 01:38:45.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we made it clear that we want
to show unselfish love as Jesus did.

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:48.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re talking about practical wisdom

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how that increases our joy.

01:38:51.106 --> 01:38:54.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew
how important this counsel was.

01:38:54.359 --> 01:38:58.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He taught his disciples
that when it comes to treasures,

01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:01.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘store up treasures in heaven,

01:39:01.408 --> 01:39:05.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because where your treasure is,
that’s where your heart is going to be.’

01:39:05.996 --> 01:39:09.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he made that very clear,
trying to help them to appreciate

01:39:09.082 --> 01:39:11.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living a practical, simple life.

01:39:11.793 --> 01:39:15.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice here in this artwork how Jesus

01:39:15.797 --> 01:39:19.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is showing his disciples this
and how much joy they have

01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:23.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying that counsel
about keeping it simple.

01:39:26.558 --> 01:39:30.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that storing up
“treasures in heaven” brings joy.

01:39:33.607 --> 01:39:36.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy Jesus found

01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:40.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in sharing life’s simple pleasures 
with others.

01:40:24.742 --> 01:40:27.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they enjoyed their surroundings.

01:40:27.953 --> 01:40:29.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are rejoicing.

01:40:29.955 --> 01:40:34.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is comparing
(who has a certain amount of gold).

01:40:34.627 --> 01:40:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, this is just enjoying life

01:40:37.671 --> 01:40:41.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their close relationship
with Jehovah God.

01:40:41.675 --> 01:40:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by keeping our life simple,

01:40:45.721 --> 01:40:49.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we trust that Jehovah
will provide for our needs.

01:40:49.934 --> 01:40:53.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something I’ve said for years:

01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:58.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, Jehovah provides
for our needs, not our greeds.”

01:40:58.275 --> 01:41:03.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’re content
with the needs Jehovah provides for us,

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience great joy.

01:41:09.245 --> 01:41:12.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to avoid distractions
that could take us away

01:41:12.498 --> 01:41:16.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from wholeheartedly serving
our heavenly Father

01:41:16.627 --> 01:41:20.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or could even start to distance us from him.

01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:24.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is filled with practical wisdom
about physical health,

01:41:24.927 --> 01:41:27.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finances, family life.

01:41:27.305 --> 01:41:29.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when this counsel is applied,

01:41:29.307 --> 01:41:32.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can in many cases prevent problems

01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at least minimize them,

01:41:34.604 --> 01:41:38.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in these difficult last days.

01:41:38.524 --> 01:41:41.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Scriptures are very clear

01:41:41.194 --> 01:41:44.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we really peer
into Jehovah’s Word

01:41:44.864 --> 01:41:48.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and it’s been referred to
in the Bible book of James as “a mirror”),

01:41:48.993 --> 01:41:50.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s the benefit.

01:41:50.703 --> 01:41:54.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you will remember this
in James chapter 1.

01:41:54.874 --> 01:41:59.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how much we appreciate the wisdom

01:41:59.837 --> 01:42:03.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is found here at James chapter 1,

01:42:03.591 --> 01:42:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 25!

01:42:07.637 --> 01:42:12.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:25: “But the one
who peers into the perfect law

01:42:12.141 --> 01:42:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that belongs to freedom
and continues in it

01:42:16.145 --> 01:42:20.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has become, not a forgetful hearer,

01:42:20.024 --> 01:42:25.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a doer of the work;
and he will be happy in what he does.”

01:42:25.029 --> 01:42:29.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we take the time
to look into Jehovah’s Word

01:42:29.826 --> 01:42:32.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“peer” in—
it’s not just a glance.

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:37.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re peering “into the perfect law,”
but then we ‘continue in it.’

01:42:37.542 --> 01:42:41.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t read it and say,
“Oh, that was interesting”

01:42:41.004 --> 01:42:44.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then go off and forget it.

01:42:44.174 --> 01:42:48.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, a ‘doer of the word’

01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:51.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that means there’s application
of what we just read.

01:42:51.723 --> 01:42:53.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the result?

01:42:53.767 --> 01:42:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We “will be happy”—guaranteed!

01:42:57.687 --> 01:42:59.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jehovah promises.

01:42:59.814 --> 01:43:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it has to be applied
to have this benefit.

01:43:04.819 --> 01:43:08.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s a beautiful proverb.

01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is personal for all of us too.

01:43:11.534 --> 01:43:14.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to apply it,
just like all of you listening.

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:19.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do likewise
—Proverbs chapter 15.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:24.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this can happen
especially in these critical last days

01:43:24.297 --> 01:43:27.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are coming and continuing
to get worse and worse.

01:43:27.592 --> 01:43:32.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ve always loved this proverb,
and it’s helped me for decades,

01:43:32.556 --> 01:43:37.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I think many of you
would agree that it’s helped you.

01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if not, then benefit

01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wisdom here at Proverbs 15,

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 15:

01:43:45.735 --> 01:43:49.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the days of the afflicted one are bad,

01:43:49.865 --> 01:43:53.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the one with a cheerful heart

01:43:53.410 --> 01:43:56.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a continual feast.”

01:43:56.246 --> 01:43:59.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we need to let that sink in.

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:04.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the days”—so this means
day after day with this negative attitude

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:08.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(“poor me, poor me,
one affliction after the other”)

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:12.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the sister
in the video we saw earlier,

01:44:12.387 --> 01:44:16.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just absorbed with negative things.

01:44:16.141 --> 01:44:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then it’s contrasted

01:44:18.185 --> 01:44:21.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with having “a cheerful heart,”

01:44:21.813 --> 01:44:23.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s like having a feast.

01:44:23.815 --> 01:44:26.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So mentally and emotionally,

01:44:26.526 --> 01:44:31.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to benefit
from not needlessly focusing

01:44:31.281 --> 01:44:35.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the afflictions
and the things that we deal with.

01:44:35.452 --> 01:44:39.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That connects with what we
earlier talked about: prayer, gratitude,

01:44:39.206 --> 01:44:41.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contentment.

01:44:41.208 --> 01:44:46.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, agonizing over problems
that are beyond our control

01:44:48.173 --> 01:44:50.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not please God.

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:55.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do the best we can
with our circumstances.

01:44:55.639 --> 01:45:00.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to be daily afflicted
and agonizing over these things

01:45:00.144 --> 01:45:03.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we really have no control over

01:45:03.814 --> 01:45:07.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we do the best we can
to resolve our problems.

01:45:07.735 --> 01:45:10.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to focus on the more productive things.

01:45:10.946 --> 01:45:13.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What <i>can</i> we do?
What are the positive things?

01:45:13.824 --> 01:45:17.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this isn’t just
some psychological endeavor.

01:45:17.494 --> 01:45:20.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Scriptural direction

01:45:20.205 --> 01:45:25.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Scriptural advice—
and when applied, it really works.

01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:28.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blesses our efforts.

01:45:28.005 --> 01:45:30.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about it

01:45:30.007 --> 01:45:33.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and especially as I’m older now,
I can relate to it),

01:45:33.677 --> 01:45:37.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you older ones,
just keep in mind

01:45:37.014 --> 01:45:41.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just because you’re tired
doesn’t mean

01:45:41.226 --> 01:45:44.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t love Jehovah,
that you’re not close to him.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things have changed.

01:45:46.523 --> 01:45:48.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So keep your close friendship with him,

01:45:48.692 --> 01:45:52.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t dwell on the afflictions

01:45:52.404 --> 01:45:54.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being elderly.

01:45:54.573 --> 01:45:58.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not healthy spiritually or physically.

01:45:58.327 --> 01:46:02.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will help us
to get through these times.

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:06.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what will help too

01:46:06.418 --> 01:46:10.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to take the thinking down another path,

01:46:10.381 --> 01:46:13.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a psalm here
that I want to share with you

01:46:13.968 --> 01:46:16.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 77.

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:20.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’ll find Psalm 77,

01:46:22.393 --> 01:46:27.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is some more beautiful,

01:46:27.106 --> 01:46:30.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired advice

01:46:30.443 --> 01:46:35.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 77—
here in the 12th verse:

01:46:37.158 --> 01:46:41.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will meditate on all your activity

01:46:41.370 --> 01:46:44.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ponder over your dealings.”

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:48.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, it’s another one of those verses
where we need to pause

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:53.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and think about it,
talking about the times we’re living in.

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:57.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must ‘meditate on Jehovah’s activity’;

01:46:57.303 --> 01:46:59.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll come back to that in a moment.

01:46:59.347 --> 01:47:03.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But “ponder over your dealings”
—what would that maybe mean?

01:47:03.476 --> 01:47:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah—how does he deal

01:47:05.895 --> 01:47:09.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his servants?

01:47:09.273 --> 01:47:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does he deal with us?
He’s kind.

01:47:12.693 --> 01:47:15.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And don’t you love being around somebody

01:47:15.029 --> 01:47:18.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s reasonable and kind?

01:47:18.783 --> 01:47:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way they deal
with others—they’re kind.

01:47:23.746 --> 01:47:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when they’re that way,
they’re really imitating

01:47:27.417 --> 01:47:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how close they are to Jehovah,
because he’s kind

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he deals with us
—and we’re so grateful for that!

01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And talking about ‘meditating
on the activity,’

01:47:39.095 --> 01:47:41.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, think about creation

01:47:41.723 --> 01:47:45.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what Jehovah has done with creation.

01:47:45.893 --> 01:47:50.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who accept evolution
—they couldn’t do such.

01:47:50.898 --> 01:47:55.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t find any benefit from creation
because they don’t believe in creation.

01:47:55.612 --> 01:47:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘All of this just happened.’

01:47:57.614 --> 01:48:00.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so for us when we

01:48:00.366 --> 01:48:03.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at creation
—something as simple as

01:48:03.912 --> 01:48:06.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this does make Jehovah
 happy when we do it)

01:48:06.873 --> 01:48:10.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a beautiful flower or a bouquet of flowers.

01:48:10.418 --> 01:48:13.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, sometimes the world—
They start these businesses,

01:48:13.588 --> 01:48:17.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have these fake flowers,
and some of them look pretty good.

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But compare it to a real flower.

01:48:22.472 --> 01:48:25.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen some make these roses

01:48:25.016 --> 01:48:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that look pretty good,

01:48:27.936 --> 01:48:32.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I don’t smell
what I smell with a real rose.

01:48:32.107 --> 01:48:35.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole thing with a beautiful rose

01:48:35.068 --> 01:48:39.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it just makes you reflect on the Creator.

01:48:39.114 --> 01:48:43.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something that has always
been a treasure for me

01:48:43.535 --> 01:48:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that when you can capture
a beautiful sunset

01:48:46.997 --> 01:48:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—might be a sunrise
or might be a sunset—

01:48:50.125 --> 01:48:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just causes people

01:48:53.169 --> 01:48:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go “Wow!”

01:48:55.964 --> 01:48:59.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of them stop
and think about God.

01:48:59.926 --> 01:49:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether they believe in him
or not, it just stuns them.

01:49:03.847 --> 01:49:06.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shortly after we had moved here

01:49:06.766 --> 01:49:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to headquarters in Warwick, I remember

01:49:11.271 --> 01:49:15.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a few days after being here,
we had some rain and such.

01:49:15.901 --> 01:49:20.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then when I took a picture of it,
it had a beautiful rainbow.

01:49:20.655 --> 01:49:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took a picture of it with my tablet.

01:49:24.451 --> 01:49:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you not feel good and refreshed

01:49:29.289 --> 01:49:32.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by looking at such activity of Jehovah God?

01:49:32.834 --> 01:49:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A beautiful, beautiful rainbow.

01:49:36.171 --> 01:49:39.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there are the antics of animals.

01:49:39.508 --> 01:49:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love dogs.

01:49:41.551 --> 01:49:46.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love puppies and kittens
and the things they do.

01:49:46.056 --> 01:49:48.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes they’re able
to capture them on video.

01:49:48.850 --> 01:49:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just causes joy in the heart.

01:49:53.021 --> 01:49:57.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So find joy more in all of the creation
of the animals.

01:49:57.859 --> 01:50:00.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all, find joy

01:50:00.862 --> 01:50:03.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your relationship with Jehovah God.

01:50:03.949 --> 01:50:07.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that in mind,
notice how our brother

01:50:07.077 --> 01:50:11.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses practical wisdom
in the following video.

01:50:13.584 --> 01:50:16.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a stable job at a local resort,

01:50:16.211 --> 01:50:18.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I later lost this job.

01:50:19.298 --> 01:50:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to look for work,
but I was unsuccessful.

01:50:22.759 --> 01:50:24.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My savings ran out.

01:50:25.888 --> 01:50:29.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had run out of money
to buy gas for cooking.

01:50:29.516 --> 01:50:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like my world had ended.

01:50:35.522 --> 01:50:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did some research in the publications.

01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:41.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that I was able to follow the example

01:50:41.278 --> 01:50:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some brothers who had found
that they were able to start businesses

01:50:45.908 --> 01:50:48.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using the skills and abilities that they had.

01:50:48.994 --> 01:50:52.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to use a fishing net that I owned,

01:50:52.539 --> 01:50:55.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go down to the sea (to the river),

01:50:55.334 --> 01:50:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put the net out in the evening.

01:50:57.419 --> 01:50:59.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in the morning,
I would go down

01:50:59.421 --> 01:51:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be able to find fish
and crabs in the net.

01:51:02.424 --> 01:51:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy.

01:51:04.093 --> 01:51:05.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not always get

01:51:05.970 --> 01:51:09.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good catch, but by doing this,

01:51:09.014 --> 01:51:11.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eventually I was able

01:51:11.016 --> 01:51:13.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support my family during that time.

01:51:13.852 --> 01:51:17.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to cook outside on a fire.

01:51:17.356 --> 01:51:22.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how I could help
my family to stay positive.

01:51:22.027 --> 01:51:24.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would sit together, and we

01:51:24.655 --> 01:51:28.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would sing Kingdom songs
and play games together.

01:51:30.661 --> 01:51:34.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I feel that Jehovah
blessed the efforts that I made.

01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:38.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:5

01:51:38.711 --> 01:51:41.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that scripture reassured me 

01:51:41.088 --> 01:51:44.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that as long as I didn’t compromise

01:51:44.049 --> 01:51:46.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the important aspects of Jehovah’s worship,

01:51:46.469 --> 01:51:48.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family’s needs would be cared for.

01:51:50.848 --> 01:51:55.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve always admired the beauty
and power of the sea.

01:51:55.686 --> 01:51:58.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of the One
who created the sea.

01:51:58.856 --> 01:52:03.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not hard for him to care
for just one small human like me.

01:52:12.662 --> 01:52:15.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What nice application of the counsel

01:52:15.957 --> 01:52:19.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have practical wisdom and of the benefits!

01:52:19.043 --> 01:52:24.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I encourage you to keep in mind
what we’ve discussed here:

01:52:24.048 --> 01:52:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing the neighborly love
that Jesus showed

01:52:27.176 --> 01:52:29.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the joy he experienced from that

01:52:29.637 --> 01:52:34.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then using the practical wisdom
that Jesus taught us about

01:52:34.392 --> 01:52:37.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we stay close to Jehovah

01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:42.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not get distracted with things
that the world is absorbed with.

01:52:42.066 --> 01:52:47.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to help us completely capture

01:52:47.071 --> 01:52:52.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this mental inclination of Jesus
especially in the days ahead,

01:52:52.076 --> 01:52:57.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want you to find Hebrews chapter 12.

01:53:01.127 --> 01:53:03.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many know this verse

01:53:03.963 --> 01:53:08.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have benefited,
but it certainly applies to our discussion

01:53:08.801 --> 01:53:13.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a close friendship
with Jehovah bringing great joy.

01:53:14.849 --> 01:53:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 12,
and you’ll notice here,

01:53:19.354 --> 01:53:23.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 2:
“. . . as we look intently

01:53:23.942 --> 01:53:28.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent and Perfecter
of our faith, Jesus.

01:53:28.321 --> 01:53:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him

01:53:32.075 --> 01:53:36.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he endured a torture stake,
despising shame,

01:53:36.829 --> 01:53:41.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has sat down
at the right hand of the throne of God.”

01:53:42.919 --> 01:53:45.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful counsel

01:53:45.338 --> 01:53:48.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this is what we need to do:

01:53:48.925 --> 01:53:53.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look intently at the Chief Agent,”
Christ Jesus.

01:53:53.888 --> 01:53:56.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re looking
at something intently,

01:53:56.808 --> 01:53:59.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that means you’re looking away
from everything else.

01:53:59.561 --> 01:54:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re focused.

01:54:01.604 --> 01:54:05.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look intently” in these last days

01:54:05.734 --> 01:54:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent,” Jesus.

01:54:08.945 --> 01:54:11.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what we learn!

01:54:11.072 --> 01:54:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because when you think
about what he went through

01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the torture stake,
as mentioned here;

01:54:16.453 --> 01:54:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that three-and-a-half-year ministry
with those hypocrites

01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:25.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(those religious hypocrites,
attacking him with their lies and slander);

01:54:25.545 --> 01:54:29.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then those final days
of his earthly life

01:54:29.549 --> 01:54:34.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially those final hours
and then those hours on the torture stake

01:54:35.555 --> 01:54:39.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he knew what was coming, the details.

01:54:39.976 --> 01:54:44.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does a man deal with that

01:54:44.147 --> 01:54:47.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without collapsing?

01:54:47.609 --> 01:54:51.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re not left to wonder.

01:54:51.863 --> 01:54:55.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him

01:54:55.408 --> 01:54:57.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he endured” all that.

01:54:57.410 --> 01:55:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus had the prehuman existence,

01:55:00.997 --> 01:55:04.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the joy of sitting with his Father
again in the heavens

01:55:04.417 --> 01:55:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oh, my!—
that got him through it.

01:55:08.964 --> 01:55:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Same for us, brothers—the joy

01:55:14.803 --> 01:55:19.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will get us through it,
the joy of staying close with our God.

01:55:19.224 --> 01:55:22.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, this last verse

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this closing talk is here

01:55:24.438 --> 01:55:27.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Romans chapter 12,

01:55:29.693 --> 01:55:34.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two sentences from this 12th verse here

01:55:36.158 --> 01:55:41.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 12:12—
and take this to heart:

01:55:41.038 --> 01:55:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rejoice in the hope.

01:55:44.249 --> 01:55:48.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Endure under tribulation.”

01:55:48.378 --> 01:55:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while waiting for the fulfillment
of all of Jehovah’s promises

01:55:53.383 --> 01:55:57.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the things that we have to deal with,
remember how Jesus dealt with it.

01:55:57.721 --> 01:56:00.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just cling to Jehovah.

01:56:00.098 --> 01:56:02.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have that close relationship with him,

01:56:02.935 --> 01:56:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will experience the greatest joy!

01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Morris,
for explaining why we find joy

01:56:14.196 --> 01:56:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in walking closely with our heavenly Father,
as Jesus did.

01:56:19.576 --> 01:56:23.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have seen today that our joy
does not depend on external circumstances.

01:56:23.997 --> 01:56:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it is a God-given quality.

01:56:27.209 --> 01:56:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has indeed given us
many reasons to rejoice!

01:56:32.506 --> 01:56:36.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we look forward to
on the next segment of the program?

01:56:36.343 --> 01:56:41.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

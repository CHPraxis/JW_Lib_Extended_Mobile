Our disciple-making work
is a weighty assignment from Jehovah.

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he does not expect us
to accomplish it on our own.

00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:13.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you making full use
of the help Jehovah provides?

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:18.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you will be encouraged
by the following three-part symposium.

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:22.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker
will introduce the one to follow.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will deliver the first talk entitled

00:00:28.174 --> 00:00:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Accept Jehovah’s Help—
Research Tools.”

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:38.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ciranko, you have our full attention.

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say?

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:50.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is the disciple-making work?

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it is so important
that Jehovah God is directly involved in it.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:01.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn in your Bibles, please,
to 1 Corinthians 3:9

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 3:9.

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “For we are God’s fellow workers.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:13.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are God’s field under cultivation,
God’s building.”

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think what a privilege we have to share

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the almighty Creator of the universe

00:01:19.184 --> 00:01:22.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the work that he considers
so important here on earth.

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allows us to experience the joy

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping to build people
into disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know from the verses
that come just before verse 9,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while we plant
and water seeds of Kingdom truth

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hearts of interested ones,

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:43.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one
who makes those seeds grow.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, knowing this
should not minimize in our minds

00:01:47.128 --> 00:01:50.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the importance of our part
in the disciple-making work.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:54.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we do and how we do it has an impact

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how those seeds of truth will grow.

00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:01.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah knows that the more skilled
we become at making disciples,

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:04.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more effective
we will be as his fellow workers,

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the more enjoyable
the work will be for us.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:13.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To that end, Jehovah equips
us to teach as effectively as possible.

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:16.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we have to do is accept his help.

00:02:16.074 --> 00:02:19.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what this symposium is all about:

00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning to benefit
from the research tools Jehovah has given us,

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:28.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that is available
from our brothers, and the power of prayer.

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:32.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each talk in this symposium
will consider two questions.

00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:35.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, what help has Jehovah given us?

00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:38.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, how can we use that help

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase our joy in the ministry?

00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:45.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by talking about research tools.

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What help has Jehovah given us?

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:53.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has given us the right tools
—the best tools—for our work.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Foremost of all,
he has dignified us by allowing us

00:02:56.907 --> 00:02:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use his written Word, the Bible,

00:02:59.368 --> 00:03:02.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is our most important tool
for the ministry.

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:08.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to 2 Timothy 3:16, 17

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Timothy 3:16, 17.

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:15.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All Scripture is inspired of God

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for setting things straight,
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:28.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that the man of God
[or woman of God] may be fully competent,

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:31.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:37.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should want to do all
we can to keep honing our skills

00:03:37.448 --> 00:03:41.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using the Bible to teach the truth
about God, Christ, and the Kingdom.

00:03:42.954 --> 00:03:45.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the beauty of using
the Bible is that the message

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:50.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contained in it can literally change people.

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:52.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Religious falsehoods and erroneous ideas

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have become “strongly entrenched”
in the minds of sincere people.

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible, when used effectively,

00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can overturn those wrong beliefs.

00:04:03.057 --> 00:04:05.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, the Bible
can even help a person understand

00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own deepest thoughts and feelings.

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible translation
renders that 16th verse by saying:

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Bible is useful for resetting
the direction of a man’s life.”

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through our own study of the Bible,

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can become skilled
at using the Scriptures in the ministry.

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:30.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to help us succeed in this, Jehovah
has given us a variety of research tools

00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:33.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use in personal study and family worship.

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These include the <i>Watchtower Library</i>,

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>JW Library</i>® app,

00:04:39.135 --> 00:04:43.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY</i>™<i>,</i>
and the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:48.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to be skillful
in using the tools he has provided

00:04:48.895 --> 00:04:52.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the proverb
will come true for us that says:

00:04:52.857 --> 00:04:55.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “Have you seen a man skillful at his work?

00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will stand before kings.”

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:07.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what comes up on Neeta’s Bible study
that challenges her as a teacher,

00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:11.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how she realizes she needs help
to teach effectively,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what research tool she uses

00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:17.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for her study with Jade.

00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:21.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . making a friend with God.

00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I don’t know how to do that.

00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:26.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a friend?

00:05:26.308 --> 00:05:27.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve done fine with me.

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:32.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I can see you—but God, a Friend?

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about what you can see?

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:38.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does creation teach us about him?

00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:39.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, not much

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:43.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe evolve or your species dies.

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:45.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t really help.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not talking about evolution.

00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:53.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m talking about the things
that God has created.

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:56.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t suppose he’s got
a little workshop up there building things

00:05:56.505 --> 00:05:58.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at a time, do you?

00:05:58.549 --> 00:06:01.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the real world, things evolve.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all random.

00:06:03.804 --> 00:06:06.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that
tells me about him.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t ready for this.

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:10.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution isn’t my strong suit.

00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:13.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help.

00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:26.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be good:

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:29.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who believe evolution. . . 

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:34.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ancient tidal pool . . . 
chemicals spontaneously assembled . . .”

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too deep.

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:41.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!
Maybe: “What does the evidence reveal? . . .

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a cell to survive, . . . DNA . . .

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“RNA . . . inanimate chemicals. . .

00:06:48.057 --> 00:06:50.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probability . . .”

00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:53.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure this is what she needs.

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:58.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:01.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:10.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One widespread false teaching . . .

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“robs people of hope . . . implies

00:07:14.542 --> 00:07:17.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that human life has no purpose . . .”

00:07:17.337 --> 00:07:20.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be it; establish the positive:

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:24.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What creation really says about Jehovah

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
versus what evolution obscures.

00:07:27.138 --> 00:07:29.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you got me thinking, . . .

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:30.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I did some research, . . .

00:07:32.393 --> 00:07:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Yeah.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I think
you’ll really like what I found.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:36.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:39.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, let’s do this.

00:07:56.084 --> 00:07:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see where Neeta turned for help?

00:07:58.628 --> 00:08:00.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a little bit of searching
and persistence,

00:08:03.174 --> 00:08:05.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she found what she needed.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She got excited about the information

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:10.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and passed that excitement on to her student.

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:16.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you use
our research tools effectively?

00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:20.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can use them to help you
to explain and teach the Scriptures.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:22.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, as with Jade,

00:08:22.402 --> 00:08:26.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your students may be struggling
to understand a Scriptural teaching.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:30.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may have a student
who is trying to overcome a personal problem.

00:08:30.202 --> 00:08:35.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use the tools that Jehovah
has given us to search for an explanation

00:08:35.082 --> 00:08:38.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an illustration that will help the person.

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may not even have to do
all the work yourself.

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:45.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you can show
your students how to use our tools

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to find
the Bible’s answers to their questions.

00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:55.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your best, though,
to learn how to use our research tools.

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:59.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, you already use
<i>JW Library</i> for personal study

00:08:59.189 --> 00:09:03.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and family worship and to prepare
for congregation meetings.

00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:08.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you keep up-to-date
with new features in the <i>JW Library</i> app,

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:11.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can also use it
to good advantage in your ministry.

00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:16.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are even features
built into the app that make it possible 

00:09:16.707 --> 00:09:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to save the research
that you have done

00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:22.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you can use it again in the future.

00:09:22.296 --> 00:09:24.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are those features?

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notes and tags

00:09:27.384 --> 00:09:29.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—notes and tags.

00:09:29.762 --> 00:09:31.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you learned how to use them?

00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:33.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now you can.

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:36.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have <i>JW Library</i> with you on a device,

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open the Bible to 1 Timothy chapter 2

00:09:40.481 --> 00:09:42.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Timothy chapter 2—

00:09:42.858 --> 00:09:46.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow along with this tutorial video.

00:09:47.905 --> 00:09:52.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you making full use of <i>JW Library®?</i>

00:09:52.076 --> 00:09:54.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn how some are using it,

00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:56.664 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then practice together.

00:09:56.664 --> 00:10:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create notes in my Bible
for many different reasons.

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:02.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a good point from a talk,

00:10:02.253 --> 00:10:06.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an illustration to help me
to explain something to a Bible student,

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something for my own meditation.

00:10:09.302 --> 00:10:12.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I highlight the key phrase
and create a note.

00:10:12.805 --> 00:10:15.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have <i>JW Library,</i>

00:10:17.602 --> 00:10:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find 1 Timothy 2:6 in the Bible.

00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now highlight the word “ransom,”

00:10:25.735 --> 00:10:29.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tap the “Add a note” button.

00:10:32.158 --> 00:10:34.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then type your comment.

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tapping the note marker in the margin

00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings your comment into view.

00:10:43.378 --> 00:10:45.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve created a lot of notes.

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:48.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I use tags to help me find them again.

00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:52.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, whenever I hear a point
that I want to use in the ministry,

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:55.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I create a note and add a tag

00:10:55.932 --> 00:10:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like “prayer,” “ransom,” or “last days.”

00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when I’m in the ministry,
I can quickly find my note.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:09.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the note you just created,

00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:11.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tap the three dots

00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then “Edit.”

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:18.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now tap the button “Add a tag,”

00:11:21.374 --> 00:11:23.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter a tag name.

00:11:23.835 --> 00:11:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, type “ransom.”

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:33.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can add as many tags as you like.

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:38.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find your notes again,

00:11:38.892 --> 00:11:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go to the Personal Study tab.

00:11:42.354 --> 00:11:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can type in the Search box,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you can just tap the tag.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I read the Bible chapters
for the midweek meeting,

00:11:50.612 --> 00:11:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often come across verses
that I want to understand better.

00:11:54.074 --> 00:11:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I check the <i>Research Guide.</i>

00:11:56.118 --> 00:11:59.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I use the points
I find in a comment at the meeting.

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:02.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s practice together.

00:12:02.249 --> 00:12:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you still at 1 Timothy chapter 2?

00:12:06.128 --> 00:12:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap on the number for verse 6,

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then tap the <i>Research Guide</i> button
on the menu.

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can read information
that explains this verse.

00:12:21.936 --> 00:12:26.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can even copy a portion
of the research and paste it into your note.

00:12:31.028 --> 00:12:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are like me, you will probably
have to watch that video a few more times.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you find it challenging
to learn how to use

00:12:38.077 --> 00:12:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the features of our tools,
here are two things you can do.

00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, ask someone
in your congregation to assist you,

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often the young people can help the most.

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, go to jw.org®,

00:12:51.757 --> 00:12:54.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll to the bottom of any page,

00:12:54.302 --> 00:12:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
click on <i>JW Library,</i>

00:12:56.762 --> 00:13:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there you will find
more tutorial videos that you can watch.

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:06.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As announced at the 2018 annual meeting,

00:13:06.814 --> 00:13:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our research tools are being redesigned
to be unified and more user-friendly.

00:13:11.819 --> 00:13:15.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be sure to learn the new features
as they are released.

00:13:15.615 --> 00:13:18.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may you joyfully work with Jehovah

00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:23.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using the research tools
he has provided for making disciples.

00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:27.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joel Dellinger,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:30.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:33.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:13:33.424 --> 00:13:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Accept Jehovah’s Help—
Our Brothers.”

00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:48.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible identifies a second source
of help that Jehovah has given us

00:13:48.565 --> 00:13:52.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can experience
the joy of making disciples.

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:57.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gift is described at 1 Peter 5:9.

00:13:57.115 --> 00:13:59.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read that with me

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:02.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 5:9:

00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:08.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But take your stand
against him, firm in the faith,

00:14:08.126 --> 00:14:11.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the same kind
of sufferings are being experienced

00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:16.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the entire association
of your brothers

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:18.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the world.”

00:14:18.094 --> 00:14:20.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope has Jehovah given us?

00:14:20.597 --> 00:14:24.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our worldwide association
of brothers and sisters.

00:14:24.976 --> 00:14:28.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as their example can help us to endure,

00:14:28.313 --> 00:14:32.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers can also help us
meet the challenges in the ministry.

00:14:32.943 --> 00:14:36.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah has given us
a large spiritual family,

00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:39.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that shows that he wants us

00:14:39.032 --> 00:14:43.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to experience the joy of working together.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we might be thinking,

00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s encouraging, but is it realistic

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:52.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think that I can experience the joy
of making a disciple?’

00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:54.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve had Bible studies

00:14:54.756 --> 00:14:58.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but none of them have yet progressed
to the point of dedication and baptism.

00:14:58.385 --> 00:15:00.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might wonder,

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I really up to that challenge?’

00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re a parent
who’s newer in the truth,

00:15:06.643 --> 00:15:08.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re thinking to yourself,

00:15:08.812 --> 00:15:11.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can I reach my child’s heart

00:15:11.231 --> 00:15:15.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help him or her learn
to love Jehovah as I do?’

00:15:15.569 --> 00:15:18.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you’re dealing with poor health

00:15:18.364 --> 00:15:21.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the effects of old age, and you wonder,

00:15:21.492 --> 00:15:25.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can I have an effective ministry?’

00:15:25.537 --> 00:15:30.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we want you to take heart.

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:32.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has provided help,

00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:35.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help may be nearer than you think.

00:15:35.548 --> 00:15:39.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To highlight the help
that Jehovah gives to all of us,

00:15:39.343 --> 00:15:43.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a few moments,
let’s consider the apostle Paul’s experience.

00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:47.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of the apostle Paul,
what comes to mind?

00:15:47.893 --> 00:15:51.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps a very hardworking, energetic brother

00:15:51.647 --> 00:15:54.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who traveled extensively as a missionary.

00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:59.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can there be any doubt
that Paul’s ministry was a complete success?

00:15:59.447 --> 00:16:02.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was Paul’s success

00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:05.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result of his efforts alone?

00:16:05.745 --> 00:16:07.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:16:07.747 --> 00:16:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul needed
and humbly accepted help from others.

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:13.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may recall reading

00:16:13.169 --> 00:16:16.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Acts chapters 16 and 17,

00:16:16.047 --> 00:16:19.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the man Silas traveled with Paul.

00:16:19.383 --> 00:16:22.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that trip, in the city of Philippi,

00:16:22.386 --> 00:16:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and Silas shared the joy
of helping an entire family

00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:29.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become baptized disciples.

00:16:29.477 --> 00:16:33.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there’s something very interesting
in the Bible’s record of that account:

00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:35.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time Paul is mentioned,

00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:38.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Silas is mentioned as well.

00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:42.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the expression “Paul and Silas”

00:16:42.031 --> 00:16:45.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs six times in quick succession.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from that?

00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Paul had help in his ministry.

00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:52.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not go it alone.

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:55.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, young ones, a question for you:

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of another close friend of Paul

00:16:59.382 --> 00:17:01.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who often traveled with him?

00:17:01.718 --> 00:17:04.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You got it right, Timothy.

00:17:04.846 --> 00:17:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For about 14 years, the two of them

00:17:07.223 --> 00:17:10.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked together in Jehovah’s service.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Paul, the more experienced man,

00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:17.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really view Timothy as a helper,
as someone who could assist him?

00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:20.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he did.

00:17:20.028 --> 00:17:23.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul neared the end
of his life, for example,

00:17:23.281 --> 00:17:25.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wrote to Timothy, his younger friend,

00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said: “Do your utmost
to come to me shortly.”

00:17:30.664 --> 00:17:35.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was not too proud to ask for help.

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:40.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Acts chapter 18,
the Bible tells us about a married couple

00:17:40.424 --> 00:17:45.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, or Prisca)
who supported Paul.

00:17:45.262 --> 00:17:50.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the city of Corinth,
they welcomed Paul not only into their home

00:17:50.142 --> 00:17:53.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also into the business of making tents.

00:17:53.854 --> 00:17:58.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
how much joy these three must have had

00:17:58.859 --> 00:18:03.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they worked together
not only in the secular trade of making tents

00:18:03.864 --> 00:18:07.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in advancing
the Kingdom good news?

00:18:07.284 --> 00:18:09.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Paul left Corinth,

00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:12.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know what happened
with Aquila and Priscilla?

00:18:12.164 --> 00:18:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They followed him to Ephesus.

00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:18.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Aquila and Priscilla used their home

00:18:18.587 --> 00:18:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a meeting place
for the local congregation.

00:18:21.924 --> 00:18:24.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their helpful services continued.

00:18:24.385 --> 00:18:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 18:24,

00:18:27.096 --> 00:18:30.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned that this couple
became acquainted with Apollos

00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:34.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Christian from Egypt who,
according to the Scriptural account,

00:18:34.687 --> 00:18:39.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was an “eloquent man”
and “well-versed in the Scriptures.”

00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:43.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, Apollos needed some help

00:18:43.195 --> 00:18:47.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had some gaps
in his understanding.

00:18:47.032 --> 00:18:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did helpful Priscilla and Aquila do?

00:18:50.953 --> 00:18:54.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 18:26 tells us:

00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:57.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They took [Apollos] into their company

00:18:57.501 --> 00:19:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explained the way
of God more accurately to him.”

00:19:01.589 --> 00:19:03.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think of that for a moment.

00:19:03.924 --> 00:19:07.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This humble couple, tentmakers,

00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not intimidated by Apollos.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To them, he was a brother
—a part of the family.

00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And out of brotherly love,
they took the initiative

00:19:16.145 --> 00:19:18.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give him the help that he needed.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in thinking about Paul

00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:24.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he viewed those that assisted him,

00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:27.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think he felt
about this beautiful couple?

00:19:27.907 --> 00:19:32.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible with me
to Paul’s own words that Jehovah preserved

00:19:32.078 --> 00:19:36.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 16:3, 4.

00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:41.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Romans 16:3, 4;

00:19:41.045 --> 00:19:43.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read it together:

00:19:43.506 --> 00:19:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give my greetings
to Prisca [or, Priscilla] and Aquila,

00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,

00:19:51.306 --> 00:19:55.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who have risked their own necks for me
and to whom not only I

00:19:55.143 --> 00:20:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also all the congregations
of the nations give thanks.”

00:20:00.148 --> 00:20:04.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep appreciation
is what Paul felt for this loyal couple.

00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:09.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He viewed them as his fellow workers.

00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does all of what we’ve discussed

00:20:11.868 --> 00:20:14.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tell us about the apostle Paul?

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:18.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, the success
he enjoyed in his ministry

00:20:18.833 --> 00:20:22.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not the result of his efforts alone.

00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:25.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Paul the help he needed

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have an effective ministry,

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:32.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that help came in the form
of many brothers and sisters.

00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:34.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:20:34.808 --> 00:20:37.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given you and given me

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:40.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same help—our brothers.

00:20:40.313 --> 00:20:42.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:20:42.357 --> 00:20:44.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please notice how Neeta benefits

00:20:44.609 --> 00:20:47.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the help of another sister.

00:20:58.874 --> 00:21:00.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting . . .

00:21:04.046 --> 00:21:06.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every Thursday and Sunday,
and I think

00:21:06.423 --> 00:21:08.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I think you’d really enjoy it.

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:11.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t promise anything.

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:14.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be nice if you could come.

00:21:22.439 --> 00:21:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might just text her,
actually, just to remind her.

00:21:24.024 --> 00:21:25.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, yeah, excellent.

00:21:28.404 --> 00:21:32.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:36.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . well, maybe not everything.

00:21:38.414 --> 00:21:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:00.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Abigay.

00:22:02.772 --> 00:22:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.
Hi, Abigay.

00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:05.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, let me kill that.

00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:15.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a long time since I hear them!

00:22:16.994 --> 00:22:18.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that band?

00:22:18.454 --> 00:22:19.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know them?

00:22:19.497 --> 00:22:24.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to see them all the time
before I became a Witness.

00:22:24.043 --> 00:22:26.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!
You like that kind of music?

00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t believe me?

00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:36.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, this bag, it’s so big!

00:22:39.308 --> 00:22:41.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t find anything.

00:22:41.853 --> 00:22:43.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abigay?

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, when I was young . . .

00:22:52.822 --> 00:22:54.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The sun shines so sweet.”

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:02.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

00:23:10.465 --> 00:23:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll be gone next week.

00:23:12.801 --> 00:23:13.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:23:13.968 --> 00:23:15.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll have someone else
take care of the study, OK?

00:23:48.044 --> 00:23:52.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how Neeta responded
to the suggestion that was given her?

00:23:52.924 --> 00:23:57.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Applying that counsel brought good results.

00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Neeta, we may need specific help

00:24:00.682 --> 00:24:03.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish our ministry fully.

00:24:03.977 --> 00:24:05.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when it comes

00:24:05.979 --> 00:24:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to making return visits
and conducting Bible studies,

00:24:09.358 --> 00:24:12.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could some brothers and sisters
in your congregation

00:24:12.402 --> 00:24:15.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help you to improve your skills?

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, all of us would benefit

00:24:17.449 --> 00:24:20.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by reaching out to such publishers

00:24:20.702 --> 00:24:25.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have gained experience
and skill in those aspects of the ministry.

00:24:25.707 --> 00:24:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’re a parent

00:24:27.876 --> 00:24:31.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wants to instill love for Jehovah
in the heart of your child?

00:24:31.922 --> 00:24:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about asking some other parents

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or grandparents for advice?

00:24:37.052 --> 00:24:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’ve had success raising their children

00:24:39.513 --> 00:24:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah
and become baptized disciples,

00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:46.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will certainly be happy
to share their experience with you.

00:24:47.771 --> 00:24:52.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what if we have
age limitations or health concerns,

00:24:52.776 --> 00:24:57.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may need practical assistance
that accommodates our needs.

00:24:57.656 --> 00:25:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at many Bethel homes,
elderly and infirm brothers and sisters

00:25:02.244 --> 00:25:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are still having a regular
and productive share in the ministry.

00:25:05.915 --> 00:25:07.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how?

00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders at Bethel
arrange for younger publishers

00:25:11.087 --> 00:25:15.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join the elderly ones
in letter writing and phone witnessing.

00:25:15.174 --> 00:25:17.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister by the name of Nancy,

00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was nearly 90 years old
at the time, said this:

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:24.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t view letter writing
as just stuffing envelopes.

00:25:24.267 --> 00:25:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is field service.

00:25:26.561 --> 00:25:29.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to know the truth!”

00:25:29.355 --> 00:25:31.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging!

00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:36.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And did you know that in less than a year,
one group of precious older ones

00:25:36.112 --> 00:25:39.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted over 1,000 hours to the ministry,

00:25:39.866 --> 00:25:42.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote over 6,000 letters,

00:25:42.452 --> 00:25:44.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made over 2,000 phone calls,

00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:48.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and placed over 6,000 pieces of literature?

00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:51.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good was accomplished
by working together,

00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:54.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what joy they experienced!

00:25:54.756 --> 00:25:57.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we have to admit

00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:02.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it takes humility
to acknowledge that we need help.

00:26:02.555 --> 00:26:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in this, we can learn from Apollos.

00:26:05.808 --> 00:26:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though eloquent
and though well-versed in the Scriptures,

00:26:09.312 --> 00:26:11.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he accepted the help that he needed.

00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:14.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, he benefited

00:26:14.025 --> 00:26:17.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all those that he would teach
thereafter benefited.

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:19.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the point:

00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:24.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of someone
like Priscilla or Aquila

00:26:24.452 --> 00:26:27.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could give you the help you need?

00:26:27.706 --> 00:26:31.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, why not explain your needs
and ask that person

00:26:31.751 --> 00:26:36.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join you in the ministry
or on Bible studies.

00:26:36.548 --> 00:26:39.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’ve been serving
Jehovah for a time,

00:26:39.968 --> 00:26:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you in a position to help others?

00:26:43.346 --> 00:26:46.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, we encourage you to be observant

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the initiative to offer assistance.

00:26:49.311 --> 00:26:51.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you see that a brother
or sister would benefit

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a kind suggestion, don’t hold back.

00:26:55.358 --> 00:26:58.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At an appropriate time,
you might begin the conversation

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:00.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a friendly way by saying:

00:27:00.822 --> 00:27:03.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘May I offer you a suggestion?’

00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘Here’s what I try to do.’

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:10.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, if we’re kind
and thoughtful like Aquila and Priscilla,

00:27:10.457 --> 00:27:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely our words and example
will prove to be a blessing

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help our brothers find joy
in making disciples too.

00:27:19.049 --> 00:27:23.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the second part of this symposium,
what have we learned?

00:27:23.554 --> 00:27:27.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our brothers are a gift from Jehovah

00:27:27.724 --> 00:27:29.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us make disciples.

00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:34.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, when we
work together and support one another,

00:27:34.273 --> 00:27:39.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us can find
great joy in our precious ministry.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:27:43.699 --> 00:27:47.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider the third
and final talk of this symposium,

00:27:47.077 --> 00:27:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Experience the Joy of Disciple-Making

00:27:50.331 --> 00:27:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Accept Jehovah’s Help—
Prayer.”

00:27:59.465 --> 00:28:01.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help!”

00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:06.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, you have sometime in your life
heard somebody call out “Help!”

00:28:06.514 --> 00:28:11.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you yourself
have called out “Help!” to Jehovah.

00:28:11.477 --> 00:28:15.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 30:10, David once sang:

00:28:15.356 --> 00:28:18.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, become my helper.”

00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah becomes our Helper
not only when we are in danger.

00:28:23.406 --> 00:28:27.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provides help in many positive ways

00:28:27.118 --> 00:28:29.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in everyday life.

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What help does Jehovah provide for us?

00:28:33.416 --> 00:28:36.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, find with me

00:28:36.002 --> 00:28:40.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 14:6.

00:28:40.006 --> 00:28:42.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, Jehovah provides

00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his holy angels to support
the worldwide preaching work.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Revelation 14:6, John recorded:

00:28:51.893 --> 00:28:55.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I saw another angel
flying in midheaven,

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:28:59.025 --> 00:29:01.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:05.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:29:08.243 --> 00:29:11.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not just one angel that is active

00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:13.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in support of the preaching work.

00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:16.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many angels are involved in it.

00:29:16.543 --> 00:29:20.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it were not for the help
and direction of the angels,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would sometimes overlook
somebody with a good heart

00:29:24.384 --> 00:29:26.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we go out and preach.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, Jehovah has also given
us his holy spirit,

00:29:32.142 --> 00:29:35.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fruitage of which makes us
more effective teachers

00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:39.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us to draw
sheeplike ones to the truth.

00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:45.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, Jehovah has given us
as a help the privilege of prayer.

00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:49.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gets personally involved
in our activities.

00:29:49.826 --> 00:29:54.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible teachers and students alike
need Jehovah’s help.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 127:1 says:

00:29:56.917 --> 00:29:59.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in vain that its builders
work hard on it.”

00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:08.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fourth, Jehovah gives us
also the needed wisdom.

00:30:08.512 --> 00:30:12.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is wisdom to pray
for “the wisdom from above”

00:30:12.265 --> 00:30:16.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned at James 3:17.

00:30:16.728 --> 00:30:21.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last, Jehovah also gives us
the needed strength,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helps us a lot when we are tired

00:30:24.069 --> 00:30:28.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or discouraged or have a lot of work.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 4:11 refers

00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:34.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “the strength that God supplies.”

00:30:35.581 --> 00:30:38.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we can pray for Jehovah’s help,

00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:42.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for wisdom, and for the necessary strength.

00:30:42.087 --> 00:30:44.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:30:44.506 --> 00:30:48.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the power of praying
in behalf of a Bible student.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long would Jesus need to wait

00:30:54.642 --> 00:30:56.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah would make him King?”

00:30:56.644 --> 00:30:58.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, so “how do we know that Jesus

00:30:58.979 --> 00:31:01.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not become King
when he was on earth

00:31:01.774 --> 00:31:04.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or immediately after he was resurrected?”

00:31:08.072 --> 00:31:11.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, because he didn’t.

00:31:14.078 --> 00:31:16.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus
teach his disciples to pray?

00:31:19.959 --> 00:31:23.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, yep—well, I know the obvious.

00:31:23.838 --> 00:31:27.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let your Kingdom come,”
implied future tense.

00:31:29.218 --> 00:31:31.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we know for sure
what’s going on in heaven?

00:31:35.224 --> 00:31:38.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it would help
if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:31:41.814 --> 00:31:45.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you leave, a suggestion:

00:31:45.067 --> 00:31:48.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe if you were to study ahead of time?

00:31:48.112 --> 00:31:48.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really . . .

00:31:48.988 --> 00:31:50.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about no.

00:31:50.156 --> 00:31:52.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really swamped.

00:31:52.492 --> 00:31:54.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re busy; we all are.

00:31:54.118 --> 00:31:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

00:31:56.579 --> 00:31:58.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to go.

00:32:05.171 --> 00:32:07.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do next.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought she
was making our study a priority,

00:32:10.426 --> 00:32:13.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe she wasn’t.

00:32:18.142 --> 00:32:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exams next week—it’s do or die time.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I remembered 1 Corinthians 3:6

00:32:52.135 --> 00:32:55.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that ‘God keeps making it grow.’

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:09.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade
and then left it with him.

00:33:33.343 --> 00:33:37.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I need to apologize.

00:33:37.097 --> 00:33:39.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forget it, you were stressed.

00:33:39.725 --> 00:33:41.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but there’s more.

00:33:41.685 --> 00:33:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside I knew you were right;

00:33:44.354 --> 00:33:47.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just the last thing I wanted to hear.

00:33:47.024 --> 00:33:49.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, really.

00:33:52.696 --> 00:33:54.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:33:57.451 --> 00:33:58.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah?

00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:06.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:07.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:34:16.428 --> 00:34:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can prayer help us
in making disciples?

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate with me

00:34:23.185 --> 00:34:27.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:9, 10.

00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:34.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this is what I continue praying,
that your love may abound

00:34:34.196 --> 00:34:37.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“still more and more with accurate knowledge

00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:40.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and full discernment;

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:44.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you may make sure
of the more important things,

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may be flawless
and not stumbling others

00:34:47.293 --> 00:34:49.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to the day of Christ.”

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Paul prayed

00:34:53.007 --> 00:34:56.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the love
of the Philippians “may abound

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:59.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . with accurate knowledge
and full discernment,” we can pray 

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same in behalf
of our Bible students.

00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:07.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray also for the holy spirit
to guide your thoughts and actions

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:10.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ones of your students.

00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:14.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray from your heart,
confident that Jehovah will hear you.

00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:19.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 65:2 says: “O Hearer of prayer,

00:35:19.325 --> 00:35:23.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to you people of all sorts will come.”

00:35:23.204 --> 00:35:26.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teach your Bible students how to pray,

00:35:26.207 --> 00:35:28.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only encourage them to do so.

00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Urge them to do so!

00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:34.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning to pray will help
your students to form

00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:36.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:35:36.885 --> 00:35:40.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray with your Bible students and for them,

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using or spelling out their name.

00:35:43.933 --> 00:35:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be confident that Jehovah
will answer your prayers and theirs.

00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:54.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Acts 10:9.

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:57.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter was a fine example

00:35:57.238 --> 00:36:00.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who prayed.

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 10:9 says:

00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The next day as they
were continuing on their journey

00:36:10.252 --> 00:36:14.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were approaching the city,
Peter went up to the housetop

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the sixth hour to pray.”

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:23.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same chapter,
Cornelius was also a fine example.

00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Acts 10:30, 31,

00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reported to Peter:

00:36:30.272 --> 00:36:33.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Four days ago counting from this hour,

00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was praying in my house at the ninth hour;

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:41.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just then a man in bright clothing
stood in front of me

00:36:41.074 --> 00:36:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and said: ‘Cornelius, your prayer
has been favorably heard,

00:36:45.454 --> 00:36:49.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your gifts of mercy
have been remembered before God.’”

00:36:51.293 --> 00:36:56.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered
Peter’s prayer and Cornelius’ prayer.

00:36:56.173 --> 00:36:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us what we need

00:36:58.842 --> 00:37:03.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase our joy in making disciples.

00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:07.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a report came to John that Jesus
was making many disciples,

00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:10.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John did not become jealous.

00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John chapter 3, he replied:

00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This joy of mine has been made full.

00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:21.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That one must go on increasing,
but I must go on decreasing.”

00:37:22.992 --> 00:37:25.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do not make disciples personally,

00:37:25.661 --> 00:37:29.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still rejoice
with those who do make them.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:34.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angels rejoice although they
do not personally make disciples.

00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:37.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 15:7, Jesus said:

00:37:37.798 --> 00:37:42.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There will be more joy in heaven
over one sinner who repents

00:37:42.803 --> 00:37:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than over 99 righteous ones
who have no need of repentance.”

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:53.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also rejoice because we have
the Bible and powerful research tools

00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:55.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in print and electronically

00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in audio format.

00:37:58.861 --> 00:38:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice because we have
our brotherhood to support and assist us.

00:38:03.866 --> 00:38:08.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask them for suggestions,
and we can invite them to accompany us

00:38:08.121 --> 00:38:12.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry, even if it is
only by computer tie-in

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or telephone witnessing.

00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:18.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we cannot meet together physically
for a congregation meeting,

00:38:18.923 --> 00:38:23.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can arrange for tie-ins with others
and hear and see them.

00:38:23.803 --> 00:38:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It warms our heart.

00:38:26.222 --> 00:38:28.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t forget the provisions
from Jehovah,

00:38:28.892 --> 00:38:31.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we mentioned
at the beginning of this talk.

00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:35.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we have the privilege of prayer;

00:38:35.773 --> 00:38:39.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, the help of God’s angels;

00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:43.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, the support of the holy spirit;

00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:47.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fourth, “the wisdom
from above”; and fifth,

00:38:47.494 --> 00:38:52.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritual and emotional strength
that God supplies.

00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:55.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us all of this

00:38:55.085 --> 00:38:58.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he cares about us
and about those we teach.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will have great joy in the ministry

00:39:01.633 --> 00:39:05.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we take full advantage
of Jehovah’s help.

00:39:05.262 --> 00:39:08.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly, we want to mention
something very precious

00:39:08.682 --> 00:39:13.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that brings us deep inner joy,
Psalm 25:14:

00:39:13.687 --> 00:39:16.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Close friendship with Jehovah

00:39:16.898 --> 00:39:21.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
belongs to those
who fear him” and pray to him.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May your joyous friendship with Jehovah

00:39:24.906 --> 00:39:28.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and the joyous friendship
that disciples

00:39:28.243 --> 00:39:32.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have with Jehovah—
last for an eternity!

00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:39.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers, for drawing
our attention to the help Jehovah provides.

00:39:40.797 --> 00:39:44.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time has now arrived
for the baptism discourse.

00:39:44.468 --> 00:39:49.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite all baptism candidates
to pay particular attention.

00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:53.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day of one’s baptism
is an especially joyful one.

00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:56.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is also just a beginning.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you candidates for baptism gain

00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:01.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even greater joy in the days ahead?

00:40:01.985 --> 00:40:06.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen closely to the answer
presented in this discourse entitled

00:40:06.657 --> 00:40:10.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How Your Baptism Leads to More Happiness.”

00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:14.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk will be given by a helper
to the Teaching Committee,

00:40:14.206 --> 00:40:16.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Malenfant.

00:40:23.007 --> 00:40:28.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the many things
that Jesus Christ revealed to his disciples

00:40:28.012 --> 00:40:32.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was this very old and fundamental truth:

00:40:32.433 --> 00:40:37.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.”

00:40:38.522 --> 00:40:42.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus learned this truth
from his Father, Jehovah God,

00:40:42.026 --> 00:40:45.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is the greatest example of a happy Giver.

00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:47.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 1:27,

00:40:47.948 --> 00:40:52.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see clear evidence
of Jehovah’s generosity.

00:40:52.703 --> 00:40:55.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 1:27 says:

00:40:55.539 --> 00:41:00.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And God went on to create
the man in his image,

00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:03.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in God’s image he created him;

00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:07.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
male and female he created them.”

00:41:08.803 --> 00:41:12.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This verse describes humans
as a unique creation,

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different in many ways
from all other forms of life on earth.

00:41:17.353 --> 00:41:20.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made in Jehovah’s image.

00:41:20.815 --> 00:41:25.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God designed us
to reflect his personality.

00:41:25.987 --> 00:41:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have within us
the capability of cultivating

00:41:29.657 --> 00:41:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the divine quality of generosity

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:36.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiencing the happiness
that comes from giving.

00:41:37.874 --> 00:41:42.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really do get pleasure
out of giving to family, friends,

00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to people we don’t know.

00:41:45.048 --> 00:41:49.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us feel good to give to others.

00:41:49.677 --> 00:41:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,
the most important giving that we can do

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the key to happiness in life

00:41:56.851 --> 00:42:00.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to give our Creator what he deserves.

00:42:02.023 --> 00:42:06.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 4:11

00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:11.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets forth clearly the things
that Jehovah God deserves,

00:42:11.074 --> 00:42:15.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it shows the reason why
we should give such things to God.

00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:21.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me Revelation 4:11.

00:42:21.918 --> 00:42:23.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are worthy, Jehovah our God,

00:42:27.716 --> 00:42:32.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to receive the glory
and the honor and the power,

00:42:32.304 --> 00:42:35.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you created all things,

00:42:35.474 --> 00:42:39.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and because of your will
they came into existence

00:42:39.353 --> 00:42:41.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were created.”

00:42:41.897 --> 00:42:46.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We exist because Jehovah created us.

00:42:46.026 --> 00:42:48.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fact makes him worthy

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive from us glory,

00:42:51.448 --> 00:42:53.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honor, and power.

00:42:53.992 --> 00:42:58.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you candidates for baptism
have made the decision to do,

00:42:58.705 --> 00:43:03.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give Jehovah God
glory and honor and power.

00:43:04.211 --> 00:43:06.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do this by praising his name,

00:43:06.922 --> 00:43:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by obeying him,

00:43:08.924 --> 00:43:11.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by using your life

00:43:11.009 --> 00:43:14.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your power, energy,
and your whole strength—

00:43:14.304 --> 00:43:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do his will.

00:43:17.474 --> 00:43:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By getting baptized
in symbol of your dedication to God,

00:43:21.895 --> 00:43:24.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are declaring publicly

00:43:24.106 --> 00:43:27.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have given yourself to Jehovah.

00:43:27.776 --> 00:43:31.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have made a gift to God
of your heart, mind, and strength

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your very being.

00:43:33.782 --> 00:43:36.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you have made this decision

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you have come to know Jehovah

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you love him.

00:43:42.917 --> 00:43:46.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are happy
to acknowledge your decision

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give yourselves to God,

00:43:48.964 --> 00:43:53.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wholeheartedly welcome
you baptism candidates.

00:43:56.097 --> 00:44:01.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving of yourself in baptism
will lead to great happiness

00:44:01.018 --> 00:44:03.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it opens up opportunities

00:44:03.437 --> 00:44:07.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give of yourself in ways that truly count.

00:44:07.775 --> 00:44:12.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your baptism brings you
into a special relationship with Jehovah.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It allows you
to participate in doing his will

00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:20.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his approval
because you are obeying him.

00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:24.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:44:24.292 --> 00:44:26.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualified to present the evidence

00:44:26.711 --> 00:44:30.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
is the only “living and true God”!

00:44:33.092 --> 00:44:37.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dedication and baptism
opens the door for you

00:44:37.305 --> 00:44:40.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become a part
of the worldwide brotherhood,

00:44:40.892 --> 00:44:43.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a true modern-day miracle.

00:44:43.603 --> 00:44:46.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is nothing anywhere on this planet

00:44:46.731 --> 00:44:51.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can compare to the visible part
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:44:51.402 --> 00:44:56.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made up of people from all nations,
tribes, languages, and backgrounds

00:44:56.407 --> 00:45:01.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who really do love God
and love one another.

00:45:02.789 --> 00:45:05.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have more opportunities now

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:10.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than ever before to give
and receive encouragement.

00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:13.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:45:13.008 --> 00:45:16.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of the encouragement
you get from the brotherhood,

00:45:16.261 --> 00:45:18.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in fulfillment of Jesus’ promise

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mark 10:29, 30.

00:45:22.267 --> 00:45:24.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those two verses,

00:45:24.311 --> 00:45:27.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus assured his disciples

00:45:27.105 --> 00:45:29.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would “get 100 times more”

00:45:29.691 --> 00:45:32.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what they left behind in this old world,

00:45:32.694 --> 00:45:35.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and in the coming system of things,”

00:45:35.113 --> 00:45:38.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said that they
would have “everlasting life.”

00:45:38.825 --> 00:45:41.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have given Jesus
pleasure to share

00:45:41.787 --> 00:45:46.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that wonderful and encouraging promise
with his disciples,

00:45:46.208 --> 00:45:50.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it most certainly made
the disciples happy.

00:45:50.504 --> 00:45:53.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how it is, isn’t it?

00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:58.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving and making other people happy
makes us happy.

00:45:58.011 --> 00:46:03.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The happiness you can experience
by helping others is unlimited

00:46:03.016 --> 00:46:06.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah focuses
on your motive for giving

00:46:06.562 --> 00:46:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why you give.

00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:11.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never takes
for granted what you do,

00:46:11.483 --> 00:46:15.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will always reward you for it.

00:46:15.362 --> 00:46:19.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me Hebrews 6:10,

00:46:19.533 --> 00:46:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note of the fact

00:46:21.577 --> 00:46:25.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
remembers why you give

00:46:25.664 --> 00:46:29.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you do
to advance Kingdom interests

00:46:29.501 --> 00:46:34.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 6:10.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:46:36.967 --> 00:46:41.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:46:41.972 --> 00:46:46.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love you showed
for his name by ministering

00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:51.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continuing to minister
to the holy ones.”

00:46:51.232 --> 00:46:53.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the scripture shows,

00:46:53.234 --> 00:46:56.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah won’t forget what you do

00:46:56.362 --> 00:46:59.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are motivated
by love for his name.

00:47:01.158 --> 00:47:04.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now consider more closely two areas

00:47:04.412 --> 00:47:09.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which baptism broadens
your opportunities to give:

00:47:09.417 --> 00:47:12.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, making disciples,

00:47:12.378 --> 00:47:16.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, helping your brothers
and sisters in the faith.

00:47:18.301 --> 00:47:21.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The foremost way
for you and for me to give

00:47:21.137 --> 00:47:23.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by sharing
the good news of the Kingdom

00:47:23.806 --> 00:47:26.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making disciples.

00:47:26.225 --> 00:47:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ exhortation to make disciples

00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:32.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:34.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The commission to make disciples

00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:37.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given not only
to the first-century Christians

00:47:37.737 --> 00:47:40.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to all of Jesus’ disciples,

00:47:40.323 --> 00:47:44.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right down to the time of the end
in which we are living.

00:47:44.243 --> 00:47:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think for a moment

00:47:46.246 --> 00:47:50.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is involved in disciple-making.

00:47:50.083 --> 00:47:53.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the result of preaching and teaching.

00:47:53.795 --> 00:47:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that it takes time

00:47:56.256 --> 00:47:59.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for and take part in the ministry.

00:48:00.176 --> 00:48:03.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sample presentations
we see in the midweek meetings

00:48:03.721 --> 00:48:05.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not complicated,

00:48:05.723 --> 00:48:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s good that they
don’t change too often.

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to have a presentation well in mind

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:15.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be prepared for the field service,

00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:20.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may need to give up some time
you formerly spent on yourself.

00:48:20.905 --> 00:48:25.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes time to learn a presentation
and to become familiar with it.

00:48:25.827 --> 00:48:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But taking the time is worth it.

00:48:29.164 --> 00:48:33.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good feeling
to be prepared and ready to preach

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:38.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have something to say and a video 
to show whenever you have the opportunity.

00:48:40.592 --> 00:48:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are sheep out there,

00:48:43.386 --> 00:48:46.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we don’t know where they are,

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:50.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we try to call on everyone.

00:48:50.018 --> 00:48:53.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to hear about the Kingdom,

00:48:53.105 --> 00:48:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether they accept the message or not.

00:48:55.649 --> 00:48:57.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t become discouraged

00:48:57.776 --> 00:49:01.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you don’t have
the kind of results you anticipated.

00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:05.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just keep on preaching,
and you will be blessed.

00:49:06.535 --> 00:49:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you preach,
you are engaging

00:49:09.538 --> 00:49:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most important work
being done today

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—announcing God’s Kingdom—

00:49:15.711 --> 00:49:19.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of Matthew 24:14:

00:49:19.173 --> 00:49:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:31.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the end will come.”

00:49:33.187 --> 00:49:36.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are successful
in obeying Jesus’ words

00:49:36.315 --> 00:49:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach the Kingdom message

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when people reject the good news.

00:49:41.487 --> 00:49:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t control how people respond,

00:49:44.615 --> 00:49:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you do not let up in preaching
the lifesaving message of truth.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honest hearts respond
to the Kingdom message.

00:49:54.416 --> 00:49:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be courageous and trust in Jehovah

00:49:57.753 --> 00:50:01.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his powerful spirit to help you.

00:50:01.215 --> 00:50:06.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your work will have
everlasting results for you personally

00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:09.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for those who listen to you
and embrace the truth.

00:50:11.434 --> 00:50:13.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul tells us

00:50:13.519 --> 00:50:16.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:9

00:50:16.814 --> 00:50:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by sharing in the ministry,

00:50:19.442 --> 00:50:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you become Jehovah’s fellow worker.

00:50:23.237 --> 00:50:25.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine?

00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:27.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah invites imperfect humans

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:31.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cooperate with him,
the almighty Creator,

00:50:31.621 --> 00:50:36.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a special work that he
considers highly important.

00:50:36.209 --> 00:50:40.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith and hope
become stronger as you give

00:50:40.713 --> 00:50:44.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sharing with others
what you know about Jehovah

00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:46.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Kingdom.

00:50:46.344 --> 00:50:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
the simple and enriching truth stated

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 11:24;

00:50:55.603 --> 00:50:59.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it applies both materially and spiritually.

00:50:59.983 --> 00:51:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Proverbs 11:24,

00:51:04.654 --> 00:51:06.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it reads:

00:51:06.698 --> 00:51:09.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One gives generously

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and ends up with more;

00:51:12.203 --> 00:51:15.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“another withholds what should be given,

00:51:15.874 --> 00:51:18.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he comes to poverty.”

00:51:19.586 --> 00:51:22.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how much
you give to Jehovah,

00:51:22.422 --> 00:51:26.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will always get back
more than you give.

00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t outgive Jehovah!

00:51:29.804 --> 00:51:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:51:32.015 --> 00:51:36.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seize every opportunity
to give of yourself in the ministry,

00:51:36.228 --> 00:51:40.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your giving
will continue to bring you happiness.

00:51:40.398 --> 00:51:45.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more involved you are,
the happier you will be.

00:51:45.278 --> 00:51:49.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Engage in the ministry
every week if at all possible.

00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:52.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, think seriously about reaching out

00:51:52.619 --> 00:51:57.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as an auxiliary pioneer
or a regular pioneer.

00:51:57.082 --> 00:52:01.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to pioneers about the joy
they get from the ministry.

00:52:01.712 --> 00:52:04.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s contagious!

00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:07.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many doors to wonderful experiences 
and blessings

00:52:07.801 --> 00:52:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open to those who reach out
to expand their ministry.

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your regular participation
in the preaching work

00:52:18.061 --> 00:52:22.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows you the opportunity
to develop skill in using the Bible,

00:52:22.983 --> 00:52:27.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting conversations,
and in using the Teaching Toolbox.

00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:32.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us enjoy doing
the things that we do well;

00:52:32.493 --> 00:52:37.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re good at something,
usually you like doing it.

00:52:37.164 --> 00:52:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work at improving
the quality of your ministry.

00:52:41.043 --> 00:52:44.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you do, your joy will increase.

00:52:44.964 --> 00:52:47.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way joy increases

00:52:47.216 --> 00:52:51.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by participating in various forms
of the ministry

00:52:51.095 --> 00:52:54.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—public witnessing,
house to house, informal,

00:52:54.598 --> 00:52:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telephone witnessing, and letter writing.

00:52:57.393 --> 00:53:01.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, you can develop 
your skills in using the Bible,

00:53:01.939 --> 00:53:06.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your tablet, or cell phone 
to bring up scriptures or videos.

00:53:06.819 --> 00:53:10.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take the time to practice
starting conversations

00:53:10.823 --> 00:53:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and using the Teaching Toolbox.

00:53:13.826 --> 00:53:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does take practice
to find exactly what you’re looking for

00:53:17.663 --> 00:53:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to use it to give a witness.

00:53:21.626 --> 00:53:23.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approaching strangers

00:53:23.711 --> 00:53:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and engaging them
in conversation about the Bible

00:53:27.256 --> 00:53:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be a challenge.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:53:30.927 --> 00:53:35.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One reason is because some of us
are more reserved than others.

00:53:37.183 --> 00:53:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pleased to introduce
Sister Loraini Jackson.

00:53:41.312 --> 00:53:46.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Jackson has been serving
for many years in special full-time service

00:53:46.234 --> 00:53:49.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visiting a variety of lands
with her husband, Geoffrey.

00:53:50.738 --> 00:53:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Jackson,

00:53:53.574 --> 00:53:56.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at first, 
when you learned the truth

00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:59.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Fiji as a young person,

00:53:59.372 --> 00:54:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did you feel
about sharing in the ministry?

00:54:02.917 --> 00:54:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Malenfant,

00:54:04.919 --> 00:54:08.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am shy and reserved by nature.

00:54:08.214 --> 00:54:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
that when I first learned

00:54:11.926 --> 00:54:15.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants us
to preach his good news,

00:54:15.555 --> 00:54:17.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was excited,

00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:21.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even more so, I was terrified.

00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:26.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that preaching
would mean approaching strangers

00:54:26.066 --> 00:54:28.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to have
conversations with them,

00:54:28.985 --> 00:54:31.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often when they least expected it.

00:54:31.363 --> 00:54:34.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really,
all I wanted to do is just be quiet

00:54:34.866 --> 00:54:36.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be on my own.

00:54:36.952 --> 00:54:41.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think there are many brothers
and sisters who feel the same way.

00:54:42.791 --> 00:54:46.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to share
in the ministry more fully?

00:54:46.837 --> 00:54:49.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the main thing
that has helped me

00:54:49.297 --> 00:54:52.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is relying on Jehovah’s help
through prayer.

00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:56.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many others, I talk to Jehovah
constantly about my struggles

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the struggle to say the right thing,

00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:02.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the struggle to not show fear

00:55:02.686 --> 00:55:05.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my manner or my voice,

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the struggle to remember
the right scriptures to use

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to use them well

00:55:10.152 --> 00:55:12.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, if someone is rude,

00:55:12.613 --> 00:55:16.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to remain calm and kind.

00:55:17.367 --> 00:55:19.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words are appreciated.

00:55:19.786 --> 00:55:22.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us, what are some of the things

00:55:22.873 --> 00:55:26.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that bring you joy in the ministry?

00:55:26.126 --> 00:55:29.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The things that bring me joy
are the very things

00:55:29.004 --> 00:55:31.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not have done
without Jehovah’s help

00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:36.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—things like conversing freely
with people (strangers)

00:55:36.261 --> 00:55:38.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah and the Bible

00:55:38.847 --> 00:55:43.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then having the opportunity
to see people’s eyes light up

00:55:43.268 --> 00:55:48.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they read or understand
a Bible verse for the first time

00:55:48.273 --> 00:55:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I think those are really precious)

00:55:50.359 --> 00:55:54.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, helping a Bible student
work through a problem

00:55:54.196 --> 00:55:57.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then also trying
to become their friend.

00:55:57.199 --> 00:56:02.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think things like these really show
Jehovah’s power and support.

00:56:02.163 --> 00:56:05.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all I can do is thank him for them.

00:56:05.499 --> 00:56:09.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very encouraging for all of us,
Sister Jackson.

00:56:09.295 --> 00:56:11.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My final question is,

00:56:11.422 --> 00:56:14.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel about participating

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:16.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in various aspects of the ministry?

00:56:16.969 --> 00:56:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I still lack so much,
but I’m so grateful

00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:23.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the opportunities I’ve been given

00:56:23.184 --> 00:56:26.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to participate
in various aspects of the ministry

00:56:26.354 --> 00:56:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they’ve allowed me
to help others start their own journeys

00:56:31.067 --> 00:56:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to becoming Jehovah’s friend,

00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:35.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ve also given me an opportunity

00:56:35.696 --> 00:56:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with Jehovah
and really rely on him.

00:56:40.576 --> 00:56:44.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel the ministry helps one,

00:56:44.413 --> 00:56:46.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if one is shy,

00:56:46.415 --> 00:56:48.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on others,

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah, on Jesus,

00:56:51.212 --> 00:56:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on people and their needs

00:56:53.256 --> 00:56:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not so much on one’s own limitations.

00:56:57.385 --> 00:57:01.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true,
I’m still very reserved and shy.

00:57:01.806 --> 00:57:05.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as those close to me know,
some days are good,

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other days I feel
like hiding somewhere

00:57:08.479 --> 00:57:10.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not saying much.

00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:14.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the ministry
has helped me manage my shyness

00:57:14.777 --> 00:57:19.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has helped train me
to accept other assignments of service.

00:57:19.532 --> 00:57:24.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am convinced that anyone,
whether timid or otherwise,

00:57:24.537 --> 00:57:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can rejoice in the ministry,

00:57:26.956 --> 00:57:30.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided that they
rely constantly on Jehovah

00:57:30.418 --> 00:57:32.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on him.

00:57:32.712 --> 00:57:35.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Sister Jackson,

00:57:35.548 --> 00:57:38.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for such encouraging expressions of faith.

00:57:40.553 --> 00:57:43.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is there to help us

00:57:43.556 --> 00:57:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we trust in him
and put forth a sincere effort

00:57:47.644 --> 00:57:50.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give of ourselves
in the preaching activity.

00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second way to give is by helping

00:57:55.193 --> 00:57:58.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those related to us in the faith.”

00:57:58.447 --> 00:58:02.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote about this at Galatians 6:10.

00:58:02.033 --> 00:58:04.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:58:04.035 --> 00:58:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, then,
as long as we have the opportunity,

00:58:08.331 --> 00:58:11.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us work what is good toward all,

00:58:11.335 --> 00:58:16.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:20.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you are part of a beautiful family.

00:58:20.385 --> 00:58:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Willingly use your time, energy,

00:58:22.971 --> 00:58:25.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and resources to assist
your fellow believers

00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:28.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “work what is good toward [them].”

00:58:28.977 --> 00:58:31.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about your brothers 
in the congregation

00:58:31.647 --> 00:58:35.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and identify those whom you
can assist in practical ways.

00:58:35.859 --> 00:58:37.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself,

00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there someone in the congregation

00:58:40.322 --> 00:58:43.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I could help by giving
that person a ride to a meeting

00:58:43.826 --> 00:58:47.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps running
an errand for him or for her?’

00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:52.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps visit the elderly
and offer to assist them in practical ways.

00:58:52.334 --> 00:58:56.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all want to show personal interest
in our brothers and sisters

00:58:56.922 --> 00:58:59.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be a source
of encouragement to them.

00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:05.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we want to support
relief efforts for needy Christians.

00:59:05.973 --> 00:59:08.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Natural disasters occur,

00:59:08.225 --> 00:59:11.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there is sickness as well as poverty,

00:59:11.103 --> 00:59:13.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among many other things.

00:59:13.397 --> 00:59:15.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t it thrill you

00:59:15.399 --> 00:59:17.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you read how
the brothers respond generously

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist fellow believers
who are in need?

00:59:21.655 --> 00:59:25.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 8:1-4,

00:59:25.618 --> 00:59:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul expresses deep appreciation

00:59:28.204 --> 00:59:30.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the brothers in Macedonia,

00:59:30.498 --> 00:59:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice why Paul felt that way

—2 Corinthians 8:1-4:

00:59:39.799 --> 00:59:42.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now we want you to know, brothers,

“about the undeserved kindness of God

“that has been granted
to the congregations of Macedonia.

“During a great test under affliction,

“their abundance of joy
and their deep poverty

00:59:55.731 --> 00:59:59.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“made the riches
of their generosity abound.

00:59:59.277 --> 01:00:01.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

it was even beyond their means,

“while they on their own initiative

“kept earnestly begging us
for the privilege of kindly giving,

01:00:12.832 --> 01:00:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a share
in the relief ministry for the holy ones.”

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:21.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in Macedonia
took the initiative

01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:25.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide loving help
to their spiritual family

01:00:25.512 --> 01:00:28.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of their own poverty.

01:00:28.723 --> 01:00:32.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fine example for us to be generous

01:00:32.185 --> 01:00:35.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to assist
our spiritual brothers and sisters

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever way we can!

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving to others
can be done in different ways.

01:00:45.365 --> 01:00:47.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that thought in mind,

01:00:47.575 --> 01:00:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are happy to interview
Sister Penny Pierce.

01:00:51.788 --> 01:00:55.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pierce,
you have raised a family;

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:58.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve spent decades
in special full-time service

01:00:58.962 --> 01:01:01.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and traveled to a variety of lands

01:01:01.339 --> 01:01:05.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your husband, Guy,
who was a member of the Governing Body.

01:01:05.051 --> 01:01:08.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, like Dorcas, 
you have a reputation

01:01:08.597 --> 01:01:12.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “[abounding] in good deeds 
and gifts of mercy.”

01:01:12.517 --> 01:01:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us, Sister Pierce,

01:01:14.603 --> 01:01:17.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what motivates you to assist others?

01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:22.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is found
at 1 Chronicles 29:14, where it says:

01:01:22.194 --> 01:01:24.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For everything is from you,

01:01:24.196 --> 01:01:27.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have given to you
what comes from your own hand.”

01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:31.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So anything that I may give
actually comes from Jehovah.

01:01:31.787 --> 01:01:34.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, with the coronavirus,

01:01:34.081 --> 01:01:38.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen an outpouring
of Jehovah’s people giving.

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:41.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have given time and energy,

01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:43.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotions, a listening ear.

01:01:43.715 --> 01:01:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And video chatting
—everyone (young and old)

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave love, faith, and trust.

01:01:49.012 --> 01:01:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it didn’t cost anything.

01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:53.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,
‘Jehovah is doing wonderful things

01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:55.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of a tragic pandemic.’

01:01:55.769 --> 01:02:00.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What you said
is truly practical and very helpful.

01:02:00.774 --> 01:02:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pierce,
please tell us the experience you had

01:02:04.653 --> 01:02:06.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you hosted brothers and sisters

01:02:06.947 --> 01:02:09.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during a special preaching campaign.

01:02:09.909 --> 01:02:14.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at times, we have
the opportunity to help materially too.

01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago,
when the family was home,

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:19.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had 30 people
coming to stay at our home.

01:02:19.627 --> 01:02:21.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were going to preach to refugees.

01:02:21.712 --> 01:02:25.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had one bathroom,
and I had 25 dollars,

01:02:25.382 --> 01:02:27.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which I spent completely on food.

01:02:27.593 --> 01:02:29.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I had zero.

01:02:29.595 --> 01:02:31.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never told anyone
that we didn’t have money.

01:02:31.931 --> 01:02:34.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew they didn’t have money too.

01:02:34.058 --> 01:02:36.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a wonderful time!

01:02:36.143 --> 01:02:40.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the friends left Sunday night,
I had more food than when they came.

01:02:40.106 --> 01:02:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That food lasted us for ten days,
to the end of the month.

01:02:44.318 --> 01:02:47.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I worried about the effect
on my teenage sons.

01:02:47.405 --> 01:02:49.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked one how he felt.

01:02:49.866 --> 01:02:54.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, 
“I know you have a jar of flour and oil.”

01:02:54.787 --> 01:02:57.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t worry anymore.

01:02:57.498 --> 01:03:00.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah certainly blessed you.

01:03:00.251 --> 01:03:03.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us how you view
what you did to host the friends

01:03:03.796 --> 01:03:06.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came to preach in your area.

01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:09.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these acts
of kindness that I did

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were very small to me,

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but often I didn’t know the big impact
it would have on their lives.

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when you realize

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:19.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve had the privilege
of working with holy spirit.

01:03:19.687 --> 01:03:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing I did;
it’s what Jehovah did.

01:03:23.942 --> 01:03:26.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful, Sister Pierce.

01:03:26.486 --> 01:03:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we would like to hear
a final expression from you

01:03:30.907 --> 01:03:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the joy that you
receive personally from giving.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One never gives to Jehovah
without receiving back a hundred fold.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not come from the same source,

01:03:41.793 --> 01:03:43.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it will come.

01:03:43.837 --> 01:03:47.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises at Acts 20:35:

01:03:47.132 --> 01:03:50.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.”

01:03:50.468 --> 01:03:54.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to admit,
Jehovah spoils me with blessings.

01:03:54.848 --> 01:03:58.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much,
Sister Pierce.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has certainly blessed you

01:04:01.688 --> 01:04:06.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your generosity
and your warm Christian hospitality.

01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:13.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping one another
strengthens the bonds of the brotherhood.

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is nothing like knowing
that your brothers really do love you.

01:04:19.372 --> 01:04:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how the brothers
in Jerusalem felt when they were in need

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:26.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received loving assistance
from the brothers in Corinth.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Corinthians 9:11-14.

01:04:33.845 --> 01:04:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is where the apostle Paul describes

01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reaction
of the needy brothers in Jerusalem

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the generosity
of the brothers in Corinth.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s 2 Corinthians 9:11-14.

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:52.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what Paul wrote:

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In everything you are being enriched

01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:57.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for every sort of generosity,

01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:02.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which produces through us
an expression of thanks to God;

01:05:02.624 --> 01:05:05.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the ministry
of this public service

01:05:05.711 --> 01:05:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is not only to provide well
for the needs of the holy ones

01:05:09.798 --> 01:05:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also to be rich
in many expressions of thanks to God.

01:05:15.471 --> 01:05:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Through the proof
that this relief ministry gives,

01:05:19.808 --> 01:05:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they [that is, the holy ones 
in Jerusalem] glorify God

01:05:23.979 --> 01:05:28.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you are submissive
to the good news about the Christ,

01:05:28.526 --> 01:05:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as you publicly declared,

01:05:30.778 --> 01:05:35.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and because you are generous
in your contribution to them and to all.

01:05:35.449 --> 01:05:38.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And with supplication for you,

01:05:38.077 --> 01:05:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they express affection for you

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:44.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the surpassing
undeserved kindness of God

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon you.”

01:05:46.502 --> 01:05:50.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in Jerusalem
glorified Jehovah,

01:05:50.423 --> 01:05:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just because they received
some material provisions,

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:57.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather, it was
because the brothers in Corinth,

01:05:57.555 --> 01:06:00.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who for the most part
were new in the Christian faith,

01:06:00.558 --> 01:06:04.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were motivated by love
to send material help.

01:06:04.562 --> 01:06:08.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the truth was in their hearts

01:06:08.274 --> 01:06:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made them cheerful givers
to their brothers in Jerusalem.

01:06:12.528 --> 01:06:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they all were happy
and felt Jehovah’s love and approval.

01:06:18.868 --> 01:06:22.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You baptism candidates will rejoice

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you sense and are convinced

01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:29.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is pleased with what you do.

01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 19:17 tells us

01:06:32.423 --> 01:06:36.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah views
unselfish giving to those in need.

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:38.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

01:06:38.972 --> 01:06:42.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one showing favor
to the lowly

01:06:42.142 --> 01:06:44.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is lending to Jehovah,

01:06:44.686 --> 01:06:48.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He will repay him for what he does.”

01:06:48.148 --> 01:06:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine “lending to Jehovah”?

01:06:52.527 --> 01:06:55.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we give spiritual or material help

01:06:55.447 --> 01:06:57.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in need,

01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees and views it
as a loan to him.

01:07:01.911 --> 01:07:05.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you can’t outgive Jehovah.

01:07:05.624 --> 01:07:09.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By giving to others and refreshing them,

01:07:09.002 --> 01:07:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the giver, in turn, will benefit himself.

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:15.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Proverbs 11:25 says:

01:07:15.592 --> 01:07:18.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The generous person will prosper,

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever refreshes others
will himself be refreshed.”

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:27.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today you feel happy

01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:30.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are giving
of yourself to Jehovah

01:07:30.982 --> 01:07:33.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve him forever.

01:07:33.151 --> 01:07:37.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You make us happy
by making that decision.

01:07:37.572 --> 01:07:41.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We exhort you to maintain your happiness

01:07:41.577 --> 01:07:45.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing what you
can reasonably do to help others

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:50.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving both in the ministry
and in the congregation.

01:07:50.377 --> 01:07:52.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will give back to you

01:07:52.963 --> 01:07:56.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more ways than you can imagine.

01:07:56.467 --> 01:07:59.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May the way in which you live

01:07:59.011 --> 01:08:02.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as dedicated servants of Jehovah

01:08:02.014 --> 01:08:05.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflect forever the fundamental truth

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
revealed by Jesus:

01:08:07.811 --> 01:08:11.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There <i>is</i>  more happiness in giving

01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:13.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than there is in receiving.”

01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:17.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Malenfant.

01:08:18.656 --> 01:08:23.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, the circumstances
for baptism will vary in each location.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:27.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you are watching
this broadcast from a private home.

01:08:27.456 --> 01:08:31.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly others of you are able
to gather at a Kingdom Hall.

01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:36.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In any event, your elders
have made suitable provisions

01:08:36.006 --> 01:08:38.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with local circumstances

01:08:38.092 --> 01:08:42.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for candidates to be baptized
after the conclusion of this session.

01:08:42.638 --> 01:08:46.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we finish singing
song number 79 together,

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:49.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptism candidates in your congregations

01:08:49.228 --> 01:08:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have an opportunity
to make a public declaration of their faith

01:08:53.316 --> 01:08:56.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by answering the two questions
posed by a local elder,

01:08:56.903 --> 01:08:59.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after which he will offer the prayer.

01:08:59.488 --> 01:09:03.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be assured that the brothers
at the branch office look forward

01:09:03.367 --> 01:09:06.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receiving your reports
about these baptisms

01:09:06.204 --> 01:09:08.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the circuit overseers.

01:09:08.498 --> 01:09:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now let us all
stand and sing together

01:09:12.168 --> 01:09:16.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
song number 79,
“Teach Them to Stand Firm.”

into more than 400 languages.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This work is supported
by branch offices around the globe.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us has an opportunity
to show appreciation

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:20.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the spiritual blessings
we have received in our own language.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way we can do this
is by making voluntary gifts

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with our circumstances.

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

at donate.jw.org.

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you faced serious obstacles

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you try to do what Jehovah commands?

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can servants of God

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain their joy despite such challenges?

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:58.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to watch and learn
from the drama

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Nehemiah: “The Joy of Jehovah</i>
<i>Is Your Stronghold”—Part I.</i>

00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:14.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we learned in our audio drama,

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews returned to Jerusalem

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:21.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rebuild the temple in 537 B.C.E.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:26.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by 515 B.C.E., it was finally completed.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:30.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the city’s walls were still left in ruins.

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:34.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s time had now come to rebuild the walls,

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:37.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he used the faithful man Nehemiah

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead in this work.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would be a massive undertaking for the Jews.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once again, there were opposers.

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:48.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah told the nation of Israel

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:52.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:56.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could he encourage them to be joyful

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:58.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite all the opposition?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lessons can we learn from their example?

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many,

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here are three to think about as you watch:

00:02:07.858 --> 00:02:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What role did prayer play in helping Nehemiah

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a courageous person for Jehovah?

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to direct attacks,

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what schemes did the enemies employ

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to oppose the work?

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite setbacks,

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was Nehemiah’s main source of joy?

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:31.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Got it?

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, then, with that in mind, please sit back

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:39.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the following video presentation

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:43.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.”</i>

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege to have a share

00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:56.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the restoration of Jehovah’s worship.

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:00.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People know we rebuilt the wall,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is so much more to the story.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start at the beginning.

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:17.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 20th year of King Artaxerxes Longimanus,

00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:20.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in Shushan the palace.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was cupbearer to the king.

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:37.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He trusted me with his life.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:41.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I was far from Jerusalem,

00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found great joy just thinking

00:03:44.038 --> 00:03:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our people there serving Jehovah

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until one day when I received a visit

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from my brother Hanani.

00:03:52.922 --> 00:03:55.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That visit changed everything.

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:07.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going on, Hanani?

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our people?

00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:12.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not good.

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The conditions are disgraceful.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the temple?

00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It stands,

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the services are nothing but empty rituals.

00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the people and the priests ignore God’s Law.

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to return with us.

00:04:46.893 --> 00:04:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For days, my conscience plagued me.

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:58.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would the king even allow me to go?

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our people had sinned

00:05:05.453 --> 00:05:10.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not keeping Jehovah’s commandments,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I felt as if I were sinning

00:05:13.253 --> 00:05:16.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not helping them in their time of need.

00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:20.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged Jehovah to grant me success.

00:05:30.103 --> 00:05:31.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah,

00:05:31.813 --> 00:05:34.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are you so gloomy when you’re not sick?

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:37.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be nothing but gloominess of heart.

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I not look gloomy

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:43.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the city,

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:45.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the place where my forefathers are buried,

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:46.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies in ruins,

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:49.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been consumed by fire?

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, what is this?

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:52.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speak frankly.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:53.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you seeking?

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:59.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At once, I prayed to the God of the heavens.

00:06:03.512 --> 00:06:05.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it pleases the king

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:10.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if your servant has found favor with you,

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:12.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send me to Judah,

00:06:12.604 --> 00:06:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the city where my forefathers are buried,

00:06:14.857 --> 00:06:16.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let me rebuild it.

00:06:23.198 --> 00:06:24.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may go.

00:06:25.492 --> 00:06:28.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with us.

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:33.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king gave me supplies,

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an army,

00:06:35.753 --> 00:06:38.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an appointment as governor.

00:06:41.008 --> 00:06:45.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were on our way to help rebuild Jerusalem’s walls.

00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:36.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had seen a portion of the city,

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:38.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t until I rose

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by night to inspect the walls

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I saw just how badly God’s city had been treated.

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait here.

00:08:16.813 --> 00:08:19.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe the destruction.

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:29.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time had come

00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:32.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal Jehovah’s purpose for Jerusalem.

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:35.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I gathered the leaders.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this man?

00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:43.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m told he’s Nehemiah, cupbearer to the king.

00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:46.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does he want from us?

00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:49.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men!

00:08:54.851 --> 00:08:58.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holy city is completely vulnerable.

00:08:58.605 --> 00:09:02.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,

00:09:02.192 --> 00:09:04.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that this disgrace will not continue.

00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:06.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will our neighbors think?

00:09:06.238 --> 00:09:08.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we have many powerful enemies.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes commissioned me

00:09:11.702 --> 00:09:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rebuild the walls and the entire city.

00:09:14.037 --> 00:09:16.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Didn’t you see the horsemen he sent

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the timber?

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:20.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave it all!

00:09:20.544 --> 00:09:23.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, the good hand of our God was upon me.

00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:26.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one to fear, not men.

00:09:26.967 --> 00:09:29.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will give us success.

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:38.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not everyone was happy

00:09:38.687 --> 00:09:40.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had come to do something good

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the people of Israel.

00:09:43.943 --> 00:09:46.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what this Nehemiah is up to.

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, do you see what I’m seeing?

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:51.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a wall,

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:53.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can keep the Jews under control.

00:09:53.953 --> 00:09:55.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they rebuild it,

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:58.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews won’t need our land or resources.

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means he’s planning to rebel.

00:10:00.209 --> 00:10:01.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t let him.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must act, and act together.

00:10:05.756 --> 00:10:06.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you with me?

00:10:06.757 --> 00:10:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have my support.

00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:12.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And mine, as always.

00:10:12.847 --> 00:10:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good!

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:17.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go to Jerusalem to keep an eye on Nehemiah.

00:10:20.229 --> 00:10:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opposers wanted to maintain control

00:10:22.565 --> 00:10:24.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to profit from Jehovah’s people.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wasted little time trying to intimidate us.

00:10:33.451 --> 00:10:35.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are these?

00:10:36.704 --> 00:10:39.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Sanballat, governor of Samaria.

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next to him is Tobiah, an Ammonite official

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:45.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and landowner to many of our people.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all look up to him.

00:10:47.215 --> 00:10:49.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Geshem;

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s a very wealthy Arabian and close ally to Sanballat.

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, are you rebelling against the king?

00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king himself gave us the authority.

00:11:13.658 --> 00:11:15.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To rebuild the city and the wall?

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To rebuild the city and the wall

00:11:17.036 --> 00:11:18.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what the king expects us to do.

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:20.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did you not consult with me?

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:23.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am the governor of Samaria.

00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but the king appointed

00:11:24.794 --> 00:11:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah as governor of Judah.

00:11:27.047 --> 00:11:28.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why have you not asked for our help?

00:11:28.715 --> 00:11:30.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worship Jehovah too.

00:11:30.508 --> 00:11:32.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve sacrificed to him for generations.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with sacrifices to all of your other gods.

00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The God of the heavens

00:11:38.016 --> 00:11:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the One that will grant us success,

00:11:40.227 --> 00:11:42.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we, his servants,

00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:43.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will get up and build.

00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one should let his religious beliefs

00:11:46.358 --> 00:11:48.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come before national unity.

00:11:48.902 --> 00:11:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have neither share

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor claim nor memorial in Jerusalem.

00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat,

00:12:04.251 --> 00:12:06.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could it be you

00:12:06.253 --> 00:12:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is rebelling against the highest King of all?

00:12:15.554 --> 00:12:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite opposition,

00:12:17.598 --> 00:12:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people worked strenuously.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, these things have to go somewhere.

00:12:40.662 --> 00:12:43.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their struggles went far beyond building a wall.

00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah remembers brothers like Peleth.

00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:50.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how he dealt with personal challenges

00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened my faith.

00:12:55.678 --> 00:12:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peleth.

00:12:57.346 --> 00:12:58.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham.

00:12:58.806 --> 00:13:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll never finish this work.

00:13:00.683 --> 00:13:02.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nothing but rubble.

00:13:02.768 --> 00:13:04.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least we’re trying to make a change.

00:13:05.646 --> 00:13:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always an optimist.

00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, you’re late on your rent

00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again.

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, I’m sorry;

00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need more time.

00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the work on the wall, . . .

00:13:17.992 --> 00:13:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enough troubles.

00:13:19.702 --> 00:13:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, if I don’t get payment

00:13:21.412 --> 00:13:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the end of the month,

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and your family are out.

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there anything we can do?

00:13:30.546 --> 00:13:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe I can work it off till we get caught up.

00:13:33.883 --> 00:13:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seriously?

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have time to work it off,

00:13:39.138 --> 00:13:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe your daughter can help.

00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:43.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She can come stay with us.

00:13:44.018 --> 00:13:45.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a slave?

00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’ll hire her to help Azubah

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:49.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to pay off your debt.

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I’m trying to help,

00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:54.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you don’t have many options here, my friend.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Raham spoke to me today.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About what?

00:14:29.647 --> 00:14:31.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to hire Simcha to help Azubah in the house.

00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:35.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says he’ll care for her like his own daughter.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imma, I’ve known Raham and Azubah

00:14:39.824 --> 00:14:42.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever since I came here with Ezra.

00:14:42.369 --> 00:14:43.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham helped us.

00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our house belongs to him.

00:14:46.998 --> 00:14:48.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t trust him.

00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:51.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants our Simcha to live with him?

00:14:51.461 --> 00:14:52.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imma, . . .

00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:54.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Jehovah’s command

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that parents raise their own children?

00:14:56.675 --> 00:14:59.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you want her to have a better life?

00:15:04.307 --> 00:15:06.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I-I cannot agree

00:15:06.768 --> 00:15:09.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to having her live apart from us,

00:15:09.396 --> 00:15:11.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we have to survive on gleanings.

00:15:11.773 --> 00:15:13.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know we’ll survive at all?

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:17.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah always takes care

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who love and obey him.

00:15:23.327 --> 00:15:26.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men like Peleth threw their burden on Jehovah

00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept working.

00:15:39.718 --> 00:15:41.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat set up camp near Jerusalem

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep an eye on our progress.

00:15:51.897 --> 00:15:53.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is it?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord.

00:15:54.608 --> 00:15:55.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes?

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:56.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall

00:15:56.026 --> 00:15:58.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s up to half its height all around the city.

00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:00.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has gone too far!

00:16:01.782 --> 00:16:03.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, how long will it take

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble an attack force?

00:16:05.953 --> 00:16:07.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attack force?

00:16:07.913 --> 00:16:11.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Sanballat, an attack on the Jews

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:13.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be an attack on the king.

00:16:13.252 --> 00:16:14.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you talking about?

00:16:14.503 --> 00:16:15.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s right.

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:18.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah has authorization from Artaxerxes himself.

00:16:18.424 --> 00:16:20.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw how many horsemen the king sent with him.

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:20.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:16:20.843 --> 00:16:22.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you be talking like this if those horsemen

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:23.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were still here?

00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:24.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they can come back.

00:16:24.388 --> 00:16:25.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nonsense!

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:27.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind the horsemen.

00:16:27.892 --> 00:16:30.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my province!

00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:33.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:36.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we need to threaten them.

00:16:37.526 --> 00:16:39.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem, you bring Samaritan troops

00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:41.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come in from this way.

00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:42.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re preparing to attack us!

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you know that?

00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:45.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard them talking.

00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:49.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, please.

00:16:49.038 --> 00:16:51.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have they attacked anyone yet?

00:16:51.082 --> 00:16:51.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have.

00:16:51.999 --> 00:16:52.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw something.

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:56.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait until they start killing us?

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:16:57.171 --> 00:16:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not!

00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:05.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani,

00:17:06.347 --> 00:17:08.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
post men by families at the lowest parts of the wall 

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at all the exposed places.

00:17:10.518 --> 00:17:11.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Nehemiah.

00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:12.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not going to work.

00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:15.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:17:15.022 --> 00:17:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we let mere threats frighten us into stopping,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will have achieved their goal.

00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:20.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no use. Don’t you see?

00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:21.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These people hate what we’re doing.

00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:22.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hate us.

00:17:22.822 --> 00:17:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to live and work around them like we do.

00:17:24.907 --> 00:17:26.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:17:26.284 --> 00:17:29.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where is your faith?

00:17:29.037 --> 00:17:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah’s will that we build this wall.

00:17:31.164 --> 00:17:32.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it is really Jehovah’s will,

00:17:32.123 --> 00:17:34.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why are we getting all this opposition?

00:17:35.126 --> 00:17:37.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe this isn’t the right time.

00:17:37.128 --> 00:17:38.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, this work is too much for us.

00:17:38.963 --> 00:17:39.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re worn out.

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:41.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we need a wall anyway?

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:49.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect Jehovah’s people.

00:17:50.558 --> 00:17:51.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:56.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not be afraid of them.

00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:59.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember Jehovah,

00:17:59.734 --> 00:18:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is great and awe-inspiring;

00:18:03.113 --> 00:18:05.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fight for your brothers,

00:18:07.075 --> 00:18:09.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your sons and daughters,

00:18:11.621 --> 00:18:13.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your wives and homes.

00:18:17.419 --> 00:18:19.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you hear the sound of the horn,

00:18:19.838 --> 00:18:22.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gather together to where we are.

00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:26.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our God will fight for us.

00:18:28.305 --> 00:18:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen for this signal.

00:18:38.148 --> 00:18:40.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The threats aren’t working.

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:44.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next sound they hear will be our battle cry.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:18:44.988 --> 00:18:46.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already spoke about this.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A direct attack would be seditious.

00:18:49.785 --> 00:18:52.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, they’ve armed themselves.

00:18:56.708 --> 00:18:58.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:18:58.293 --> 00:19:00.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My-my lord,

00:19:00.254 --> 00:19:03.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem is right.

00:19:03.006 --> 00:19:05.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d never get away with this.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you recall who commissioned Nehemiah?

00:19:07.469 --> 00:19:08.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the king.

00:19:08.554 --> 00:19:10.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the king of Persia, let me remind you.

00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is setting himself up as a king.

00:19:19.815 --> 00:19:23.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend we turn the accusation of sedition

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Nehemiah.

00:19:26.864 --> 00:19:28.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s brilliant!

00:19:28.866 --> 00:19:31.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,

00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:33.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will beg for our help.

00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to Samaria.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani,

00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:15.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look like you’ve been working.

00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must smell like it too.

00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:20.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:22.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you do.

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:25.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers!

00:20:27.216 --> 00:20:30.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we are well on our way to completing the wall.

00:20:30.428 --> 00:20:33.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is helping us,

00:20:33.431 --> 00:20:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we must not let our hands drop.

00:20:38.645 --> 00:20:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From now on,

00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:42.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will all spend the night inside Jerusalem.

00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:44.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will take turns keeping watch.

00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani will give out assignments.

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good work today.

00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:30.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was working hard on the wall.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:37.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there were more issues to contend with.

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:44.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My brothers, how can I help you?

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:49.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, we, with our sons and daughters, are many.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:51.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need food to stay alive.

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gave our fields and vineyards

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and houses as security to get grain during

00:21:59.059 --> 00:22:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food shortage.

00:22:00.477 --> 00:22:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We borrowed money

00:22:02.145 --> 00:22:04.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our fields and our vineyards to pay the king’s tribute.

00:22:06.775 --> 00:22:09.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had to sell some of our children into slavery.

00:22:09.444 --> 00:22:11.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re powerless to stop this

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:14.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our fields and vineyards belong to others.

00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must ponder all this.

00:22:21.248 --> 00:22:22.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Nehemiah.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hanani, please tell all the nobles

00:22:30.674 --> 00:22:32.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deputy rulers to come to me

00:22:32.718 --> 00:22:34.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With God’s help, we can make this right.

00:22:52.446 --> 00:22:53.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men of Judah,

00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:58.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each of you is demanding interest from your brother.

00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:02.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

00:23:02.123 --> 00:23:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should you not walk in the fear of our God

00:23:04.667 --> 00:23:07.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the nations, our enemies,

00:23:07.378 --> 00:23:09.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot reproach us?

00:23:09.672 --> 00:23:14.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please, stop this lending on interest.

00:23:14.635 --> 00:23:17.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please restore to them their fields,

00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:19.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vineyards, olive groves, houses,

00:23:21.976 --> 00:23:24.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the interest.

00:23:25.938 --> 00:23:30.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, I will restore the fields this day at sunset.

00:23:33.654 --> 00:23:36.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all will restore these things to our brothers.

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before Jehovah,

00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:43.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you swear to these promises?

00:23:43.206 --> 00:23:44.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do!

00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:47.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May the true God shake out from his house

00:23:47.293 --> 00:23:51.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every man who does not carry out this promise.

00:23:51.673 --> 00:23:53.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:23:58.262 --> 00:23:59.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meshullam,

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:03.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must inform Tobiah about this.

00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:08.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will be successful.

00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:10.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bless it.

00:24:20.076 --> 00:24:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham!

00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:24.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bring good news.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that so?

00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:27.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:29.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have your rent.

00:24:29.169 --> 00:24:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh?

00:24:31.171 --> 00:24:33.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come by anytime and collect it.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I thought we—

00:24:35.592 --> 00:24:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Simcha?

00:24:42.933 --> 00:24:44.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll be staying with us.

00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how were you able to put it together so quickly?

00:24:49.272 --> 00:24:51.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always takes care of those

00:24:51.191 --> 00:24:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love and obey him.

00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since Nehemiah got here,

00:24:57.531 --> 00:25:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things have been getting better and better.

00:25:14.965 --> 00:25:16.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah thinks we’re still as young

00:25:16.967 --> 00:25:18.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as when we came here with Ezra.

00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:20.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve worked hard.

00:25:22.097 --> 00:25:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now Nehemiah treats us like it all fell out of heaven,

00:25:24.308 --> 00:25:26.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we just have to pick it up.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked hard for what I have, didn’t I?

00:25:28.937 --> 00:25:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you worked hard.

00:25:30.147 --> 00:25:32.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I give back my fields,

00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what am I to eat?

00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What am I to drink?

00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:37.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong with lending on interest?

00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:40.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You borrow, you pay with interest.

00:25:40.032 --> 00:25:42.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raham, Jehovah just wants us

00:25:42.034 --> 00:25:43.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to treat our brothers fairly, doesn’t he?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Haven’t you heard a word I said?

00:25:44.995 --> 00:25:46.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I treat everyone fairly!

00:25:52.294 --> 00:25:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why are you so angry?

00:25:54.296 --> 00:25:56.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not angry!

00:25:58.342 --> 00:26:00.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you talking to me like this?

00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just feel betrayed.

00:26:04.223 --> 00:26:05.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By whom?

00:26:05.224 --> 00:26:07.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the people I’ve lent money to!

00:26:10.646 --> 00:26:12.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can I do about it?

00:26:12.356 --> 00:26:15.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only what a wife is supposed to do!

00:26:15.067 --> 00:26:17.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give me a son!

00:26:17.194 --> 00:26:19.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not a son, then a daughter.

00:26:22.658 --> 00:26:26.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot give you what Jehovah does not give us.

00:26:26.078 --> 00:26:27.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,

00:26:27.747 --> 00:26:30.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be too late.

00:26:41.302 --> 00:26:43.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say we write a letter to the king.

00:26:43.304 --> 00:26:45.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s see what the boy reports when he returns.

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:47.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Sanballat.

00:26:47.141 --> 00:26:48.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:50.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall has no more gaps.

00:26:50.645 --> 00:26:52.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What?

00:26:54.565 --> 00:26:57.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can they advance so quickly?

00:26:57.652 --> 00:27:01.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there’s a letter for Tobiah.

00:27:14.961 --> 00:27:16.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is forcing

00:27:16.963 --> 00:27:20.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
landlords to return their fields to the original owners.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:22.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re running out of time.

00:27:22.135 --> 00:27:23.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough!

00:27:28.725 --> 00:27:30.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell this to Nehemiah:

00:27:32.103 --> 00:27:34.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Come, and let us set a time

00:27:34.731 --> 00:27:38.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet together in the Valley Plain of Ono.”

00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to lure me away from Jerusalem

00:27:41.404 --> 00:27:43.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do me harm.

00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, tell your master:

00:27:51.623 --> 00:27:53.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am engaged in a great work,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I am not able to go down.

00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:57.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why should the work stop

00:27:57.128 --> 00:27:58.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while I leave it to come to you?”

00:27:58.838 --> 00:28:02.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent me the same message several times.

00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:06.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time I gave them the same response.

00:28:14.104 --> 00:28:17.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, he has rejected your offer a fourth time.

00:28:23.321 --> 00:28:24.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Geshem,

00:28:24.322 --> 00:28:27.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s time to implement your plan.

00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:29.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:28:29.578 --> 00:28:31.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
write this down:

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Among the nations it has been heard,

00:28:34.249 --> 00:28:37.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Geshem is also saying it,

00:28:37.294 --> 00:28:41.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you and the Jews

00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:43.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are scheming to rebel.

00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:47.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why you are building the wall.”

00:29:05.072 --> 00:29:06.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes?

00:29:07.658 --> 00:29:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give this to Nehemiah.

00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:33.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell your master:

00:29:33.893 --> 00:29:36.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“None of the things you are saying have taken place.

00:29:37.271 --> 00:29:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are making them up out of your own imagination.”

00:30:00.753 --> 00:30:02.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re bluffing.

00:30:02.922 --> 00:30:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re trying to frighten us into stopping the work.

00:30:05.508 --> 00:30:08.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they know that the king won’t change his decree.

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:14.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But believe me, they won’t stop.

00:30:37.123 --> 00:30:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I pray,

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthen my hands.

00:30:46.341 --> 00:30:48.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to stop him?

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have much time.

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:53.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall is almost complete.

00:30:58.603 --> 00:31:00.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat,

00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I know a way.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah, you called for me.

00:31:06.444 --> 00:31:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:31:08.947 --> 00:31:09.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quickly!

00:31:11.116 --> 00:31:13.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are in great danger.

00:31:13.368 --> 00:31:15.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so am I because I know about it.

00:31:15.036 --> 00:31:15.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk sense, man!

00:31:15.787 --> 00:31:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What danger?

00:31:17.247 --> 00:31:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re coming to kill you—by night!

00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:23.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must go into the temple and close the doors.

00:31:23.211 --> 00:31:25.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shemaiah,

00:31:25.005 --> 00:31:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should a man like me run away?

00:31:27.257 --> 00:31:29.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t understand.

00:31:29.134 --> 00:31:32.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that do to the spirit of the entire nation?

00:31:32.095 --> 00:31:34.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the only safe place.

00:31:34.097 --> 00:31:36.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, I’m not a priest.

00:31:36.349 --> 00:31:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I entered the temple,

00:31:38.352 --> 00:31:39.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be valid reason to kill me.

00:31:39.978 --> 00:31:42.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not go in.

00:31:42.773 --> 00:31:45.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That decision would be foolish, Nehemiah.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see!

00:31:52.616 --> 00:31:56.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah and Sanballat put you up to this,

00:31:56.537 --> 00:31:58.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t they, you hypocrite?

00:31:58.664 --> 00:32:00.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah remember them

00:32:00.624 --> 00:32:02.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you false prophets

00:32:02.209 --> 00:32:03.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who keep trying to frighten me.

00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:06.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, Hanani,

00:32:06.004 --> 00:32:08.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have work to do.

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:20.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Argh!

00:32:24.356 --> 00:32:27.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just kept working day and night.

00:32:27.568 --> 00:32:29.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we knew it,

00:32:29.903 --> 00:32:33.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were finishing the very last section of the wall.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us to achieve the impossible.

00:32:56.722 --> 00:32:58.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were tired,

00:32:58.683 --> 00:33:00.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we discovered something we had lost

00:33:04.063 --> 00:33:05.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy.

00:33:07.358 --> 00:33:10.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah, the wall is complete!

00:33:10.653 --> 00:33:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah! Yes!

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:33:15.533 --> 00:33:17.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just 52 days.

00:33:23.583 --> 00:33:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, it’s from Shemaiah. 

00:33:40.975 --> 00:33:42.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it say?

00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:55.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wall is complete.

00:33:55.573 --> 00:33:59.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the doors are left to be put in.

00:33:59.327 --> 00:34:02.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat, we must act quickly.

00:34:02.413 --> 00:34:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sanballat . . .

00:34:03.706 --> 00:34:06.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop it, Tobiah.

00:34:06.417 --> 00:34:07.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, there’s still time.

00:34:07.752 --> 00:34:09.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Write that letter to the king.

00:34:09.337 --> 00:34:11.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tobiah,

00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you see?

00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:16.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God must be helping the Jews.

00:34:19.931 --> 00:34:21.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s over.

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:24.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll lose all control over them.

00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:29.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t over.

00:35:19.658 --> 00:35:23.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebuilding the walls was only the beginning.

00:35:23.745 --> 00:35:26.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would definitely need God’s help

00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:28.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what was coming next.

00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:38.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you now eager to see
the conclusion of the drama?

00:35:38.177 --> 00:35:40.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will enjoy Part II

00:35:40.804 --> 00:35:44.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the final session of this convention.

00:35:44.183 --> 00:35:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account of Nehemiah teaches us

00:35:47.227 --> 00:35:51.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trust in Jehovah
as we carry out our assigned work.

00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout this session
and the preceding one,

00:35:55.778 --> 00:35:59.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have been focusing
on the vital work

00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making disciples.

00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:04.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall the key lessons?

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, what disciple-making work
do we look forward to in the future?

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:14.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay close attention
to Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:16.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he delivers the talk

00:36:16.424 --> 00:36:21.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Making Disciples Now Prepares Us
for New World Disciple-Making.”

00:36:29.812 --> 00:36:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things in life

00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:36.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prepare a person for greater things.

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, elementary school

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:41.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a student for high school.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Running shorter races

00:36:43.242 --> 00:36:46.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a person to run a marathon.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working as an apprentice

00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:53.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares a worker to serve as a professional.

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this talk, we’re going to discuss

00:36:56.839 --> 00:37:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how disciple-making now prepares us

00:37:01.844 --> 00:37:05.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the greater disciple-making work

00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world.

00:37:07.684 --> 00:37:09.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s briefly discuss

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:14.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how making disciples right now
brings a lot of joy.

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Psalm 105.

00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:19.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is the theme scripture

00:37:19.696 --> 00:37:21.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for today’s program,

00:37:21.865 --> 00:37:24.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 105:3:

00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:27.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Boast about his holy name.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:32.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts
of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, we’re encouraged
to “boast about [Jehovah’s] holy name.”

00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:38.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do this?

00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:41.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by preaching, teaching,

00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:45.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping others come to know
Jehovah and his purposes.

00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:48.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the result of this?

00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, honesthearted ones respond favorably,

00:37:52.312 --> 00:37:54.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they begin to seek Jehovah.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how are they affected?

00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:59.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as the second part of that verse read,

00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:03.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that their hearts overflow with ‘rejoicing.’

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:08.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, taking it a little further,
how are we affected

00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re able to help someone
start seeking Jehovah

00:38:12.374 --> 00:38:15.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on that road to everlasting life?

00:38:15.335 --> 00:38:18.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it makes our hearts rejoice,
isn’t that true?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, there are
very few things in life

00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:25.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can bring more joy

00:38:25.178 --> 00:38:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than helping someone start seeking Jehovah

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get on that narrow road to life.

00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:34.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To explain Bible truth to them,

00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:37.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see their face light up

00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:40.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as little light bulbs
start going off in their mind

00:38:40.569 --> 00:38:42.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they’re learning these truths,

00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:47.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them start making changes
in their life to please Jehovah,

00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:51.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see them become an unbaptized publisher
and come up from that baptismal pool

00:38:51.955 --> 00:38:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe later get into the pioneer work

00:38:54.416 --> 00:38:57.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there’s nothing this world can offer

00:38:57.336 --> 00:39:00.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(no accomplishment, no paycheck)

00:39:00.047 --> 00:39:02.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can equal the joy

00:39:02.216 --> 00:39:06.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of helping someone start seeking Jehovah.

00:39:06.387 --> 00:39:10.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appropriately,
throughout this second day

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our program,

00:39:12.184 --> 00:39:14.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have been taught many ways

00:39:14.687 --> 00:39:17.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can improve in our disciple-making skills,

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is vital that we do so

00:39:20.359 --> 00:39:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because eternal lives
hang in the balance.

00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:29.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the value of one eternal life?

00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:33.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one brother said,
“If all of Jehovah’s Witnesses pioneered

00:39:33.331 --> 00:39:36.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the end came and one person

00:39:36.584 --> 00:39:39.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learned the truth, it would be worth it.”

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the value of one life.

00:39:41.714 --> 00:39:45.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, with all the money, the gold,
the silver, and the diamonds combined,

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could not buy one eternal life.

00:39:48.262 --> 00:39:49.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s priceless.

00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:54.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not one but almost 304,000 thousand

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were helped to the point of baptism
during the last service year

00:39:58.606 --> 00:40:01.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of Jehovah blessing

00:40:01.192 --> 00:40:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the disciple-making skills of his people.

00:40:04.654 --> 00:40:07.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we mentioned before,

00:40:07.115 --> 00:40:10.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learning disciple-making skills now

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:14.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares us for the even greater

00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:18.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disciple-making work of the new world.

00:40:18.084 --> 00:40:22.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s talk
about how vast this work will be

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this educational work in the new world.

00:40:26.843 --> 00:40:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it, millions
have been made disciples

00:40:31.848 --> 00:40:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these last years of the last days.

00:40:35.018 --> 00:40:39.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the new world, apparently,

00:40:39.022 --> 00:40:42.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
billions of disciples will need to be made.

00:40:42.734 --> 00:40:45.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much greater is a billion than a million?

00:40:45.904 --> 00:40:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thousand times greater!

00:40:48.615 --> 00:40:50.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re talking about thousands of times

00:40:50.909 --> 00:40:55.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more disciples
needed to be made then than now.

00:40:55.664 --> 00:40:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And likely, we will carry on
this work of disciple-making

00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:04.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world for centuries,
not just decades,

00:41:04.297 --> 00:41:07.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as is the case in the last days.

00:41:07.133 --> 00:41:10.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is really something
to think about, isn’t it?

00:41:10.178 --> 00:41:12.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it makes us think of what Jesus said

00:41:12.806 --> 00:41:16.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his disciples at John 14:12.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:21.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them,
‘You will do works greater than I am doing.’

00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, really, we could say that

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that disciple-making work
of the new world will be greater.

00:41:27.571 --> 00:41:32.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More people will be witnessed to
and will be made disciples

00:41:32.534 --> 00:41:36.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a larger area, a longer period of time.

00:41:36.455 --> 00:41:40.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And undoubtedly,
disciple-making in the new world

00:41:40.584 --> 00:41:45.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be even more joyful
than disciple-making now.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we said before, it’s
an indescribable joy to make a disciple now.

00:41:49.551 --> 00:41:52.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why will it be even more enjoyable?

00:41:52.137 --> 00:41:54.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about the environment.

00:41:54.681 --> 00:41:57.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil will be gone.

00:41:57.392 --> 00:42:01.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll be like a 100-pound block
off of all our shoulders.

00:42:01.355 --> 00:42:04.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spirit of the world will no longer exist

00:42:04.316 --> 00:42:06.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that spirit of the world exhaled by Satan—

00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Satan will be locked in the abyss;

00:42:10.322 --> 00:42:12.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, you could say, it’ll be airtight.

00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:16.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll not be able to exhale
the spirit of the world from there.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One government will rule the entire earth.

00:42:19.665 --> 00:42:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All human governments will be gone.

00:42:22.877 --> 00:42:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think of this, never again
—never, ever—

00:42:26.672 --> 00:42:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will the unrighteous outnumber the righteous.

00:42:30.593 --> 00:42:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will always be the minority.

00:42:33.345 --> 00:42:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this wonderful environment

00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will undoubtedly make disciple-making

00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even more exhilarating in the new world.

00:42:42.688 --> 00:42:44.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s think for a moment

00:42:44.774 --> 00:42:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how voluminous the work itself will be.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29 says that “all those

00:42:54.325 --> 00:42:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the memorial tombs

00:42:57.745 --> 00:43:00.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will hear [Jesus’] voice and come out”

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—<i>all</i> in the tombs.

00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:05.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will be included among these ones

00:43:05.503 --> 00:43:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will come out of “the memorial tombs”?

00:43:08.422 --> 00:43:11.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open up to Acts chapter 24,

00:43:11.634 --> 00:43:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice who will be included

00:43:14.846 --> 00:43:19.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts 24:15:

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I have hope toward God,

00:43:22.645 --> 00:43:26.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which hope these men also look forward to,

00:43:26.941 --> 00:43:31.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there is going to be a resurrection

00:43:31.571 --> 00:43:36.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”

00:43:36.326 --> 00:43:38.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you notice, it’s guaranteed.

00:43:38.536 --> 00:43:42.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is going to happen
—not maybe or a good possibility.

00:43:42.248 --> 00:43:43.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to happen!

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:45.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to include

00:43:45.627 --> 00:43:48.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the righteous and the unrighteous.”

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s a question:

00:43:50.882 --> 00:43:54.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why will the righteous
who are resurrected

00:43:54.427 --> 00:43:57.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need further education?

00:43:57.013 --> 00:44:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even though
they’re already servants of God,

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will need to learn details

00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:06.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning fulfilled prophecies,

00:44:06.564 --> 00:44:09.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the outworking of God’s purposes,

00:44:09.693 --> 00:44:12.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that have happened since they died.

00:44:12.612 --> 00:44:15.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to be
brought up to speed, so to speak.

00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:18.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how much they’ll need to be taught

00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:23.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will depend largely upon
how long ago they died.

00:44:23.707 --> 00:44:28.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will also need help
to continue in their righteous course

00:44:28.712 --> 00:44:32.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to obey the things
written in the scrolls.

00:44:32.841 --> 00:44:37.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 20:12 talks
about these new scrolls.

00:44:37.304 --> 00:44:40.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “I saw the dead,
the great and the small,

00:44:40.974 --> 00:44:45.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“standing before the throne,
and scrolls were opened. . . .

00:44:45.979 --> 00:44:49.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dead were judged
out of those things written

00:44:49.191 --> 00:44:52.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the scrolls according to their deeds.”

00:44:52.653 --> 00:44:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> said this
about those new scrolls.

00:44:55.572 --> 00:44:59.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “These scrolls
will most likely set forth

00:44:59.785 --> 00:45:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s requirements
for mankind at that time.

00:45:04.414 --> 00:45:09.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By studying these, all people,
including resurrected ones,

00:45:09.086 --> 00:45:12.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will be able to know God’s will for them.

00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:15.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These scrolls will surely give us

00:45:15.551 --> 00:45:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
further insight into Jehovah’s mind.”

00:45:19.763 --> 00:45:23.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s exciting, indeed, to ponder, isn’t it?

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Included among the righteous
to be resurrected

00:45:27.771 --> 00:45:30.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be faithful ones

00:45:30.316 --> 00:45:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be brought back
to serve as “princes.”

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:38.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 45:16 says that Jesus

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will appoint “princes in all the earth.”

00:45:42.828 --> 00:45:46.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> pointed out
that one example would be Daniel.

00:45:46.832 --> 00:45:51.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what Jehovah
promised him shortly before he died?

00:45:51.045 --> 00:45:55.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “You will rest,
but you will stand up

00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:59.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.”

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he’s rested
in the grave for some 2,500 years,

00:46:03.474 --> 00:46:06.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will “stand up” in the resurrection.

00:46:06.185 --> 00:46:09.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’ll take his position
as one of these princes,

00:46:09.855 --> 00:46:12.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as pointed out in <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:46:12.108 --> 00:46:15.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, Daniel and others like him

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be brought up to speed

00:46:18.072 --> 00:46:21.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—updated, trained for their assignments.

00:46:21.325 --> 00:46:24.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, many of the princes will be selected

00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:29.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the faithful elders
who are taking the lead today,

00:46:29.584 --> 00:46:31.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as pointed out by <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:46:31.878 --> 00:46:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, Jesus, the Messianic King,
will make the appointments.

00:46:36.132 --> 00:46:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we know?

00:46:38.134 --> 00:46:40.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be good appointments.

00:46:40.178 --> 00:46:44.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be princes
who will truly love the people

00:46:44.015 --> 00:46:48.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faithfully carry out all the directions

00:46:48.144 --> 00:46:50.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the heavenly government.

00:46:50.313 --> 00:46:54.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also included among “the righteous”
to be resurrected

00:46:54.734 --> 00:46:57.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be many of our loved ones

00:46:57.237 --> 00:47:00.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may have thought they would live
to see the end of this system,

00:47:00.949 --> 00:47:03.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they died in the last days.

00:47:03.618 --> 00:47:07.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what a joy it will be
for you brothers and sisters

00:47:07.664 --> 00:47:11.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to welcome these ones back and teach them

00:47:11.584 --> 00:47:15.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all the things
that have happened since they died!

00:47:15.714 --> 00:47:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to be brought up-to-date

00:47:18.007 --> 00:47:21.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they can help
in this great disciple-making work.

00:47:21.594 --> 00:47:24.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example: I think of my mother.

00:47:24.306 --> 00:47:28.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1938.

00:47:28.518 --> 00:47:32.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She died in 2012,
a little over eight years ago.

00:47:32.772 --> 00:47:36.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really wanted to see
the end of this system.

00:47:36.192 --> 00:47:40.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she was
of that “Judge Rutherford generation.”

00:47:40.071 --> 00:47:43.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really wanted to see
that “prostitute” destroyed,

00:47:43.074 --> 00:47:46.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but cancer prevented that from happening.

00:47:46.328 --> 00:47:48.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
shortly before she died, I said:

00:47:48.622 --> 00:47:52.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, I know you wanted
to go into the new world

00:47:52.667 --> 00:47:57.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the overland passageway
(never die at all).

00:47:57.631 --> 00:48:00.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you’re going to have
to take the underground tunnel.

00:48:00.842 --> 00:48:02.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the main thing is to get there.

00:48:02.844 --> 00:48:05.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you’re going to
very shortly close your eyes,

00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:06.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the next thing you’re going to see,

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:10.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to open your eyes
in that new world.”

00:48:10.227 --> 00:48:12.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when she comes back,

00:48:12.479 --> 00:48:16.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just think of the things that have happened
in the eight years that she’s been gone.

00:48:16.984 --> 00:48:19.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll have to be
brought up to speed, won’t she?

00:48:19.653 --> 00:48:24.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is JW Broadcasting®

00:48:24.158 --> 00:48:28.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:48:28.912 --> 00:48:31.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She doesn’t even know about the broadcast!

00:48:31.582 --> 00:48:35.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’ll have to be brought up to speed,
but she’ll be so happy

00:48:35.085 --> 00:48:39.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn about this and other developments.

00:48:39.173 --> 00:48:41.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s a question:

00:48:41.258 --> 00:48:45.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where will the billions
of new disciples come from?

00:48:45.679 --> 00:48:49.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the resurrected righteous ones

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be educated,

00:48:51.894 --> 00:48:54.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re already disciples, aren’t they?

00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:57.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where will the new disciples come from?

00:48:57.316 --> 00:49:00.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, ones born after Armageddon

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to be made disciples.

00:49:03.322 --> 00:49:06.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there will be a vast multitude

00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:11.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of unrighteous ones
who will return from the Grave.

00:49:11.038 --> 00:49:14.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they’ll come
from all different backgrounds.

00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:19.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll come back,
and they’ll need to be taught.

00:49:19.005 --> 00:49:23.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need help to accept Christ’s ransom,

00:49:23.134 --> 00:49:26.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the things
that are written in the new scrolls,

00:49:26.887 --> 00:49:28.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because most of them will know nothing.

00:49:28.889 --> 00:49:31.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe some studied a while,

00:49:31.517 --> 00:49:34.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but death prevented them from continuing.

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most will know nothing
—completely unaware about the good news.

00:49:39.317 --> 00:49:44.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we said, they’ll come
from all time periods, locations, cultures.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may have been rulers, maybe slaves,

00:49:47.533 --> 00:49:51.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe criminals,
maybe self-righteous persons,

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:53.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe ones who died in combat,

00:49:53.915 --> 00:49:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died in childbirth,

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:59.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died of disease
(perhaps the coronavirus),

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:03.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
died by starvation, natural disaster.

00:50:03.883 --> 00:50:08.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seems that the last thought
on their mind when they died

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be the first thought
when they come back.

00:50:11.432 --> 00:50:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking about the men who threw

00:50:13.935 --> 00:50:16.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace,

00:50:16.229 --> 00:50:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they died because of the heat.

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:23.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll come back
with a vivid memory of that situation,

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they’ll have to be taught
what happened after they died

00:50:28.742 --> 00:50:33.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how those three Hebrews
came out unharmed.

00:50:33.371 --> 00:50:38.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine all these backgrounds
of ones coming back.

00:50:38.376 --> 00:50:41.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine situations that could develop.

00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:43.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is just an example.

00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:45.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a former ruler

00:50:45.717 --> 00:50:49.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had hundreds,
maybe thousands, of slaves

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who catered to his every desire.

00:50:51.806 --> 00:50:53.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he comes back in the resurrection,

00:50:53.934 --> 00:50:58.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his overseer is one of his former slaves.

00:50:58.146 --> 00:51:03.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he tells him, gives him direction
(loving direction, but direction)

00:51:03.068 --> 00:51:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to plant a tree in a certain location.

00:51:06.488 --> 00:51:08.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, will he humble himself?

00:51:08.657 --> 00:51:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting, interesting possibilities.

00:51:11.702 --> 00:51:14.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the atheists
who will be resurrected.

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:18.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here they ate Jehovah’s food,
they drank his water,

00:51:18.625 --> 00:51:21.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they breathed his air,
they walked on his ground,

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they never gave him any credit,

00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:26.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they never acknowledged him at all.

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:30.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us think of the illustration
of the pig under the apple tree.

00:51:30.429 --> 00:51:33.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gobbles up the apples off the ground,

00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:36.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he never looks up to see
where they came from.

00:51:36.727 --> 00:51:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we may not use that illustration

00:51:38.979 --> 00:51:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these atheists that come back,

00:51:42.024 --> 00:51:47.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they will have to be helped to see
what a selfish life they lived.

00:51:47.029 --> 00:51:50.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re
going to have to praise Jehovah,

00:51:50.074 --> 00:51:54.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
acknowledge him, give him honor,
glory, and worship.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they do so?

00:51:56.622 --> 00:51:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it will be up to them.

00:51:58.499 --> 00:52:02.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones.

00:52:02.378 --> 00:52:06.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s just ponder

00:52:06.257 --> 00:52:09.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of these ones that will come back
by means of some artwork.

00:52:09.802 --> 00:52:12.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, look at the following artwork, please.

00:52:12.638 --> 00:52:15.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s going to show you people

00:52:15.558 --> 00:52:18.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different time periods,
different backgrounds,

00:52:18.352 --> 00:52:22.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being taught after they’re resurrected.

00:52:22.815 --> 00:52:25.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the artwork displays,

00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:28.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to imagine yourself teaching ones

00:52:28.237 --> 00:52:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these various backgrounds.

00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:12.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers and sisters, that artwork

00:54:12.467 --> 00:54:15.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just a little, tiny sampling

00:54:15.846 --> 00:54:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ones from various
time periods and backgrounds

00:54:19.141 --> 00:54:22.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will return to the land of the living.

00:54:22.602 --> 00:54:24.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we mentioned,

00:54:24.646 --> 00:54:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will empower Jesus

00:54:27.524 --> 00:54:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resurrect all of these ones

00:54:30.986 --> 00:54:34.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(bringing them back from the memorial tombs)

00:54:34.448 --> 00:54:38.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will ‘hear his voice,
and they will come out.’

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know it’ll be
in a controlled, orderly way.

00:54:41.496 --> 00:54:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, Jehovah “is a God
not of disorder but of peace.”

00:54:46.168 --> 00:54:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 14:33.

00:54:49.004 --> 00:54:54.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also wants things
to “take place decently and by arrangement.”

00:54:54.009 --> 00:54:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 14:40.

00:54:56.762 --> 00:54:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if they all came back at once,

00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
a chaotic population explosion, wouldn’t it?

00:55:03.519 --> 00:55:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t even be taught properly.

00:55:06.313 --> 00:55:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They couldn’t be cared for.

00:55:08.357 --> 00:55:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it will be progressive
during the thousand years.

00:55:12.653 --> 00:55:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower</i> said this:

00:55:14.697 --> 00:55:19.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faithful Christians who died
shortly before the end of Satan’s system

00:55:19.368 --> 00:55:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will likely be among the first ones raised.

00:55:23.497 --> 00:55:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We can also expect an early resurrection

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the faithful men of old
who will serve as ‘princes.’”

00:55:32.715 --> 00:55:35.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We touched on that previously.

00:55:35.759 --> 00:55:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, resurrected ones
will have much to learn,

00:55:40.556 --> 00:55:43.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you dear brothers and sisters

00:55:43.642 --> 00:55:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have the privilege to help them.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll need to learn
about Jehovah, his qualities,

00:55:49.357 --> 00:55:52.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the wonderful things he’s done.

00:55:52.068 --> 00:55:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many will need
to reject false religious ideas

00:55:56.405 --> 00:55:59.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they believed in Satan’s world.

00:55:59.408 --> 00:56:01.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s just an example:

00:56:01.452 --> 00:56:04.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine one who really believed

00:56:04.372 --> 00:56:07.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all good people go to heaven.

00:56:07.375 --> 00:56:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now he’s resurrected,
and he’s brought back here to the earth.

00:56:11.587 --> 00:56:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, he’ll know
that teaching was wrong.

00:56:14.465 --> 00:56:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about other false teachings
that he believed?

00:56:17.885 --> 00:56:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he change his mind and heart?

00:56:20.263 --> 00:56:22.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he accept these truths?

00:56:22.724 --> 00:56:24.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be up to him.

00:56:24.726 --> 00:56:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones.

00:56:28.104 --> 00:56:30.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’ll be many others
who will come back

00:56:30.982 --> 00:56:34.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will have to abandon
their former way of life.

00:56:34.527 --> 00:56:38.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking, as an example, a homosexual.

00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this former homosexual
comes back in the resurrection,

00:56:41.784 --> 00:56:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he really thought

00:56:43.786 --> 00:56:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and he was taught, and he came to believe—

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God accepted him with that lifestyle.

00:56:50.793 --> 00:56:54.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now he’s going to learn
about Jehovah’s moral standards.

00:56:54.714 --> 00:56:56.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to learn

00:56:56.716 --> 00:57:00.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will not lower his standard
to accommodate us.

00:57:00.345 --> 00:57:03.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to come up to Jehovah’s standard.

00:57:03.348 --> 00:57:06.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will he change?
Will he adjust?

00:57:06.226 --> 00:57:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be up to him.

00:57:08.228 --> 00:57:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you brothers and sisters
will help such ones

00:57:11.481 --> 00:57:14.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy life eternal.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All must learn to walk
in Jehovah’s righteous ways

00:57:19.155 --> 00:57:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and willingly choose to do so.

00:57:22.492 --> 00:57:26.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what if someone
refuses to make the necessary changes?

00:57:26.872 --> 00:57:29.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i> commented on that.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “After being given ample time,

00:57:32.169 --> 00:57:36.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“maybe even ‘a hundred years,’ to seek God,

00:57:36.882 --> 00:57:41.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some will show that they refuse
to practice righteousness.

00:57:41.386 --> 00:57:45.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Justly they will lose life
in that new world,

00:57:45.807 --> 00:57:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we can see from Isaiah 65:20,” which says:

00:57:50.812 --> 00:57:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the sinner will be cursed,

00:57:54.274 --> 00:57:58.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he is a hundred years of age.”

00:57:58.612 --> 00:58:01.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we expect this will be the minority,

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:05.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the majority will be delighted
to make the adjustments

00:58:05.285 --> 00:58:09.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can live
in that wonderful new world.

00:58:09.289 --> 00:58:11.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think about what one brother told me

00:58:11.959 --> 00:58:14.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning his Bible student.

00:58:14.336 --> 00:58:17.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Bible student kept saying:
“Well, how do I know

00:58:17.923 --> 00:58:20.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m going to like life in the new world?

00:58:20.926 --> 00:58:23.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do I know I’m not going to be bored?”

00:58:23.137 --> 00:58:25.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, finally, the brother told him, he said,

00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, one thing about it:

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t like being there,
you don’t have to stay.”

00:58:32.521 --> 00:58:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was kind of humorous,
but it’s a lot of truth.

00:58:35.858 --> 00:58:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person has to willingly want to be there
and make the necessary changes.

00:58:40.863 --> 00:58:44.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we believe the vast majority

00:58:44.325 --> 00:58:47.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be delighted to do so.

00:58:47.244 --> 00:58:49.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a privilege it will be

00:58:49.747 --> 00:58:53.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach ones
in that new world at a time

00:58:53.083 --> 00:58:57.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Isaiah 11:9
will be true, which says:

00:58:57.254 --> 00:59:01.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The earth will certainly be filled
with the knowledge of Jehovah

00:59:01.342 --> 00:59:05.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the waters [are] cover[ing] the sea.”

00:59:05.262 --> 00:59:06.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, think about it.

00:59:06.931 --> 00:59:11.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This earth—71 percent
of its surface is covered with water.

00:59:11.936 --> 00:59:15.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you smooth all the land out,

00:59:15.106 --> 00:59:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sea water would cover planet Earth

00:59:18.234 --> 00:59:21.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one and two thirds miles deep.

00:59:21.404 --> 00:59:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a watery planet, isn’t it?

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:28.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that illustration there in Isaiah
just shows how prolific

00:59:28.703 --> 00:59:31.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how widespread, how filled—
the earth will be

00:59:31.706 --> 00:59:34.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the knowledge of Jehovah” at that time.

00:59:34.792 --> 00:59:39.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that wonderful knowledge
will enable faithful humans

00:59:39.505 --> 00:59:44.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grow to perfection
and to sufficiently be equipped

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:49.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to face and pass the final test

00:59:49.474 --> 00:59:52.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the thousand years.

00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:55.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good things
that you dear brothers and sisters

00:59:55.188 --> 00:59:58.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have learned today
in the second day of our program

00:59:58.191 --> 01:00:01.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what you’ve learned today
about helping your Bible students now—

01:00:01.945 --> 01:00:04.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you in the new world.

01:00:04.489 --> 01:00:07.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you learned, you learned how to teach

01:00:07.325 --> 01:00:10.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your Bible students
to feed themselves spiritually,

01:00:10.662 --> 01:00:15.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the meetings,
to avoid bad associations,

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:18.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome unclean habits,

01:00:18.586 --> 01:00:22.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop a personal relationship
with Jehovah.

01:00:22.632 --> 01:00:27.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those very same things
you will need to teach these new ones

01:00:27.262 --> 01:00:30.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come back in the resurrection.

01:00:30.432 --> 01:00:35.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, at this time, let’s review
some of the good things

01:00:35.103 --> 01:00:38.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have learned today
about disciple-making.

01:00:38.398 --> 01:00:43.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s meditate on how these skills
will help in the new world.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, look at this video, please

01:00:46.114 --> 01:00:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a brief video that gives us some highlights

01:00:49.993 --> 01:00:52.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our first symposium,

01:00:52.621 --> 01:00:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was entitled “Improve Your Skills.”

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:04.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there’s no death or pain in heaven,
where would this promise apply?

01:01:05.509 --> 01:01:07.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The earth.

01:01:07.135 --> 01:01:09.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to learn
how to be part of that future?

01:01:10.764 --> 01:01:14.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If these are God’s promises,
wouldn’t it make sense to go to his Word

01:01:14.017 --> 01:01:15.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out how to enjoy them?

01:01:15.686 --> 01:01:17.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can think of it this way.

01:01:17.062 --> 01:01:21.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When parents with a severe genetic defect
have children, what happens?

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I get it!

01:01:23.443 --> 01:01:24.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No study is perfect.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s making some effort; focus on that.

01:01:28.073 --> 01:01:32.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone’s enthusiasm
is contagious, it’s yours.

01:01:33.746 --> 01:01:36.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can help, if you want.

01:01:36.248 --> 01:01:39.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The real question is, Do you trust him?

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to; I really do.

01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:50.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw in that video,

01:01:50.721 --> 01:01:54.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to improve our skills.

01:01:54.224 --> 01:01:57.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the symposium, we saw six areas

01:01:57.978 --> 01:02:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can improve our skills.

01:02:00.147 --> 01:02:02.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each one of the six videos

01:02:02.149 --> 01:02:05.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that symposium
discussed one of those skills.

01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:10.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In review, Neeta, in the first video
(the Bible study conductor),

01:02:10.116 --> 01:02:15.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used questions to help the interested person

01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:18.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see the practical value of the Bible.

01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:21.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second video, the next time they met,

01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:26.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta unleashed the power of God’s Word

01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:29.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing her student scriptures

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:32.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highlight our spiritual need.

01:02:32.513 --> 01:02:34.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third video,

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta illustrated Adamic sin

01:02:38.477 --> 01:02:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by likening it to inherited illness.

01:02:42.732 --> 01:02:44.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fourth video,

01:02:44.734 --> 01:02:46.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when her Bible student
seemed to be losing interest,

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:49.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta learned the importance

01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:52.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of enthusiasm to motivate.

01:02:52.992 --> 01:02:57.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the fifth video,
Neeta showed empathy

01:02:57.372 --> 01:03:00.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her student’s stressful circumstances

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:03.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and provided practical help.

01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:06.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, in the last (the sixth) video,

01:03:06.297 --> 01:03:10.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta’s conviction and Scriptural reasoning

01:03:10.301 --> 01:03:14.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped to reach her student’s heart

01:03:14.347 --> 01:03:17.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she reconsidered her situation

01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:20.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her views on morals.

01:03:20.979 --> 01:03:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you just imagine how you’ll use
those six skills in the new world?

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:27.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

01:03:27.402 --> 01:03:29.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll use questions, won’t you?

01:03:29.404 --> 01:03:31.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll use questions to help resurrected ones

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see the practical value
of the Bible and the new scrolls.

01:03:35.994 --> 01:03:39.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, by the way,
the Bible will be used in the new world.

01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:43.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will unleash the power of God’s Word

01:03:43.543 --> 01:03:48.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power of the scrolls
by showing these new ones scriptures.

01:03:48.006 --> 01:03:52.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will use good illustrations
to help them reason.

01:03:52.302 --> 01:03:56.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will use enthusiasm to motivate.

01:03:56.348 --> 01:03:58.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will show empathy,

01:03:58.558 --> 01:04:02.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for ones who have scars

01:04:02.395 --> 01:04:06.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of a horrible life
in Satan’s old world.

01:04:06.817 --> 01:04:09.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will also use conviction

01:04:09.903 --> 01:04:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Scriptural reasoning
to reach their heart.

01:04:14.908 --> 01:04:18.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s move to our second symposium,

01:04:18.495 --> 01:04:22.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was entitled “Accept Jehovah’s Help.”

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:25.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed three aids
that Jehovah gives us.

01:04:25.252 --> 01:04:30.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at this brief video
that will remind us of that second symposium.

01:04:32.175 --> 01:04:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her real issue was getting to know
someone that she can’t see.

01:04:36.471 --> 01:04:38.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s the best place to begin.

01:04:38.473 --> 01:04:42.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did some research, 
and I think you’ll really like what I found.

01:04:42.394 --> 01:04:44.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, come, sit down.

01:04:46.106 --> 01:04:48.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting.

01:04:48.984 --> 01:04:51.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

01:04:52.529 --> 01:04:53.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

01:04:53.739 --> 01:04:54.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So sweet.”

01:04:54.907 --> 01:04:55.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

01:04:55.908 --> 01:04:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

01:04:57.493 --> 01:05:00.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, I know you’re busy.

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have no clue, do you?

01:05:01.747 --> 01:05:03.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to go.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:06.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I asked him to help Jade

01:05:06.919 --> 01:05:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then left it with him.

01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:16.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as reminded in that video,

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides research tools,

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:22.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provides the brotherhood,

01:05:22.226 --> 01:05:26.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he provides help by means of prayer.

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:29.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll use those things
in the new world, obviously.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:33.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like Neeta, she used research tools

01:05:33.112 --> 01:05:37.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare to discuss evolution
with her student.

01:05:37.616 --> 01:05:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she realized
she had a limited understanding

01:05:40.161 --> 01:05:42.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the student’s background,

01:05:42.288 --> 01:05:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she sought help from the brotherhood.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She brought along a publisher

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:50.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a similar background to her student.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:54.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that third video,
when her student resisted

01:05:54.342 --> 01:05:58.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta’s encouragement
to prepare for her Bible study,

01:05:58.095 --> 01:06:01.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta prayed to Jehovah

01:06:01.265 --> 01:06:04.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her and to motivate the student.

01:06:04.602 --> 01:06:07.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know Jehovah hears prayers.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But imagine:
You’ll use research tools,

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll use the brotherhood,

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:16.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll use prayer
to make disciples in the new world.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to that third symposium:

01:06:19.534 --> 01:06:22.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Bible Students to . . .”

01:06:22.954 --> 01:06:26.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we talked about five things
we want to help them to do.

01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at this video,

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will remind us of that third symposium.

01:06:34.048 --> 01:06:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which do you remember more from our studies,

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:40.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answers or the things
that touch your heart?

01:06:40.221 --> 01:06:41.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm.

01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:45.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s asking how Jehovah feels about something

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:47.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then asking what that means for me.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My meeting part tonight covers that point.

01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:51.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you come?

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m having some people over this weekend.

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:59.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t the club, but it was still fun.

01:06:59.491 --> 01:07:02.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beating it felt impossible.

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:06.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be made new
in your dominant mental attitude.”

01:07:06.039 --> 01:07:09.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remembered one of the Psalms:
“I will walk in your truth.

01:07:09.084 --> 01:07:12.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart to fear your name.”

01:07:16.424 --> 01:07:20.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as reminded, there are five things

01:07:20.011 --> 01:07:22.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to help our students to accomplish.

01:07:22.722 --> 01:07:27.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that first video in the symposium,
Neeta helped her student learn

01:07:27.602 --> 01:07:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed herself spiritually by demonstrating

01:07:32.399 --> 01:07:35.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how she herself prepared for their study.

01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:37.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second video,

01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta returned to the subject
of meeting attendance

01:07:40.449 --> 01:07:43.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by pointing out that the next meeting

01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:47.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would consider a question
she had raised previously.

01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third video,

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta helped her student
to seek good association

01:07:54.379 --> 01:07:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by arranging for her
to attend a Christian gathering.

01:07:58.467 --> 01:08:00.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in the fourth video,

01:08:00.886 --> 01:08:04.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it became clear that the student
was not ready to be a publisher

01:08:04.765 --> 01:08:07.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of an unclean practice,

01:08:07.393 --> 01:08:12.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta gently helped her
to appreciate what it means

01:08:12.398 --> 01:08:17.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become and remain clean in Jehovah’s eyes.

01:08:17.403 --> 01:08:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the last video, that fifth one

01:08:20.656 --> 01:08:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—most important—

01:08:22.658 --> 01:08:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neeta helped her student

01:08:24.785 --> 01:08:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop strong love for Jehovah

01:08:27.997 --> 01:08:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be so strong

01:08:29.999 --> 01:08:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would be able
to resist pressure from the world.

01:08:34.003 --> 01:08:38.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can imagine
that you’ll use the very same skills.

01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll try to help your students there

01:08:41.385 --> 01:08:44.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish the same
five things we discussed.

01:08:44.597 --> 01:08:47.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to learn
to feed themselves spiritually.

01:08:47.558 --> 01:08:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to attend meetings.

01:08:50.352 --> 01:08:53.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll help them to see the need
to seek out good association,

01:08:53.898 --> 01:08:57.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to avoid unclean practices

01:08:57.068 --> 01:08:59.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,

01:08:59.654 --> 01:09:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop deep love for Jehovah.

01:09:03.532 --> 01:09:05.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s obvious

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:10.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our skills, our experience,

01:09:10.122 --> 01:09:14.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our qualities learned now
in the disciple-making work

01:09:14.418 --> 01:09:18.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be very valuable in the new world.

01:09:18.089 --> 01:09:21.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be able to put these skills
to good use then.

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:26.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s all strive to improve as teachers.

01:09:26.806 --> 01:09:29.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Titus 1:9 says,

01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should
“[hold] firmly to the faithful word

01:09:33.896 --> 01:09:37.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as respects [our] art of teaching.”

01:09:37.442 --> 01:09:40.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to be artists
—the “art of teaching.”

01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have heard
the difference between a laborer,

01:09:43.573 --> 01:09:46.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a craftsman, and an artist.

01:09:46.034 --> 01:09:50.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A laborer uses his back;
a craftsman has to add his mind;

01:09:50.872 --> 01:09:54.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but an artist adds his heart.

01:09:54.042 --> 01:09:57.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to be
just laborers or craftsmen, but artists

01:09:57.712 --> 01:10:01.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really putting our heart
into the disciple-making work.

01:10:01.466 --> 01:10:03.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it does take effort.

01:10:03.468 --> 01:10:07.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at one last scripture
here in 1 Timothy chapter 4

01:10:07.305 --> 01:10:10.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the effort involved—
and it’s worth the effort.

01:10:10.892 --> 01:10:14.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 4:15:

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:19.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ponder over these things;
be absorbed in them,

01:10:19.025 --> 01:10:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your advancement

01:10:21.444 --> 01:10:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“may be plainly seen by all people.

01:10:24.447 --> 01:10:28.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay constant attention
to yourself and to your teaching.

01:10:28.493 --> 01:10:33.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Persevere in these things, for by doing this

01:10:33.373 --> 01:10:37.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will save both yourself
and those who listen to you.”

01:10:37.961 --> 01:10:42.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true now;
it will be true in the new world.

01:10:42.507 --> 01:10:45.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is providing what we need

01:10:45.343 --> 01:10:50.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he’s giving us excellent training;
he provides excellent tools.

01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to make good use
of both of these provisions.

01:10:54.227 --> 01:10:56.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do want to give this caution:

01:10:56.647 --> 01:10:58.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be overwhelmed, please.

01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:00.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve discussed a lot of skills,

01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:03.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of suggestions,
but don’t be overwhelmed.

01:11:03.612 --> 01:11:05.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to help you.

01:11:05.697 --> 01:11:08.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will bless your efforts to do your best.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we encourage you to just pick out

01:11:10.494 --> 01:11:14.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one or two skills at first and work on those.

01:11:14.081 --> 01:11:17.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you can move on to other things.

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:20.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In conclusion, think about this:

01:11:20.462 --> 01:11:24.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many secular skills practiced today

01:11:24.591 --> 01:11:28.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will not even exist in the new world.

01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:33.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doctors (no doctors), nurses, optometrists,

01:11:33.225 --> 01:11:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undertakers, locksmiths, lawyers

01:11:37.313 --> 01:11:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such professions will not even exist.

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your skills as a disciple-maker

01:11:45.321 --> 01:11:47.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be in high demand.

01:11:47.698 --> 01:11:51.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be able
to use these skills to the full,

01:11:51.952 --> 01:11:56.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will definitely rejoice greatly

01:11:56.916 --> 01:12:00.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you share in this voluminous,

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this enormous,

01:12:03.047 --> 01:12:06.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
new world educational campaign

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon to come.

01:12:10.012 --> 01:12:12.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lett,

01:12:12.014 --> 01:12:15.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that exciting preview
of the work that lies ahead of us!

01:12:17.353 --> 01:12:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This program has highlighted

01:12:19.355 --> 01:12:23.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy we can find in making disciples.

01:12:23.109 --> 01:12:27.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we look forward to
in the next two sessions?

01:12:27.113 --> 01:12:29.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture theme for those sessions

01:12:29.448 --> 01:12:33.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is taken from Psalm 37:4, which says:

01:12:33.077 --> 01:12:35.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

01:12:35.788 --> 01:12:39.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:44.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next session begins with a symposium

01:12:44.088 --> 01:12:47.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will show how we can imitate
the apostle Paul and others

01:12:47.925 --> 01:12:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by rejoicing in all circumstances.

01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the final session,

01:12:54.057 --> 01:12:57.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will enjoy the conclusion
of the Nehemiah drama,

01:12:57.769 --> 01:13:01.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
followed by an uplifting closing talk.

01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:06.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let all in attendance stand,
if you are able to do so,

01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:10.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sing together song number 140.

01:13:10.198 --> 01:13:14.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This song invites us
to imagine our future joy.

01:13:14.536 --> 01:13:19.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is entitled “Life Without End—At Last!”

01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:24.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song, you may have
your local concluding prayer.

01:13:24.546 --> 01:13:29.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 140.

Good day, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next session will begin
with a music-video presentation.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:12.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This afternoon’s music-video presentation
shows the joy of our brothers

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the earth
as they share in giving a witness.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also reminds us that we
can always rely on Jehovah for support.

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch and listen.

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening song for this session highlights

00:10:31.908 --> 00:10:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the importance of including Jehovah
in one’s marriage.

00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:39.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to stand
and sing song number 131,

00:10:39.123 --> 00:10:42.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “‘What God Has Yoked Together.’”

00:12:26.273 --> 00:12:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be seated.

00:12:29.276 --> 00:12:32.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriage and family life are not always easy.

00:12:32.696 --> 00:12:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The amount of joy you find
in your family depends, in part, on you.

00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:41.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following four-part symposium
will help husbands, wives, 

00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:46.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
parents, and children to find joy together
despite imperfections.

00:12:46.126 --> 00:12:49.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:52.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Seth Hyatt,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:12:52.216 --> 00:12:54.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the first talk, entitled

00:12:54.927 --> 00:12:59.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate Joy in Your Family
—Husbands, Rejoice in Your Wife.”

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
how Adam must have felt

00:13:11.193 --> 00:13:14.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he
was introduced to Eve?

00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we don’t have
to imagine how he felt.

00:13:18.826 --> 00:13:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that he
was overwhelmed with appreciation.

00:13:23.664 --> 00:13:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he expressed his appreciation

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in poetic terms
that are recorded in the Bible.

00:13:30.087 --> 00:13:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember the words:
“This is at last

00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:40.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bone of my bone
and flesh of my flesh.”

00:13:40.097 --> 00:13:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:13:42.141 --> 00:13:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam and Eve
had a perfect marriage,

00:13:45.853 --> 00:13:50.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and together
they formed a perfect family.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, with their disobedience,
all of that changed.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of perfection,

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were confronted
with one another’s imperfections.

00:14:02.578 --> 00:14:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the instant that they
separated themselves from Jehovah,

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:11.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to experience
stress and anxiety

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:15.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that affected their relationship.

00:14:15.675 --> 00:14:19.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a testimony to Jehovah’s love

00:14:19.304 --> 00:14:23.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wisdom
that despite imperfections

00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:26.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and despite
the stress and anxiety

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have only intensified
in these last days,

00:14:30.773 --> 00:14:35.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the family can still
be a source of joy

00:14:35.487 --> 00:14:40.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a place of security
and stability.

00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:42.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for that to happen,

00:14:42.702 --> 00:14:46.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each member of the family
must shoulder his load

00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:49.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Scriptural responsibility.

00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:52.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium,

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:56.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to consider husbands,

00:14:56.216 --> 00:15:00.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wives, parents, and children,

00:15:00.553 --> 00:15:03.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how each of us can contribute

00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:06.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the joy of the family.

00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:08.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To start,

00:15:08.603 --> 00:15:12.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s address husbands.

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:15.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a husband,

00:15:15.235 --> 00:15:19.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you view your wife?

00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:23.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view her as Jehovah does?

00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:28.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view her and feel about her

00:15:28.081 --> 00:15:30.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Adam felt about Eve

00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:33.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he first met her?

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:38.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible helps
us husbands appreciate

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:42.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our wives
are a gift from Jehovah.

00:15:42.346 --> 00:15:46.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you appreciate the gift?

00:15:46.308 --> 00:15:51.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And are you demonstrating
your appreciation?

00:15:51.146 --> 00:15:56.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a few minutes this morning,
we’re going to consider four ways

00:15:56.068 --> 00:15:59.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we husbands
can demonstrate

00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:02.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciation for the gift
Jehovah has given us.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re taking notes,
here they are:

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) It’s important that we assign

00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:13.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wives honor;

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:18.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) we must invest time

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our relationship;

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) it’s important that we confine

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our romantic interests to our wife;

00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:31.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (4)

00:16:31.103 --> 00:16:36.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to be realistic
in our expectations.

00:16:36.066 --> 00:16:40.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider these points
one at a time.

00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:44.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, in your Bible
to 1 Peter chapter 3,

00:16:47.703 --> 00:16:50.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 7:

00:16:52.917 --> 00:16:56.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You husbands, in the same way,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continue dwelling with them
according to knowledge.

00:17:00.216 --> 00:17:04.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Assign them honor
as to a weaker vessel,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the feminine one,
since they are also heirs

00:17:08.474 --> 00:17:12.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with you
of the undeserved favor of life,

00:17:12.103 --> 00:17:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order for your prayers
not to be hindered.”

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Peter leaves us in no doubt

00:17:21.362 --> 00:17:26.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to who is being addressed,
“you husbands.”

00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:29.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s you and me.

00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:32.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He tells us that we
must continue dwelling

00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:36.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our wives
“according to knowledge.”

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:41.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote in our Bible says:
“showing them consideration;

00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understanding them.”

00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:48.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How well do you know your wife?

00:17:48.389 --> 00:17:53.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you know
about her background, her upbringing?

00:17:53.144 --> 00:17:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know
what makes her happy.

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:58.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why?

00:17:58.191 --> 00:18:00.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know what’s upsetting to her,

00:18:00.944 --> 00:18:03.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what causes anxiety.

00:18:03.738 --> 00:18:06.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you understand why?

00:18:06.658 --> 00:18:09.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important
that we take the time

00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:14.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to know our wives
because only then

00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:18.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we care for their physical,

00:18:18.295 --> 00:18:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotional, and spiritual needs.

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:27.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only then can we do
what Peter next says in the verse,

00:18:27.012 --> 00:18:29.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s our main point:

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Assign them honor.”

00:18:32.642 --> 00:18:35.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assign your wife honor.

00:18:35.687 --> 00:18:39.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Peter says
“as to a weaker vessel.”

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does Peter mean

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he refers
to the wife as a weaker vessel?

00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think he’s betraying
some chauvinistic leaning?

00:18:52.829 --> 00:18:54.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:18:54.873 --> 00:18:59.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s already said
‘assign her honor.’

00:18:59.127 --> 00:19:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it this way:

00:19:01.964 --> 00:19:05.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you have two bowls

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:08.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly the same size,

00:19:08.387 --> 00:19:11.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly the same capacity,

00:19:11.765 --> 00:19:14.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but one is made of wood

00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:17.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other is made of a very fine,

00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:20.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very expensive porcelain

00:19:20.649 --> 00:19:23.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both bowls,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both with the same capacity.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would you handle both
in the same way?

00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:32.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:19:32.453 --> 00:19:36.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recognize that the porcelain
is more valuable

00:19:36.957 --> 00:19:38.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more fragile,

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:43.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you handle it
in a different way.

00:19:43.422 --> 00:19:47.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Peter
is telling us about our wives.

00:19:47.426 --> 00:19:52.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is the “weaker vessel,
the feminine one.”

00:19:52.014 --> 00:19:54.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way is she weaker?

00:19:54.725 --> 00:19:57.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly not intellectually,

00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and certainly not spiritually.

00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:03.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Primarily in a physical sense,

00:20:03.484 --> 00:20:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we husbands have an advantage.

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:11.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we accord our wife honor.

00:20:11.409 --> 00:20:15.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we would never
get physical with her,

00:20:15.746 --> 00:20:19.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and certainly we would never

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a pretext pretend
to honor her in public

00:20:24.505 --> 00:20:29.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then abuse her
in some way in private.

00:20:29.343 --> 00:20:31.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that would never work,
would it?

00:20:31.971 --> 00:20:33.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:38.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We assign her honor at all times.

00:20:38.561 --> 00:20:41.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s why.

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter says:
“They are also heirs with you

00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:47.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the undeserved favor of life.”

00:20:47.653 --> 00:20:51.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands and wives
are on equal footing

00:20:51.157 --> 00:20:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah
in a spiritual sense.

00:20:54.243 --> 00:20:57.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both husbands and wives
must “[wash] their robes

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [make] them white
in the blood of the Lamb.”

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:04.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not die
more for husbands

00:21:04.212 --> 00:21:07.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than he did for wives.

00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And both husbands and wives

00:21:10.218 --> 00:21:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the hope of everlasting life.

00:21:13.763 --> 00:21:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we remember that.

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t,
how does Peter conclude?

00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:23.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In order for your prayers

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be hindered.”

00:21:25.692 --> 00:21:27.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:21:28.737 --> 00:21:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dealings with our wife
will have a direct impact

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:37.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our personal relationship
with Jehovah.

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:40.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So assign her honor.

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Value what she does for you

00:21:43.668 --> 00:21:48.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for your family,
and demonstrate your appreciation.

00:21:48.548 --> 00:21:50.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second point:

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Invest time in your relationship.

00:21:55.764 --> 00:21:59.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so easy—isn’t it?—
for secular work,

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:02.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic assignments,
and association with others

00:22:02.896 --> 00:22:05.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rob us of valuable time

00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:09.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should be spent
with our wives.

00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, when we
were getting to know one another, courting,

00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:20.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were anxious
for one-on-one time.

00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:23.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That shouldn’t change
when we get married.

00:22:23.917 --> 00:22:26.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So buy out the time,

00:22:26.753 --> 00:22:31.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set it aside, and stick to it.

00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:34.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that way,
you demonstrate your appreciation

00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:38.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the gift Jehovah
has given you.

00:22:38.182 --> 00:22:42.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point is highlighted
in Proverbs chapter 5.

00:22:42.644 --> 00:22:44.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So turn there with me, please.

00:22:44.688 --> 00:22:49.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs chapter 5
—and we’ll begin reading in verse 18:

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:57.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May your own fountain be blessed,
[and here’s the point]

00:22:57.159 --> 00:23:00.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and may you rejoice

00:23:00.788 --> 00:23:03.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the wife of your youth,

00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a loving doe,
a graceful mountain goat.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let her breasts
satisfy you at all times.

00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:14.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and then here
again is the point]

00:23:14.718 --> 00:23:19.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you be captivated
by her love constantly.”

00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the point?

00:23:23.185 --> 00:23:27.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must confine
our romantic interests

00:23:27.064 --> 00:23:29.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our wife.

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:31.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no other option.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:36.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to “rejoice
with the wife of [our] youth.”

00:23:36.616 --> 00:23:40.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to “be captivated
by her love.”

00:23:40.328 --> 00:23:45.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means avoiding
overly-close relationships with other women,

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:50.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not just physical relationships
—texting,

00:23:50.338 --> 00:23:53.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
videoconferencing,
telephone calls

00:23:53.716 --> 00:23:56.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all constitute a relationship.

00:23:56.552 --> 00:23:58.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re very careful.

00:23:58.596 --> 00:24:02.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We set limits,
and we don’t go beyond them.

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:06.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And confining
our romantic interests to our wife

00:24:06.646 --> 00:24:08.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes rejecting

00:24:08.856 --> 00:24:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sexual fantasies involving others.

00:24:13.069 --> 00:24:17.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world makes light
of such fantasizing.

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:20.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus helped us to appreciate

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:22.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s a very serious matter.

00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recall his words
in the Sermon on the Mount?

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:30.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Anyone] who keeps on looking

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at a woman
so as to have a passion for her

00:24:34.174 --> 00:24:37.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has already committed adultery
 . . . in his heart.”

00:24:37.802 --> 00:24:39.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point:

00:24:39.804 --> 00:24:44.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fantasizing is little more
than rehearsing.

00:24:44.017 --> 00:24:47.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we reject such fantasies

00:24:47.145 --> 00:24:50.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that they
violate Bible counsel,

00:24:50.148 --> 00:24:53.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including Jesus’ very pointed advice.

00:24:53.735 --> 00:24:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they can prevent us
from rejoicing in our wife.

00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:02.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, (4)

00:25:02.619 --> 00:25:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be realistic in your expectations.

00:25:06.623 --> 00:25:09.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We husbands are not perfect.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that.

00:25:11.044 --> 00:25:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our wives are not perfect.

00:25:14.214 --> 00:25:17.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you appreciate it when your wife

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:22.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smooths over your imperfections
and makes you look good?

00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:26.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our wives appreciate it
when we do that for them.

00:25:26.852 --> 00:25:31.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be alert
for opportunities to do that.

00:25:31.148 --> 00:25:33.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:25:33.859 --> 00:25:38.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the husband
rejoices in his wife.

00:25:41.617 --> 00:25:44.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was trying to get caught up on paperwork
for the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:25:45.621 --> 00:25:47.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was so much to do.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:25:58.634 --> 00:26:01.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re home early, Honey.

00:26:03.472 --> 00:26:05.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sensed something was wrong.

00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids had left a few things out,
and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:26:15.276 --> 00:26:17.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed to talk
to the girls about this.

00:26:17.278 --> 00:26:19.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:33.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more I thought about it, though,
I realized it wasn’t just the kitchen.

00:26:36.213 --> 00:26:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I was part of the problem.

00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe the problem was me.

00:26:44.847 --> 00:26:48.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, my wife
is an amazing woman,

00:26:55.316 --> 00:26:57.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so loving.

00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:08.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be an understatement
to call her industrious.

00:27:15.878 --> 00:27:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there’s her infectious joy.

00:27:20.925 --> 00:27:25.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how could I not love her?

00:27:27.598 --> 00:27:32.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes it takes
more than saying, “I love you.”

00:27:32.103 --> 00:27:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:27:36.232 --> 00:27:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:27:38.568 --> 00:27:42.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls
as soon as they come through that door.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:27:44.866 --> 00:27:46.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:27:49.746 --> 00:27:54.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the husband
in the video rejoiced in his wife?

00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:59.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reflected
on her many good works

00:27:59.255 --> 00:28:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—her devotion to Jehovah,

00:28:02.258 --> 00:28:05.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good acts
that she performed for others,

00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:08.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her fine work
in behalf of her family,

00:28:08.723 --> 00:28:11.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her spontaneous joy

00:28:11.142 --> 00:28:13.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that made her
even more beautiful to him.

00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:16.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as he reflected

00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:19.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of those fine things,
what happened?

00:28:19.526 --> 00:28:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His appreciation
for his gift deepened,

00:28:23.446 --> 00:28:28.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was motivated
to do something about it.

00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:32.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a beautiful example for us.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So rejoice in your wife

00:28:35.792 --> 00:28:38.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by assigning her honor,

00:28:38.044 --> 00:28:41.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by investing time
in your relationship,

00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:45.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by confining
your romantic interests to your wife,

00:28:45.385 --> 00:28:49.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by being realistic
in your expectations.

00:28:49.139 --> 00:28:51.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, your marriage

00:28:51.933 --> 00:28:54.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your family
will continue to be

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:58.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a source of joy,
a place of stability,

00:28:58.357 --> 00:29:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a place of security.

00:29:01.443 --> 00:29:03.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Patrick LaFranca,

00:29:03.737 --> 00:29:06.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Personnel Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk
of the symposium,

00:29:10.536 --> 00:29:13.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate Joy in Your Family

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:17.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Wives, Rejoice
in Your Husband.”

00:29:24.216 --> 00:29:27.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christian wives, are you happy?

00:29:27.344 --> 00:29:29.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you love being a wife?

00:29:29.555 --> 00:29:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably right now
you’re looking at your husband

00:29:31.807 --> 00:29:33.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying, “Of course.”

00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:35.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s good.

00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could you add
even more joy to your marriage?

00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:42.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking,

00:29:42.192 --> 00:29:46.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Yes, if only my husband would . . .’

00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:48.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you finish the sentence.

00:29:48.782 --> 00:29:51.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think most husbands would admit

00:29:51.076 --> 00:29:53.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have
some room for improvement.

00:29:53.537 --> 00:29:55.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this talk is for you.

00:29:55.956 --> 00:30:00.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you do as a wife
to add joy to your marriage?

00:30:00.544 --> 00:30:03.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one of the first things is

00:30:03.047 --> 00:30:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think about your God-assigned role.

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:12.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, to Genesis 2:18.

00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:18.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Jehovah is going to explain

00:30:18.604 --> 00:30:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was making a wife for Adam:

00:30:22.525 --> 00:30:24.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah God said:

00:30:24.986 --> 00:30:28.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is not good for the man
to continue to be alone.

00:30:28.489 --> 00:30:31.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am going to make a helper for him,

00:30:31.993 --> 00:30:35.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a complement of him.’”

00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:39.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Eve was going to be a helper

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a complement of Adam.

00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:46.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is a complement?

00:30:46.632 --> 00:30:49.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we feel sure that you sisters

00:30:49.927 --> 00:30:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
know a lot about complementary colors.

00:30:53.056 --> 00:30:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you go to pick out
an outfit with accessories,

00:30:56.893 --> 00:31:01.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pick those with colors
that blend well together,

00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:05.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are a harmonious combination.

00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when you’re making a meal,

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:12.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know there are certain foods
that go well with other foods,

00:31:12.575 --> 00:31:15.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or complement, other foods,

00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a Korean sister making kimchi

00:31:18.998 --> 00:31:21.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably will make rice.

00:31:21.167 --> 00:31:24.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or pasta with cheese,

00:31:24.546 --> 00:31:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bacon and eggs, bread and butter

00:31:26.756 --> 00:31:31.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there are so many combinations
that complement one another.

00:31:31.219 --> 00:31:34.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jehovah God created Eve,

00:31:34.556 --> 00:31:37.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he built into her feminine qualities

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:41.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he knew would really work well

00:31:41.313 --> 00:31:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Adam’s masculine qualities.

00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:48.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Adam and Eve had a prospect

00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:53.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being a perfectly matched couple

00:31:53.658 --> 00:31:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could work well together.

00:31:56.119 --> 00:32:00.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eve could be fully happy
in working with her husband 

00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:05.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring for that garden
—the beautiful home God gave her.

00:32:06.505 --> 00:32:11.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, we know
that didn’t happen because of sin,

00:32:11.134 --> 00:32:14.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and along with sin, came stress.

00:32:14.096 --> 00:32:16.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are,
descendants of Adam and Eve.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’ve got too
—sin and stress.

00:32:20.602 --> 00:32:23.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah helps us, doesn’t he?

00:32:23.146 --> 00:32:28.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he gives us principles
that can help us make a happy marriage.

00:32:28.152 --> 00:32:31.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Ecclesiastes.

00:32:31.905 --> 00:32:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Ecclesiastes 4:9, 10

00:32:36.285 --> 00:32:40.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describe what a partnership
should be like.

00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:44.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wives, do you think of yourself
as your husband’s partner?

00:32:44.793 --> 00:32:47.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read verse 9:

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Two are better than one
because they have

00:32:50.716 --> 00:32:53.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good reward for their hard work.”

00:32:53.218 --> 00:32:56.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So your husband has made a decision,

00:32:56.013 --> 00:32:59.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe you think,

00:32:59.183 --> 00:33:02.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t know if that’s the best decision.’

00:33:02.228 --> 00:33:04.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re his partner.

00:33:04.605 --> 00:33:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how will you help him?

00:33:07.983 --> 00:33:09.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’re going to support
that decision;

00:33:09.985 --> 00:33:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to try to make it work.

00:33:12.154 --> 00:33:15.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what will be your reward?

00:33:15.116 --> 00:33:19.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all, you’re
going to accomplish so much more

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by working together
than you could individually.

00:33:23.124 --> 00:33:27.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,
you’re going to strengthen your friendship

00:33:27.586 --> 00:33:30.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your partnership with your husband.

00:33:30.923 --> 00:33:33.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 10, it adds:

00:33:33.718 --> 00:33:38.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if one of them falls,
the other can help his partner up.

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:41.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But what will happen to the one who falls

00:33:41.183 --> 00:33:43.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no one to help him up?”

00:33:43.644 --> 00:33:46.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be thinking,
‘Well, my husband is a strong man,’

00:33:46.689 --> 00:33:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably so.

00:33:48.691 --> 00:33:50.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But inside,

00:33:50.693 --> 00:33:54.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may be struggling
with serious insecurities.

00:33:54.822 --> 00:33:57.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, he may feel like a failure.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:00.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s lost his job

00:34:00.244 --> 00:34:02.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feels like he’s not a good provider.

00:34:02.955 --> 00:34:04.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re his partner.

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you going to do to lift him up?

00:34:07.877 --> 00:34:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably, you’re going to share with him

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:15.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some tactful words
of comfort and encouragement.

00:34:15.385 --> 00:34:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’ll be a happy place.

00:34:18.054 --> 00:34:22.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Proverbs
contains much wisdom,

00:34:22.809 --> 00:34:25.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of it is directed to wives.

00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:28.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Proverbs 14:1:

00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:33.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The truly wise woman
builds up her house,

00:34:33.778 --> 00:34:38.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the foolish one
tears it down with her own hands.”

00:34:38.283 --> 00:34:43.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you are wise,
you will build up, or increase,

00:34:43.288 --> 00:34:48.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
respect for your husband
on the part of your children and of others.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:53.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to be foolish
by speaking negatively

00:34:53.924 --> 00:34:58.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—talking about
your husband’s deficiencies or failures;

00:34:58.136 --> 00:35:02.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor would you want to undermine
his own confidence

00:35:02.057 --> 00:35:05.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by nagging or arguing with him.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do so much
to contribute to a happy house.

00:35:10.106 --> 00:35:13.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at mealtimes,

00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:16.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share in the conversation by adding,

00:35:16.696 --> 00:35:19.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps, a spiritual gem
you found in your Bible reading

00:35:19.991 --> 00:35:23.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a nice experience
or even a humorous story

00:35:23.286 --> 00:35:26.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that will lift
the spirits of the whole family.

00:35:28.792 --> 00:35:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we want to go
to Proverbs chapter 31,

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:36.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably right away you recognize

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is the chapter
that describes a capable wife.

00:35:42.472 --> 00:35:44.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think all of you wives
want to be that.

00:35:44.808 --> 00:35:48.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to be that “Proverbs 31” wife.

00:35:48.103 --> 00:35:50.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you read those verses,

00:35:50.397 --> 00:35:52.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you realize that this woman is very busy.

00:35:52.941 --> 00:35:56.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s out there
buying household supplies,

00:35:56.487 --> 00:36:00.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for the health
and welfare of her family,

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:05.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping others in need,
spending money wisely

00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:07.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—diligently caring for all the duties

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a wife, mother, friend, and neighbor.

00:36:10.626 --> 00:36:15.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think many of you wives
are doing all of those things.

00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:20.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you do it day in and day out,
and you don’t complain.

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:25.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re happy
—happy because you’re giving.

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:27.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you’re even happier

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when this happens in verse 28:

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:36.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her children rise up
and declare her happy;

00:36:36.026 --> 00:36:39.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her husband rises up and praises her.”

00:36:39.488 --> 00:36:42.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they do appreciate what you do.

00:36:42.491 --> 00:36:46.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they may not express it,
but they do appreciate it.

00:36:46.412 --> 00:36:50.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is another element
to a very happy marriage,

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:53.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s expressed in verse 11:

00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:57.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her husband trusts her from his heart,

00:36:57.256 --> 00:37:00.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he lacks nothing of value.”

00:37:01.969 --> 00:37:06.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust is so important in a marriage.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wife must trust her husband,

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:12.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a husband must trust his wife.

00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:14.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to have conversations;

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re going to express
your innermost feelings and thoughts.

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:23.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must not have fear that
that’s going to be shared with others

00:37:23.991 --> 00:37:27.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that you’ll be belittled in some way.

00:37:27.954 --> 00:37:30.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s trust

00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:33.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a very important aspect of marriage.

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you wives, build up your friendship,

00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:40.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your confidence with your husband.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 12, it adds:

00:37:42.218 --> 00:37:45.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She rewards him with good, not bad,

00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:48.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the days of her life.”

00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So wives, reward your husband with good

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:56.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—support him on what he has to do—

00:37:56.649 --> 00:37:59.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know that he
will love you all the more.

00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:01.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “all the days of [your] life.”

00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:03.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “all the days of [your] life,”

00:38:03.615 --> 00:38:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build up that friendship with your husband

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:09.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether he is a believer or not.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to say in behalf
of the thousands

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of hardworking elders
and ministerial servants,

00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:20.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without your faithful support,

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:25.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be much more challenging
to care for our responsibilities.

00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:29.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So thank you very much,
dear wives, for what you’re doing.

00:38:30.892 --> 00:38:35.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes you feel obliged
to speak your mind,

00:38:35.522 --> 00:38:39.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a trusting relationship,
that’s expected.

00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:42.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how will you speak your mind?

00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 26:

00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:47.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She opens her mouth in wisdom;

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:51.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the law of kindness is on her tongue.”

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:55.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So yes, you have
something worthwhile to say,

00:38:55.626 --> 00:38:59.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how you say it is very, very important.

00:38:59.338 --> 00:39:03.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the law of kindness
govern your tongue?

00:39:03.717 --> 00:39:06.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you say it in kindness,

00:39:06.804 --> 00:39:09.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your husband will love you all the more.

00:39:11.892 --> 00:39:14.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s read verse 30:

00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:19.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Charm may be false,
and beauty may be fleeting,

00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:23.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the woman
who fears Jehovah will be praised.”

00:39:23.988 --> 00:39:28.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, above all,
a capable wife who fears Jehovah

00:39:28.951 --> 00:39:32.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is highly valued and is to be praised.

00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:35.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you dear wives who fear Jehovah,

00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:38.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you worship him with awe and respect.

00:39:38.377 --> 00:39:41.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s so important
because that helps you

00:39:41.255 --> 00:39:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to easily be in subjection to your husband

00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:49.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know
that this pleases your heavenly Father.

00:39:51.432 --> 00:39:55.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you watch
the following dramatization,

00:39:55.227 --> 00:39:59.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the wife
rejoices in her husband.

00:40:04.028 --> 00:40:06.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so tired after work

00:40:06.697 --> 00:40:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but glad to finally get home, until . . .

00:40:16.165 --> 00:40:18.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to be kidding me.

00:40:21.504 --> 00:40:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re home, Honey.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew he had congregation stuff
to work on,

00:40:28.678 --> 00:40:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but seriously?

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:32.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tough day?

00:40:33.433 --> 00:40:36.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were supposed
to talk to the girls about this.

00:40:36.436 --> 00:40:38.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re making it a habit.

00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:45.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, it upset me
that he didn’t say anything,

00:40:46.779 --> 00:40:49.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then I began to think.

00:40:51.576 --> 00:40:56.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually something I’ve come to love
about John—his patience.

00:41:01.836 --> 00:41:03.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t overreact.

00:41:10.053 --> 00:41:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s thoughtful, concerned.

00:41:16.768 --> 00:41:18.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He really listens.

00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:25.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s why he’s such a good elder

00:41:31.992 --> 00:41:34.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why we’ve enjoyed
so many blessings together.

00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:51.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I forget,

00:41:52.804 --> 00:41:55.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could be more patient.

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:01.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Honey, you’re right.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is completely unacceptable.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:08.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll talk to the girls as soon
as they come through that door.

00:42:08.195 --> 00:42:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:42:10.572 --> 00:42:12.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:42:14.952 --> 00:42:18.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the wife
rejoiced in her husband?

00:42:18.997 --> 00:42:22.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when she walked
into that kitchen, she saw the mess;

00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:24.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wasn’t rejoicing.

00:42:24.545 --> 00:42:28.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she wanted to say something
to her husband, and she did.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did she say it?

00:42:30.592 --> 00:42:32.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did she yell at him?

00:42:32.594 --> 00:42:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made her point.

00:42:36.223 --> 00:42:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the husband react?

00:42:38.225 --> 00:42:40.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t overreact.

00:42:40.227 --> 00:42:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let her think about it,
and he thought about it.

00:42:43.647 --> 00:42:45.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as she thought about it,

00:42:45.649 --> 00:42:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she thought:
‘You know, he didn’t overreact.

00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:52.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s one of the things
I love about my husband.

00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is so patient.’

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course, he talked with her,

00:42:56.911 --> 00:42:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they resolved the issue.

00:42:58.954 --> 00:43:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So love triumphed

00:43:01.123 --> 00:43:05.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over any possible argument or anger.

00:43:05.503 --> 00:43:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue, dear wives,
to rely on Jehovah

00:43:09.632 --> 00:43:13.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you work
to make your marriage a delight,

00:43:13.803 --> 00:43:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will bless and help you.

00:43:17.598 --> 00:43:21.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux,
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:43:21.686 --> 00:43:25.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium:

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:30.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate Joy in Your Family
—Parents, Rejoice in Your Children.”

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy
to have hundreds of thousands of children

00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:47.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
associated
with our congregations worldwide.

00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be assured Jehovah loves
every one of those children.

00:43:52.175 --> 00:43:54.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we say that?

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one reason is that every child
owes their name to Jehovah God

00:43:59.265 --> 00:44:03.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he’s the Originator
of life and, in fact,

00:44:03.102 --> 00:44:06.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Originator
of the family unit as well.

00:44:06.314 --> 00:44:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was in heaven,
he recognized

00:44:09.692 --> 00:44:13.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observed
Jehovah’s intense love for children.

00:44:13.279 --> 00:44:16.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jesus
walked the earth,

00:44:16.157 --> 00:44:20.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reflected
those same qualities toward children.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The psalmist
beautifully expresses

00:44:23.832 --> 00:44:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s feelings
about children

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the 127th Psalm
and verse 3.

00:44:29.754 --> 00:44:31.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read that

00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:35.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 127:3.

00:44:38.471 --> 00:44:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Look!

00:44:40.515 --> 00:44:43.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sons are an inheritance
from Jehovah;

00:44:43.601 --> 00:44:47.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fruit of the womb
is a reward.”

00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:51.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not only are our children
a blessing, or “a reward,”

00:44:51.902 --> 00:44:56.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scripture indicates
that they “are an inheritance” as well.

00:44:56.907 --> 00:45:01.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they are a gift
to you from Jehovah.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person who hopes
to inherit something

00:45:04.664 --> 00:45:07.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually prepare
to receive it

00:45:07.125 --> 00:45:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then takes good care
of it afterward.

00:45:10.045 --> 00:45:15.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that’s exactly what you parents
want to do with your children.

00:45:15.008 --> 00:45:18.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, children
can bring much joy;

00:45:18.136 --> 00:45:20.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can
also cause frustration.

00:45:20.972 --> 00:45:25.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is:
How can you find joy in your children

00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:29.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite living in a stressful world?

00:45:31.275 --> 00:45:34.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One suggestion
is to view your children

00:45:34.861 --> 00:45:37.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way Jehovah does.

00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:41.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are special gifts
to you from him.

00:45:41.577 --> 00:45:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love them;
make them feel loved.

00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:48.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not enough for you
to know you love your own children.

00:45:48.542 --> 00:45:50.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need to know it.

00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:54.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will not know it
unless you find ways

00:45:54.339 --> 00:45:56.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show your love to them.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as with any gift,
there’s a responsibility to take care of it.

00:46:01.764 --> 00:46:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we go back
to the 127th Psalm,

00:46:05.601 --> 00:46:09.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the illustration
that King Solomon uses

00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:12.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to explain this responsibility.

00:46:12.358 --> 00:46:14.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in verses 4 and 5.

00:46:14.985 --> 00:46:17.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 127:4, 5,

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Like arrows
in the hand of a mighty man,

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so are the sons of one’s youth.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man who fills
his quiver with them.

00:46:31.335 --> 00:46:33.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will not be put to shame.”

00:46:35.256 --> 00:46:37.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So children
are likened to arrows

00:46:37.925 --> 00:46:40.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and parents
to mighty warriors.

00:46:40.928 --> 00:46:43.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a warrior
will take the arrow

00:46:43.264 --> 00:46:47.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will carefully aim it
so he hits the target.

00:46:47.268 --> 00:46:49.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same
with you parents.

00:46:49.729 --> 00:46:54.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you,
carefully direct your children

00:46:54.066 --> 00:46:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that,
so to speak, you “hit the target”

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so your children
can have a happy, fulfilling life

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving Jehovah God.

00:47:03.826 --> 00:47:06.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help
you to do that?

00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:10.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah
to help you build

00:47:10.124 --> 00:47:14.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintain a strong relationship
with your children.

00:47:14.212 --> 00:47:16.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This closeness
will help them

00:47:16.964 --> 00:47:21.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to respond favorably
to your good direction.

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:25.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the way you treat
your children is going to affect

00:47:25.556 --> 00:47:30.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only their future
but your happiness as well.

00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:34.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are five suggestions
that might be of assistance

00:47:34.274 --> 00:47:36.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in building and maintaining

00:47:36.276 --> 00:47:39.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this strong relationship
with your children.

00:47:39.612 --> 00:47:42.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one:

00:47:42.031 --> 00:47:45.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell your children
you love them.

00:47:45.326 --> 00:47:48.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say,
“Well, that’s not the way I was raised.”

00:47:48.288 --> 00:47:49.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe not.

00:47:49.998 --> 00:47:52.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But learn from the example
of Jehovah God

00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah
openly expressed his affection

00:47:56.713 --> 00:47:58.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his Son, Jesus.

00:47:58.923 --> 00:48:01.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no matter how
you were brought up,

00:48:01.217 --> 00:48:04.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn to express openly

00:48:04.304 --> 00:48:07.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your feelings
toward your children.

00:48:07.307 --> 00:48:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One father said this:

00:48:10.518 --> 00:48:15.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have found that children
are a bit like some flowers.

00:48:15.524 --> 00:48:19.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as these little plants
turn toward the sun

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:23.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to receive light and warmth,
children look to their parents

00:48:23.448 --> 00:48:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for love
and for reassurance

00:48:25.909 --> 00:48:30.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are
welcome members of the family.”

00:48:30.205 --> 00:48:33.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make your children
have to ask you,

00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:36.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mom, Dad,
do you love me?”

00:48:36.461 --> 00:48:39.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, on a regular basis,

00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:43.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your words support the fact
that you love them.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:49.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another way to build
a strong relationship with your children is:

00:48:49.975 --> 00:48:52.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give them your time.

00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:56.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s going to be a challenge
in the world we’re living in now.

00:48:56.190 --> 00:49:00.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t you think your children
are worth meeting that challenge?

00:49:00.402 --> 00:49:04.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to require
good organization on your part

00:49:04.406 --> 00:49:07.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even
making some sacrifices

00:49:07.659 --> 00:49:10.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving up some things
that you enjoy doing.

00:49:10.454 --> 00:49:14.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But spend a lot of time
talking to your children,

00:49:14.458 --> 00:49:19.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eating with your children,
playing with your children.

00:49:19.296 --> 00:49:22.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s up to you parents
to figure out

00:49:22.716 --> 00:49:26.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you can give
your time to your children.

00:49:26.762 --> 00:49:30.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mother once asked
her children,

00:49:30.516 --> 00:49:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you could have
anything you wanted,

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:36.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you like most?”

00:49:36.397 --> 00:49:38.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four responded,

00:49:38.858 --> 00:49:42.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More time
with Mom and Dad.”

00:49:42.862 --> 00:49:47.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, show your children
how important

00:49:47.032 --> 00:49:50.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are to you
by spending time with them.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know,
there’s more that’s necessary

00:49:53.706 --> 00:49:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than just to be
physically around them.

00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That leads us
to our third suggestion:

00:49:59.128 --> 00:50:03.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to your children
and acknowledge their feelings.

00:50:03.924 --> 00:50:06.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when communicating
with your children,

00:50:06.552 --> 00:50:08.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t dominate
the conversations.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let them talk.

00:50:10.973 --> 00:50:14.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen carefully
and respectfully.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to understand
how they feel.

00:50:17.563 --> 00:50:21.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they express themselves
and their emotions and their thoughts

00:50:21.067 --> 00:50:24.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and sometimes,
maybe in extreme terms),

00:50:24.445 --> 00:50:27.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t respond in a similar way.

00:50:27.907 --> 00:50:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:23 says:

00:50:31.327 --> 00:50:36.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart of the wise one
gives his mouth insight.”

00:50:36.124 --> 00:50:38.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So parents, work hard

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:42.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at patiently trying
to understand why your child

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:46.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feels the way they do
and how you can be of help.

00:50:46.593 --> 00:50:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One father expressed
the matter this way,

00:50:51.723 --> 00:50:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since Jehovah allows me
to pour out my heart to him in prayer,

00:50:56.352 --> 00:50:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think it is only fair
that I allow my children

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to pour out their positive

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:05.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>and</i> negative feelings to me.”

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:09.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also listen to your children

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and acknowledge their feelings.

00:51:12.452 --> 00:51:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fourth suggestion

00:51:14.621 --> 00:51:19.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may help to maintain
a strong relationship with your children is:

00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:23.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not expect
them to be adults.

00:51:23.171 --> 00:51:27.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Bible says:
‘Through <i>use</i>

00:51:27.092 --> 00:51:30.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘a person’s perceptive powers
are trained

00:51:30.595 --> 00:51:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distinguish
between right and wrong.’

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:36.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s going to take time.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also speaks
of the “traits of a babe,”

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “foolishness” of boyhood,

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the “vanity” of adolescence.

00:51:46.778 --> 00:51:51.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as your children
are going through these various stages,

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognize their limitations

00:51:53.702 --> 00:51:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t expect them
to be little adults.

00:51:57.622 --> 00:52:00.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fifth suggestion:

00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When disciplining your children,

00:52:03.045 --> 00:52:06.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always show love
and discernment.

00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:11.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is supported
by Ephesians 6:4

00:52:11.386 --> 00:52:16.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there it tells parents
‘not to be irritating your children,

00:52:16.141 --> 00:52:18.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘but to bring them up
in the discipline

00:52:18.727 --> 00:52:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and admonition of Jehovah.’

00:52:21.563 --> 00:52:25.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s no secret formula
on how to accomplish this,

00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:29.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially
since every child is different.

00:52:29.029 --> 00:52:32.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So parents,
we encourage you, give thought

00:52:32.157 --> 00:52:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the manner of your discipline,

00:52:34.576 --> 00:52:38.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always showing love
and discernment.

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:41.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there are five suggestion

00:52:41.542 --> 00:52:46.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help you to build
a strong relationship with your children

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:50.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help them to respond
to your good training.

00:52:53.053 --> 00:52:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what effect
will that have upon you parents?

00:52:56.432 --> 00:52:58.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please read with me

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:01.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs chapter 23,

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:05.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 24 and 25

00:53:05.065 --> 00:53:09.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 23:24, 25.

00:53:10.905 --> 00:53:15.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The father of a righteous one
will surely be joyful;

00:53:15.576 --> 00:53:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whoever fathers a wise son
will rejoice in him.

00:53:20.247 --> 00:53:23.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your father
and your mother will rejoice,

00:53:23.501 --> 00:53:27.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she who gave birth
to you will be joyful.”

00:53:27.546 --> 00:53:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the greatest joy
that a parent can have

00:53:31.634 --> 00:53:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see their children
turn out to be righteous

00:53:35.471 --> 00:53:39.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wise servants
of Jehovah God.

00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:43.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to take time and effort
on your part to accomplish that.

00:53:43.604 --> 00:53:46.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we encourage you,
don’t give up

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:51.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on these precious gifts
that you have received from Jehovah.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch
the following dramatization,

00:53:54.657 --> 00:53:59.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the parents
rejoice in their children.

00:54:00.288 --> 00:54:02.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you. I love you.

00:54:02.415 --> 00:54:04.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love you too.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Showtime!

00:54:07.378 --> 00:54:09.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fire drill went off right
when we were having our math test.

00:54:09.881 --> 00:54:11.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

00:54:17.889 --> 00:54:18.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Girls.

00:54:18.973 --> 00:54:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.

00:54:19.682 --> 00:54:21.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to finish the kitchen now.

00:54:21.184 --> 00:54:23.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we don’t have any time;
we just got home.

00:54:23.228 --> 00:54:24.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we have to leave in 15 minutes.

00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:26.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

00:54:28.525 --> 00:54:29.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:54:36.783 --> 00:54:39.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:54:39.035 --> 00:54:42.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did tell them to leave
the kitchen spotless, didn’t I?

00:54:42.372 --> 00:54:43.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:54:45.125 --> 00:54:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed to hear that.

00:54:46.835 --> 00:54:48.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:54:49.796 --> 00:54:54.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just overall they are . . .

00:54:54.593 --> 00:54:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know. I know.

00:55:00.432 --> 00:55:03.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were auxiliary pioneering
during the circuit overseer’s visit.

00:55:05.228 --> 00:55:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really
put themselves out for others

00:55:15.113 --> 00:55:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including you—I mean, us.

00:55:41.765 --> 00:55:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t ever want
to take them for granted.

00:55:47.479 --> 00:55:49.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, girls,

00:55:49.481 --> 00:55:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the big mess earlier,

00:55:51.859 --> 00:55:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanks for cleaning that up.

00:55:53.986 --> 00:55:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mom and I, we were upset.

00:55:58.115 --> 00:56:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we really want you to know that, um . . .

00:56:03.078 --> 00:56:08.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . you are gifts from Jehovah
precious gifts we both cherish.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you very much.

00:56:10.794 --> 00:56:12.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What your Mom said.

00:56:22.723 --> 00:56:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the parents
rejoiced in their children?

00:56:26.435 --> 00:56:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the daughters needed
some counsel and some discipline,

00:56:30.439 --> 00:56:33.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it didn’t overshadow
all their good qualities.

00:56:33.734 --> 00:56:36.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, but these parents
made comments

00:56:36.404 --> 00:56:40.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like they never wanted
to take the girls for granted

00:56:40.324 --> 00:56:42.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cherished
these girls.

00:56:42.868 --> 00:56:46.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they openly expressed
that they loved them.

00:56:46.706 --> 00:56:51.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it was apparent
this family had cultivated joy.

00:56:51.544 --> 00:56:56.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re confident
that you as parents also are working hard

00:56:56.299 --> 00:56:59.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at cultivating joy
in your family.

00:56:59.469 --> 00:57:01.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some things that will help you

00:57:01.554 --> 00:57:05.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to be sure to tell
your children you love them,

00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:09.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give them your time,
listen to them,

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
acknowledge their feelings,

00:57:11.689 --> 00:57:14.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t expect them
to be adults,

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and train them
with love and discernment.

00:57:19.113 --> 00:57:21.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These suggestions
are going to help you

00:57:21.866 --> 00:57:24.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to aim your children

00:57:24.285 --> 00:57:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an everlasting future
of serving Jehovah God.

00:57:28.498 --> 00:57:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you put forth
all of this effort to assist your children,

00:57:33.336 --> 00:57:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be able
to rejoice in them

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:38.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these precious gifts

00:57:38.633 --> 00:57:41.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you
have inherited from Jehovah.

00:57:43.138 --> 00:57:47.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Ronald Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:57:47.267 --> 00:57:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

00:57:50.812 --> 00:57:53.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Cultivate Joy in Your Family

00:57:53.606 --> 00:57:56.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Young Ones,
Rejoice in Your Parents.”

00:58:04.034 --> 00:58:07.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium has helped us
to appreciate even more 

00:58:07.954 --> 00:58:10.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love
for families.

00:58:10.165 --> 00:58:13.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate this gift,
the Bible,

00:58:13.335 --> 00:58:16.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which serves
as a blueprint for families

00:58:16.254 --> 00:58:20.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a loving,
warm, safe environment.

00:58:20.759 --> 00:58:24.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You young ones
play a vital role

00:58:24.262 --> 00:58:27.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in contributing
to the joy in your family life.

00:58:27.974 --> 00:58:32.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your mother and your father
love you very much,

00:58:32.312 --> 00:58:37.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want to have a close,
personal, loving relationship with you.

00:58:37.275 --> 00:58:39.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s
their heartfelt desire

00:58:39.778 --> 00:58:43.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have a close,
personal, loving relationship

00:58:43.824 --> 00:58:46.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:58:46.201 --> 00:58:48.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want you
to be happy now

00:58:48.787 --> 00:58:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the rest of your life
—everlasting life.

00:58:52.875 --> 00:58:57.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the previous talk,
we understood how Jehovah wants

00:58:57.796 --> 00:59:00.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
parents to train
their children.

00:59:00.382 --> 00:59:02.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with what purpose?

00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:06.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Proverbs 22:6

00:59:06.513 --> 00:59:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives as instructions
for parents.

00:59:10.184 --> 00:59:12.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in verse 6, it reads:

00:59:12.936 --> 00:59:17.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Train a boy 
[or the footnote says, “child; youth”]

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the way he should go;
even when he grows old

00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:24.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not depart from it.”

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah
asking of your parents?

00:59:28.827 --> 00:59:32.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To train you
—to train you in such a way

00:59:32.206 --> 00:59:36.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will always serve
Jehovah from your youth

00:59:36.001 --> 00:59:38.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the way
to your adulthood

00:59:38.963 --> 00:59:41.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, really,
for the rest of your life.

00:59:41.715 --> 00:59:45.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah doesn’t spell out
every single detail

00:59:45.302 --> 00:59:49.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for parents on how they should instruct
you and how they should train you.

00:59:49.432 --> 00:59:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s left up to them.

00:59:51.434 --> 00:59:56.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they need to prayerfully think
about what would be best for your family

00:59:56.147 --> 00:59:59.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for you
as a child personally.

00:59:59.608 --> 01:00:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that they
will make house rules.

01:00:02.612 --> 01:00:06.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you’ll get chores,
maybe curfews.

01:00:06.407 --> 01:00:09.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will get reminders,
correction, and discipline.

01:00:09.827 --> 01:00:11.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they love you
and because they’re doing their best

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:18.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen and obey Jehovah,

01:00:18.169 --> 01:00:20.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his instructions
are to train you

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discipline you so that you
can serve Jehovah forever.

01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:27.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not an easy assignment.

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:31.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need all the help
that they can get from Jehovah

01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:35.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as from you,
especially when they make rules

01:00:35.395 --> 01:00:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may not like:
what you can and cannot wear,

01:00:39.148 --> 01:00:41.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you can
and cannot listen to or watch,

01:00:41.776 --> 01:00:44.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or who you pick
as close friends.

01:00:44.696 --> 01:00:47.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are decisions
that are left to your parents.

01:00:47.949 --> 01:00:52.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, will your parents always make
the perfect decision, the perfect rule?

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Breaking news:

01:00:56.082 --> 01:01:00.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not news to you
that they will make mistakes.

01:01:00.044 --> 01:01:02.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re imperfect,
but they love you,

01:01:02.922 --> 01:01:05.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re doing the best
they can to give you

01:01:05.884 --> 01:01:07.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best training possible

01:01:07.886 --> 01:01:11.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can love Jehovah
and serve him forever.

01:01:11.306 --> 01:01:14.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you
love and appreciate

01:01:14.059 --> 01:01:18.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that your parents do for you,
but let’s be real.

01:01:18.146 --> 01:01:22.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you don’t understand
the reason for the rule

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you simply don’t agree with it.

01:01:25.237 --> 01:01:28.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do?
Well, you get frustrated.

01:01:28.573 --> 01:01:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s OK.
We’ve been there.

01:01:30.867 --> 01:01:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were your age
at one time,

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:36.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we completely understand
that it could be frustrating.

01:01:36.122 --> 01:01:39.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know
that this will pass

01:01:39.459 --> 01:01:42.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you’ll understand
why they’re doing this.

01:01:42.087 --> 01:01:44.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s out of love.

01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:47.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you
don’t see eye to eye,

01:01:47.092 --> 01:01:49.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are you supposed to do?

01:01:49.094 --> 01:01:52.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes you need
to change your view.

01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:57.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much has to do with how
you view your parents.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How you view
your mother and your father

01:02:00.147 --> 01:02:03.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will affect how much
or how little

01:02:03.734 --> 01:02:08.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you respect them,
listen to them, and obey them.

01:02:08.739 --> 01:02:12.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s a question
we’d like to pose to you children:

01:02:12.618 --> 01:02:15.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you sometimes
view your parents

01:02:15.746 --> 01:02:19.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as prison guards
or lifeguards?

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting question.

01:02:22.419 --> 01:02:26.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prison guards are trained
to keep a close watch over prisoners

01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they
don’t really trust them.

01:02:28.842 --> 01:02:32.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They keep them confined
with many restrictions.

01:02:32.429 --> 01:02:35.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tell them what to do
and when to do it

01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:38.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when to get up
and when to go to sleep,

01:02:38.811 --> 01:02:41.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they will eat
and when they will eat,

01:02:41.647 --> 01:02:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they will wear,
and all kinds of other rules.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They keep all these restrictions
because they don’t trust them.

01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view your parents
as prison guards at times?

01:02:53.242 --> 01:02:55.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might,
especially if you want

01:02:55.828 --> 01:02:58.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more freedom
—more independence.

01:02:58.539 --> 01:03:01.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if it seems like they
don’t really trust you

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re watching every single move
that you make),

01:03:04.545 --> 01:03:07.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might feel confined

01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:10.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of all the rules
and restrictions.

01:03:10.134 --> 01:03:12.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about lifeguards?

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:15.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, lifeguards also watch people;
they watch swimmers,

01:03:15.681 --> 01:03:18.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for a very different reason.

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:20.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want
to keep them safe.

01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to make sure
that they do not swim into danger.

01:03:23.272 --> 01:03:28.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from their lifeguard tower, they keep
a close watch over all the swimmers.

01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:31.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they will use
their whistle to warn you of danger

01:03:31.739 --> 01:03:35.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to keep away from riptides
or maybe sharks,

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that you’re not aware of.

01:03:38.079 --> 01:03:42.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you view
your parents as lifeguards?

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:44.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope so
because they are.

01:03:44.836 --> 01:03:47.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said
that you could spend years

01:03:47.213 --> 01:03:49.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wishing your parents
would get off your back

01:03:49.465 --> 01:03:51.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to realize

01:03:51.509 --> 01:03:55.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re the only ones
who ever really had your back.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, your parents,
like lifeguards,

01:03:58.683 --> 01:04:01.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are looking out
for your best interest.

01:04:01.102 --> 01:04:04.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve always had your back,
and they always will.

01:04:05.773 --> 01:04:10.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to make sure that you will avoid
being drawn into the dangerous currents

01:04:10.778 --> 01:04:15.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this wicked world
—dangers that you may not be aware of.

01:04:15.742 --> 01:04:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to be happier?

01:04:18.995 --> 01:04:21.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to have
more trust from your parents?

01:04:21.498 --> 01:04:24.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more freedom?
more independence?

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:28.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you might have to change
your view of your parents.

01:04:28.755 --> 01:04:32.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t view them in a negative way
(like they’re prison guards),

01:04:32.258 --> 01:04:34.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but view them like lifeguards,

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:38.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguarding your life.

01:04:38.098 --> 01:04:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your parents
love you very much,

01:04:41.017 --> 01:04:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their training
will pay off if you listen.

01:04:44.854 --> 01:04:47.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Jehovah
is asking you to do.

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:49.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While your parents
are training you,

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to do your part
—and that is to listen.

01:04:52.654 --> 01:04:56.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what our scripture
at Proverbs chapter 23

01:04:56.575 --> 01:04:59.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has as an assignment for you.

01:04:59.578 --> 01:05:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s chapter 23
of Proverbs in verse 22.

01:05:04.499 --> 01:05:08.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there, verse 22
says to you children:

01:05:08.003 --> 01:05:11.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Listen to your father
who caused your birth,

01:05:11.465 --> 01:05:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and do not despise
[or dislike]

01:05:14.551 --> 01:05:18.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your mother
just because she has grown old.”

01:05:18.597 --> 01:05:21.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So although it’s not easy at times,

01:05:21.934 --> 01:05:24.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is Jehovah asking of you?

01:05:24.228 --> 01:05:29.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your parents are training you,
please listen to them.

01:05:29.233 --> 01:05:32.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean to listen?

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:35.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening is more
than just hearing words.

01:05:35.614 --> 01:05:39.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hearing
with a view to obeying.

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:43.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening to your mother
and your father

01:05:43.288 --> 01:05:46.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means giving them
your full attention

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:48.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—undivided attention.

01:05:48.836 --> 01:05:51.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means turning off your music,

01:05:51.463 --> 01:05:53.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking out your earbuds,

01:05:53.799 --> 01:05:55.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting away your phone,

01:05:55.801 --> 01:06:00.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoiding rolling your eyes
when they’re speaking to you.

01:06:00.598 --> 01:06:04.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, you may get frustrated;
you may get upset.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:06.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s understandable.

01:06:06.812 --> 01:06:10.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do,
but how you control your emotions

01:06:10.983 --> 01:06:14.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will affect
the outcome in the future.

01:06:14.195 --> 01:06:17.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By listening
and obeying your parents,

01:06:17.448 --> 01:06:20.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are building
a record of trust

01:06:20.326 --> 01:06:22.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help
you in the future

01:06:22.328 --> 01:06:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you need to communicate with them,
maybe about rules.

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:30.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
trust is something that you earn;

01:06:30.294 --> 01:06:35.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not something that you demand
or that’s automatic.

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:39.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the best way for you
to speak to your parents

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:43.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about rules that you don’t understand
or maybe that you don’t agree with?

01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:45.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to communicate

01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good, open communication.

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:52.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Communication
doesn’t mean complaining,

01:06:52.859 --> 01:06:57.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shouting, whining,
maybe replying with sarcasm.

01:06:57.864 --> 01:07:02.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means calmly telling
your parents how you feel.

01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:05.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell them what’s on your mind.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:10.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following Bible verse
helps if we can apply it.

01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:12.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 29:11 says:

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:15.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A stupid person
gives vent to all his feelings

01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:19.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[It’s out of control—no control.],
but the wise one

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:24.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calmly keeps them in check
[in control].”

01:07:24.515 --> 01:07:27.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we want
to try to follow.

01:07:27.185 --> 01:07:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A young woman named Devan tried to do this,
and this is what she advises.

01:07:31.648 --> 01:07:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says,
“I found that when I stayed calm

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and presented
my thoughts clearly,

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:39.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could count on
my parents to listen

01:07:39.864 --> 01:07:42.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and either to reason
with me on their decision

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to come up
with another solution.”

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:50.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents appreciate having
a real conversation with their children

01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than screaming matches
that end up with slamming doors.

01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:59.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open communication
is what’s needed.

01:07:59.009 --> 01:08:02.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you young ones,
what have we learned?

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned
how to view our parents correctly,

01:08:05.932 --> 01:08:09.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as a prison guard,
but as a lifeguard

01:08:09.644 --> 01:08:13.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really wants to save your life
—your everlasting life.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have your back,
and they always will.

01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:21.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listening and obeying strengthens
your relationship with your parents

01:08:21.156 --> 01:08:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as your heavenly Father, Jehovah.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:27.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brings you joy
and brings joy to your parents.

01:08:27.788 --> 01:08:31.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you apply the training
that your parents are giving to you,

01:08:31.833 --> 01:08:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will gain wisdom
that will help you now

01:08:35.337 --> 01:08:38.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make wise decisions
so that you can have

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:42.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real life,
yes, everlasting life.

01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:46.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the concluding video
of this symposium,

01:08:46.473 --> 01:08:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please notice how these children
find joy in their parents.

01:08:52.354 --> 01:08:56.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Man, I’m so happy today because
that fire drill interrupted our math test.

01:08:56.567 --> 01:08:58.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to do it tomorrow,

01:08:58.235 --> 01:08:59.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’m going to be
studying again all night.

01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:01.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Mom, Dad!
I’ve got to shower before our study.

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No discussion, no excuses.
Now!

01:09:08.037 --> 01:09:09.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

01:09:13.625 --> 01:09:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did all of this come from?

01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:17.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be here all night.

01:09:25.846 --> 01:09:28.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did give us time to think.

01:09:36.816 --> 01:09:38.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are such good examples.

01:09:48.119 --> 01:09:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom never stops working.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our home
is always, always beautiful.

01:10:00.423 --> 01:10:03.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They give us so much of their time

01:10:06.012 --> 01:10:08.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and themselves.

01:10:09.765 --> 01:10:12.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a bit cheesy sometimes,

01:10:12.143 --> 01:10:15.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but overall, they’re pretty great.

01:10:17.523 --> 01:10:20.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, they didn’t lecture us.

01:10:20.443 --> 01:10:23.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just reminded us of one thing.

01:10:23.362 --> 01:10:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was pretty deep.

01:10:25.573 --> 01:10:29.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah,

01:10:29.702 --> 01:10:32.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our lives include everything

01:10:32.914 --> 01:10:37.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our time, our resources, our home,

01:10:37.418 --> 01:10:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our kitchen.

01:10:38.461 --> 01:10:40.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our kitchen.

01:10:40.129 --> 01:10:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how we care for those things,
it reflects on him

01:10:44.634 --> 01:10:47.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on us as your parents.

01:10:47.762 --> 01:10:49.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That kind of sank in.

01:10:49.681 --> 01:10:51.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do better.

01:10:53.643 --> 01:10:55.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Mom.
We got this.

01:10:55.937 --> 01:10:59.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.
We got this?

01:10:59.149 --> 01:11:01.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.
We got this.

01:11:12.704 --> 01:11:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the daughters
showed respect for their parents?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did this by listening
and obeying their instructions.

01:11:21.212 --> 01:11:23.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the key?

01:11:23.215 --> 01:11:25.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how they viewed
their parents.

01:11:25.425 --> 01:11:28.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They reflected
on their parents’ fine example

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:32.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry and at home,
where they would take the time

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:36.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the patience to help them,
to listen to them.

01:11:36.311 --> 01:11:38.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they saw the joy
on their mother’s face

01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:42.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she kept the home
clean and tidy.

01:11:42.234 --> 01:11:44.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a good example!

01:11:44.277 --> 01:11:46.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They listened
to their parents’ advice,

01:11:46.446 --> 01:11:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they
made personal application.

01:11:50.033 --> 01:11:52.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned
that showing respect in the family

01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:55.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant helping out with chores,

01:11:55.414 --> 01:11:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when it meant
doing the dishes.

01:11:58.333 --> 01:12:02.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made their parents happy
and the daughters happy as well.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this symposium, we considered
how husbands and wives,

01:12:06.758 --> 01:12:10.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mothers and fathers,
and children can all add

01:12:10.888 --> 01:12:14.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to the success
of the joy within the family.

01:12:14.933 --> 01:12:17.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do this
by working together in unity,

01:12:17.686 --> 01:12:21.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on the positive things
in others

01:12:21.148 --> 01:12:24.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having respect
for one another.

01:12:24.109 --> 01:12:26.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each in the family,

01:12:26.153 --> 01:12:30.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they apply Bible principles
—use Jehovah’s blueprint—

01:12:30.491 --> 01:12:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they know that they can have
a successful and happy family.

01:12:34.244 --> 01:12:37.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of all,
we can make Jehovah happy

01:12:37.456 --> 01:12:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—give him honor
as the Designer,

01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:44.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Architect,
and the Creator of all families.

01:12:46.298 --> 01:12:49.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for sharing that practical counsel.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:52.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all family members continue to strengthen 

01:12:52.179 --> 01:12:55.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their love and appreciation for one another.

01:12:55.808 --> 01:12:59.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite you to stand
and sing song number 135,

01:12:59.728 --> 01:13:04.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Jehovah’s Warm Appeal:
‘Be Wise, My Son.’”

01:13:05.443 --> 01:13:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the song,
there will be some announcements,

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you wish, you may remain standing.

01:13:10.656 --> 01:13:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 135.

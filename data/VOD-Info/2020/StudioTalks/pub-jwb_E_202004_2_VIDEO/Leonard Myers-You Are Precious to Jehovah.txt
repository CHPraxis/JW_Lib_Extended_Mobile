00:00:01 Our theme for this month’s program is
00:00:04 “You Are Precious to Jehovah.”
00:00:07 How vital it is
00:00:09 that we remind ourselves of that!
00:00:11 Why?
00:00:13 Well, let’s consider three reasons.
00:00:16 First, Satan wants us to believe
00:00:19 that Jehovah doesn’t love us or value our service.
00:00:22 He wanted Job to believe that.
00:00:25 But that was a lie in Job’s day, and it’s still a lie today.
00:00:33 A second reason that we need to be reminded that we’re precious to Jehovah
00:00:36 is because of negative circumstances
00:00:38 or events that have taken place in our life.
00:00:42 Severe illness, advancing years, injustices,
00:00:46 mistreatment, a difficult family life, or other situations
00:00:51 may cause some brothers and sisters to feel that they’re just not worth loving.
00:00:57 Some may question why Jehovah allows those things to happen.
00:01:02 Finally, we need reminders of how Jehovah feels about us
00:01:06 because our imperfection can cause us to have negative thoughts.
00:01:11 Some may still punish themselves for past mistakes,
00:01:15 doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them
00:01:17 or that he could ever love them.
00:01:20 Others wage a constant battle against feelings of worthlessness.
00:01:25 One Witness wrote:
00:01:27 “Satan has done an excellent job of making
00:01:30 “even those who love Jehovah feel worthless and unlovable.
00:01:35 “. . . I never felt worthy of Jehovah’s love,
00:01:38 “so I tried to do more and more in his service
00:01:41 “as a way of earning that love.
00:01:43 “. . . So no matter how many hours I spent in the ministry,
00:01:46 “or how many people I helped, I felt it was not enough.
00:01:50 I saw only the lack in me.”
00:01:54 One brother stated:
00:01:57 “I came from a family that showed little love.
00:02:00 “I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.
00:02:04 “So, early in life I felt worthless.
00:02:08 “I still carry entrenched feelings from my past
00:02:11 “that beat me down when I experience calamity.
00:02:15 “When I stopped serving as a congregation elder,
00:02:18 “I felt like a failure as usual
00:02:21 —to God, my family, and my brothers in the congregation.”
00:02:27 If you’ve experienced such feelings,
00:02:30 you’re not alone.
00:02:32 So how can you be assured of Jehovah’s interest?
00:02:36 Let’s examine three lines of evidence
00:02:38 that prove you’re precious to Jehovah.
00:02:42 First, we’ll examine Jehovah’s feelings for the nation of Israel.
00:02:47 Second, we’ll reflect on an event recorded in the Gospels.
00:02:51 And third, we’ll consider a modern-day example
00:02:55 of one who was very precious to God.
00:03:00 By the end of the 16th century B.C.E.,
00:03:03 millions of Israelites were enslaved in Egypt,
00:03:05 where they were severely oppressed.
00:03:08 In their distress, the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.
00:03:13 How did he feel?
00:03:15 Turn with me to Isaiah 63:9.
00:03:19 The A portion reads:
00:03:22 “During all their distress
00:03:24 it was distressing to him.”
00:03:27 Did you notice?
00:03:29 Not only did Jehovah see their troubles
00:03:32 but he felt for his people,
00:03:34 and he was moved to act in their behalf.
00:03:37 Isaiah 63:9 goes on to say:
00:03:41 “In his love and compassion he repurchased them.”
00:03:47 Jehovah couldn’t see their suffering or hear their outcries
00:03:51 without feeling for them and doing something about it.
00:03:55 That may remind us of the loving concern
00:03:58 that a mother has for her newborn child.
00:04:00 When that baby cries,
00:04:02 the mother takes notice
00:04:04 and she feels for her child.
00:04:07 In fact, notice how this is expressed at Isaiah 49:15.
00:04:12 It reads:
00:04:14 “Can a woman forget her nursing child
00:04:18 “or have no compassion for the son of her womb?
00:04:21 “Even if these women forget,
00:04:24 I would never forget you.”
00:04:28 It’s hard to imagine a mother forgetting to nourish and care for her nursing child.
00:04:33 That baby is helpless
00:04:35 —day and night it needs its mother’s attention.
00:04:39 Sad to say, however,
00:04:41 that we hear at times of such maternal neglect.
00:04:44 But what did Jehovah say to reassure the Israelites?
00:04:48 “I would never forget you.”
00:04:52 Yes, the tender compassion that Jehovah felt for his servants
00:04:56 was immeasurably stronger
00:04:59 than one of the most tender and natural feelings we can imagine
00:05:03 —the compassion a mother normally feels for her baby.
00:05:08 Jehovah’s feelings for the Israelites
00:05:10 are summed up in another expression in the book of Isaiah.
00:05:13 Please read with me Isaiah 43:4:
00:05:17 “For you became precious in my eyes,
00:05:22 you were honored, and I have loved you.”
00:05:27 Jehovah clearly expressed his feelings for his people.
00:05:32 As one of Jehovah’s servants,
00:05:35 you can be sure that he also loves you most tenderly.
00:05:39 No matter what trials you’re facing now or have endured in the past,
00:05:43 Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.
00:05:47 When you hurt, he hurts.
00:05:50 You’re far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.
00:05:55 He remembers your past efforts,
00:05:57 and he sees your continuing efforts to please him.
00:06:02 Notice how Jehovah promises to sustain and comfort his people
00:06:06 according to Isaiah 66:12, 13:
00:06:12 “You will nurse and be carried on the hip,
00:06:15 “and you will be bounced on the knees.
00:06:19 “As a mother comforts her son,
00:06:21 so I will keep comforting you.”
00:06:25 What a heartwarming scene!
00:06:28 Imagine a loving mother carrying a baby on her hip
00:06:31 or bouncing him on her knees.
00:06:34 In this way,
00:06:36 Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity
00:06:39 and tenderness of his love for you.
00:06:42 Just as Jehovah loved his people, Israel,
00:06:45 he likewise feels that you are very precious and dear
00:06:50 —never doubt that!
00:06:54 A second example of how Jehovah feels
00:06:56 about his faithful servants can be found in the Gospels.
00:07:00 Let’s read what happened on one occasion
00:07:02 when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem
00:07:05 at Luke 21:1-4:
00:07:09 “Now as he looked up,
00:07:11 “he saw the rich dropping their gifts
00:07:13 “into the treasury chests.
00:07:16 “Then he saw a needy widow drop in
00:07:19 “two small coins of very little value,
00:07:23 “and he said:
00:07:25 “‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow
00:07:28 “‘put in more than they all did.
00:07:31 “‘For all of these put in gifts
00:07:33 “‘out of their surplus,
00:07:35 “‘but she, out of her want
00:07:37 “‘[or as the footnote says, “poverty”],
00:07:40 put in all the means of living she had.’”
00:07:45 The study note for verse 2
00:07:47 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
00:07:50 tells us that the Greek word for “needy” may describe
00:07:53 “a person who lacks the basic necessities of life
00:07:57 “or someone for whom life is a great struggle.
00:08:00 In the Christian Greek Scriptures, it is used only here.”
00:08:05 Just think about the widow’s circumstances.
00:08:08 Not only had she experienced the grief
00:08:11 of losing her husband, her provider,
00:08:13 but she also lived in a religious climate
00:08:16 dominated by leaders who,
00:08:18 according to Luke 20:47,
00:08:21 would “devour the houses of the widows”
00:08:24 rather than help such vulnerable ones.
00:08:27 That widow was so poor that her contribution to the temple
00:08:32 was what a laborer might earn in just a few minutes.
00:08:35 Life wasn’t easy for her.
00:08:39 In fact, Jesus said that she
00:08:41 “put in all the means of living she had.”
00:08:46 Our publications have stated that the coins the widow contributed
00:08:50 were likely two lepta.
00:08:53 With eight lepta, a person could buy two sparrows,
00:08:57 which were among the cheapest birds used for food.
00:09:01 So the widow had only half the amount needed
00:09:04 to buy one sparrow,
00:09:07 hardly enough for a single meal.
00:09:09 Yet, both the widow and her contribution
00:09:12 were valuable to Jehovah.
00:09:15 Jesus said that her contribution was greater
00:09:18 than the contributions of the rich.
00:09:21 When she put those two small coins in the treasury chest,
00:09:25 they would be mixed with what the rich had put in.
00:09:27 To imperfect human eyes, they might seem lost, buried.
00:09:32 Yet, this precious widow was the one Jesus singled out for praise.
00:09:36 When the treasury workers came across the coins,
00:09:39 they wouldn’t have known how precious the coins and their donor
00:09:43 were to Jehovah.
00:09:45 But God’s view was the one that really mattered,
00:09:48 not what other people thought
00:09:50 or even how that dear widow viewed herself.
00:09:54 Like that widow,
00:09:56 you may find that circumstances limit
00:09:58 what you can contribute to Jehovah.
00:10:01 Age, infirmities, or other circumstances beyond your control
00:10:06 may limit the amount of time you’re able to spend in the ministry.
00:10:10 You might feel that your efforts are like those
00:10:13 “two small coins of very little value.”
00:10:18 Still, we learn from this account of the needy widow
00:10:21 that Jehovah notices and he treasures each act done for him,
00:10:26 especially when we do it despite difficult circumstances.
00:10:31 For a moment, think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year.
00:10:37 Some of you may feel that you accomplished little.
00:10:41 Your imperfect heart might cause you to wonder
00:10:43 whether Jehovah was pleased with your efforts.
00:10:47 However, did one of the hours you spent
00:10:50 require a special sacrifice on your part?
00:10:54 If Jehovah took notice of the widow
00:10:56 dropping in those two coins and valued her contribution,
00:11:01 don’t you think he also noticed
00:11:03 and valued what you did for him during that hour?
00:11:07 Jehovah values every gift, no matter how small,
00:11:11 that springs from a heart motivated by love.
00:11:14 He remembers, and he’ll reward
00:11:17 even the smallest contribution given in support of his Kingdom.
00:11:22 That’s proof of how Jehovah feels about you.
00:11:27 Finally, let’s consider a modern-day example
00:11:30 of one who was very precious to Jehovah.
00:11:34 It’s the experience of Sister Areti Pina.
00:11:37 Sister Pina lived on the southern coast of Albania
00:11:40 in the town of Vlorë.
00:11:42 She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.
00:11:47 There was a strong congregation  in Vlorë in the 1930’s,
00:11:51 and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer
00:11:53 who climbed up and down rugged mountains,
00:11:56 preaching with her Bible in hand.
00:11:59 In time, a congregation no longer existed in Vlorë,
00:12:03 and Sister Pina lost contact with the brothers.
00:12:06 Yet, she kept preaching faithfully on her own.
00:12:10 Do you think her efforts went unnoticed by Jehovah?
00:12:14 Well, years later, word reached the brothers
00:12:17 that there was an old, senile woman
00:12:19 who was reportedly preaching in Vlorë.
00:12:22 People thought she was crazy for keeping faith in God
00:12:25 during years of totalitarian rule.
00:12:29 Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80’s, was anything but senile.
00:12:34 When the brothers arrived at her home,
00:12:37 Sister Pina invited them in,
00:12:39 but she seemed somewhat reserved.
00:12:42 When they explained that they were her spiritual brothers,
00:12:45 she had no reaction.
00:12:48 After a few minutes,
00:12:50 Sister Pina started firing questions at the brothers:
00:12:53 “Do you believe in the Trinity? What is God’s name?
00:12:57 “Do you believe in hellfire? What happens when we die?
00:13:00 What about the earth? How many go to heaven?”
00:13:04 The brothers answered each question.
00:13:06 “Do you preach?” she then asked.
00:13:10 “Yes,” said one brother, “we preach.”
00:13:13 “But,” she responded,  “how do you preach?”
00:13:17 “We preach from house to house,” replied the brother.
00:13:21 “Now I know that you are my brothers!” she exclaimed.
00:13:25 “Only Jehovah’s people preach from house to house!”
00:13:30 Through her tears, Sister Pina stated:
00:13:33 “Jehovah is wonderful. He never forgot me!”
00:13:39 Sometime later, the brothers were notified that Sister Pina was ill
00:13:44 and that she wanted to meet with one of the responsible brothers.
00:13:47 When he arrived, she asked in part,
00:13:50 as she gasped for air,
00:13:53 “Has the book of Revelation been fulfilled?”
00:13:57 The brother responded, “Yes, Areti, most of it has.”
00:14:02 Sister Pina said: “Now I can die in peace.
00:14:06 I needed to know how close we are.”
00:14:10 Shortly after that conversation,
00:14:12 Sister Pina faithfully finished her earthly course.
00:14:17 What do you think?
00:14:19 During all those years of isolation
00:14:22 from the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization,
00:14:25 did Sister Pina’s efforts go unnoticed by Jehovah?
00:14:29 Absolutely not!
00:14:31 Just imagine Jehovah’s joy
00:14:34 as he watched her faithfully doing what she could in his service.
00:14:38 Do you think that Sister Pina was precious to Jehovah?
00:14:42 Without a doubt she was.
00:14:46 Well, your efforts in Jehovah’s service do not go unnoticed by him either.
00:14:51 Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.
00:14:57 So, what has this consideration helped us to realize?
00:15:00 We may have to contend with Satan’s lies,
00:15:03 negative circumstances and events in our lives,
00:15:06 and our own imperfections.
00:15:09 But we should never forget that Jehovah highly values his servants.
00:15:15 We saw that in his words to the Israelites through the prophet Isaiah.
00:15:19 You can be sure that Jehovah loves you most tenderly.
00:15:24 No matter what trials you’re facing now or have endured in the past,
00:15:28 Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.
00:15:32 When you hurt, he hurts.
00:15:35 You’re far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.
00:15:41 The account of the widow in Luke chapter 21
00:15:44 can assure you that although circumstances
00:15:46 may affect what you can contribute to Jehovah,
00:15:49 he notices and treasures each act you do for him,
00:15:54 especially when you do it in the face of difficult circumstances.
00:15:58 He remembers, and he will reward
00:16:01 even the smallest contribution given in support of his Kingdom.
00:16:06 And what beautiful modern-day examples we have in the organization
00:16:11 of brothers and sisters who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah
00:16:14 and are precious to him, like the example of Sister Pina!
00:16:20 Dear brothers and sisters, please,
00:16:23 never forget that you are precious to Jehovah!

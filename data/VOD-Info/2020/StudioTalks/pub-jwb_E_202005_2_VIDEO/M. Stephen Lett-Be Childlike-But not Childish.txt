00:00:01 The theme for this program is
00:00:04 “Be Childlike—But Not Childish!”
00:00:10 First Corinthians 14:20
00:00:14 is our theme scripture:
00:00:18 “Brothers, do not become young children in your understanding,
00:00:23 “but be young children as to badness;
00:00:27 and become full-grown in your understanding.”
00:00:32 In this single verse,
00:00:34 we’re told not to be like a young child in one way
00:00:38 and we’re told to be like a young child in another way.
00:00:43 We should not be like a child when it comes to understanding,
00:00:48 and we should be like a child when it comes to badness.
00:00:52 During this discussion,
00:00:55 let’s focus on three ways
00:00:58 we should not be like a child
00:01:00 and then let’s talk about three ways we should be like a child.
00:01:06 Please turn to Hebrews 5:13, 14,
00:01:11 and let’s identify negative trait number one
00:01:16 that we do not want to imitate:
00:01:20 “For everyone who continues to feed on milk
00:01:24 “is unacquainted with the word of righteousness,
00:01:28 “for he is a young child.
00:01:31 “But solid food belongs to mature people,
00:01:35 “to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained
00:01:40 to distinguish both right and wrong.”
00:01:44 So the negative trait that children have
00:01:47 is immature feeding habits.
00:01:52 Think about it: Young children
00:01:55 have a tendency to eat what they like
00:01:58 regardless of its nutritional value.
00:02:02 Most young ones would be perfectly happy
00:02:05 eating ice cream, candy, cookies,
00:02:08 and other sweets for all of their meals.
00:02:12 But now we ask,
00:02:14 What do our spiritual appetites
00:02:17 and feeding habits reveal about us?
00:02:21 Consider: How do we spend our free time?
00:02:25 Do we squander voluminous hours watching television
00:02:30 or reading material that provides little or no spiritual nutrition?
00:02:35 Or do we make wise use of our free time
00:02:39 to take in solid spiritual food?
00:02:43 When we receive a new issue of The Watchtower,
00:02:47 do we merely scan through it, looking at a few highlights,
00:02:51 and then do something else?
00:02:53 Do we take time to research deeper spiritual truths
00:02:58 so as to fully understand them?
00:03:01 Do we take time to really meditate?
00:03:04 Meditation is not daydreaming.
00:03:07 Meditation is bridled, focused thought.
00:03:11 Pause your reading to ask questions such as:
00:03:15 ‘What does this teach me about Jehovah?
00:03:19 ‘With whom could I share this information?
00:03:22 ‘What’s Jehovah telling me?
00:03:25 ‘How does this fit in with other things I know about this subject?
00:03:30 How can I make application?’
00:03:34 James 1:25 encourages us
00:03:38 to peer into God’s Word.
00:03:40 According to the Reference Bible,
00:03:43 ‘peer’ literally means to ‘stoop beside.’
00:03:47 To illustrate: Simply reading through the Bible
00:03:52 could be likened to walking quickly through the world’s greatest museum
00:03:56 and periodically glancing at the various displays.
00:04:01 You will learn something.
00:04:04 But meditatively peering into God’s Word
00:04:08 can be likened to stopping all along the museum route
00:04:12 and even stooping down
00:04:14 and closely examining from different angles
00:04:18 the artifacts, exhibitions, and displays.
00:04:23 Now our knowledge and appreciation
00:04:27 are going to be enhanced much more.
00:04:31 Yes, our spiritual appetite and feeding habits
00:04:36 reveal much about whether we have done away
00:04:40 with the trait of a young child, namely,
00:04:42 immature feeding habits.
00:04:46 Now please turn to Ephesians 4:14.
00:04:51 Let’s discern from this scripture negative trait number two
00:04:56 that we don’t want to imitate:
00:05:00 “So we should no longer be children,
00:05:04 “tossed about as by waves and carried here and there
00:05:09 “by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men,
00:05:14 by means of cunning in deceptive schemes.”
00:05:19 So, what’s the negative trait?
00:05:22 Young children are easily tricked, or fooled.
00:05:27 This scripture likens being easily tricked about what’s right or wrong
00:05:32 to being tossed about by the waves of the ocean
00:05:36 and blown around by the wind.
00:05:39 If you think of a piece of wood floating in a turbulent ocean
00:05:44 or a piece of paper in a windstorm,
00:05:47 there’s no stability or direction.
00:05:50 Both can be easily maneuvered
00:05:54 to go anywhere—take any position.
00:05:58 Well, that’s true of very young children
00:06:02 who often can be easily deceived.
00:06:05 For example, if given a choice
00:06:08 between a shiny coin of little value
00:06:11 and paper money of great value,
00:06:15 the shiny coin will likely be chosen.
00:06:20 But now, here’s the point:
00:06:22 What do our spiritual choices reveal about us?
00:06:26 Do our choices in regard to music and other entertainment,
00:06:31 clothing, and grooming indicate that we’re being fooled
00:06:35 even slightly by Satan and his world?
00:06:40 Yes, Satan is bent on tricking us,
00:06:43 but Jehovah tells us
00:06:45 at 1 Corinthians 14:20 (the scripture we read earlier):
00:06:50 “Do not become young children in your understanding.”
00:06:58 But now, please turn to Matthew 11:16, 17.
00:07:03 Here we’ll find the third negative trait of a child
00:07:07 that we do not want to imitate:
00:07:11 “With whom will I compare this generation?
00:07:15 “It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces
00:07:20 “who call out to their playmates, saying:
00:07:23 “‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance;
00:07:27 we wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.’”
00:07:34 Jesus was saying that adult people
00:07:37 were acting like children.
00:07:40 Children love to play.
00:07:43 So the negative trait of young children
00:07:46 is that they prefer play over responsibility.
00:07:51 Think about it: The vast majority
00:07:55 of the waking hours of a small child
00:07:57 are spent playing
00:07:59 —play, play, and more play.
00:08:03 Most of their life is fun and games.
00:08:07 But later, when the child goes to school,
00:08:10 where does he get the time to do so?
00:08:13 He has to take it from his playtime.
00:08:17 But now, spiritually speaking, we can ask ourselves,
00:08:22 ‘How far have we progressed
00:08:25 in buying out time from our playtime?’
00:08:29 Ephesians 5:16 encourages us
00:08:32 to ‘make the best use of our time.’
00:08:36 Literally, according to the footnote,
00:08:38 this scripture is telling us
00:08:41 to ‘buy out the appointed time’
00:08:45 —that is, buy it from less important things.
00:08:49 So the question for all of us is,
00:08:52 Have we bought out the majority of our playtime
00:08:55 for more important spiritual responsibilities?
00:09:00 Now, we’ve discussed three negative traits
00:09:03 of a young child that we want to avoid.
00:09:07 If we had time, we could have discussed
00:09:10 other negative traits to be avoided,
00:09:12 such as how children tend to have a short attention span
00:09:17 (they’re easily distracted),
00:09:20 their curiosity often gets them into trouble,
00:09:25 and they generally need a lot of time and attention
00:09:29 (they’re high-maintenance).
00:09:32 But now let’s briefly discuss three positive traits
00:09:36 of a young child that we do well to imitate.
00:09:40 Positive characteristic number one
00:09:44 is at 1 Corinthians 14:20, which we read at the outset.
00:09:50 That scripture tells us
00:09:53 to “be young children as to badness.”
00:09:59 So, what’s the characteristic that we want to imitate?
00:10:02 Young children are innocent,
00:10:06 inexperienced, when it comes to badness.
00:10:10 Or put another way,
00:10:13 they haven’t done many truly bad things.
00:10:16 Like children, we don’t want
00:10:20 to gain knowledge or experience in what is bad.
00:10:24 For example, when it comes to pornography,
00:10:28 we want no experience whatsoever
00:10:32 in regard to this filthy thing of Satan’s world.
00:10:36 When it comes to television programs
00:10:39 that are designated for a “mature audience,”
00:10:43 remember to tell yourself,
00:10:46 ‘I’m not old enough; I’m a young child.’
00:10:52 For positive characteristic number two,
00:10:55 let’s consider Matthew 18:2-4:
00:11:02 “So calling a young child to him,
00:11:05 “he [Jesus] stood him in their midst and said:
00:11:10 “‘Truly I say to you, unless you turn around
00:11:15 “‘and become as young children,
00:11:18 “‘you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.
00:11:23 “‘Therefore, whoever  will humble himself like this young child
00:11:27 is the one who is the greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens.’”
00:11:33 What’s the desirable trait?
00:11:36 Young children are humble and teachable.
00:11:39 Young children ask many questions because they want to learn,
00:11:44 but grown-ups are often hesitant to ask questions.
00:11:48 Why?
00:11:50 They don’t want to look uninformed.
00:11:54 But acting like we know something
00:11:56 when we don’t is actually dishonest
00:12:00 and probably motivated by pride.
00:12:03 The point is,
00:12:06 Don’t be afraid to reveal what you don’t know.
00:12:10 Remain humble and teachable like a child.
00:12:16 Now let’s identify desirable trait number three
00:12:20 by going to Matthew 21:15, 16:
00:12:26 “When the chief priests and the scribes
00:12:29 “saw the marvelous things he did
00:12:32 “and the boys who were shouting in the temple,
00:12:35 “‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’
00:12:38 “they became indignant and said to him:
00:12:42 “‘Do you hear what these are saying?’
00:12:44 “Jesus said to them
00:12:46 “‘Yes. Did you never read this,
00:12:49 “‘“Out of the mouth of children and infants
00:12:52 you have brought forth praise”?’”
00:12:56 So, what desirable characteristic can we identify?
00:13:00 Young children are exuberant and enthusiastic.
00:13:05 Well, in like manner,
00:13:08 we want to remain exuberant and expressive
00:13:12 about Jehovah, Jesus,
00:13:15 the Kingdom, and other spiritual things.
00:13:19 Psalm 145:7 encourages us to “bubble over”
00:13:23 and “shout joyfully” because of these wonderful things.
00:13:28 And we never want to lose that childlike enthusiasm.
00:13:34 Well, there we have three desirable traits of a young child
00:13:39 that we want to do our utmost to imitate.
00:13:43 If we had time, we could discuss
00:13:46 several other positive characteristics,
00:13:49 such as how children tend to be trusting,
00:13:54 not prejudiced, and not hypocritical.
00:14:00 But now in review, may each of us
00:14:04 prayerfully strive not to be childish
00:14:08 when it comes to (1) immature feeding habits,
00:14:13 (2) being easily tricked, or fooled,
00:14:18 and (3) preferring play over responsibility.
00:14:24 On the other hand,
00:14:26 may each of us prayerfully strive to be childlike
00:14:30 when it comes to being
00:14:33 (1) innocent and inexperienced concerning badness,
00:14:38 (2) humble and teachable,
00:14:43 and (3) exuberant and enthusiastic
00:14:48 about spiritual things!

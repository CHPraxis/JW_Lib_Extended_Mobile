00:00:01 My comments this month
00:00:03 are drawn from 1 Corinthians 3:10:
00:00:07 “Let each one keep watching
00:00:09 how he is building.”
00:00:11 Building
00:00:13 —are we talking about the upcoming construction
00:00:16 of a facility for headquarters departments in Ramapo, New York?
00:00:21 Or are we referring to the building of new Kingdom Halls in your country?
00:00:27 Well, as important as those building projects are,
00:00:31 my comments are directed to an even more important building work.
00:00:38 Let’s look at the context
00:00:40 at 1 Corinthians 3:5.
00:00:46 Apollos and Paul are mentioned by name.
00:00:49 And what was their specific role identified to be?
00:00:53 Verse 5 says
00:00:55 “ministers through whom you became believers.”
00:01:00 Apollos and Paul had taught the Scriptures to many in Corinth.
00:01:05 In verses 6 through 9,
00:01:07 Paul likens this teaching activity to the planting of a field.
00:01:12 Seeds of truth are planted in the heart of a person.
00:01:16 By means of return visits and Bible studies,
00:01:20 the seeds are watered.
00:01:22 But if the person is receptive,
00:01:25 then with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing,
00:01:28 the truth will blossom
00:01:31 and grow to the point of dedication and baptism.
00:01:36 Did you notice in verse 9
00:01:39 that Bible teachers are described as “God’s fellow workers”?
00:01:45 What an awesome privilege we have to assist Jehovah
00:01:49 in gathering “the precious things of all the nations”!
00:01:56 So we now know the topic of these verses
00:01:59 in 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
00:02:02 It’s discussing Bible teachers
00:02:04 who help others to become believers.
00:02:08 But did you also notice that in verse 9,
00:02:12 Paul changes illustrations?
00:02:15 He said: “You are God’s field under cultivation”
00:02:20 —that’s agricultural.
00:02:22 But then he changes the analogy,
00:02:24 saying “God’s building”
00:02:27 —that’s architectural; that’s construction.
00:02:32 Why the change in illustrations?
00:02:36 The building analogy highlights a specific point.
00:02:41 You see, the illustration of the farmer
00:02:44 doesn’t focus on the farmer’s impact on the growth of a plant.
00:02:49 In that illustration, the farmer waters the seedling,
00:02:53 but it’s God that makes the plant grow.
00:02:58 However, the illustration of building, or construction,
00:03:03 focuses on the builder’s involvement,
00:03:06 or the Bible teacher’s involvement.
00:03:09 The one constructing a building has considerable influence
00:03:14 over the quality of the end product.
00:03:17 What kind of materials does he select?
00:03:21 Is he thorough in his work,
00:03:24 or does he cut corners to get the job done faster
00:03:27 or with less effort?
00:03:30 Now let’s read the 10th verse
00:03:33 of 1 Corinthians chapter 3:
00:03:37 “According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me,
00:03:42 “I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder,
00:03:47 “but someone else is building on it.
00:03:49 “But let each one keep watching
00:03:52 how he is building on it.”
00:03:55 There in Corinth, Paul, as a “master builder,”
00:03:59 had initially acquainted many with the truth.
00:04:03 In effect, he “laid a foundation”
00:04:06 for others to build on.
00:04:09 But what was that foundation?
00:04:11 Verse 11 says:
00:04:13 “For no one can lay any other foundation
00:04:18 “than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”
00:04:23 Paul had helped establish the congregation there in Corinth
00:04:27 based on the teachings of Jesus,
00:04:30 the foundation of the truth.
00:04:33 Building on that foundation,
00:04:36 others would become Bible teachers
00:04:39 and help still others to progress toward baptism.
00:04:43 That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10
00:04:46 to “keep watching how” we build.
00:04:50 We can affect the outcome.
00:04:53 So to all of us Bible teachers, including parents,
00:04:58 we ask the question,
00:05:00 How are we building on the foundation?
00:05:05 Why does it really matter?
00:05:08 Let’s read verses 12 and 13:
00:05:12 “Now if anyone builds on the foundation
00:05:15 “gold, silver, precious stones,
00:05:19 “wood, hay, or straw,
00:05:21 “each one’s work will be shown for what it is,
00:05:24 “for the day will show it up,
00:05:27 “because it will be revealed by means of fire,
00:05:30 “and the fire itself will prove
00:05:33 what sort of work each one has built.”
00:05:37 Do we understand how important it is
00:05:39 to analyze our teaching techniques?
00:05:44 Will we use the best techniques possible
00:05:47 to reach our student’s or our child’s heart?
00:05:52 Or do we just try to get by with the bare essentials,
00:05:55 in effect, a halfhearted effort,
00:05:59 using hay or straw, as it were?
00:06:04 Some years ago in one developing country
00:06:07 during an economic boom,
00:06:09 it became a priority
00:06:11 to build more and more schools.
00:06:15 Unfortunately, building requirements and materials
00:06:19 were substandard.
00:06:22 Well, what happened when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake
00:06:27 hit one of the areas?
00:06:29 Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled
00:06:34 while buildings around them remained standing.
00:06:39 An official report indicated
00:06:41 that over 5,000 students died.
00:06:46 Think about it.
00:06:48 Prior to the earthquake, schools were in session
00:06:52 and everything seemed fine.
00:06:54 Students and faculty
00:06:56 were coming and going on a daily basis.
00:07:00 But the unforeseen earthquake proved
00:07:04 that the building methods used
00:07:06 were not of the quality needed to prevent collapse
00:07:10 and terrible carnage.
00:07:14 First Corinthians 3:13 makes clear
00:07:18 that how we build spiritually when teaching Bible students
00:07:23 or our children
00:07:25 is just as important.
00:07:29 Now notice the sobering point
00:07:33 made in verses 14 and 15:
00:07:39 “If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains,
00:07:43 “he will receive a reward;
00:07:46 “if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss,
00:07:51 “but he himself will be saved;
00:07:53 yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”
00:07:58 The point in verse 14 is that if we’re conscientious
00:08:03 and reach the hearts of our Bible students,
00:08:06 that may be what gives them the needed fortitude
00:08:09 to withstand unexpected trials.
00:08:13 In that case, our diligent work “remains.”
00:08:17 Then verse 15 makes the point
00:08:19 that if our teaching techniques were inconsistent
00:08:24 or were in some way slipshod,
00:08:27 our student may not successfully weather a “fire,”
00:08:31 or stormy trial in his life.
00:08:35 We personally may survive,
00:08:38 but we might suffer the loss of the one we studied with,
00:08:42 whether a Bible student
00:08:44 or our own child.
00:08:47 That’s why Paul is highlighting the need
00:08:50 to be the best Bible teacher
00:08:53 we personally can be.
00:08:57 However, we should mention
00:08:59 that if a person who progresses to dedication and baptism
00:09:04 later leaves the truth,
00:09:07 it’s not necessarily the responsibility of the Bible teacher.
00:09:13 The teacher may have been very diligent
00:09:16 and used the best of spiritual building materials.
00:09:21 But the student or child may not have responded from his heart.
00:09:26 Or possibly he allowed human imperfection or temptation
00:09:31 to cause him to deviate from the way.
00:09:35 But the takeaway point from 1 Corinthians chapter 3
00:09:40 is to do our best to build in our students or children
00:09:45 fire-resistant materials.
00:09:48 We want them to remain
00:09:51 —to endure the tests that are sure to come their way.
00:09:56 What might be likened to building with inferior materials
00:10:00 when studying the Bible with someone?
00:10:03 Possibly, we initially aroused a person’s interest
00:10:07 by telling him about the hope of everlasting life in Paradise.
00:10:12 That’s indeed Scriptural.
00:10:14 But is that in itself building in such a way
00:10:17 that the person will survive
00:10:19 a fiery trial of faith in the future?
00:10:25 What if our teaching consisted solely of saying,
00:10:29 “If you want to live forever in Paradise,
00:10:31 “you must study, go to the meetings,
00:10:35 and share in the preaching work”?
00:10:38 If so, we are not building
00:10:41 in a way to ensure
00:10:43 that the student or child
00:10:46 will resist the fire of trials
00:10:49 or stand the test of time.
00:10:52 In effect, we’re using wood, hay, or straw.
00:10:59 Do you remember that Paul said we are to build “on the foundation”?
00:11:04 He said the foundation “is Jesus Christ.”
00:11:07 That is solid.
00:11:11 Ephesians 3:16, 17
00:11:16 help us to understand what it means
00:11:19 to build with quality materials
00:11:21 such as gold, silver, and precious stones.
00:11:26 In verse 16, it makes clear that there’s a way
00:11:31 that we can “be made mighty in the [person we] are inside.”
00:11:38 Let’s read verse 17:
00:11:40 “And that through your faith
00:11:42 “you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.
00:11:46 May you be rooted and established on the foundation.”
00:11:52 How can we help our child or Bible student
00:11:55 become strong, or mighty, spiritually?
00:11:59 Interestingly, verse 17 said
00:12:02 that it’s by having “the Christ dwell in your hearts,”
00:12:06 not just knowing Jesus in the head
00:12:10 but sounding his teachings and personality down
00:12:14 into our student’s heart.
00:12:17 It means to know Jesus so well
00:12:20 that it’s as if he lives, or dwells, inside of us
00:12:25 and motivates us as Christians.
00:12:29 The result?
00:12:31 Verse 17 concluded by saying
00:12:33 that the student would become
00:12:35 “rooted and established on the foundation.”
00:12:39 Yes, solidly grounded
00:12:42 on Jesus Christ.
00:12:45 And Hebrews 1:3
00:12:47 says that “[Jesus] is the reflection of God’s glory
00:12:50 and the exact representation of his very being.”
00:12:55 Jesus himself said:
00:12:58 “No one comes to the Father except through me.”
00:13:02 So building with fire-resistant materials means
00:13:06 helping the student to love Jesus, yes,
00:13:09 but also to have a close, loving relationship
00:13:13 with Jehovah God himself.
00:13:17 But why are we considering the theme
00:13:20 ‘Keep Watching How You Are Building’ now?
00:13:24 Why is this more urgent than ever before?
00:13:30 It’s because all indications,
00:13:33 Scripturally and circumstantially,
00:13:36 point to Satan’s evil system of things coming to an abrupt end.
00:13:42 The physical indications of Matthew chapter 24
00:13:47 and the bizarre temperament described
00:13:49 at 2 Timothy 3:1-5
00:13:52 become more and more precise
00:13:55 as we watch “the scene of this world” unfold.
00:14:01 We can expect even more opposition and persecution
00:14:05 from those who are opposed to our resolve
00:14:09 to stand on the side of Jehovah.
00:14:12 Our brothers in Russia and other lands
00:14:15 are experiencing this now.
00:14:19 Some have been beaten
00:14:21 and brutalized in other ways.
00:14:23 As we’ve heard,
00:14:26 others have been sentenced to years in prison.
00:14:30 In recent years, the organization has reminded us of what we can expect
00:14:35 as the great tribulation begins.
00:14:40 Do you remember this video clip
00:14:42 from the Pursue What Builds Loyalty video series
00:14:46 shown at the 2016 regional convention?
00:14:50 Be reminded.
00:14:54 And your faith has led you here
00:14:58 as loyal servants of Jehovah,
00:15:01 confident that Psalm 97:10
00:15:05 applies to you personally:
00:15:08 “[Jehovah] is guarding the lives of his loyal ones.”
00:15:23 Where are they?
00:15:27 Try the basement!
00:15:34 Check that door!
00:16:16 That video series has been affectionately called
00:16:20 the basement video.
00:16:23 It was depicting one possible scenario
00:16:25 that could be considered a “fire”
00:16:28 according to 1 Corinthians 3:13.
00:16:32 The serious question we want to ask ourselves is,
00:16:36 ‘Would my Bible student or child
00:16:39 be in the basement with those other faithful brothers and sisters?’
00:16:45 If not, would the reason be
00:16:48 because of his own lack of faith?
00:16:51 Or might it, at least in part, be
00:16:54 because we did not take our responsibility as a teacher
00:16:59 seriously enough?
00:17:02 Did we build with fire-resistant materials
00:17:06 or, in effect, with hay or straw?
00:17:11 The same verse said:
00:17:13 “For the day will show it up . . .
00:17:17 “the fire itself will prove
00:17:19 what sort of work each one has built.”
00:17:22 It’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?
00:17:26 If you recall in the May 2020
00:17:29 JW Broadcasting® monthly program,
00:17:32 Brother Lett addressed the concern a few parents have expressed
00:17:36 about some of our videos that depict
00:17:38 Biblical or modern-day situations.
00:17:42 In these, at times, true worshippers are depicted
00:17:45 as having their faith tested
00:17:48 as if by fire.
00:17:50 The concern expressed is that some scenes
00:17:54 could have an effect on children
00:17:56 who’ve been protected from all negative circumstances on TV,
00:18:01 including daily news reports of catastrophes
00:18:05 being faced by real people.
00:18:08 The basement scene we just reviewed
00:18:11 was one of our videos
00:18:13 that produced such a reaction.
00:18:16 Another one was the reenactment of the Bible account
00:18:20 depicting Jehovah’s saving acts in the time of King Hezekiah.
00:18:25 It was shown at the 2016 regional convention,
00:18:29 and the video is entitled
00:18:31 “O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You.”
00:18:35 Let’s look again at that portrayal of Jehovah’s saving acts.
00:18:59 My lord!
00:19:05 If a parent has shielded his child
00:19:08 from viewing all scenes on the news
00:19:11 or other visual images depicting negative realities,
00:19:16 it’s understandable that there may be a concern.
00:19:21 However, as Brother Lett stated:
00:19:25 ‘Parents need to give their children a realistic idea
00:19:29 ‘of what we will face in the near future.
00:19:34 ‘Many parents choose to help their children appreciate
00:19:37 ‘the graphic visual imagery of a Bible-based account
00:19:42 ‘while at the same time building trust in Jehovah,
00:19:46 who will be with them in times of distress.’
00:19:49 The point is, friends,
00:19:51 the Bible warns us, young and old alike,
00:19:54 that a time of fiery testing looms on the horizon.
00:19:59 We want to be realistic and face these events
00:20:02 with faith and courage.
00:20:05 Our videos depict such circumstances
00:20:09 in a tasteful and sanitized way,
00:20:12 not showing any actual acts of bloodshed or violence.
00:20:18 Be assured that the Governing Body
00:20:21 is not trying to scare anyone.
00:20:25 Instead, we are trying
00:20:27 to prepare everyone.
00:20:31 We feel responsible to fortify the brotherhood
00:20:34 by using fire-resistant building materials
00:20:38 in the spirit of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
00:20:42 As teachers of the Word of God,
00:20:45 may we all give prayerful thought to the methods,
00:20:49 techniques, and the diligence we display
00:20:53 when conducting Bible studies.
00:20:56 We’re motivated by the very spirit of Jehovah God.
00:21:01 The words at 2 Peter 3:9 come to mind.
00:21:05 Of Jehovah, it says:
00:21:07 “He does not desire anyone to be destroyed
00:21:12 but desires all to attain to repentance.”
00:21:17 May that be our resolve
00:21:19 as we take to heart the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3:10:
00:21:24 “Let each one keep watching how he is building”!

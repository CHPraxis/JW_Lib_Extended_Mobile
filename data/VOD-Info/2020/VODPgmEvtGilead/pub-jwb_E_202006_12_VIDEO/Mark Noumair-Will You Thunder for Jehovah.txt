00:00:02 And now from Andrew to John
00:00:05 —the apostle John;
00:00:07 he was living at a most critical time
00:00:11 —the last surviving apostle.
00:00:13 He was helping to hold back a tidal wave of worldly influence
00:00:17 and apostate thinking that was already eroding
00:00:20 the Christian congregation.
00:00:23 Under divine inspiration,
00:00:26 John wrote a most vigorous letter to his brothers.
00:00:30 We can still sense in him that fiery enthusiasm
00:00:34 that earned him his name, “Son of Thunder.”
00:00:39 And that letter, the letter that we’re going to look at right now,
00:00:44 will show you
00:00:46 how you like John can thunder for Jehovah.
00:00:49 Well, how can you do that? Let’s find out.
00:00:52 We’re going to open up now to 1 John chapter 1.
00:00:56 We’re going to read verses 1 and 3,
00:00:58 and watch how John makes very clear his objective right from the outset.
00:01:05 First John 1:1:
00:01:07 “That which was from the beginning,
00:01:11 “[now, the beginning was Christ Jesus in his prehuman existence;
00:01:15 “he was the firstborn of all creation]
00:01:18 “which we have heard,
00:01:21 “which we have seen with our eyes,
00:01:25 which we have observed and our hands have felt [him].”
00:01:29 And notice that John right away wants to grab the attention of the brothers
00:01:33 and to say: ‘Look! We heard him.
00:01:36 ‘We’ve seen him with our eyes. We’ve observed him.
00:01:39 ‘I’ve felt him. I touched him.
00:01:41 I laid my head in his chest.’
00:01:44 Did John even hear his heartbeat?
00:01:48 Well, the fact is that these messages were so clear to John,
00:01:52 and he wanted to make it known.
00:01:54 Notice verse 3:
00:01:56 “That which we have seen and heard,” again John repeats this.
00:02:00 ‘His teachings, I saw them—I heard them.
00:02:03 I’m so convinced that God’s powers are operating through him,’
00:02:07 that there in verse 3, John says:
00:02:10 “We are reporting also to you.”
00:02:14 ‘I’m reporting this to you,’ John said.
00:02:16 John had such good reason to thunder.
00:02:20 He was a living link to Christ.
00:02:22 The brothers alive at that time did not have the privilege that John had
00:02:26 to walk and to touch and to be taught by Jesus personally.
00:02:31 But John did, and he was so moved by these experiences
00:02:35 that he wanted to report these real-life experiences about Christ.
00:02:40 But why?
00:02:42 To protect his brothers
00:02:44 —to protect his beloved brothers from the false teachers at that time
00:02:48 who were trying to draw them away from the truth.
00:02:52 You see, John spoke up against lies
00:02:55 that the apostates and the other false teachers
00:02:58 were spreading in his day.
00:03:01 They were telling disgusting lies about God and Jesus.
00:03:06 They craftily constructed speeches designed to corrupt the teachings of Christ.
00:03:11 John knew that. He felt it.
00:03:13 They even claimed to have secret revelations and superior knowledge.
00:03:17 And they boasted that they were the correctors of the apostles.
00:03:21 Liars!
00:03:23 And John could not stomach liars.
00:03:27 And it is of interest:
00:03:28 Out of the 15 times the Bible used the word “liar,”
00:03:32 he used the word eight times.
00:03:36 You see, John continued to thunder, defend, and speak out for the truth
00:03:42 because he loved the truth, he loved Christ Jesus,
00:03:45 and he loved the Father, Jehovah.
00:03:50 Similarly today,
00:03:54 lies and false reports against the truth abound.
00:03:58 And enemies of the truth use any means
00:04:01 to try to smear the reputation of Christ’s brothers.
00:04:05 But, now, what’s the point?
00:04:07 Your time here at world headquarters,
00:04:10 your time with the Governing Body,
00:04:13 your time with the responsible brothers from world headquarters
00:04:16 convinces you firsthand
00:04:20 that any negative reports that you hear about the organization are lies.
00:04:25 And now you can thunder for Jehovah
00:04:28 by defending the truth about those whom Christ appointed
00:04:31 to take the lead in his organization.
00:04:34 And look what you’ve been able to do.
00:04:36 You can say just like John:
00:04:37 ‘Look, I’ve heard. I’ve seen.
00:04:39 ‘I’ve observed. I’ve felt.
00:04:41 That is me. I’ve had a close-up view.’
00:04:44 This is an even closer look than you can have on JW Broadcasting.
00:04:49 This is one-on-one in the flesh.
00:04:53 And you can say:
00:04:55 ‘I’ve had a close-up view of God’s spirit-directed organization.
00:04:59 ‘And now I am reporting to you,
00:05:04 my beloved brothers and sisters,’ in the assignments that you have.
00:05:07 That’s what you can do now —‘what I’ve seen and I’ve heard.’
00:05:11 And, in this way, imagine what you can do
00:05:15 to strengthen, stabilize, and build confidence in your brothers!
00:05:20 This is your responsibility now.
00:05:22 This wasn’t coming here to school just to have a good time.
00:05:25 I know you did have a good time, but that wasn’t the objective.
00:05:28 The objective is now that you go out and you serve your brothers
00:05:32 —all of you, each and every one of you, brother, sister,
00:05:35 single, married; it doesn’t matter.
00:05:37 Your brothers and sisters now deserve a Gilead graduate’s reward.
00:05:42 And you’re going to give it to them.
00:05:44 And you thunder in doing that.
00:05:49 Now let’s go back to the apostle John.
00:05:54 John’s thunder never diminished to a low rumble.
00:05:58 Think about it.
00:06:00 What did John do when he was released from prison
00:06:02 on the island of Patmos at nearly 100 years old?
00:06:05 What did he do?
00:06:08 I mean, did he say: ‘I’m a weak, old man.
00:06:10 There’s nothing I can do anymore’?
00:06:12 No, no, no.
00:06:13 You see, he knew the apostasy was coming
00:06:16 and that oppressive wolves were already misleading the brothers.
00:06:20 But John said, ‘Not on my watch.’
00:06:26 And he would continue to thunder for Jehovah
00:06:29 by using every fiber of his being
00:06:32 to help his brothers right down to his dying breath.
00:06:36 How did he do that?
00:06:38 He wrote four Bible books,
00:06:42 including the portion that we just read here
00:06:46 in 1 John chapter 1.
00:06:49 He didn’t retire.
00:06:51 He was still full of fiery enthusiasm,
00:06:54 wanting to help his brothers because he loved the truth.
00:06:58 But what helped John to keep the thunder rolling?
00:07:02 What helped him?
00:07:04 He knew the final outcome.
00:07:10 You see, in 96 C.E. before his release,
00:07:14 he received that unexpected flash of light —the Revelation,
00:07:19 a vision
00:07:21 of 144,000 Kingdom conquerors
00:07:25 who will rule with Jesus in heaven.
00:07:28 He got that.
00:07:30 Then he was told  about an integrity-keeping “great crowd
00:07:33 . . . out of all [the] nations” that would worship God in truth.
00:07:36 He got that.
00:07:38 Can you imagine how that strengthened his conviction?
00:07:41 In spite of the apostasy,
00:07:44 he said true worship would not be extinguished.
00:07:50 So think about it.
00:07:52 If a prophetic vision of the great crowd
00:07:57 encouraged John to continue to fight and defend the truth,
00:08:01 what about you
00:08:03 —you who see not a vision but the reality of its fulfillment?
00:08:10 Now, John is seeing the reality from heaven —true—
00:08:13 but you have a front-row seat right here on earth
00:08:17 as you witness the greatest preaching effort in history
00:08:21 and you watch Jehovah perform a modern-day miracle
00:08:24 by gathering ‘a great crowd from all the nations.’
00:08:28 No matter what we face now
00:08:31 or in the future,
00:08:33 keep the thunder rolling.
00:08:36 Why?
00:08:38 Because you know the final outcome.
00:08:42 You see it already developing.
00:08:46 John continued to thunder for Jehovah,
00:08:51 but he mellowed through the years of faithful service.
00:08:56 His fiery enthusiasm is now on display in perfect balance.
00:09:02 A man who once wanted to call down fire from heaven to get results
00:09:07 now uses a force much stronger
00:09:10 and more effective.
00:09:12 What is it?
00:09:14 Love.
00:09:16 In fact, at 1 John 2:14,
00:09:20 notice what he says here.
00:09:22 And just sense the love that he has
00:09:25 when he writes verse 14:
00:09:29 “I write you, fathers,
00:09:31 “because you have come to know him who is from the beginning.
00:09:36 “I write you, young men, because you are strong
00:09:40 “and the word of God remains in you
00:09:43 and you have conquered the wicked one.”
00:09:46 Can you sense the love?
00:09:48 John is saying, ‘Look, the word of God remains in you.’
00:09:52 He used the powerful force of love to commend his readers
00:09:55 because they never lost their heartfelt appreciation for the truth.
00:10:00 Can you see yourself doing that?
00:10:03 You see, thunder without love is just noise.
00:10:06 But be determined to lovingly commend your brothers
00:10:10 for their endurance.
00:10:12 Thank them for their integrity.
00:10:15 Commend them for their unselfish love.
00:10:18 Touch their hearts when you speak with them.
00:10:21 Our brothers need encouragement, not criticism.
00:10:28 Well, as I look at each one of you,
00:10:32 I have a lot of thoughts going through my mind.
00:10:35 I do. I mean, here you are—
00:10:37 I mean, all the memories
00:10:39 are flooding through my mind, flooding through my heart.
00:10:42 It’s amazing as I look at you!
00:10:46 I can still hear your comments.
00:10:49 But you know what else I can hear?
00:10:51 I can hear each day (when you came to class)
00:10:53 how you thundered into that classroom.
00:10:55 You did. We have never seen such a thunderous class.
00:11:00 There you were each morning hugging each other,
00:11:04 clapping for the morning worship comments, commending each other.
00:11:07 It’s as if you hadn’t seen each other in three months;
00:11:09 it was just last night you saw each other.
00:11:12 But, oh no,
00:11:14 you thundered in appreciation for divine truth
00:11:18 and for the privilege to be here at school
00:11:20 and for each other’s integrity-keeping course.
00:11:24 Now, as you leave, what do we want you to remember?
00:11:29 We want you to remember how you can keep the thunder rolling.
00:11:32 How can you do that?
00:11:34 I’m going to give you three ways.
00:11:36 One, defend the truth.
00:11:42 Don’t allow false reports and lies about the organization that you love
00:11:46 —the organization that you love and cherish,
00:11:48 the very organization that brought you to these seats.
00:11:53 Never allow lies and false reports to stop you
00:11:56 from reporting what you have seen and heard firsthand.
00:12:01 Two, remember the final outcome.
00:12:04 True worship will prevail.
00:12:07 You already see it doing so.
00:12:10 And three, use the powerful force of love.
00:12:14 Use love to commend and fortify your brothers.
00:12:18 Encourage them. Build them up.
00:12:20 Use love.
00:12:22 And like John, with all your might,
00:12:24 with all your ability,
00:12:27 thunder for Jehovah.

00:00:01 Expect the unexpected.
00:00:05 Well, the unexpected has arrived, hasn’t it?
00:00:08 None of us expected that this graduation program
00:00:13 would need to be modified and changed as it is.
00:00:16 And yet, what have you had to do?
00:00:19 You’ve had to accept the unexpected.
00:00:24 There’s not much you can do.
00:00:26 And we’d like to commend you students,
00:00:28 soon-to-be graduates of this class of Gilead,
00:00:32 because you have accepted these changes
00:00:34 in a fine, positive attitude.
00:00:37 But it does highlight to us —doesn’t it?—
00:00:39 that sometimes it can be disappointing
00:00:42 when unexpected things occur.
00:00:45 Now soon, you’ll be going to your assignments,
00:00:49 whether back home or to a new assignment.
00:00:52 And, no doubt, you are going to face
00:00:56 some unexpected things as well.
00:00:58 And we’d just like to discuss one aspect of this theme.
00:01:02 If you’d like to take your Bibles
00:01:04 and turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 10,
00:01:10 Ecclesiastes 10:7,
00:01:15 and here it describes something that is unexpected:
00:01:20 “I have seen servants on horseback
00:01:24 but princes walking on foot just like servants.”
00:01:29 Well, you wouldn’t expect to see that, would you?
00:01:31 Now, how are you going to see that?
00:01:35 Well, The Watchtower made a very interesting comment
00:01:38 about this verse that said:
00:01:40 “Those who have great ability
00:01:43 “do not always receive the recognition.
00:01:47 “And those with less ability
00:01:50 sometimes receive more honor.”
00:01:53 So when you arrive back full of enthusiasm
00:01:58 —you’ve enjoyed your Gilead training,
00:02:00 and no doubt you’re thinking:
00:02:03 ‘I’m a different person. I’ve changed.’
00:02:06 And we hope you have.
00:02:08 Maybe you might expect
00:02:11 that there will be certain privileges granted to you.
00:02:15 And yet, at the same time,
00:02:17 you may see that someone you don’t expect
00:02:21 is given those privileges.
00:02:24 They may even come up to you and say: “I’m so surprised!
00:02:28 I’m shocked they’ve given me this privilege!”
00:02:31 And outwardly you say, “Hmm,”
00:02:33 but inwardly you’re saying: “I’m shocked too,
00:02:36 “because I’m the one who is trained at Gilead.
00:02:39 Surely I should get this privilege.”
00:02:43 But when you think about it,
00:02:45 remember that Jehovah is the one
00:02:48 who is backing the work, and at times,
00:02:51 he does the unexpected and, in this case,
00:02:54 gives someone we don’t expect a privilege.
00:02:57 Think about it for a few moments.
00:03:00 When you first came here, we know and remember your introductions,
00:03:05 and quite a number of you made the comment:
00:03:07 “When we received that invitation to Gilead, we were shocked!
00:03:11 “We were humbled.
00:03:13 “We were amazed, numb all over,
00:03:17 thinking why we were selected.”
00:03:19 And maybe some of the people in your congregation and branch
00:03:22 were also saying, “Why were they accepted?”
00:03:25 You see, maybe that was an unexpected invitation.
00:03:30 But now, here you are about to graduate.
00:03:33 But it’s good to remember that sometimes others are surprised
00:03:38 about privileges that we’re given.
00:03:41 So, what can help us to accept the unexpected
00:03:45 when it comes to others getting privileges?
00:03:48 Well, let’s look at two principles in the Scriptures.
00:03:51 The first one is at Ecclesiastes 6:9,
00:03:57 Ecclesiastes 6:9:
00:04:02 “Better to enjoy what the eyes see
00:04:05 “than to wander after one’s desires.
00:04:09 This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.”
00:04:13 So, in other words, be satisfied with the privileges you do have.
00:04:18 Don’t be looking for other privileges,
00:04:23 just not satisfied with what you’ve already been given.
00:04:26 Treasure the privileges you already have.
00:04:29 Included in that is the privilege
00:04:31 of coming here to Gilead and being trained.
00:04:34 Now, the second principle we’d like to highlight
00:04:37 is found in the book of Psalms,
00:04:40 Psalm 119:31, 32:
00:04:47 “I cling to your reminders.
00:04:50 “O Jehovah, do not let me be disappointed.
00:04:54 “I will eagerly pursue the way of your commandments
00:04:57 because you make room for it in my heart.”
00:05:01 What’s the point?
00:05:03 Don’t be disappointed.
00:05:05 Trust in Jehovah.
00:05:07 Trust in his arrangement.
00:05:09 It could be that Jehovah is saying to you:
00:05:14 ‘Look, you’ve already had enough privileges.
00:05:17 ‘You went to Gilead, remember?
00:05:19 ‘Now be happy that I’m letting someone else
00:05:23 have an unexpected privilege.’
00:05:26 Well, that can be a test.
00:05:28 Another thing that will help us in a situation like that
00:05:32 is to remember many of the accounts in the Scriptures.
00:05:35 And one of those we like to refer to briefly
00:05:39 is that of David killing Goliath.
00:05:42 Let’s think for a few moments.
00:05:45 If you were an Israelite soldier
00:05:48 just before David offered himself to do this assignment,
00:05:52 who would you have expected
00:05:55 to take down this giant, Goliath?
00:05:58 Well, probably, first of all, you would have thought about King Saul
00:06:03 because, after all, he was head and shoulders taller
00:06:06 than the average person and he was a man experienced in warfare.
00:06:11 So you might have expected,
00:06:13 ‘I think King Saul is the one who will take this on.’
00:06:16 Or maybe if you weren’t thinking of King Saul,
00:06:20 you might be thinking of his son Jonathan.
00:06:22 Why?
00:06:24 Well, remember Jonathan was a national hero by this time.
00:06:28 There was the case there at Michmash,
00:06:31 where he and his attendant climbed up
00:06:33 and boldly and bravely appeared before the Philistines.
00:06:38 They killed about 20 of them, and that was the turning point in the battle.
00:06:43 So if anyone is going to take on Goliath, probably you would expect
00:06:48 that Jonathan would be able to do that.
00:06:50 Now, let’s just assume that you were thinking,
00:06:54 ‘Maybe the best way to do this would be with a sling and a stone.’
00:06:59 So now, who would you expect to actually do this?
00:07:04 Probably Saul and Jonathan.
00:07:08 Why?
00:07:09 They were from the tribe of Benjamin.
00:07:12 And what do you remember about the people from Benjamin?
00:07:15 They were experts with using the sling.
00:07:18 In fact, we’re told they could sling a stone
00:07:21 to a hairbreadth and would not miss.
00:07:24 And in fact, at 1 Chronicles 12:2,
00:07:27 it says that the brothers of Saul were experts with the sling.
00:07:33 So not knowing what Jehovah was going to do,
00:07:36 probably each one of us, if we were there back then,
00:07:39 would have thought that surely it would be King Saul or maybe Jonathan.
00:07:43 They were the most qualified.
00:07:46 But why wouldn’t you have expected David?
00:07:49 Well, for a start, David was just a boy.
00:07:52 He wasn’t a soldier.
00:07:53 He didn’t have experience in warfare.
00:07:56 Yes, he’d killed a lion and a bear,
00:07:58 but he really didn’t know about fighting people in a war.
00:08:03 Second, he wasn’t impressive in appearance.
00:08:07 In fact, Goliath was shocked
00:08:09 when he saw this young man coming toward him.
00:08:12 And third, he wasn’t from the tribe of Benjamin.
00:08:17 You see, he wasn’t one of these famous persons who could use the sling.
00:08:21 The Watchtower made the comment
00:08:23 that perhaps because David lived near where the tribe of Benjamin was,
00:08:28 maybe that’s where he learned how to use the sling.
00:08:31 But the bottom line is
00:08:33 none of us would have expected
00:08:35 that this young man David would have been used.
00:08:38 It was an unexpected event.
00:08:42 But now, let’s think for a moment about how others reacted.
00:08:47 How did King Saul react?
00:08:49 Well, initially, King Saul was very happy
00:08:53 with the fact that David killed Goliath.
00:08:56 But what happened later?
00:08:58 That turned into jealousy —didn’t it?—
00:09:00 even into a murderous desire to kill David.
00:09:05 But, on the other hand, what about Jonathan?
00:09:08 You see, Jonathan perhaps could have been jealous, but he wasn’t.
00:09:13 He built a strong relationship and friendship with David.
00:09:17 So, what can we learn from this account?
00:09:21 You see, if you come across someone
00:09:24 who gets that ideal privilege
00:09:27 —that assignment that you always secretly have wanted
00:09:31 and that you actually modestly think you deserve—
00:09:35 what will you be?
00:09:38 a Saul or a Jonathan?
00:09:42 Yes, brothers and sisters,
00:09:45 let’s always remember that Jehovah does the unexpected,
00:09:48 and sometimes the unexpected is giving someone else you don’t expect
00:09:53 a certain privilege.
00:09:55 Don’t stand in the way of Jehovah
00:09:58 when he uses someone else to glorify his name.
00:10:01 Yes, rejoice in the fact that others are used,
00:10:05 just like you are being used, in an unexpected way.

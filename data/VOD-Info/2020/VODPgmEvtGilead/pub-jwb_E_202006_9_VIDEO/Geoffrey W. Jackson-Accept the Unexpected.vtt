00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:05.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Expect the unexpected.

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the unexpected
has arrived, hasn’t it?

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:13.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of us expected
that this graduation program

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would need to be modified
and changed as it is.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, what have you had to do?

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve had to accept the unexpected.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not much you can do.

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d like to commend you students,

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:32.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon-to-be graduates of this class of Gilead,

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:34.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you have accepted these changes

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a fine, positive attitude.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does highlight to us
—doesn’t it?—

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sometimes it can be disappointing

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when unexpected things occur.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now soon, you’ll be going
to your assignments,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether back home or to a new assignment.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, no doubt, you are going to face

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some unexpected things as well.

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d just like to discuss
one aspect of this theme.

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles

00:01:04.848 --> 00:01:08.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 10,

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 10:7,

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here it describes something
that is unexpected:

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have seen servants on horseback

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but princes walking
on foot just like servants.”

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you wouldn’t expect
to see that, would you?

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how are you going to see that?

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:38.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i>
made a very interesting comment

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this verse that said:

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who have great ability

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not always receive the recognition.

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:50.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And those with less ability

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:53.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes receive more honor.”

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you arrive back full of enthusiasm

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’ve enjoyed your Gilead training,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt you’re thinking:

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m a different person. I’ve changed.’

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we hope you have.

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you might expect

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:15.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there will be
certain privileges granted to you.

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, at the same time,

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may see that someone you don’t expect

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is given those privileges.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may even come up
to you and say: “I’m so surprised!

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:31.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m shocked they’ve given me this privilege!”

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And outwardly you say, “Hmm,”

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:36.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inwardly you’re saying: “I’m shocked too,

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because I’m the one
who is trained at Gilead.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely I should get this privilege.”

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you think about it,

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:48.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember that Jehovah is the one

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is backing the work, and at times,

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he does the unexpected and, in this case,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives someone we don’t expect a privilege.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it for a few moments.

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you first came here,
we know and remember your introductions,

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quite a number of you made the comment:

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When we received that invitation
to Gilead, we were shocked!

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were humbled.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were amazed, numb all over,

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking why we were selected.”

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe some of the people
in your congregation and branch

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:25.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were also saying,
“Why were they accepted?”

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, maybe
that was an unexpected invitation.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here you are about to graduate.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s good to remember
that sometimes others are surprised

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about privileges that we’re given.

00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us to accept the unexpected

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to others getting privileges?

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at two principles
in the Scriptures.

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is at Ecclesiastes 6:9,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 6:9:

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Better to enjoy what the eyes see

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than to wander after one’s desires.

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This too is futility,
a chasing after the wind.”

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:18.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in other words, be satisfied
with the privileges you do have.

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be looking for other privileges,

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:26.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just not satisfied
with what you’ve already been given.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:29.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treasure the privileges you already have.

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Included in that is the privilege

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:34.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of coming here to Gilead and being trained.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:37.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second principle
we’d like to highlight

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in the book of Psalms,

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:45.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 119:31, 32:

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to your reminders.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, do not let me be disappointed.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will eagerly pursue the way
of your commandments

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you make room for it in my heart.”

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be disappointed.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in his arrangement.

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:14.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be that Jehovah is saying to you:

00:05:14.063 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Look, you’ve already had enough privileges.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You went to Gilead, remember?

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now be happy that I’m letting someone else

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have an unexpected privilege.’

00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:28.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that can be a test.

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:32.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing that will help us
in a situation like that

00:05:32.482 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to remember many
of the accounts in the Scriptures.

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of those we like to refer to briefly

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of David killing Goliath.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think for a few moments.

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:48.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were an Israelite soldier

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before David offered himself
to do this assignment,

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would you have expected

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:58.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take down this giant, Goliath?

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably, first of all,
you would have thought about King Saul

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, after all,
he was head and shoulders taller

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:11.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the average person
and he was a man experienced in warfare.

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might have expected,

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I think King Saul is the one
who will take this on.’

00:06:16.826 --> 00:06:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe if you
weren’t thinking of King Saul,

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might be thinking of his son Jonathan.

00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:24.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember Jonathan
was a national hero by this time.

00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:31.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was the case there at Michmash,

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he and his attendant climbed up

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and boldly and bravely
appeared before the Philistines.

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They killed about 20 of them,
and that was the turning point in the battle.

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:48.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if anyone is going to take on Goliath,
probably you would expect

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jonathan would be able to do that.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s just assume
that you were thinking,

00:06:54.964 --> 00:06:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe the best way to do this
would be with a sling and a stone.’

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, who would you expect
to actually do this?

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:08.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably Saul and Jonathan.

00:07:08.744 --> 00:07:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:15.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do you remember
about the people from Benjamin?

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:18.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were experts with using the sling.

00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:21.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we’re told they could sling a stone

00:07:21.757 --> 00:07:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a hairbreadth and would not miss.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, at 1 Chronicles 12:2,

00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:33.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that the brothers of Saul
were experts with the sling.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not knowing what Jehovah was going to do,

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably each one of us,
if we were there back then,

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:43.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have thought that surely
it would be King Saul or maybe Jonathan.

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the most qualified.

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:49.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why wouldn’t you have expected David?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, David was just a boy.

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t a soldier.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have experience in warfare.

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he’d killed a lion and a bear,

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he really didn’t know
about fighting people in a war.

00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:07.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, he wasn’t impressive in appearance.

00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Goliath was shocked

00:08:09.038 --> 00:08:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he saw this young man
coming toward him.

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:17.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, he wasn’t
from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he wasn’t one of these
famous persons who could use the sling. 

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i> made the comment

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps because David lived near
where the tribe of Benjamin was,

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe that’s where he learned
how to use the sling.

00:08:31.394 --> 00:08:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the bottom line is

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of us would have expected

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this young man David
would have been used.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:42.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an unexpected event.

00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:47.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s think for a moment
about how others reacted.

00:08:47.243 --> 00:08:49.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did King Saul react?

00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially, King Saul was very happy

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:56.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the fact that David killed Goliath.

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened later?

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That turned into jealousy
—didn’t it?—

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even into a murderous desire to kill David.

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, on the other hand, what about Jonathan?

00:09:08.531 --> 00:09:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jonathan perhaps
could have been jealous, but he wasn’t.

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:17.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built a strong relationship
and friendship with David.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we learn from this account?

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:24.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, if you come across someone

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gets that ideal privilege

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that assignment
that you always secretly have wanted

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:35.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you
actually modestly think you deserve—

00:09:35.758 --> 00:09:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will you be?

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:42.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Saul or a Jonathan?

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, brothers and sisters,

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s always remember
that Jehovah does the unexpected,

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes the unexpected is
giving someone else you don’t expect

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:55.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certain privilege.

00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t stand in the way of Jehovah

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he uses someone else
to glorify his name.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, rejoice in the fact
that others are used,

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:09.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you are being used,
in an unexpected way.

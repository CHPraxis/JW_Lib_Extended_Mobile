00:00:01 Before coming to Gilead,
00:00:03 all of you students enjoyed many privileges of service.
00:00:08 Maybe you served as a regular pioneer,
00:00:11 as a special pioneer, as a construction worker,
00:00:14 or as a field missionary.
00:00:16 You may have served in the circuit work or at Bethel,
00:00:20 and now you’ve enjoyed the additional privilege
00:00:23 of having five months of intensive training
00:00:26 here at Gilead School.
00:00:28 And no doubt all of you have appreciated
00:00:32 the fine direction you’ve received.
00:00:35 Proverbs 28:20 says
00:00:38 that “a faithful man will receive many blessings.”
00:00:42 And no doubt all of you students
00:00:44 feel richly blessed here on your graduation day.
00:00:50 We’re very happy for you,
00:00:52 and we’re certainly confident that there are many more blessings
00:00:55 and privileges that await you as you go on to your assignments.
00:01:00 But before you go,
00:01:02 I’d just like to ask one question:
00:01:05 Do privileges make you privileged?
00:01:09 We ask this question because the answer will help you
00:01:13 to have a proper view of your Gilead training
00:01:16 and also whatever privileges you may receive
00:01:19 as you go on to your assignment.
00:01:21 And the answer will also help all of us
00:01:24 to show modesty and humility
00:01:27 in whatever assignment Jehovah sees fit to give us.
00:01:31 So do privileges make us privileged?
00:01:36 The simple answer is no.
00:01:38 But in some languages,
00:01:40 the word “privilege” can carry the wrong idea.
00:01:43 For example, in English,
00:01:46 “privilege” carries the meaning of entitlement.
00:01:50 We may speak of a privileged class
00:01:52 —people who because of their birth or because of their wealth
00:01:56 have a higher place in society than others.
00:02:00 A privilege that we receive in Jehovah’s organization
00:02:04 could even be misunderstood
00:02:07 as something given to us because we’re special
00:02:10 or even better than others.
00:02:14 The possibility of misunderstanding
00:02:17 what is meant by the word “privilege”
00:02:19 is even more pronounced in other languages.
00:02:22 For example, in Japanese, for many years,
00:02:26 we used the word tokken to translate the word “privilege.”
00:02:31 And if you look in the dictionary, that’s the word that you should use.
00:02:35 But many of us in the Japanese field
00:02:38 felt a little bit uncomfortable using tokken
00:02:41 because that word is formed by combining two Chinese characters:
00:02:46 toku  means “special,”
00:02:49 and ken  means “right.”
00:02:53 So literally that would mean
00:02:56 you have a special right to attend Gilead School.
00:02:59 I have a special right to serve at Bethel.
00:03:04 But we know that is not the case.
00:03:08 So you can imagine our delight
00:03:11 when we received study article 35
00:03:15 in the September 2019 issue of The Watchtower.
00:03:18 It was entitled “Jehovah Values His Humble Servants.”
00:03:22 And in a section that was discussing the need
00:03:25 for humility when others receive privileges of service,
00:03:30 the Japanese translators applied the principle
00:03:34 of meaning-based translation.
00:03:37 Instead of using the dictionary meaning
00:03:40 and calling the privileges special rights,
00:03:43 they call them hoshinokikai
00:03:47 —opportunities to serve.
00:03:50 We were elated.
00:03:52 Privileges are not given as a special right.
00:03:56 Rather, they give us additional opportunities
00:03:59 to be of service to Jehovah and to our brothers.
00:04:04 So does that mean we should stop using the word “privilege”?
00:04:07 Not necessarily.
00:04:09 But we do need to have a correct understanding
00:04:12 of its meaning in the spiritual setting.
00:04:17 One way to gain a proper understanding
00:04:19 is to examine how the word “privilege”
00:04:22 is used in the New World Translation.
00:04:24 For example, at Luke 1:43,
00:04:28 Elizabeth described a visit from Mary,
00:04:31 the mother of her Lord, as a “privilege.”
00:04:35 Now, did Elizabeth mean that she had a special right
00:04:38 to have Mary enter her home?
00:04:41 No.
00:04:43 Rather, she viewed the visit
00:04:46 as a blessing from Jehovah.
00:04:49 Acts 7:46 speaks of David
00:04:53 asking God “for the privilege of providing
00:04:56 a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.”
00:04:58 And at 2 Corinthians 8:4,
00:05:01 Paul spoke of Christians who ‘kept earnestly begging us
00:05:06 ‘for the privilege of having a share
00:05:09 in the relief ministry for the holy ones.’
00:05:12 David and Paul were not talking about any special right.
00:05:17 Rather, they were describing an opportunity
00:05:20 to work in service to Jehovah and to their brothers.
00:05:24 So let’s not be misled by the meaning
00:05:27 that the world generally attaches to the word “privilege.”
00:05:32 The direction found at Luke 17:10 will help us.
00:05:37 Please open to that verse.
00:05:39 And whenever we receive a privilege,
00:05:42 or an opportunity to serve,
00:05:45 let’s remember these words
00:05:48 and this counsel of Jesus
00:05:51 —Luke 17:10.
00:05:55 He said: “Likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you,
00:06:00 “say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves.
00:06:03 What we have done is what we ought to have done.’”
00:06:07 Now, of course, this doesn’t mean
00:06:09 that we should view ourselves as useless, or worthless.
00:06:14 A note in the Study Bible  explains that ‘according to the context,
00:06:18 ‘“good-for-nothing” conveys the idea
00:06:21 ‘that the slave would view himself modestly,
00:06:25 not as deserving of some special credit or praise.’
00:06:30 And that is how we view ourselves
00:06:33 when we receive privileges of service.
00:06:37 Now let’s consider another aspect of privileges.
00:06:40 The English dictionary defines privilege
00:06:43 as “a right attached specifically
00:06:46 to a position or office.”
00:06:49 However, not all privileges of service
00:06:53 involve a specific assignment or a position.
00:06:58 The number of positions in Jehovah’s organization is limited.
00:07:03 The opportunities to serve are endless.
00:07:08 Please open to Matthew chapter 20;
00:07:11 we’ll read verses 25 to 27
00:07:15 because here Jesus clarified the importance
00:07:18 of serving over position.
00:07:21 Now, Brother Lett already explained the setting:
00:07:23 It’s when the mother of James and John
00:07:25 asked Jesus to give her sons special positions in the Kingdom.
00:07:30 In verses 25 to 27,
00:07:34 this is what Jesus said:
00:07:37 “But Jesus called them to him and said:
00:07:40 “‘You know that the rulers of the nations
00:07:43 “‘lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them.
00:07:47 “‘This must not be the way among you;
00:07:50 “‘but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister,
00:07:54 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.’”
00:07:59 Yes, instead of seeking a high position of authority,
00:08:03 Christians reach out to minister to the needs of others
00:08:08 —to serve as humble slaves.
00:08:12 Interestingly, 1 Timothy 3:1
00:08:16 used to describe a man
00:08:18 who “is reaching out for an office of overseer.”
00:08:22 But the revised edition of The New World Translation  reads:
00:08:26 “If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,
00:08:31 he is desirous of a fine work.”
00:08:34 This puts the emphasis not on the office or position
00:08:38 but on the qualifications that are needed by one
00:08:41 who exerts himself to be of service to others.
00:08:46 There are many opportunities of service
00:08:49 that do not involve a special appointment or position.
00:08:53 Think of Bible examples of hardworking Christian men and women.
00:08:59 Dorcas “abounded
00:09:01 in good deeds and gifts of mercy”;
00:09:04 Joanna, Susanna, and many other women
00:09:07 ministered to Jesus from their belongings;
00:09:10 and while Paul was in prison,
00:09:13 Tychicus served as his personal messenger;
00:09:16 Mark helped Paul in practical ways,
00:09:19 perhaps delivering food to him.
00:09:21 So as you go on to your assignment,
00:09:23 remember,
00:09:25 privileges do not make you privileged
00:09:30 and whether your privileges come with an official assignment or not,
00:09:34 humbly carry them out
00:09:36 as opportunities to “slave for Jehovah”
00:09:39 and to serve our brothers more fully.

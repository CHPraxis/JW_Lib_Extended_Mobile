00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before coming to Gilead,

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of you students enjoyed
many privileges of service.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you served as a regular pioneer,

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:14.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer,
as a construction worker,

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:16.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as a field missionary.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have served
in the circuit work or at Bethel,

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now you’ve enjoyed
the additional privilege

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of having five months of intensive training

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at Gilead School.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt all of you have appreciated

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fine direction you’ve received.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 28:20 says

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a faithful man
will receive many blessings.”

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt all of you students

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel richly blessed here
on your graduation day.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy for you,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re certainly confident
that there are many more blessings

00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and privileges that await you
as you go on to your assignments.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before you go,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d just like to ask one question:

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do privileges make you privileged?

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask this question
because the answer will help you

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:16.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a proper view of your Gilead training

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:19.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also whatever privileges you may receive

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you go on to your assignment.

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer will also help all of us

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show modesty and humility

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever assignment
Jehovah sees fit to give us.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do privileges make us privileged?

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer is no.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in some languages,

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word “privilege”
can carry the wrong idea.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in English,

00:01:46.122 --> 00:01:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“privilege” carries the meaning
of entitlement.

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may speak of a privileged class

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who because of their birth
or because of their wealth

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a higher place in society than others.

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:04.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A privilege that we receive
in Jehovah’s organization

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could even be misunderstood

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as something given to us
because we’re special

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:14.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even better than others.

00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The possibility of misunderstanding

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is meant by the word “privilege”

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:22.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is even more pronounced in other languages.

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in Japanese, for many years,

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we used the word <i>tokken</i>
to translate the word “privilege.”

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look in the dictionary,
that’s the word that you should use.

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many of us in the Japanese field

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt a little bit uncomfortable using <i>tokken</i>

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that word is formed
by combining two Chinese characters:

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:49.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>toku</i>  means “special,”

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>ken</i>  means “right.”

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So literally that would mean

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:59.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a special right
to attend Gilead School.

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a special right to serve at Bethel.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that is not the case.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can imagine our delight

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:15.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we received study article 35

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the September 2019 issue
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was entitled
“Jehovah Values His Humble Servants.”

00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in a section that was discussing the need

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for humility when others
receive privileges of service,

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Japanese translators
applied the principle

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of meaning-based translation.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of using the dictionary meaning

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:43.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and calling the privileges special rights,

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they call them <i>hoshinokikai</i>

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—opportunities to serve.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were elated.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Privileges are not given as a special right.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they give us additional opportunities

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:04.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be of service
to Jehovah and to our brothers.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So does that mean
we should stop using the word “privilege”?

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do need
to have a correct understanding

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of its meaning in the spiritual setting.

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way to gain a proper understanding

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to examine how the word “privilege”

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is used in the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Luke 1:43,

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:31.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth described a visit from Mary,

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:35.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother of her Lord, as a “privilege.”

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:38.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Elizabeth mean
that she had a special right

00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have Mary enter her home?

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, she viewed the visit

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a blessing from Jehovah.

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 7:46 speaks of David

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking God “for the privilege of providing

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.”

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:01.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at 2 Corinthians 8:4,

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:06.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul spoke of Christians
who ‘kept earnestly begging us

00:05:06.456 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for the privilege of having a share

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:12.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the relief ministry for the holy ones.’

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David and Paul were not talking
about any special right.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they were describing an opportunity

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:24.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work in service to Jehovah
and to their brothers.

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s not be misled by the meaning

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:32.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the world generally attaches
to the word “privilege.”

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The direction found
at Luke 17:10 will help us.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to that verse.

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever we receive a privilege,

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an opportunity to serve,

00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s remember these words

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this counsel of Jesus

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 17:10.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Likewise, when you
have done all the things assigned to you,

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we have done
is what we ought to have done.’”

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, this doesn’t mean

00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should view ourselves
as useless, or worthless.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A note in the <i>Study Bible</i>  explains
that ‘according to the context,

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“good-for-nothing” conveys the idea

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that the slave would view himself modestly,

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:30.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as deserving
of some special credit or praise.’

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how we view ourselves

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we receive privileges of service.

00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
another aspect of privileges.

00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:43.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English dictionary defines privilege

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:46.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a right attached specifically

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a position or office.”

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:53.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, not all privileges of service

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involve a specific assignment or a position.

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number of positions
in Jehovah’s organization is limited.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opportunities to serve are endless.

00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:11.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Matthew chapter 20;

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:15.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll read verses 25 to 27

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here Jesus clarified the importance

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving over position.

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Lett
already explained the setting:

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s when the mother of James and John

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked Jesus to give her sons
special positions in the Kingdom.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 25 to 27,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what Jesus said:

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jesus called them to him and said:

00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:43.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You know that the rulers of the nations

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘lord it over them and the great men
wield authority over them.

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:50.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This must not be the way among you;

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but whoever wants to become great
among you must be your minister,

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:59.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever wants to be first among you
must be your slave.’”

00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, instead of seeking
a high position of authority,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians reach out to minister
to the needs of others

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to serve as humble slaves.

00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, 1 Timothy 3:1

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used to describe a man

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “is reaching out
for an office of overseer.”

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the revised edition
of <i>The New World Translation</i>  reads:

00:08:26.722 --> 00:08:31.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is desirous of a fine work.”

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This puts the emphasis
not on the office or position

00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on the qualifications
that are needed by one

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:46.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who exerts himself
to be of service to others.

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many opportunities of service

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:53.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that do not involve
a special appointment or position.

00:08:53.716 --> 00:08:58.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Bible examples
of hardworking Christian men and women.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dorcas “abounded

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in good deeds and gifts of mercy”;

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joanna, Susanna, and many other women

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ministered to Jesus from their belongings;

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and while Paul was in prison,

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tychicus served as his personal messenger;

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark helped Paul in practical ways,

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:21.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps delivering food to him.

00:09:21.677 --> 00:09:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you go on to your assignment,

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:25.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember,

00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
privileges do not make you privileged

00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whether your privileges come
with an official assignment or not,

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:36.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbly carry them out

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as opportunities to “slave for Jehovah”

00:09:39.595 --> 00:09:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to serve our brothers more fully.

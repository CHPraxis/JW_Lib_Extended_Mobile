00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:06.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
we’re moving to a part of our program

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:09.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve truly grown to love.

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entitled <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Trent Lippold will be our host.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s give Brother Lippold
our attention as he presents this:

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to another edition
of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re going to meet
four guests from three continents,

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
representing the 148th class of Gilead.

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to hear stories of isolation,

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a remarkable gift, and obedience.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:11.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In each case,
we will see different faces of integrity.

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Curious?

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s meet our first guests then,

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Salvador and Isabel Domingos from Angola.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Isabel.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:25.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:27.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Salvador, welcome.

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, again, welcome.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re both from Angola,
serving in the branch.

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Isabel,
what is your assignment in the branch?

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work in the Translation Department.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do composition
for one of our vernacular languages.

00:01:43.953 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, which language is it?

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work with the Chokwe language.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chokwe?

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right.
How do you say <i>“Watchtower” </i> in Chokwe?

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Kaposhi wa Kutalila.</i>

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, Brother Lippold,

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t need to learn
the language to do composition

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s a technical process.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you for learning
to say <i>“The Watchtower”</i>  anyway.

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Salvador,
what is your assignment?

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work in the Service Department
with the Preaching Needs Desk,

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also give support to the branch office.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, the Preaching Needs Desk in Angola
—what’s the preaching like in Angola?

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,
the preaching work in Angola is wonderful.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have been seeing
the fulfillment of Haggai 2:7.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is “shaking the nation.”

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people are coming into the truth.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since people
respond well to the good news,

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:35.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we usually say that Angola is a paradise

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all publishers
but especially for pioneers.

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:40.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so He’s “shaking” Angola.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how many are coming in in Angola?

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, right now we have

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 165,000 publishers

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more than 720,000 Bible studies.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven hundred
and twenty thousand Bible studies?

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, more than that.

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than?

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is absolutely amazing!

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:03.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isabel, with the kind of growth
that you have in Angola,

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what touches your heart about this?

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:14.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What touches me most is seeing
young ones come into the truth

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—young ones who are
at seven, eight, nine, ten years old.

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They start studying the Bible.

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They start going to the meetings,

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of them without their parents,

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they make progress in the truth.

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They start preaching with the congregation.

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:32.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get baptized.

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of them,
they start working as auxiliary pioneers.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is something amazing to see.

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really touches my heart.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful, yeah.

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:45.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Salvador, for you,
when you look at the growth,

00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how does it affect you?

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:49.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What touches you?

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how Jehovah has been blessing

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work in our branch territory,
it’s something amazing.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, I remember when I was invited

00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:02.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first time to attend a meeting.

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meeting was held in a brother’s home,

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we used a bedroom

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a place to hold the meeting
because we were under ban.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometime later,
since more people were coming,

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we needed to move
from that bedroom in the same house

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the dining room.

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some months later,

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with more people coming

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(there was a little bit more freedom),

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we needed to move
from that dining room to the courtyard.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Same house?

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:36.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same house.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:37.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from that time on,
many congregations in Angola

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started using courtyards of brothers’ homes

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold meetings.

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the situation
is completely different.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So seeing the transition

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:55.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the courtyard of a brother’s home

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a nice Kingdom Hall

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
built with the help of Jehovah’s organization

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is something that touched my heart

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:06.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—seeing how Jehovah takes care

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his people
by means of his organization.

00:05:09.092 --> 00:05:10.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the situation like
with Kingdom Halls in Angola?

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, right now
we have many congregations

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are sharing one Kingdom Hall.

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
in one Kingdom Hall with one auditorium

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are 10, 11, 13.

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even right now,
we received information about a Kingdom Hall

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there are 14 congregations using it.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have a huge need
for more Kingdom Halls in Angola.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say that’s one
of the biggest needs right now in Angola?

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, since many people
are coming into the truth,

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:49.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic facilities
are a big need in Angola.

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need space in Bethel;
we need more Assembly Halls;

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need a facility for SKE,

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially Kingdom Halls.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, yes.

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have a video that shows

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the big need for Kingdom Halls
that we have in Angola.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will enjoy seeing this video.

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:07.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, excellent. Let’s watch it.

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:16.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the southwest coast of Africa
sits Angola

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—home to lush jungle hillsides,

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vast desert plains,

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tropical Atlantic beaches.

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even more beautiful
is the love that the people of Angola

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrate for Bible truths.

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The growth rate of Kingdom proclaimers

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has vastly outpaced
Kingdom Hall construction,

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:45.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some Kingdom Halls hosting
as many as 14 congregations.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the coordination challenges
this creates for the publishers

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the bodies of elders.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accommodate all the weekend meetings
that must take place,

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some begin at 6:30 in the morning

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they continue to be held all day long.

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For midweek meetings,
some congregations

00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must start early in the afternoon.

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supporting these schedules

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could potentially jeopardize
our brothers’ employment.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, they prayerfully negotiate
with their employers to get off work

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one or two hours early
on meeting days.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The later meetings that follow
can last well into the night.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders cooperate

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that everyone can get the best.

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They decide that the congregation

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:41.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stays far from the Kingdom Hall

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has priority to choose
the right time for them,

00:07:45.615 --> 00:07:49.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can feel comfortable
because of the distance.

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the Kingdom Hall is full,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation spills outside the building,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forming lines at the windows.

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:03.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all cases,
our dear brothers and sisters

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly put the needs and welfare of others
ahead of their own.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the building in constant use,

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when do the congregations schedule time
for maintenance and cleaning?

00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:17.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes careful coordination

00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of the Kingdom Hall Maintenance Committee

00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ensure that the building stays

00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clean, safe,

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very comfortable.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Angola

00:08:31.894 --> 00:08:35.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are “aglow with the spirit” and cooperate 

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together in beautiful ways,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing a witness to all onlookers

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:45.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is
a God of order and peace.

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:53.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
I mean, that was very, very interesting.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look at the flexibility
and the cooperation

00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the brothers and sisters in Angola
with the Kingdom Hall,

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will appreciate whatever meeting time
our congregation is assigned.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just so beautiful to see the spirit

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of preaching in Angola.

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers “step over”
into unassigned territories,

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others go to seldom-worked territory

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help congregations with fewer publishers.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why, for example, Brother Lippold,

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
last service year

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:27.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had 20 new circuits

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—last service year.

00:09:29.018 --> 00:09:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty.

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:30.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This service year, from September until now,
we have already . . .

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should I hold on?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . we have already 97 new congregations.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ninety-seven?

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s almost a hundred new congregations
in just a few months.

00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a tremendous, tremendous spirit,

00:09:50.806 --> 00:09:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to see the obedience of the brothers
and sisters in Angola for preaching.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example for all of us!

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:59.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you both for being here
and sharing these experiences with us

00:09:59.882 --> 00:10:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the spirit of the brothers
and sisters in Angola.

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:02.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:02.785 --> 00:10:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s introduce our next guest.

00:10:09.492 --> 00:10:12.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Brother Ho Chong from Korea.

00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Ho.

00:10:20.002 --> 00:10:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to have you on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:10:22.972 --> 00:10:24.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:10:24.974 --> 00:10:27.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Brother Chong,
you are serving in the Korea branch.

00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:29.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is your assignment?

00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work with the Legal Department.

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:34.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And last year,
our branch renovated

00:10:34.183 --> 00:10:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the historical museum of our branch,

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had the privilege
to participate in the project

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially working with the “Integrity”
section of the historical museum—

00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:47.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with two other brothers.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had very encouraging experiences.

00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:51.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Integrity, Korea

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we think of young brothers
and conscientious objection.

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:59.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that what the “Integrity” part
of the museum is about?

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:00.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To renovate the section,

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters
were invited to donate

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:09.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaningful historical artifacts.

00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:12.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we received a lot
of valuable items from them.

00:11:12.388 --> 00:11:15.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them was very, very special to us.

00:11:15.624 --> 00:11:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a photograph

00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we received
from a special pioneer brother.

00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:23.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the photo.

00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very interesting.

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:26.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lippold, what do you think?

00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is this picture, and where was it taken?

00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it obviously looks like at a military
—some kind of military place.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looks like a young brother.

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s being offered a uniform,

00:11:41.484 --> 00:11:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is him refusing
the military uniform.

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s right.
It was in a military camp.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not a reenactment;
it is a real situation.

00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers in Korea were forcefully taken
to the military camp for enlistment,

00:11:55.998 --> 00:12:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes from home
and sometimes even from the Kingdom Halls.

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we can see in this picture,

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were forced
to take arms to be a soldier.

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is not—

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has not been brought from court
or anything like that.

00:12:09.912 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right on the spot
he has to take his stand for Jehovah.

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that’s right.

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:19.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you said that a special pioneer
sent the photograph.

00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he get the photo?

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, this photo was taken in 1988

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a military police investigator.

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to use this photo as evidence

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to charge this brother.

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:38.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was so touched by his firm standing,

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he kept this photo for almost 20 years.

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:44.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2007,

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:48.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the special pioneer visited him
during the house-to-house ministry.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave this photo to him,
even recalling the name of the brother,

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:56.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said,
“Please give this back to him.”

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:57.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:02.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you received the photograph
(you and the other two brothers),

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you saw it for the first time,

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you think?

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:11.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all just agreed that it is a gift.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a special gift from Jehovah.

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without him, it is impossible.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:19.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just the existence
of this photo is impossible,

00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has been kept for almost 20 years.

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:26.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then through the special pioneer,
we have it.

00:13:26.522 --> 00:13:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s also impossible.

00:13:28.858 --> 00:13:31.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did you feel so strongly
that it’s impossible?

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t take this picture.

00:13:34.363 --> 00:13:37.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The investigator took it, and he kept it.

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we have it.

00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:42.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the timing is also very important

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s
after the two monumental decisions

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the highest courts,

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then
all the imprisoned brothers were released,

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we now have this photo.

00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:56.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was just last year in 2019?

00:13:56.685 --> 00:13:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we thought
that Jehovah was commending

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the brothers who did their best,

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their Bible-trained conscience,

00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their integrity.

00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah was saying:

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still remember your integrity.
Thank you so much.”

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt that way.

00:14:15.905 --> 00:14:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very powerful.

00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can feel that also.

00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you able to find the brother?

00:14:22.478 --> 00:14:24.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we did.

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is now serving as an elder.

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has three children.

00:14:29.151 --> 00:14:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never expected
that he would see this picture.

00:14:34.156 --> 00:14:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that it was taken.

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:39.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew the photograph was taken?

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:43.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he remembered the investigator

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was favorable to him,

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:49.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he relayed
one encouraging story about him.

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The investigator, for his work,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the convention in 1988.

00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:56.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our convention?

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, for his work.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:01.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he received a book.

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the book,

00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:04.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Revelation</i>  book?

00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1988.

00:15:05.054 --> 00:15:08.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and he gave this book to this brother.

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:09.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the camp?

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:10.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:15:10.392 --> 00:15:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said:

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe here you may be relaxed.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe in prison it is more severe.

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just enjoy this book.”

00:15:19.301 --> 00:15:20.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is unbelievable.

00:15:20.235 --> 00:15:24.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
So he missed the convention but . . .

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . he got the release.

00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:27.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:15:27.076 --> 00:15:28.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s quite a story.

00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened when the photo was shown?

00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:32.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the response of his children?

00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:36.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all surprised at this.

00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:38.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The eldest son was surprised

00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because his father
was always happy and smiling,

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was so serious in this picture.

00:15:45.327 --> 00:15:47.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was able to understand

00:15:47.663 --> 00:15:52.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how determined his father was
in order to keep his integrity

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:55.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the second son found out

00:15:55.437 --> 00:15:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his father looked very similar.

00:15:59.008 --> 00:16:01.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the two looked alike,
the younger son and the father.

00:16:01.777 --> 00:16:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
So he found himself in this photo.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all the family members

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to visualize
what it would be like in keeping integrity.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was really encouraging to all of them.

00:16:16.592 --> 00:16:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I think it’s really true

00:16:18.594 --> 00:16:21.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the younger son has said
about seeing himself in this picture

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in many ways
it is him in this picture.

00:16:25.134 --> 00:16:27.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s you in this picture,
and it’s me in this picture.

00:16:27.803 --> 00:16:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all of us

00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when we take our stand for Jehovah
and when we’re loyal to him—

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:37.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s a young person in school
not saluting the flag,

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or not participating
in a false religious holiday

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with worldly relatives,

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:47.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at work
(again not participating in things)

00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking a stand for Jehovah.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:53.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, really, Ho,
this is a gift for all of Jehovah’s people

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind us of what it means

00:16:55.164 --> 00:16:58.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show our integrity
and be loyal to Jehovah.

00:16:58.567 --> 00:17:00.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very, very much
for sharing this with us.

00:17:00.903 --> 00:17:02.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:08.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s meet our next guest.

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s from Chile, and his name is Allen Kim.

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nice to have you on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:26.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much for inviting me.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:29.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Brother Kim,
you were born in Chile and raised in Chile?

00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I was born in Chile,

00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:36.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was raised in Brazil,
and then we moved to Chile.

00:17:36.705 --> 00:17:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my parents are Korean.

00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:39.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:43.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you speak Spanish
when you came back to Chile?

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:46.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to learn Spanish, yes.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did you come back to Chile?

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about 14 years old
when I moved with my family.

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:57.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so, what was that like
—fourteen years old, you speak Portuguese

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:01.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then coming to Chile
and having to learn Spanish?

00:18:02.364 --> 00:18:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy at first

00:18:04.366 --> 00:18:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Chile is not a country

00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:11.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was used to receiving many foreigners.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:14.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just seeing our family,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an Asian-looking family,

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:20.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caught much attention in Chile.

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we were walking on the streets

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or going to a store,

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people used to look at us, point at us,

00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:32.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also talk about us.

00:18:32.127 --> 00:18:34.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had some bad experiences also.

00:18:34.296 --> 00:18:35.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as a young person,
how did that make you feel?

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:42.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a teenager,
you know that it’s not easy to receive

00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:45.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that kind of treatment in some places.

00:18:45.574 --> 00:18:48.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also added to that,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to be acquainted with their food

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s a new place, a new culture.

00:18:54.583 --> 00:18:58.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have a problem of identity

00:18:58.387 --> 00:19:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are in one country,

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have another culture,
you were raised in another culture.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it wasn’t easy to find myself—my place.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:12.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sometimes even among many people,

00:19:12.668 --> 00:19:15.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can feel a little bit isolated

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you don’t belong anywhere.

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, that’s interesting.

00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably a lot of people
(a lot of brothers and sisters even)

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can relate to what you’re saying,
sometimes feeling that way

00:19:25.948 --> 00:19:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not being sure
where you fit in for various reasons.

00:19:30.252 --> 00:19:32.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed for you?

00:19:32.454 --> 00:19:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, a big help was association
with brothers and sisters.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:42.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I especially remember
that our congregation was invited

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend a special international convention

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Chile in 2003.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was a very special moment

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was my first time

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at such a big event of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:19:57.512 --> 00:20:02.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing brothers
from all around the world.

00:20:02.017 --> 00:20:06.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one was judging you
by your looks or having differences.

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just being there and seeing
everyone happy and united

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that was a very big moment for me.

00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:18.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I could understand well
that this is really Jehovah’s organization.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the place I should be.

00:20:21.436 --> 00:20:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we have a picture here of you.

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is at the international convention?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:20:25.841 --> 00:20:28.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the same year
that we arrived to Chile,

00:20:28.443 --> 00:20:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s my family
attending at that location.

00:20:30.846 --> 00:20:33.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, very nice.
You’ve changed your hair since then.

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:34.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you found your place now
in the congregation

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:42.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things really started
to progress for you?

00:20:42.024 --> 00:20:45.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as I started to progress spiritually,

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would meet many brothers and sisters.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a big help for me.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:54.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
I remember one single brother

00:20:54.569 --> 00:20:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was from our congregation,
a Korean brother raised in Chile.

00:20:58.073 --> 00:21:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went to MTS,

00:21:00.075 --> 00:21:02.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was assigned back to our congregation

00:21:02.844 --> 00:21:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with another Chilean brother,

00:21:05.047 --> 00:21:08.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, well,
just seeing their example

00:21:08.617 --> 00:21:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later
many other brothers’ examples helped me

00:21:10.919 --> 00:21:14.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find my place in the organization.

00:21:14.222 --> 00:21:16.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the congregation,
was this a Spanish congregation you were in?

00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a Korean congregation.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so you’re in a Korean congregation,

00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:25.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you had a Chilean-Korean brother
assigned to your congregation

00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:27.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
together with a Chilean brother.

00:21:27.469 --> 00:21:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he speak Korean?

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, he was learning Korean when he arrived.

00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:31.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to learn.

00:21:31.673 --> 00:21:36.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the three of you, then,
you found that you made a good partnership.

00:21:36.144 --> 00:21:37.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:21:37.012 --> 00:21:39.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A really positive influence on you
—that’s absolutely beautiful.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re working at the branch now in Chile?

00:21:41.984 --> 00:21:46.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m working at the Chile branch
in the Service Department.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I help in the Preaching Needs Desk.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, a bit like Salvador then,
the Preaching Needs Desk

00:21:51.827 --> 00:21:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what’s the preaching like in Chile?

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:57.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many places, remote areas,

00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:01.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in the southern part of Chile,
where territories are very big.

00:22:01.603 --> 00:22:06.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So brothers have to (sometimes they have to)
travel for many hours by car.

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:11.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are even places
that they can’t reach by car,

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the congregation
has to arrange a preaching campaign

00:22:16.018 --> 00:22:19.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be days
—seven days—

00:22:19.554 --> 00:22:22.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of walking, sleeping in tents,

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:26.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes even washing
themselves in the river.

00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they try to reach those places,

00:22:28.597 --> 00:22:31.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remote places, with two to three houses.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that sounds exciting!

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:37.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first photograph you’ve brought for us,
where is this?

00:22:37.639 --> 00:22:40.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This place is called Aysén Region.

00:22:40.876 --> 00:22:45.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this place,
the brothers have to drive for many hours

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to reach a small town

00:22:47.482 --> 00:22:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where a few people live
in these remote areas.

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:52.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.
In the next photograph, where is this area?

00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:55.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is a southern part of Chile;

00:22:55.557 --> 00:22:58.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s called Araucanía Region.

00:22:58.026 --> 00:23:00.095 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And many people live there,

00:23:00.095 --> 00:23:02.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially people that speak Mapudungun.

00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:04.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also have many remote areas

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers have to walk to reach.

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:11.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, and the next photograph you have,
I mean, that’s quite appealing.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this is one of the most remote areas

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the most southern part of Chile,

00:23:17.779 --> 00:23:22.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers also arrange
to preach in those places.

00:23:22.117 --> 00:23:23.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is called Torres del Paine.

00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:24.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:23:24.453 --> 00:23:27.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing to see the efforts
that the branch is making

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach these really remote areas in Chile.

00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, brothers and sisters are working hard

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to reach a few people.

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:39.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can say
that they are doing a good work.

00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good, yeah.

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:43.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very, very remote in these places.

00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:44.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is that—?

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:46.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is in the most southern part of Chile.

00:23:46.408 --> 00:23:47.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that as far as you go?

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, this is not one
of the most remote areas.

00:23:50.712 --> 00:23:55.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have other places
that are more isolated than that area.

00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:57.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I brought a video that I want to show you.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:23:58.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to see it?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, please.

00:24:06.661 --> 00:24:10.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 2,000 miles
of open ocean separate Easter Island

00:24:11.566 --> 00:24:14.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the west coast of South America.

00:24:16.004 --> 00:24:19.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, even here on this remote island

00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:23.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with less than 8,000 inhabitants,

00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:27.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good news of God’s Kingdom
is being preached.

00:24:27.749 --> 00:24:31.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the publishers
in this seemingly isolated field

00:24:32.454 --> 00:24:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel the full support
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:24:36.424 --> 00:24:41.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Kingdom Hall and translation office
was built in 2016.

00:24:41.096 --> 00:24:43.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here five brothers and sisters

00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work to translate spiritual food

00:24:46.134 --> 00:24:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the native Polynesian language
of Rapa Nui,

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:55.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensuring that local publishers receive
the same spiritual food as their brothers 

00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sisters around the world.

00:24:59.181 --> 00:25:04.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation personnel receive benefit
from Bethel spiritual programs

00:25:04.052 --> 00:25:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being two time zones away

00:25:07.455 --> 00:25:10.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the branch office in Santiago, Chile.

00:25:10.692 --> 00:25:13.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in the middle of the ocean,

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel how Jehovah loves me

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gives me his strength.

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is taking care
of all of us on the island.

00:25:22.837 --> 00:25:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Chile branch also supports

00:25:24.873 --> 00:25:28.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kingdom publishers on Robinson Crusoe Island.

00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:31.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although much closer to the mainland,

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just over 400 miles away,

00:25:34.749 --> 00:25:37.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s more challenging to reach.

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:45.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journey involves
a flight and then a boat ride

00:25:45.227 --> 00:25:48.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the isolated airport
to the inhabited part 

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:51.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the island, which can only be traveled

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the seas aren’t too rough.

00:25:56.805 --> 00:26:00.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite these challenges,
our brothers and sisters

00:26:00.008 --> 00:26:03.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive constant and timely spiritual food,

00:26:04.012 --> 00:26:06.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
LDC support, and shepherding.

00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:12.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, Robinson Crusoe Island was home

00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:15.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to just five spiritual sisters.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the help of the LDC,
a small Kingdom Hall

00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was remodeled
and a two-room apartment was added.

00:26:22.864 --> 00:26:24.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This made it possible

00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:27.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for two single elders
to move to the island,

00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:30.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they now assist
with preaching and shepherding.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although traveling here
is not for the faint of heart,

00:26:34.843 --> 00:26:38.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this congregation of eight publishers
receives a visit

00:26:38.213 --> 00:26:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from their circuit overseer twice a year.

00:26:40.982 --> 00:26:45.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The visit lasts for two
or three weeks each time,

00:26:45.487 --> 00:26:49.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing extra spiritual support
to these faithful ones.

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:52.027 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter where you live,

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:54.029 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
if you are in the city,

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the countryside,
or even in a place like this

00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:58.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of the ocean,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with us.

00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:05.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who preach
and those who respond to the good news

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive abundant spiritual care,

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
resulting in a unified worldwide brotherhood

00:27:13.014 --> 00:27:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that praises our great God, Jehovah.

00:27:26.995 --> 00:27:30.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful, Allen,
to see the efforts that the branch is making

00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:33.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for brothers and sisters
on such remote islands.

00:27:33.968 --> 00:27:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought it was
interesting as well that,

00:27:36.171 --> 00:27:38.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for example,
on Robinson Crusoe Island,

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:41.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the circuit overseer
will stay there for two or three weeks

00:27:41.743 --> 00:27:43.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is so isolated.

00:27:43.745 --> 00:27:47.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the time he spends two weeks

00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:50.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to encourage
the brothers that are so isolated,

00:27:50.618 --> 00:27:54.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes
he even spends one additional week

00:27:54.055 --> 00:27:56.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(almost three weeks)

00:27:56.057 --> 00:27:58.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to combine with a circuit assembly.

00:27:58.159 --> 00:27:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, very nice, very nice.

00:27:59.627 --> 00:28:01.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a nice arrangement
that the branch has

00:28:01.896 --> 00:28:04.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for this particular island.

00:28:04.065 --> 00:28:04.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:06.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s another island

00:28:06.801 --> 00:28:09.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that circuit overseers
from Chile are visiting,

00:28:09.671 --> 00:28:12.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the Falkland Islands.

00:28:12.073 --> 00:28:14.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this area,
we have an arrangement

00:28:14.442 --> 00:28:16.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to send a circuit overseer

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage the brothers and sisters.

00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:20.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing, very nice.

00:28:20.882 --> 00:28:22.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you brothers in Chile,

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not afraid
of remote places, that’s for sure.

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:25.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:28:25.186 --> 00:28:27.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, these places that we just saw

00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:30.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not the most remote areas.

00:28:30.325 --> 00:28:35.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have one place
that we also reached a few years ago,

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s Antarctica,
as you can see in the photo.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re kidding me.

00:28:40.101 --> 00:28:42.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You mean the branch in Chile
has supported the work in Antarctica?

00:28:42.937 --> 00:28:43.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:28:43.638 --> 00:28:45.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I imagine it’s very difficult to get there.

00:28:45.473 --> 00:28:47.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s very hard

00:28:47.075 --> 00:28:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because first we need permission,
and we have to fly.

00:28:50.412 --> 00:28:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the branch has to make

00:28:52.414 --> 00:28:55.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some arrangements
to reach a couple in that area.

00:28:56.418 --> 00:28:57.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.
Well, thank you very much, Allen.

00:28:57.685 --> 00:29:00.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing
this information with us

00:29:00.188 --> 00:29:02.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helping us to see
that even though we’re isolated,

00:29:02.757 --> 00:29:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re not alone.

00:29:04.526 --> 00:29:07.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you really feel like Chile is your home?

00:29:07.862 --> 00:29:08.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, of course.

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:11.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see, Chile is a beautiful place

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many good brothers and sisters.

00:29:14.602 --> 00:29:19.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, it really doesn’t matter
where we are physically.

00:29:19.374 --> 00:29:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we are with Jehovah and his organization,

00:29:22.877 --> 00:29:25.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are in the great spiritual temple.

00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:26.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can feel—

00:29:26.781 --> 00:29:29.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever we are, we can feel that’s our home.

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:29.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful.

00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:31.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Allen,
for sharing that with us.

00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:43.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and unbreakable devotion
to the Person of Jehovah,

00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:47.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that his will comes first
in all of our decisions.’

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:51.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our guests today
have shown us different faces of integrity,

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like obedience and cooperation

00:29:53.942 --> 00:29:56.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in preaching and meeting together

00:29:56.277 --> 00:30:01.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintaining loyalty
when you come face-to-face with tests.

00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:03.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you feel isolated

00:30:03.885 --> 00:30:07.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are literally geographically isolated,

00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:11.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can maintain
unbreakable devotion to Jehovah.

00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:13.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The psalmist wrote:

00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:15.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I would fly away
with the wings of the dawn

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to reside by the most remote sea,

00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:21.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even there your hand would lead me

00:30:21.336 --> 00:30:23.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your right hand would take hold of me.”

00:30:23.938 --> 00:30:28.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah sees our acts of integrity,

00:30:28.376 --> 00:30:30.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he loves us for it.

Please join us on another edition
of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:31:03.545 --> 00:31:06.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would think that we have
about 500 here in the audience.

00:31:08.416 --> 00:31:13.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was again
a faith-strengthening program.

00:31:13.054 --> 00:31:15.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing, some of the experiences

00:31:15.323 --> 00:31:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things happening
in various parts of the earth.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a treat that was!

00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:06.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t the most extraordinary
among the apostles.

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he didn’t walk on water.

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t receive “the keys of the Kingdom.”

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t one of the “Sons of Thunder.”

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t see the transfiguration.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t write a Bible book.

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, all together

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s only mentioned 12 times
in the Scriptures,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s mostly
when the list of all the apostles is given.

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are we talking about?

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be Andrew.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See,
Andrew was best known

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the brother of Peter.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he was famous for primarily.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter is mentioned
some 150 times in the Scriptures.

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seems that Peter
was always in the limelight,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:01.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas Andrew
always seemed to be in the shadows.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:05.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter was extraordinary;
Andrew was ordinary.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Andrew,
most of us view ourselves

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as just ordinary.

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the valedictorian.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the greatest speaker.

00:01:18.795 --> 00:01:22.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not “Miss Congeniality.”

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just in the shadows.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that how Jehovah sees us?

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that how he saw Andrew?

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Andrew the person
for just a minute.

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:40.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles, if you would,
to John chapter 1, please,

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 1.

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:47.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you begin just following
along with me in verse 35,

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Andrew

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a disciple of John the Baptizer.

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:57.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one day
when he was with John the Baptizer

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and John said:
“See, the Lamb of God!”

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:05.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is it that Andrew did immediately?

00:02:05.842 --> 00:02:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately left following John

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow Jesus.

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t have a lot of time
for this talk,

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what is it—?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah see in Andrew at that point?

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:26.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have seen
that Andrew wanted to draw close to God

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:31.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he would be adaptable
and that he would be willing to change

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:36.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to be able to draw closer to Jehovah
and do his will.

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:40.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must have loved Andrew
for that attitude.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you follow along in verses 38 and 39,

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that it says:

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Then Jesus turned,
and saw them following him.’

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you notice what Jesus said?

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“What are you looking for?”

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:03.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Andrew respond to that?

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Andrew say:
‘Well, you know, Lord,

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’d like to have a better assignment,

00:03:10.373 --> 00:03:14.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘something that brings a little prestige,
maybe some accolades.

00:03:14.844 --> 00:03:19.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And along with that,
if I had a bigger room,

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one with a view . . . ’?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he said was:
‘Lord, where are you staying?’

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible shows us
that Andrew then went with Jesus

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stayed with him
till about four o’clock in the afternoon.

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was interesting
because he was really showing

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he valued spiritual things
over the mundane things.

00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then after that time,

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 40 and 41 say

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Andrew ran to find his brother Peter.

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said five words

00:03:54.884 --> 00:03:58.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—five words
that would change their lives forever:

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:01.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have found the Messiah.”

00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have found the Messiah.”

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Andrew know that?

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:09.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Andrew must have been
a man who loved God’s Word.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have been familiar with it.

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in that time that he was with Jesus,

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:19.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could take
what he’d read in the Scriptures

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and compare them
with the man in front of him,

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came to that conclusion.

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a spiritual man.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved God’s Word.

00:04:29.118 --> 00:04:32.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result of his zeal,

00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he brought his brother Peter to Jesus.

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, that’s a little bit
about what we know about Andrew the person.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Andrew the apostle?

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go over to John chapter 6 now,

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 6,

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll look at verses 40 and 41.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, excuse me, John 6:5-9,

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we see a large crowd of people now

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are gathering to see Jesus,
and Jesus wants to feed them.

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember the account.

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he says to Philip:

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:16.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know, I want to feed these people.’

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip says:
‘Lord, that’s impossible.

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two hundred denarii wouldn’t feed them all.’

00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:25.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there were probably
over 5,000 people there.

00:05:25.842 --> 00:05:29.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, while he, Philip,
is talking to Jesus,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to reason with him,
what is Andrew doing?

00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:34.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew goes through the crowd,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he finds a little boy that has
some fish and some bread,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he brings that little child to Jesus.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Andrew have any idea
what Jesus was going to do?

00:05:44.694 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t have known.
There’s no way he could have known.

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he must have thought—
He must have seen enough  

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know that Jesus could do something,

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, he did.

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was the lesson?

00:06:01.177 --> 00:06:06.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, while Philip saw the problem,
Andrew was looking for a solution.

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may notice again that as usual

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew is bringing people to Jesus.

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:16.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a side point,

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think
that little boy would be talking about

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he became my age,

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yeah, after that miracle he saw?

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have really been an impactful one.

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go to John chapter 12,

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:36.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 12,

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:39.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look down at verses 20 through 22

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now we have a group of Greeks

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who come to worship at the festival.

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they approach Philip,
and what do they want to do?

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to see Jesus.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Philip do?

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip goes to Andrew.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Andrew do?

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew takes Philip,
and they go to Jesus.

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, two things.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:04.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew recognized the channel.

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to circumvent it.

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to make the decision.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He recognized the channel.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second,

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew was a friend

00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now he would be a mentor to Philip

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:26.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach him to go to the channel as well.

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible doesn’t say much

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Andrew,

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:39.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can see that Andrew
didn’t think it was all about him.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always had the desire to help others.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this brief discussion,

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:49.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there anything really ordinary
about Andrew?

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:54.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while it’s true
that Andrew never walked on water,

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never wrote a Bible book,

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also never denied Christ,

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never got his mom
to ask for special favors,

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was never known
for being a “doubting Andrew,”

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he never ever was called Satan,

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a force for good
for those around him.

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the lessons for the class:

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be adaptable.

00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be adaptable to the leanings
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if you don’t fully understand them.

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:36.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two:

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get tripped up by the desire
for the mundane things.

00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the question
that Jesus asked Andrew:

00:08:44.807 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What are you looking for?”

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:50.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good reset question for all of us
from time to time.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we looking for?

00:08:53.049 --> 00:08:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jehovah is not limited
in how he can work out problems.

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:03.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give him the chance to show
what he can do for you,

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may find the answer comes
in some very unexpected ways.

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, in your assignment,

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:17.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be quick to pass over
the seemingly ordinary people.

00:09:18.341 --> 00:09:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the “Andrews.”

00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in all the congregations.

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:24.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in all the Bethels.

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re like the hidden gems
that are all around us.

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acknowledge them;
encourage them;

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:38.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see what they’re contributing,
and say something about it.

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those hidden gems
will begin to come out of the shadows,

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:46.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will shine
in the light of appreciation.

00:09:46.502 --> 00:09:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the days to come,

00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:51.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be a steadying force for good.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show loving kindness to all.

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:59.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give Jehovah your best,
and give the friends your best,

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give it with love.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you will never ever be in the shadow

00:10:05.388 --> 00:10:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s eyes.

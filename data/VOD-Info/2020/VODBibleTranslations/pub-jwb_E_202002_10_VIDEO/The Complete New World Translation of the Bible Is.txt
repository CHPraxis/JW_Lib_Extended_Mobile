00:00:05 “So when this sound occurred,
00:00:09 “a crowd gathered and was bewildered,
00:00:14 “because each one heard them speaking
00:00:17 in his own language.”
00:00:22 When I was young, two sisters came to my door and taught me God’s name.
00:00:26 I didn’t really get the sense of it.
00:00:28 To understand, I used to sign the words in the publications,
00:00:31 but the message never touched my heart.
00:00:33 When I would attend church, I only had an English Bible to read.
00:00:37 There was no ASL Bible, and I didn’t understand the English.
00:00:41 I prayed for the Bible in my language,
00:00:43 but I never thought it would happen.
00:00:45 Those taking the lead among Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:49 decided that the Bible should be translated for smaller language groups.
00:00:52 We were thrilled.
00:00:54 “Does that include sign language?”
00:00:56 “Yes, go ahead with it!”
00:00:59 On October 26, 2004,
00:01:01 approval was given to begin work on the translation
00:01:04 of the Christian Greek Scriptures into American Sign Language.
00:01:12 We are thrilled to announce that the translation
00:01:16 of the Christian Greek Scriptures into ASL
00:01:19 is now under way!
00:01:28 The New World Translation in ASL was released incrementally,
00:01:31 starting with Matthew.
00:01:33 Wow!
00:01:35 At first, I was in a state of shock.
00:01:39 I never thought that Jehovah God
00:01:42 would allow his Holy Word,
00:01:45 his glorious Word, to be translated into ASL
00:01:50 —such undeserved kindness.
00:01:53 When it hit me that they were going to translate
00:01:55 all of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:01:57 (with each verse beginning from Matthew 1:1, 1:2, and so forth),
00:02:01 I was absolutely stunned.
00:02:03 I went to the restroom and cried and thanked Jehovah.
00:02:06 When I got home, I cried so much; I couldn’t even see the video.
00:02:11 I got up at 4 o’clock the next morning, and I ran to watch it,
00:02:14 but I started crying again.
00:02:16 I sobbed all week!
00:02:18 When I finally watched it, I thanked Jehovah.
00:02:20 Without a doubt, Jehovah has not forgotten us deaf people.
00:02:24 Look at all the spiritual food he is providing.
00:02:27 Ahh.
00:02:28 For that reason, we should really appreciate
00:02:31 and take advantage of these provisions.
00:02:33 Well,
00:02:35 we want to mention something to you
00:02:37 —something very special.
00:02:41 You see, the team has been working
00:02:44 on translating the Bible
00:02:47 into sign language for 15 years.
00:02:53 And today,
00:02:55 this means that with the release of the book of Job,
00:02:58 the whole New World Translation is now completed.
00:03:05 As far as we know,
00:03:08 Jehovah’s Witnesses are the first organization,
00:03:11 or group of persons,
00:03:13 to release the complete Bible into ASL.
00:03:30 Here in Fort Lauderdale, we have our team that works on translating the Bible
00:03:34 and other publications from English to ASL.
00:03:37 There are typically three people on a translation team.
00:03:41 One will focus on generating translation ideas,
00:03:44 another focuses on the accuracy of the translation,
00:03:47 and a third person will watch to make sure
00:03:50 the signing is natural and easy to understand.
00:03:52 First, we are given the text in English.
00:03:55 As we read it, we carefully analyze the message
00:04:00 and give thought to the theme of the text.
00:04:04 After analyzing the text,
00:04:06 the three members of the team get together for a project meeting
00:04:10 to discuss any challenges and to make sure all are on the same page.
00:04:16 The ASL Bible team was the first to use a live review panel.
00:04:20 The panel would look at the Bible books
00:04:22 and give immediate feedback to the team,
00:04:25 and that feedback was incorporated to make the final product far superior.
00:04:32 The translation is further refined.
00:04:35 Once it is finalized, then the team goes to the studio to record.
00:04:51 When deaf people watch the ASL version of the New World Translation,
00:04:55 they can have complete confidence that it is accurate and trustworthy.
00:05:08 Now in the ministry, when I show the Scriptures in ASL,
00:05:13 I can see the reaction of the people really getting the sense of it,
00:05:18 and I think, ‘Oh, Jehovah, you’re amazing.’
00:05:21 My confidence has greatly increased.
00:05:24 Before the New World Translation was available in ASL,
00:05:27 I was nervous preaching.
00:05:28 I wasn’t sure what to say.
00:05:30 We only had a few translated scriptures.
00:05:32 If asked a question, I was at a loss.
00:05:39 The ASL Bible project set a pattern for other sign languages,
00:05:43 and now we have parts of the Bible available in 17 sign languages,
00:05:47 with more on the way.
00:05:49 Now that the Bible is available in sign language,
00:05:53 we know without a doubt
00:05:56 that Jehovah wants people of all nations,
00:06:00 backgrounds, and languages to know him
00:06:04 —to know his ways, his name, his purpose for the future.
00:06:09 He wants everyone to know him.

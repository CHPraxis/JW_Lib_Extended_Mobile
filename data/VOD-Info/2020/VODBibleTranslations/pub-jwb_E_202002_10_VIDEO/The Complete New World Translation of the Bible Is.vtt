“So when this sound occurred,

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:12.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a crowd gathered and was bewildered,

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because each one heard them speaking

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his own language.”

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was young, two sisters
came to my door and taught me God’s name.

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t really get the sense of it.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To understand, I used to sign
the words in the publications,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the message never touched my heart.

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I would attend church,
I only had an English Bible to read.

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no ASL Bible,
and I didn’t understand the English.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for the Bible in my language,

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I never thought it would happen.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those taking the lead
among Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided that the Bible should be translated
for smaller language groups.

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrilled.

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does that include sign language?”

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, go ahead with it!”

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On October 26, 2004,

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
approval was given
to begin work on the translation

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Christian Greek Scriptures
into American Sign Language.

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are thrilled to announce
that the translation

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Christian Greek Scriptures into ASL

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now under way!

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i> in ASL
was released incrementally,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with Matthew.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, I was in a state of shock.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that Jehovah God

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would allow his Holy Word,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:50.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his glorious Word, to be translated into ASL

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:53.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such undeserved kindness.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it hit me that they
were going to translate

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:01.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(with each verse beginning
from Matthew 1:1, 1:2, and so forth),

00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was absolutely stunned.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to the restroom
and cried and thanked Jehovah. 

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got home, I cried so much;
I couldn’t even see the video.

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got up at 4 o’clock the next morning,
and I ran to watch it,

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I started crying again.

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sobbed all week!

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally watched it, I thanked Jehovah.

00:02:20.911 --> 00:02:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt,
Jehovah has not forgotten us deaf people.

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at all the spiritual food
he is providing.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:28.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ahh.

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For that reason, we should really appreciate

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take advantage of these provisions.

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to mention something to you

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something very special.

00:02:41.807 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the team has been working

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on translating the Bible

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:51.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into sign language for 15 years.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today,

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this means that with the release
of the book of Job,

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole <i>New World Translation</i>
is now completed.

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:08.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As far as we know,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
are the first organization,

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:13.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or group of persons,

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to release the complete Bible into ASL.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in Fort Lauderdale, we have our team
that works on translating the Bible

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:36.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other publications from English to ASL.

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:41.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are typically three people
on a translation team.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One will focus
on generating translation ideas,

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another focuses on the accuracy
of the translation,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a third person will watch to make sure

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the signing is natural
and easy to understand.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we are given the text in English.

00:03:55.923 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read it,
we carefully analyze the message

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give thought to the theme of the text.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:06.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After analyzing the text,

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:10.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the three members of the team
get together for a project meeting

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:14.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discuss any challenges and to make sure
all are on the same page.

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ASL Bible team
was the first to use a live review panel.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The panel would look at the Bible books

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give immediate feedback to the team,

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that feedback was incorporated
to make the final product far superior.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation is further refined.

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:39.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once it is finalized,
then the team goes to the studio to record.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When deaf people watch the ASL version
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:04:55.816 --> 00:05:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can have complete confidence
that it is accurate and trustworthy.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now in the ministry,
when I show the Scriptures in ASL,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see the reaction of the people
really getting the sense of it,

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I think, ‘Oh, Jehovah, you’re amazing.’

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:24.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My confidence has greatly increased.

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before the <i>New World Translation</i>
was available in ASL,

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was nervous preaching.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t sure what to say.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We only had a few translated scriptures.

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If asked a question, I was at a loss.

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:43.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ASL Bible project set a pattern
for other sign languages,

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:47.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we have parts of the Bible available
in 17 sign languages,

00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:49.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with more on the way.

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:53.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that the Bible
is available in sign language,

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:56.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know without a doubt

00:05:56.877 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah wants people of all nations,

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:04.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
backgrounds, and languages to know him

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to know his ways, his name,
his purpose for the future.

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:13.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants everyone to know him.

00:00:03 Soon after the Governing Body released
00:00:06 the revised English edition of the New World Translation,
00:00:09 they decided to revise the Spanish edition.
00:00:13 They wanted it to be a modern, understandable translation
00:00:17 for the entire Spanish-speaking world.
00:00:21 Spanish is the mother tongue of around 480 million people.
00:00:26 And it is also the most widely spoken language
00:00:29 among Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:31 This translation project would be a unique challenge.
00:00:35 It eventually took four and a half years to complete.
00:00:39 Why did it take so long?
00:00:41 Apart from the translation process itself,
00:00:44 the work was complicated
00:00:46 by the wide geographic range
00:00:48 of these Hispanic countries
00:00:50 and their different cultures.
00:00:52 This diversity meant that in different countries
00:00:55 the same Spanish word could mean different things.
00:00:59 In other cases, the word may be unknown
00:01:03 in certain areas or even sound objectionable to some.
00:01:07 To overcome these difficulties,
00:01:09 the translators used 100 outside readers
00:01:12 from many different countries
00:01:14 to review the translated text progressively.
00:01:19 These readers were of different ages, cultures, and backgrounds.
00:01:23 These outside readers regularly received chapters of the Bible electronically,
00:01:27 and then they introduced their suggested revisions.
00:01:32 The translation teams took note of all their recommendations,
00:01:36 and in some cases, they also sent them specific inquiries.
00:01:40 Every verse was checked by 130 different people.
00:01:45 Naturally, all of this took time.
00:01:49 The work was finished in the spring of 2019.
00:01:54 But then another challenge arose.
00:01:56 We needed to print millions of Bibles
00:02:00 to satisfy the demand of the Spanish-speaking field.
00:02:02 This was a huge job
00:02:04 for our printing presses in the United States and Japan.
00:02:07 Despite working night and day,
00:02:10 the task would take a long time.
00:02:12 And naturally, everyone wanted to have the Bible right away.
00:02:16 Right at the Madrid international convention,
00:02:19 the Governing Body decided to release
00:02:21 the Bible in digital format.
00:02:23 This was several months before all the Bibles could be printed.
00:02:26 The highlight of the Friday morning convention program
00:02:29 was when Brother Lösch presented the newly revised Bible.
00:02:32 But there was another surprise!
00:02:34 Since at the convention
00:02:37 most brothers and sisters had their phones and tablets with them,
00:02:40 they were able to immediately download the revised Bible.
00:02:43 How was that possible?
00:02:47 Over 500 portable Wi-Fi devices were distributed
00:02:50 among each of the 11 convention venues
00:02:53 in Spain that were tied in with the Madrid stadium.
00:02:56 During the lunch break on Friday,
00:02:59 practically everyone in attendance could download
00:03:02 the revised Spanish edition of the New World Translation.
00:03:05 More than 1,200 volunteers were trained
00:03:08 to give technical support to those who needed it.
00:03:12 In this way, the brothers started to use the revised translation
00:03:15 right away during the afternoon program.
00:03:21 We laughed and cried with joy.
00:03:23 We knew it was a gift from Jehovah,
00:03:25 which he was giving us at that moment.
00:03:28 And also, we felt so happy because we’d been waiting a long time for it.
00:03:33 What I like most about this revision
00:03:35 is that it’s very easy to understand.
00:03:37 Sometimes I think,
00:03:38 ‘But was this what we had before?’
00:03:40 It seems that it reaches my heart much quicker.
00:03:44 As you use it,
00:03:45 you realize that many scriptures
00:03:46 have been adjusted and that the faithful slave
00:03:50 has worked very hard to make it easier to understand.
00:03:55 Without a doubt, this revised edition of the New World Translation
00:03:59 is a wonderful gift for all our Spanish-speaking brothers.
00:04:04 The Word of God has power,
00:04:07 and this will be a powerful tool
00:04:09 to help many people get to know Jehovah.

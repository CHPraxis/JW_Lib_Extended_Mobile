00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after the Governing Body released

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revised English edition
of the <i>New World Translation,</i>

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they decided to revise the Spanish edition.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted it to be a modern,
understandable translation

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the entire Spanish-speaking world.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spanish is the mother tongue
of around 480 million people.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is also
the most widely spoken language

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:35.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This translation project
would be a unique challenge.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It eventually took
four and a half years to complete.

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did it take so long?

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:44.231 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Apart from the translation process itself,

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:46.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the work was complicated

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the wide geographic range

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these Hispanic countries

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their different cultures.

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This diversity meant
that in different countries

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same Spanish word
could mean different things.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other cases,
the word may be unknown

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in certain areas
or even sound objectionable to some.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To overcome these difficulties,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators used 100 outside readers

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from many different countries

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review the translated text progressively.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These readers were of different ages,
cultures, and backgrounds.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These outside readers regularly received
chapters of the Bible electronically,

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they introduced
their suggested revisions.

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation teams
took note of all their recommendations,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in some cases,
they also sent them specific inquiries.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every verse was checked
by 130 different people.

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naturally, all of this took time.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work was finished in the spring of 2019.

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then another challenge arose.

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to print millions of Bibles

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to satisfy the demand
of the Spanish-speaking field.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:04.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a huge job

00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our printing presses
in the United States and Japan.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite working night and day,

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the task would take a long time.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:15.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And naturally, everyone wanted
to have the Bible right away.

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Right at the Madrid international convention,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body decided to release

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.747 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible in digital format.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was several months
before all the Bibles could be printed.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The highlight
of the Friday morning convention program

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when Brother Lösch
presented the newly revised Bible.

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was another surprise!

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since at the convention

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most brothers and sisters
had their phones and tablets with them,

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were able to immediately
download the revised Bible.

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was that possible?

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 500 portable Wi-Fi devices
were distributed

00:02:50.357 --> 00:02:53.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among each of the 11 convention venues

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Spain that were
tied in with the Madrid stadium.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the lunch break on Friday,

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practically everyone
in attendance could download

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revised Spanish edition
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 1,200 volunteers were trained

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give technical support
to those who needed it.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, the brothers started
to use the revised translation

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right away during the afternoon program.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:23.891 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We laughed and cried with joy.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.893 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We knew it was a gift from Jehovah,

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:28.145 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which he was giving us at that moment.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, we felt so happy
because we’d been waiting a long time for it.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.235 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What I like most about this revision

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.279 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is that it’s very easy to understand.

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I think,

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But was this what we had before?’

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that it reaches
my heart much quicker.

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:45.496 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As you use it,

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:46.955 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you realize that many scriptures

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been adjusted
and that the faithful slave

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has worked very hard
to make it easier to understand.

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt, this revised edition
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a wonderful gift
for all our Spanish-speaking brothers.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:07.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Word of God has power,

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this will be a powerful tool

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help many people get to know Jehovah.

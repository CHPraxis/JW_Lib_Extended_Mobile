‎In chapter 17, we learned

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about Gog’s attack 
on Jehovah’s people. 

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re grateful 
that Jehovah has warned us

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about what 
the coalition of nations will do. 

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But that’s not the end of the story. 

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel’s prophecy goes on to tell us

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what will happen 
to this enemy of pure worship.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 18 
of the Pure Worship book is entitled

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“My Great Rage Will Flare Up.” 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That title comes from Ezekiel 38:18:

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘On that day, the day when Gog 
invades the land of Israel,’

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah,

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘my great rage will flare up.’”

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As we study this thrilling information,

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for these key points:

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What provokes Jehovah’s great rage? 

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why will his enemies not have valid cause

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to be surprised when he unleashes his wrath? 

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When will Jehovah’s rage flare up,

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how will he express it?

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.588 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just think:

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During the great tribulation just ahead,

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎pure worshippers 
will witness something truly spectacular

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—how Jehovah will stand up for his people

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and sanctify his holy name. 

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May this chapter move you
to do all you can

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to promote pure worship now.

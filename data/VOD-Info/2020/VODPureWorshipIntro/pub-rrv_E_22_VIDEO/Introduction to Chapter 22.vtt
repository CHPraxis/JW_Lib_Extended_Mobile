‎Wouldn’t you agree
that it’s been absolutely thrilling

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to study Ezekiel’s prophecies and visions? 

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the 21 chapters
of the Pure Worship book

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we’ve studied thus far,

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ve learned many valuable lessons

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about pure worship.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The final chapter
of the Pure Worship book

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is entitled “Worship God,”

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎based on Revelation 22:9. 

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s read that verse together:

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“But he [an angel]

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:38.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“tells me [the apostle John]:

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Be careful! 

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:42.938 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Do not do that! 

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘I am only a fellow slave of you

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘and of your brothers the prophets

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘and of those observing 
the words of this scroll. 

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Worship God.’”

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this chapter,

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ll review some
of the principal themes of Ezekiel

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how they apply
both now and in the future.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, with the help of Bible prophecy,

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ll peer into the future 

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the end
of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look for the answers to these questions:

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What final test

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will Jehovah’s worshippers face? 

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What will happen
to those who fail that test?

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.067 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s our hope

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that what you’ve learned
from the Pure Worship book

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.489 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will strengthen your determination

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to give Jehovah

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what he so richly deserves

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—your exclusive worship. 

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And may you 
be more determined than ever

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to preach with zeal and urgency,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎helping others to join us in pure worship. 

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How we all long for the time when everyone

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in heaven and on earth will be united

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the pure worship of Jehovah!

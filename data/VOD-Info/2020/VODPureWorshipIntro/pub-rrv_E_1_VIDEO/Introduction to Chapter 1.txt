00:00:01 ‎Well, hello.
00:00:03 ‎We’re starting a new book together
00:00:05 ‎with an interesting title:
00:00:07 ‎Pure Worship of Jehovah—Restored At Last!
00:00:12 ‎What spiritual gems will we find in this book?
00:00:16 ‎Will there be clarifications of understanding?
00:00:19 ‎Yes!
00:00:21 ‎Will we see beautiful illustrations  of vivid prophetic visions?
00:00:25 ‎Yes!
00:00:27 ‎Rather than discussing  the book of Ezekiel verse by verse,
00:00:30 ‎the Pure Worship book  considers Ezekiel’s prophecy topic by topic.
00:00:35 ‎Section 1, which begins with chapter 3,
00:00:39 ‎focuses on the celestial chariot.
00:00:42 ‎The remaining four sections
00:00:44 ‎discuss how pure worship was contaminated
00:00:47 ‎and restored
00:00:49 ‎and how it will survive attack
00:00:52 ‎and remain for all time.
00:00:56 ‎Each chapter concludes with a box entitled
00:00:58 ‎“Your Place in Pure Worship.”
00:01:01 ‎Take time to meditate  on the questions in those boxes.
00:01:05 ‎Doing so will increase  your appreciation for pure worship
00:01:08 ‎and your place in it.
00:01:10 ‎Now, what can we expect in chapter 1?
00:01:16 ‎Are you dealing with a trial in your life?
00:01:19 ‎Or is someone tempting you  to ignore Jehovah’s standards?
00:01:24 ‎If so,
00:01:26 ‎you can relate to the situation  that Jesus faced in 29 C.E.
00:01:31 ‎Satan had waited until Jesus was hungry
00:01:34 ‎before approaching him  with the first of three temptations.
00:01:38 ‎What was Satan’s goal?
00:01:41 ‎We learn the answer  from the way Jesus responded to Satan.
00:01:46 ‎Please read with me Matthew 4:10:
00:01:51 ‎“Then Jesus said to him:  ‘Go away, Satan!
00:01:55 ‎“‘For it is written:
00:01:57 ‎“‘“It is Jehovah your God  you must worship,
00:02:01 ‎and it is to him alone  you must render sacred service.”’”
00:02:05 ‎This is the theme scripture  for the chapter entitled
00:02:09 ‎“It Is Jehovah Your God You Must Worship.”
00:02:12 ‎As you consider this material,  look for these points:
00:02:17 ‎What tactics did Satan use  in his first two temptations of Jesus,
00:02:22 ‎and how does Satan tempt us in similar ways?
00:02:26 ‎As shown by the third temptation of Jesus,
00:02:29 ‎what does Satan want from us,
00:02:31 ‎and how can we resist his enticements?
00:02:35 ‎How can you demonstrate  that you agree with the words:
00:02:38 ‎“It is Jehovah your God you must worship”?
00:02:43 ‎Make time to study each chapter.
00:02:46 ‎Look up the scriptures.
00:02:48 ‎Consider how they apply to the material
00:02:50 ‎and what they teach you  about our Father and Creator.
00:02:55 ‎Jehovah loves you
00:02:57 ‎and will give you the strength to deal with any trial or temptation.
00:03:02 ‎One way he does so  is through his Word, the Bible.
00:03:06 ‎The better you understand Bible principles,
00:03:09 ‎the greater will be your desire  to reject Satan’s traps
00:03:12 ‎and to give Jehovah exclusive, pure worship.
00:03:17 ‎Enjoy the study!

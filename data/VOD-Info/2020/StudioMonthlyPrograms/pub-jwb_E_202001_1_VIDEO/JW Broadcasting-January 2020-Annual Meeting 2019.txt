00:00:02 We extend a warm welcome to all of you!
00:00:06 This is the January 2020 edition
00:00:11 of JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:31 Excitement was in the air
00:00:33 as brothers and sisters
00:00:35 from around the world
00:00:37 poured into the Assembly Hall
00:00:39 in Newburgh, New York,
00:00:41 for the annual meeting on October 5, 2019.
00:00:47 Encouraging reports and thrilling announcements
00:00:51 gave clear evidence of Jehovah’s blessing
00:00:54 on the preaching work.
00:00:56 Now you will hear it for yourself.
00:00:59 Please enjoy the first part
00:01:02 of the 2019 annual meeting.
00:01:08 I’ve chosen the theme
00:01:10 “Your Leader Is One, the Christ,”
00:01:14 based on Matthew 23:10.
00:01:19 Starting out with Nimrod of Babylon,
00:01:21 the world has seen many leaders
00:01:24 —religious leaders, political leaders.
00:01:27 When Hitler ruled Nazi Germany,
00:01:30 the Nazis created a slogan:
00:01:32 “One people, one empire, one leader.”
00:01:36 Well, what happened to that leader?
00:01:39 After causing the death of millions during World War II,
00:01:43 he reportedly ended his life by suicide.
00:01:47 Human leaders have failed.
00:01:49 Why?
00:01:50 For one, most did not have enough love for God and for the people.
00:01:55 They used their position to acquire wealth, fame, power.
00:02:00 Others might have had noble intentions but still failed.
00:02:03 Why?
00:02:05 Imperfect man does not have the ability
00:02:08 to rule, or lead, others perfectly.
00:02:13 In Bible times, Jehovah was the leader of the ancient people of Israel.
00:02:17 He said, according to Leviticus 11:45:
00:02:20 “For I am Jehovah, who is leading you
00:02:24 up out of the land of Egypt to prove myself God to you.”
00:02:29 However, Jehovah appointed Moses as a visible leader representing Him,
00:02:34 although he was imperfect.
00:02:36 Later, he appointed Joshua, then the judges, then the kings.
00:02:41 However, the people sometimes rejected their leadership.
00:02:46 Today, a leader exists whose leadership is perfect
00:02:51 —Jesus Christ.
00:02:53 He was appointed by Jehovah.
00:02:56 We have a leader who is sinless
00:02:58 —different from any other human.
00:03:01 He’s perfect in wisdom and in righteousness.
00:03:04 He’s more powerful than all human leaders together.
00:03:10 He’s also perfect in love.
00:03:13 He is a leader that gave his life for the people.
00:03:16 Do we all appreciate his leadership?
00:03:20 Sure we do.
00:03:22 Jesus provided leadership by personal example
00:03:26 and at the same time showed humility in dealing with others.
00:03:29 He showed love for his disciples throughout the centuries until today,
00:03:34 strengthening them when persecuted.
00:03:37 He never abandoned them,
00:03:39 as he also indicated at Matthew 28:19, 20.
00:03:45 Do you want to follow his lead?
00:03:49 I trust you do.
00:03:51 In the first century, at Pentecost 33 C.E.,
00:03:56 the Christian congregation was formed.
00:03:59 There was a governing body of mature Christians, namely, the apostles,
00:04:03 who were responsible to take the lead.
00:04:05 When some of them were killed or died of sickness or old age,
00:04:10 other anointed ones were appointed to serve on that body.
00:04:13 Similarly today,
00:04:15 there’s no specific number on the modern-day Governing Body.
00:04:20 In the first century, the governing body
00:04:22 was not only led by the spirit
00:04:24 but in matters of doctrine, even inspired.
00:04:29 Today, it’s not inspired
00:04:31 but still led by the spirit.
00:04:36 Today, our recognizing Christ’s leadership involves
00:04:39 submission to and cooperation with his spiritual brothers
00:04:42 and with other appointed overseers.
00:04:46 After Brother Russell,
00:04:48 Brother Rutherford became the president of the Society,
00:04:52 or our human leader at that time.
00:04:56 Whereas at the beginning of his presidency
00:04:59 he strongly emphasized his position,
00:05:01 he changed his attitude later,
00:05:03 realizing he was not to be considered
00:05:06 the number one, or the leader.
00:05:10 The book Jehovah’s Witnesses —Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom
00:05:14 says on pages 220-221:
00:05:18 “At a convention in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1941,
00:05:22 “shortly before his death,
00:05:24 “he spoke about the matter of leadership, saying:
00:05:27 “‘I want to let any strangers here know
00:05:30 “‘what you think about a man being your leader,
00:05:34 “‘so they won’t be forgetting.
00:05:36 “‘. . . If there is any person in this audience
00:05:38 “‘who thinks that I, this man standing here,
00:05:41 “is the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses, say Yes.’
00:05:45 “The response was an impressive silence,
00:05:50 “broken only by an emphatic ‘No’
00:05:53 “from several in the audience.
00:05:56 “The speaker continued:
00:05:58 “‘If you who are here believe that I am just one of the servants of the Lord,
00:06:02 “‘and we are working shoulder to shoulder in unity,
00:06:06 “serving God and serving Christ, say Yes.’
00:06:09 “[And] in unison the assembly
00:06:11 roared out a decisive ‘Yes!’”
00:06:18 From January 1942 to June 1977,
00:06:22 Brother Nathan Homer Knorr served as president of the Society.
00:06:26 Gradually, by divine influence,
00:06:28 authority was shifted more and more
00:06:30 from the president to a Governing Body
00:06:34 as the meaning of the term and the function
00:06:36 was understood increasingly better.
00:06:39 Today, Jesus is still the Leader,
00:06:43 providing leadership for the congregations.
00:06:46 He also directs the worldwide preaching work from heaven.
00:06:50 However, he has delegated leadership
00:06:52 to “the faithful and discreet slave” —the Governing Body—
00:06:56 through whom he provides spiritual food at the proper time
00:06:59 in line with Matthew 24:45-47.
00:07:05 No member of the Governing Body has the title “Leader,”
00:07:09 since Jesus said that none of his disciples
00:07:12 should be called Leader
00:07:15 —Matthew 23:10-12.
00:07:19 The term “governing body” was used by us for the first time
00:07:23 in The Watchtower  of 1944,
00:07:25 November 1, page 328,
00:07:29 in the article “Theocratic Organization in Action.”
00:07:32 But de facto in 1944, there was no Governing Body
00:07:37 with collective decision-making in operation yet.
00:07:43 A historic change came on September 6, 1971.
00:07:47 It was resolved that the chairmanship of the Governing Body
00:07:50 would rotate annually among its members,
00:07:53 doing so alphabetically.
00:07:55 On October 1, 1971,
00:07:58 Brother Frederick William Franz
00:08:00 became the chairman of the Governing Body for one year,
00:08:04 according to the Proclaimers  book,
00:08:07 pages 106-107.
00:08:11 Starting in 1971,
00:08:13 the number of the members of the Governing Body was raised.
00:08:16 Gradually, there were 18 members.
00:08:18 When the Governing Body was formed,
00:08:20 it was put in writing that all members
00:08:23 consider themselves as equal to the others;
00:08:27 none were more equal than the others.
00:08:33 Who was the number one among the 12 apostles?
00:08:37 Well, none of them.
00:08:39 Revelation 21:14 says
00:08:42 that in a figurative description
00:08:46 of the New Jerusalem —Messianic Kingdom—
00:08:50 that there will be “12 apostles of the Lamb,”
00:08:55 and no apostle is shown in this text
00:08:58 as being superior to another.
00:09:01 The Governing Body also appoints
00:09:05 helpers to assist them;
00:09:08 this was instituted in 1992.
00:09:13 Each of the Governing Body committees has helpers;
00:09:16 there are over 30 helpers now.
00:09:20 They participate at the meetings
00:09:22 of the Governing Body committee to which they are assigned.
00:09:26 They do not share in decision-making
00:09:29 but are offering observations and suggestions.
00:09:33 And also they carry out the decisions made
00:09:36 by the respective Governing Body committee.
00:09:40 The Governing Body also appoints
00:09:42 Branch Committees and Country Committees
00:09:44 in different parts of the world,
00:09:47 and they have oversight over one or more countries.
00:09:51 Now, who is the number one on the Branch Committee?
00:09:56 No one.
00:09:58 Christ is number one.
00:10:00 Branch Committees also have a chairman
00:10:03 who rotates each year alphabetically.
00:10:06 This is in place since 1976.
00:10:10 The chairman of the U.S. branch starting this coming January
00:10:15 is Brother Lon Schilling.
00:10:17 Who is the leader among congregation elders?
00:10:22 Although all of them are to take the lead,
00:10:25 none of them is to be considered number one.
00:10:28 There is no rotation in place.
00:10:31 In a sense, we could say that Jesus is number one, or the Leader.
00:10:36 He is the head of the congregation.
00:10:39 The coordinators of the body of elders do not rotate,
00:10:43 but they are aware that all elders are equals.
00:10:47 None are more equal than the others.
00:10:51 Well, is Christ’s leadership real to you?
00:10:56 We are not following a man.
00:10:58 Be determined to study more
00:11:01 about our Leader,
00:11:04 imitating him in our personal lives.
00:11:08 Jehovah will love you
00:11:10 if you follow his appointed Leader now,
00:11:14 and if you do, you may get the privilege to follow him
00:11:19 forever after into all eternity.
00:11:28 We now have the privilege
00:11:30 to hear from Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body.
00:11:34 He will address the subject
00:11:37 “Our Relief Ministry, Used by Jehovah to Provide Relief.”
00:11:51 Jehovah is a wonderful God
00:11:55 of comfort and relief.
00:11:58 In stark contrast,
00:12:00 Satan the Devil is a horrible god
00:12:03 of pain and suffering.
00:12:05 In fact, if we think about it,
00:12:07 even with the so-called natural disasters
00:12:12 that cause a lot of pain and suffering,
00:12:14 Satan is the ultimate cause.
00:12:16 Why do we say that?
00:12:18 Well, by alienating humans from Jehovah,
00:12:23 Satan deprived them of the Creator
00:12:26 lovingly controlling the weather for their benefit.
00:12:30 Additionally, humans under Satan’s rule
00:12:33 have grossly mismanaged the earth
00:12:36 and its environmental provisions,
00:12:38 resulting in erratic weather swings
00:12:41 which undoubtedly contribute to these so-called natural disasters.
00:12:46 But how thankful, as we said,
00:12:49 that Jehovah is a God of comfort and relief!
00:12:51 And one way he lives up to this title
00:12:55 is by empowering and motivating us
00:12:59 to share in a relief ministry in behalf of our brothers
00:13:04 who have been pummeled by some catastrophe.
00:13:07 And when we allow Jehovah to use us in this way,
00:13:11 we’re actually imitating our first-century brothers and sisters.
00:13:14 Please go to Acts 11:29.
00:13:19 The setting is about the year 46 C.E.,
00:13:23 and our brothers in Judea
00:13:26 are suffering from a terrible famine.
00:13:30 Being unable to pay the sky-high prices for food,
00:13:34 they’re very hungry; they’re even facing starvation.
00:13:38 So, what did their brothers in Antioch,
00:13:41 their Jewish and Gentile brothers,
00:13:45 do for these brothers in Judea?
00:13:47 Well, let’s read beginning in verse 29:
00:13:50 “So the disciples determined,
00:13:53 “each according to what he could afford,
00:13:56 “to send relief to the brothers living in Judea;
00:14:00 “and this they did,
00:14:02 sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.”
00:14:06 Now, you can just imagine how appreciative
00:14:09 those brothers facing starvation in Judea were
00:14:12 to receive this aid from their brothers in Antioch!
00:14:16 And you can just imagine how appreciative Jehovah was
00:14:19 for what the ones in Antioch did for their very needy brothers!
00:14:24 And this Bible account is just one of several
00:14:27 about our brothers in one area performing a relief ministry
00:14:31 in behalf of others living elsewhere who are very needy.
00:14:36 Now we ask this,
00:14:38 How specifically does Jehovah provide
00:14:41 comfort and relief by means of our relief ministry?
00:14:45 Well, here are three ways.
00:14:47 One, physical relief is given.
00:14:50 Our brother’s immediate needs regarding food, clothing, shelter,
00:14:55 medicine, first-aid supplies are provided.
00:14:58 Two, emotional relief is given.
00:15:02 Assurance is given that they’re not alone.
00:15:05 Jehovah is with them,
00:15:07 and their brothers are with them in this time of distress.
00:15:10 But most important, spiritual relief is given.
00:15:14 We make sure that our brothers have what they need
00:15:19 to resume immediately
00:15:22 their spiritual routine of serving Jehovah.
00:15:26 But now, in order to continue their spiritual routine long-term,
00:15:31 their lives and their circumstances have to be stabilized.
00:15:35 This often requires either repairing
00:15:38 or rebuilding their Kingdom Halls
00:15:41 and repairing or even in many cases
00:15:44 rebuilding their homes,
00:15:46 and then they can continue in their spiritual routine.
00:15:50 In fact, enjoy, please, this video
00:15:53 showing how our brothers in Indonesia
00:15:56 were helped to resume quickly
00:15:59 their spiritual routine
00:16:01 after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2018.
00:16:14 Four days after the earthquake, evacuation of 132 people began.
00:16:33 It was important
00:16:34 to take care of the spiritual needs
00:16:36 of the brothers and sisters
00:16:37 and, amazingly,
00:16:39 not a single meeting was missed.
00:16:42 Several of us from the branch office
00:16:44 gave encouraging talks to the publishers there.
00:16:47 Meetings for field service were also held,
00:16:49 and the publishers there went out preaching
00:16:51 just a couple of days after they had arrived.
00:16:56 We had the opportunity to go out preaching in Poso.
00:16:58 Many people were interested in discussing
00:17:01 the events that took place in Palu.
00:17:03 They listened to the Bible’s message and asked to be visited again.
00:17:07 After meeting for field service
00:17:09 at the Poso Kingdom Hall,
00:17:11 we had the opportunity
00:17:12 to play sign-language videos
00:17:14 from jw.org® to several deaf ones.
00:17:18 Even though we were struck
00:17:20 by a natural disaster,
00:17:23 we were still able to carry out
00:17:25 spiritual routines.
00:17:26 I’m very grateful to Jehovah,
00:17:29 the brothers from the branch office, and others whose prayers,
00:17:32 examples, and presence really helped us
00:17:35 to endure and to keep on relying on Jehovah no matter what.
00:17:47 By means of our relief ministry,
00:17:50 we prove we’re imitators
00:17:53 of the God of comfort and relief
00:17:55 and we also prove
00:17:57 that we’re obeying the command
00:17:59 at Ephesians 5:1, 2, which says:
00:18:02 “Become imitators of God, as beloved children,
00:18:06 and go on walking in love.”
00:18:10 Now, if you think about it, we’re really created to imitate Jehovah.
00:18:14 We’re made in his image, aren’t we?
00:18:16 In contrast, animals cannot imitate Jehovah,
00:18:20 the God of unselfish love and comfort and relief.
00:18:24 For example, you can’t imagine a dog thinking to himself:
00:18:27 ‘You know, I really feel bad about taking that bone away from the other dog.
00:18:33 In the future, I’m really going to try to be more unselfish.’
00:18:38 You can’t imagine a horse
00:18:41 looking up at a beautiful sunset:
00:18:44 ‘My, that sunset makes me love my Creator more.
00:18:48 I’m going to try to please him more in the future.’
00:18:51 You can’t imagine an eagle praying,
00:18:55 ‘Lord, thank you very much for the fish I’m about to eat.’
00:19:01 No, animals are not made in God’s image —we are.
00:19:04 We can imitate our wonderful God
00:19:07 of comfort and relief and love.
00:19:10 Now here’s a question:
00:19:12 How does our relief ministry glorify Jehovah?
00:19:15 Well, here are three ways we’ll discuss.
00:19:18 Number one: It proves that we are true Christians,
00:19:23 and that reflects well on our God.
00:19:25 Secondly, it unites us as brothers and sisters;
00:19:30 it unites us in love and prayer.
00:19:33 As soon as we hear about a disaster
00:19:35 affecting our brothers, what do we do?
00:19:37 We start praying for them, don’t we?
00:19:39 And then as we start giving them relief,
00:19:42 they start praying for us
00:19:44 and they start working in harmony with us
00:19:47 —that’s the second way we’re united in activity.
00:19:50 We spring into action to help our brothers,
00:19:53 and they do what they can to support our efforts in their behalf.
00:19:57 In fact, please enjoy this video.
00:20:00 Relief workers from the United States, Indonesia, and Africa
00:20:04 spring into action to help their brothers.
00:20:16 We are so happy
00:20:18 to be able to come
00:20:20 and help rebuild the damaged houses
00:20:22 so that the brothers
00:20:25 feel secure living in them.
00:20:27 We see this as evidence
00:20:29 that we have brotherly love toward one another.
00:20:34 It’s been a faith-strengthening event,
00:20:36 not just for the families affected directly by the fire,
00:20:40 but for all of us helping out.
00:20:43 We’ve had the privilege to watch Jehovah
00:20:46 do so much for his people
00:20:48 —physically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally.
00:20:53 It’s very faith-strengthening to know that Jehovah never abandons us.
00:21:02 Right after the cyclone hit here in Beira,
00:21:05 we were privileged to be able to come
00:21:06 up here and help out.
00:21:07 It felt really good to be there
00:21:10 to be able to help the brothers
00:21:12 to face an extremely difficult situation.
00:21:15 I learned a lot during this time.
00:21:17 Always, always, always
00:21:20 follow Jehovah’s direction.
00:21:22 This is good for us.
00:21:23 We’re actually putting a roof back on the Kingdom Hall.
00:21:26 It was completely destroyed during the storm.
00:21:28 And the idea is that the Memorial is next week;
00:21:30 they’re going to be able to come back to their Kingdom Hall,
00:21:32 which will be fixed up, and celebrate the Memorial.
00:21:34 So we’re happy to be a part of that.
00:21:47 Additionally,
00:21:49 we’re united in giving contributions.
00:21:53 We give generously
00:21:56 as cheerful givers.
00:21:58 And those who have been helped, what do they do?
00:22:01 Subsequently, they, in turn,
00:22:03 help others who are afflicted with their contributions.
00:22:07 In fact, here are some statistics
00:22:10 about the great magnitude of our relief ministry
00:22:15 just during the past two service years.
00:22:17 Now, during these two service years alone,
00:22:20 more than 900,000 of our brothers
00:22:23 have been affected
00:22:25 —almost a million.
00:22:27 Sixty-two thousand of them
00:22:29 were displaced;
00:22:31 190 were injured;
00:22:33 sadly, 64 were killed;
00:22:36 more than 700 Kingdom Halls
00:22:38 were damaged or destroyed;
00:22:40 more than 15,000 homes
00:22:42 were damaged or destroyed.
00:22:44 The organization
00:22:46 spent $49.5 million (U.S.)
00:22:50 on relief efforts
00:22:52 just during these two service years.
00:22:54 I mean, that’s almost $50 million
00:22:56 in just two service years.
00:22:59 Obviously, our relief ministry
00:23:02 has taken on gigantic proportions.
00:23:06 To help you appreciate how your donations are being used,
00:23:10 please enjoy this video showing before and after pictures
00:23:14 of homes of our brothers
00:23:16 after Cyclone Idai struck in Africa.
00:24:16 Just for your information,
00:24:18 those homes that were rebuilt that you saw there,
00:24:21 some were rebuilt and some were repaired.
00:24:23 The cost to repair
00:24:25 ranged from $50 to $900 per home.
00:24:29 The cost to rebuild
00:24:31 was from $900 to $3,500 for each home.
00:24:36 Now, as you saw, the rebuilt homes are not extravagant,
00:24:41 but the brothers often ended up with something a lot better
00:24:45 than what they had before
00:24:47 because of the use of improved building materials.
00:24:51 And undoubtedly, this will help them better weather future storms.
00:24:56 But at this point, we’d like to just take a moment
00:24:59 and thank you dear brothers and commend you
00:25:02 for your generous, generous contributions
00:25:07 that make our relief ministry possible.
00:25:10 You can be sure that Jehovah is well-pleased.
00:25:13 In fact, at Hebrews 13:16,
00:25:18 we’re told:
00:25:20 “Moreover, do not forget to do good
00:25:24 “and to share what you have with others,
00:25:28 for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”
00:25:33 And I love that thought.
00:25:35 He’s not just pleased; he’s “well-pleased” with your generosity.
00:25:39 So thank you very much, and the Governing Body thanks you
00:25:43 from the bottom of our hearts.
00:25:45 Our brothers and sisters who have been helped
00:25:47 thank you from the bottom of their hearts.
00:25:50 In fact, enjoy this video,
00:25:52 and you’re going to see some of the brothers
00:25:54 in the United States and Africa
00:25:56 expressing their appreciation.
00:26:08 Jehovah has really helped us out
00:26:12 in this disaster by using
00:26:14 the brotherhood to strengthen and encourage us
00:26:17 in ways we’ve never seen before.
00:26:19 And it’s really drawn us closer to him.
00:26:23 Jehovah, through his organization,
00:26:26 gave me two wonderful people
00:26:29 who were there to take care of my needs and my wants.
00:26:32 Everything I needed was handled through them
00:26:35 —just having someone that you can talk to;
00:26:38 just having people that care.
00:26:41 I’ve been in the truth almost 50 years,
00:26:44 and I’ve always had friends, and it’s always been loving and good,
00:26:48 but I have never felt as loved by Jehovah.
00:26:55 The Service Department called
00:26:57 and warned that a big storm would arrive on Thursday.
00:27:01 We saw the true love
00:27:03 that the branch office had for us,
00:27:05 and we followed their example.
00:27:07 We risked our lives to inform the brothers to come to the Kingdom Hall.
00:27:10 The brothers from the branch
00:27:13 were constantly in contact with us.
00:27:15 I found that really encouraging.
00:27:17 Until very late in the evening, they were sending us messages,
00:27:20 telling us that they were still up praying for us.
00:27:23 Those messages were a great comfort to us.
00:27:27 The organization
00:27:29 has been helping us so much emotionally.
00:27:34 The branch sent representatives to provide shepherding
00:27:37 and also a variety of food
00:27:40 —good, nutritious food.
00:27:42 All of this has really been impressive.
00:27:46 And we want to thank Jehovah for the way he’s been caring for us.
00:27:50 What Jehovah’s organization
00:27:52 is doing right now
00:27:53 is far superior than anything
00:27:55 the human governments have been doing.
00:27:59 We really want to say, “Thank you.”
00:28:01 We really feel Jehovah’s love.
00:28:17 Seeing that video motivates us even more
00:28:22 to want to help our brothers by means of our donations
00:28:27 and also by means of our labor.
00:28:29 Now, speaking of labor,
00:28:31 we’re happy to inform you that later in our program,
00:28:35 Brother Lösch will tell you about a new provision
00:28:39 for applying to help with relief work
00:28:42 and other needs in the organization.
00:28:45 So stay tuned
00:28:47 for the revealing of that information.
00:28:51 But now one more way, a third way,
00:28:53 our relief ministry gives a good witness
00:28:56 and glorifies Jehovah
00:28:59 is that it gives a good witness to onlookers,
00:29:04 and that glorifies Jehovah.
00:29:06 Neighbors, family members,
00:29:09 government officials
00:29:11 see our love in action.
00:29:16 As a result, some actually come into the truth.
00:29:19 Please enjoy this video.
00:29:21 An unbelieving husband comes into the truth
00:29:25 as a result of our relief ministry.
00:29:32 I always loved my family.
00:29:34 I wanted the best for them.
00:29:36 So I worked to provide for them.
00:29:37 That’s my duty.
00:29:38 My wife got baptized two years before me.
00:29:43 I built our home right here.
00:29:45 Then one day, our lives changed forever.
00:29:50 This is my house,
00:29:53 so I have to start again.
00:29:56 Two brothers came to see me.
00:29:59 They said: “Don’t worry about a thing.
00:30:01 “Everything will be all right.
00:30:03 The brothers will take care of it.”
00:30:05 I thought, ‘Hmm, I don’t know if he knows what he’s talking about.’
00:30:11 When the brothers started showing up at my place to help,
00:30:13 I was thinking: ‘Why would they help me?
00:30:16 They don’t know me.’
00:30:19 Every morning I watched the brothers.
00:30:21 When they finished praying, everyone grabbed their tools and got to work.
00:30:25 I told my wife that this was unbelievable.
00:30:31 When I saw an elderly sister carrying concrete blocks
00:30:33 (they were so heavy for her),
00:30:36 I ran inside with tears in my eyes.
00:30:38 I didn’t want anyone to see me cry.
00:30:43 I thought, ‘Something is wrong with them for sure,
00:30:45 or something is wrong with me.’
00:30:50 I began to appreciate what they did and how they acted.
00:30:54 A lot of love —that is the only way I can put it—
00:30:56 a lot of love.
00:30:59 They even shared their food with me.
00:31:02 They made it clear that this work was a sign of Jehovah’s love.
00:31:07 And all those things touched my heart.
00:31:10 They let me know that, man,
00:31:12 this organization is for real,
00:31:14 and it’s the truth.
00:31:16 I wanted to be part of that.
00:31:19 I decided to give my life to Jehovah
00:31:21 because he showed me how much he loves both me and my family.
00:31:27 Now I take care of my family better than ever before.
00:31:41 So in review, our relief ministry
00:31:46 is a loving expression
00:31:49 from the God of comfort and relief whom we serve.
00:31:53 By means of it, Jehovah uses us to provide
00:31:57 physical, emotional, and spiritual relief to our brothers.
00:32:00 And it glorifies Jehovah
00:32:02 (1) by identifying us as true Christians,
00:32:06 (2) by uniting us as brothers and sisters
00:32:11 in love, prayer, action, and giving contributions,
00:32:15 and it glorifies Jehovah
00:32:18 (3) by attracting honesthearted ones to the truth.
00:32:23 How happy we are
00:32:25 that soon Jehovah will provide permanent relief!
00:32:30 There will be no more disasters.
00:32:32 But until that grand time,
00:32:35 we will continue to exert ourselves
00:32:38 in our relief ministry in behalf of our brothers.
00:32:42 Doing so will help us to remain focused on spiritual things,
00:32:46 it will unite us as brothers and sisters,
00:32:49 it will give a unique witness to onlookers,
00:32:53 and it will help prepare us
00:32:56 for the great tribulation
00:32:58 and the great reconstruction to follow.
00:33:12 Thank you, Brother Lett.
00:33:14 It’s a relief to know that the brotherhood provides relief
00:33:19 in times of disaster, isn’t it?
00:33:23 We now have a video we invite you to enjoy.
00:33:27 It is entitled
00:33:29 ‘The Good Hand of Our God Is Upon Us . . . Let Us Get Up and Build.’
00:33:43 Jehovah’s organization now cares
00:33:46 for almost 80,000 buildings worldwide,
00:33:49 with a total area of more than 215 million square feet,
00:33:55 or 20 million square meters.
00:33:57 That is the area
00:33:59 of about 2,800 soccer fields,
00:34:03 or six times the area of Central Park in Manhattan.
00:34:08 The scores of branch office buildings,
00:34:10 hundreds of Assembly Halls,
00:34:12 and tens of thousands of Kingdom Halls around the world
00:34:16 provide tangible proof
00:34:18 that God’s Kingdom is ruling.
00:34:21 Why can we say that?
00:34:24 As Psalm 127:1 reminds us,
00:34:27 none of this would be possible without Jehovah’s blessing.
00:34:33 Like Nehemiah and the Jews who rebuilt Jerusalem’s walls,
00:34:37 we are confident
00:34:39 that ‘the good hand of our God is upon us.’
00:34:44 These buildings have been dedicated to Jehovah.
00:34:47 So it is a privilege for us to make sure
00:34:50 that they continue to measure up to the purpose for which they were built.
00:34:54 Our branch facilities are especially well-maintained.
00:34:58 Some of these properties are relatively new,
00:35:02 but many others are 30 or more years old.
00:35:07 A building itself may last
30, 60, or even 100 years,
00:35:12 but building systems may reach the end of their life
00:35:15 after only 15 or 20 years.
00:35:18 So many of our facilities are in need
00:35:20 of major renovation or replacement.
00:35:23 Activities at Bethel are also changing.
00:35:27 So interior layouts sometimes need to be updated.
00:35:32 All of this presents a challenge:
00:35:35 How do we take care of our Bethel facilities
00:35:38 and still keep up with the work on our Kingdom Halls?
00:35:41 Indeed, what is the need?
00:35:43 How can we address it?
00:35:45 And how can you help?
00:35:47 Join us now on an encouraging trip around the world.
00:35:53 We want to show you what’s being done
00:35:55 and planned for our branch facilities.
00:35:58 Fasten your seat belts, please.
00:36:00 This report will be moving quickly.
00:36:07 Our brains are not good at noticing gradual change.
00:36:10 For this reason, the organization
00:36:12 began a program a few years ago
00:36:15 to evaluate the current and future needs
00:36:17 of our properties every two to three years.
00:36:20 And based on this assessment,
00:36:22 a decision can be made for each property
00:36:24 on whether or not to renovate and what that should involve.
00:36:29 At times, it makes more sense
00:36:31 to renovate or redevelop what we already have.
00:36:33 Major renovations have already started in branches that need it the most.
00:36:42 The Governing Body would like to see
00:36:44 more of the Bethelites care for their own personal services.
00:36:48 The offices always used to be
00:36:52 individual, for one person.
00:36:54 Now it’s better if the offices are open and use dividers
00:36:57 because these can be easily changed and modified
00:37:02 according to the necessity of the work.
00:37:09 Well, Patterson is a beautiful and practical complex.
00:37:12 I don’t think anyone envisioned
00:37:13 when the complex was built
00:37:15 that we would have over a thousand
00:37:16 of our brothers and sisters
00:37:17 visiting Bethel every day.
00:37:19 But having a visitor’s center is going to give them
00:37:22 an improved tour experience here at Patterson
00:37:25 and at the same time make sure that departments are able to do their work.
00:37:36 In 2013, the Governing Body decided
00:37:39 to merge the Finland branch with several other branches.
00:37:43 Additionally, the oldest parts of the facility were almost 60 years old.
00:37:49 We had been printing literature in Finland for 83 years.
00:37:53 But now, under the guidance of the Governing Body,
00:37:57 it was decided that we will stop printing in Finland
00:38:01 and use the space of the old printery
00:38:03 for new offices and other purposes.
00:38:08 We were a little concerned
00:38:10 where we would find all the needed volunteers.
00:38:13 When we told about our needs to local congregations,
00:38:18 the applications started to flow in.
00:38:21 We realized that here we have
00:38:24 fine young brothers and sisters.
00:38:28 It has been touching, really touching,
00:38:30 to see their willing spirit.
00:38:34 Sometimes, it’s not practical to renovate a property,
00:38:38 so we would purchase or build new buildings
00:38:41 and then sell the old ones.
00:38:43 This was recently decided, for example,
00:38:46 in Argentina, Cameroon, and India.
00:38:54 Our Bethel family decreased
00:38:56 from around 350 to 150.
00:39:00 The multiple buildings were spread across several properties,
00:39:04 and with the reduction, many of them were no longer being used.
00:39:08 It was decided that our Bethel facilities be sold
00:39:12 and to begin a search for a new Bethel facility.
00:39:16 The timing had to be precise
00:39:18 between the purchase and construction of a new facility
00:39:22 and the sale of all current properties.
00:39:26 We saw Jehovah’s direction clearly.
00:39:29 On the one hand, we had the sale of all the properties,
00:39:33 and on the other hand, the purchase of the new project.
00:39:38 Both processes climaxed within the same 24-hour period.
00:39:48 The Kingdom preaching work
00:39:49 has sped up in our branch territory.
00:39:51 We’ve experienced a 4 percent increase
00:39:52 in Cameroon
00:39:53 like we’ve never experienced before.
00:39:55 We’re now translating into 29 different languages.
00:39:58 We did consider renovating our present location,
00:40:02 but how do you continue the work
00:40:05 in a tiny branch while a renovation is happening around you?
00:40:08 We had a piece of land right next to one of our major Assembly Halls
00:40:12 in one of the biggest cities in our branch territory.
00:40:14 But sadly, the access was terrible
00:40:17 —a dirty, muddy road, very difficult to access either in a car
00:40:21 or on foot.
00:40:24 All of a sudden something amazing happened.
00:40:26 The local government decided to build a road right outside our Assembly Hall,
00:40:31 thus giving us access to this piece of land.
00:40:34 It was Jehovah saying,
00:40:35 ‘This is the piece of land where you should build the new Cameroon branch.’
00:40:43 Our facility was now oversized for our real needs.
00:40:47 The Governing Body directed that we sell this property
00:40:51 and relocate the branch to a more economical facility.
00:40:55 We realized that we were millions of dollars short
00:40:58 of the needed funds.
00:41:00 We needed a buyer who would agree to buy
00:41:03 the facility at the right price,
00:41:05 give us enough money in advance to pay for the new branch,
00:41:09 and allow us to keep using the existing branch
00:41:12 till the new one was ready.
00:41:14 We felt very helpless.
00:41:18 Just a few days before we were scheduled to sign up for the new branch,
00:41:22 a buyer, who had shown interest
00:41:25 but had not yet committed to anything,
00:41:28 signed a binding agreement and met all our conditions.
00:41:31 He also provided a large amount of a nonrefundable deposit
00:41:36 to help us to purchase the new branch.
00:41:38 Nothing is impossible for Jehovah.
00:41:41 He timed everything perfectly.
00:41:44 Many more projects like these are in the planning stages.
00:41:49 We want all of our properties to keep meeting the organization’s needs
00:41:53 and reflecting well on Jehovah.
00:41:57 Besides renovations,
00:41:59 many of our branch facilities are again being used to capacity.
00:42:06 The number of publishers, commuters, remote volunteers,
00:42:10 and Bethelites has increased worldwide.
00:42:14 Some countries have seen an increase of 5, 7, or more percent
00:42:17 in the number of publishers each year.
00:42:19 More work is also being done worldwide
00:42:23 in translation,  video production,
00:42:27 digital publishing, and other important areas.
00:42:30 The organization pursues every avenue
00:42:33 to make our Bethel operations more efficient.
00:42:37 But we will always need people to do much of the work.
00:42:41 Therefore, planning has already begun to see
00:42:43 where additional expansion might be needed.
00:42:48 We have many world headquarters departments
00:42:50 involved in the planning process to give input.
00:42:53 Also, the Branch Committee is involved in this.
00:42:57 Before any facility is recommended for expansion, questions are asked.
00:43:01 For example, is this expansion going to directly advance
00:43:06 the preaching and teaching activity in the country?
00:43:10 Could it be that with some operational changes,
00:43:12 the function of the branch
00:43:14 could be discontinued in some way
00:43:17 or outsourced or simplified in some way
00:43:21 to mean that we wouldn’t need to expand?
00:43:23 With recent changes in Bethel operations,
00:43:27 it is possible for us now to buy standard apartments
00:43:31 and offices for a Bethel facility.
00:43:34 If we need more offices and apartments, we buy them from the market.
00:43:39 And as these options are investigated,
00:43:41 we look for Jehovah’s hand in this.
00:43:43 What is the evidence that his spirit is behind one of these options?
00:43:47 The Governing Body has asked all of us
00:43:50 “to give priority to those activities
00:43:53 “that contribute the most to the spiritual welfare of God’s people
00:43:58 and the advancement of the global preaching work.”
00:44:02 This principle helps us to prioritize our efforts worldwide.
00:44:09 There is definitely a lot to do.
00:44:12 But it is really exciting to see
00:44:15 the good hand of Jehovah on his people today.
00:44:19 The brothers and sisters everywhere
00:44:22 are zealously supporting this work with their time,
00:44:25 financial resources, and prayers.
00:44:31 We are confident that Jehovah God will continue to bless
00:44:34 the collective efforts to provide the facilities the organization needs.
00:44:40 And the skills we are learning
00:44:42 not only benefit us now
00:44:45 but into the future —right into God’s new world.
00:44:59 Thank you, brothers, for bringing us up-to-date
00:45:01 on what is happening with our Bethel facilities around the world.
00:45:06 When Nehemiah prepared to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls,
00:45:10 he took a prayerful and practical approach.
00:45:14 Jehovah blessed that approach
00:45:16 because Nehemiah acted in faith
00:45:19 and relied fully on Jehovah.
00:45:22 When the people saw that Jehovah’s good hand was on Nehemiah,
00:45:26 they said: “Let us get up and build.”
00:45:30 Well, the Governing Body today makes facility decisions
00:45:33 in a similar way.
00:45:35 They prayerfully analyze what is needed.
00:45:38 They make sure we have the necessary resources to finish the work.
00:45:43 And then they present to God’s people
00:45:46 what they have in mind to do
00:45:48 and ask for their support.
00:45:51 So, what is left for us to say?
00:45:54 Thank you for your loyal support
00:45:57 in the days ahead of all these important initiatives.
00:46:01 Jehovah will bless you too
00:46:03 for your willing and generous spirit.
00:46:07 And now, it’s time for us too
00:46:10 to get up and build.
00:46:21 Maintenance, renovation,
00:46:23 and new construction are ongoing projects.
00:46:27 But how does the Governing Body decide
00:46:29 when and where to build new facilities?
00:46:33 We searched our archived video files
00:46:36 and found some comments from some brothers
00:46:38 who were involved in property acquisition in years past.
00:46:43 These comments predate the more recent decision
00:46:46 to move world headquarters out of Brooklyn, New York.
00:46:50 Please enjoy this faith-strengthening video entitled
00:46:54 A Historic Look at Property Acquisitions.
00:48:28 Well, originally the reason
00:48:30 we bought the Watchtower Farm
00:48:33 was that the family
00:48:34 was growing here in Brooklyn,
00:48:35 and Mountain Farm was limited
00:48:38 because it was only 100 and some acres (40 ha).
00:48:40 So Brother Knorr approved of us buying a piece of land.
00:48:53 The brother there said
00:48:55 to both George and Max,
00:48:57 “Well, you know,
00:48:59 “we just had a family business meeting
00:49:02 “just a few days ago,
00:49:04 and we want to sell our property, our farm.”
00:49:10 And the interesting thing is that Brother Knorr said:
00:49:13 “This is only going to be for a farm.
00:49:17 “Don’t get any ideas of anything else.
00:49:20 It’s for a farm.”
00:49:22 Well, back in 1960 when we bought that much land,
00:49:27 we had no idea of a printery.
00:49:30 But what did the Lord have in mind for it?
00:49:32 He had in mind to put the printery there.
00:49:36 We were zealously going after a farm,
00:49:39 but we didn’t need string beans and potatoes.
00:49:43 We needed books and Bibles printed up there.
00:49:46 And so we see the good results of it today.
00:49:49 What a difference!
00:49:51 Who could ever think
00:49:54 that Watchtower Farms could turn into being
00:49:58 the United States branch of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:50:03 That to me is a wonderful example
00:50:07 of Jehovah leading the organization.
00:50:13 So we started in 1980
00:50:15 looking for suitable property
00:50:18 out of the city for expansion.
00:50:21 One time, we looked at a piece of property over in Jersey.
00:50:25 It was an old school, but the buildings were so bad
00:50:27 that we would’ve never gotten them fixed up.
00:50:30 And so we told the real estate man,
00:50:32 “No, we really don’t want it —no use in looking anymore.”
00:50:36 Well, he got a little upset,
00:50:39 and he said, “Well, what do you want?”
00:50:42 And I said, “What we really want
00:50:44 “is something up near Suffern or Brewster,
00:50:48 “about five or six hundred acres (200-240 ha) of land
00:50:52 “where there are roads and hills
00:50:56 and scenery and water and all that,”
00:50:59 thinking he’d never find it
00:51:01 because we’d looked all over the country.
00:51:03 Well, the next day, about 11 o’clock, he called me on the phone.
00:51:07 He said, “I found your property.”
00:51:09 I took it up with the Governing Body,
00:51:12 and we looked at the property, and they loved it.
00:51:16 We told the town that we wanted four or five hundred people.
00:51:21 Well, before we got our final permit to build,
00:51:25 we had it up to 1,500,
00:51:27 and we’re looking to adjust here and there
00:51:31 to accommodate what we need there now.
00:51:47 How these projects have met the organization’s need is amazing
00:51:52 —and at the proper time—
00:51:54 every one of these, no matter what!
00:51:58 Today, we have millions in the truth.
00:52:01 And the Bible tells us that we’re going to grow and fill the earth.
00:52:04 How many millions of people
00:52:07 we’ll have in the truth when Armageddon comes, we don’t know.
00:52:10 We don’t know when Armageddon is coming.
00:52:13 We’re not going backward;
00:52:16 we’re going to continue to go ahead
00:52:18 doing things more efficiently.
00:52:21 It means you’re going to have to expand; you’re going to have to build.
00:52:25 So you have to always be looking ahead.
00:52:28 Right to the end, we’re going to be giving out
00:52:31 spiritual food at the right time.
00:52:33 We don’t know what the Lord is going to use
00:52:36 after the great tribulation, immediately.
00:52:39 As Brother Couch said
00:52:41 (and Brother Larson felt the same way):
00:52:44 “The Lord is running the organization,
00:52:47 “so we’ve got to follow him.
00:52:49 And whatever he tells us, we do it.”
00:53:01 It’s so interesting to see Jehovah’s direction
00:53:05 in locating useful properties,
00:53:08 and that brings us to a related subject.
00:53:10 The title of the next video is
00:53:13 A New Construction Project Is Being Planned.
00:53:18 Please watch and enjoy the following presentation.
00:53:25 We live in a time when technology
00:53:28 has allowed us to communicate
00:53:30 the truth of God’s Word
00:53:33 in new and exciting ways.
00:53:36 Our modern world has seen advancements in printing,
00:53:40 radio, television, computers and, of course, the Internet.
00:53:46 You likely can remember a time just a few short years ago
00:53:50 when we released only a handful of videos every year.
00:53:54 But these now number into the hundreds,
00:53:57 with videos created for use in the ministry,
00:54:01 midweek meetings,
00:54:04 JW Broadcasting® programs,
00:54:07 regional conventions,
00:54:10 and we can’t forget the Become Jehovah’s Friend  series.
00:54:19 Jehovah’s organization
00:54:21 has made use of videos over the years,
00:54:23 over the decades.
00:54:25 But from 2014 forward,
00:54:28 we have seen a dramatic increase in the use
00:54:30 of videos, and that has really impacted how we teach
00:54:35 and how we reach hearts.
00:54:37 Because of the demand for more videos, more space was needed.
00:54:40 So we purchased the Mt. Ebo property,
00:54:43 and there we have been making many of our large video productions.
00:54:48 Well, the response
00:54:49 from the brothers and sisters in the field has been outstanding;
00:54:52 it’s been amazing!
00:54:54 It’s actually been very encouraging for the Teaching Committee
00:54:56 and the Governing Body to see how the brothers and sisters appreciate
00:55:00 the videos, the music,
00:55:04 and the recordings that are produced.
00:55:06 It’s helping them to really understand the teaching points in God’s Word.
00:55:11 It helps them to deal with the anxieties and pressures of life.
00:55:15 It really helps them to appreciate too what’s happening around the world
00:55:18 when they hear reports, dramatizations, and interviews.
00:55:24 With this explosive growth
00:55:26 and even more coming on the horizon,
00:55:29 the Governing Body has determined
00:55:31 it’s Jehovah’s direction
00:55:34 that we take further steps to support this expanded use of video.
00:55:39 So we are thrilled to announce an exciting initiative
00:55:43 currently underway to accomplish this:
00:55:46 The creation of a site dedicated primarily
00:55:49 to media production.
00:55:52 The building of a new facility in Ramapo, New York.
00:56:03 Yes, the Governing Body has approved construction
00:56:06 of an additional world headquarters complex
00:56:09 on a 248-acre property purchased in 2009.
00:56:16 The property is located two miles, or about three kilometers,
00:56:20 from the existing world headquarters facility in Warwick.
00:56:25 Our objective is to build a facility
00:56:28 similar in size to Warwick,
00:56:30 which would include ten residence buildings,
00:56:34 a main office building, eight studio spaces
00:56:37 for audio/video productions,
00:56:39 a multipurpose space
00:56:42 —including kitchen, dining, and meeting area—
00:56:45 plus, a visitors’ center.
00:56:48 This will culminate in a location capable
00:56:50 of housing over 1,000 volunteers,
00:56:54 with 920 office spaces, and will accommodate
00:56:58 Audio/Video Services,
00:57:02 Text Processing,
00:57:04 Writing Correspondence,
00:57:06 and the Art Department.
00:57:10 Planning and engineering are already underway.
00:57:12 We are beginning our discussions with the local authorities on this project.
00:57:16 And, Jehovah willing,
00:57:18 we hope to start site work in 2022
00:57:22 and have a completed facility
00:57:25 by December 31, 2026.
00:57:28 One year ago this week in October,
00:57:32 the Teaching Committee was discussing
00:57:35 all that has been asked of Audio/Video Services
00:57:38 —all the videos that they’re producing.
00:57:40 And we could see that it was a little bit difficult because this
00:57:43 department was spread out over four different complexes,
00:57:47 10 different buildings,
00:57:49 and 16 different floors.
00:57:52 So working together and collaborating
00:57:54 has been a little difficult by being spread out.
00:57:57 If you go back some years,
00:57:59 it was planned
00:58:00 to increase the Bethel facility,
00:58:02 expand the Bethel facility,
00:58:04 at Patterson, New York.
00:58:05 Yet, at that time, there were two large construction projects underway
00:58:09 at Wallkill and Warwick.
00:58:12 So another construction project
00:58:14 was just not feasible at that time.
00:58:16 But Audio/Video Services still had needs —immediate needs.
00:58:20 So at that time the Governing Body approved to purchase the building
00:58:24 at Mt. Ebo as a temporary solution.
00:58:28 The use of video in our teaching programs was exploding,
00:58:32 and so there was a need
00:58:34 for much more studio space
00:58:36 and the associated spaces
00:58:39 to support video production.
00:58:41 After searching
00:58:43 the area of Patterson for additional space,
00:58:46 this property at Mt. Ebo rose to the top.
00:58:49 It was a smooth transaction,
00:58:52 and we were renovating and using this space very quickly,
00:58:57 which all of us have benefited from since.
00:59:00 And the intent was that AVS would use it for ten years or so,
00:59:05 and then when a more permanent facility became available,
00:59:08 Mt. Ebo would be sold to recoup the original purchase price.
00:59:13 So Ramapo
00:59:15 will become that more permanent studio location.
00:59:19 When any functional department is split up
00:59:21 over multiple locations,
00:59:23 it can involve a degree of inefficiency
00:59:26 and it can also involve
00:59:27 a doubling up of tasks,
00:59:29 which creates a complex framework
00:59:31 for anyone to operate in.
00:59:33 So having all Audio/Video Services operating out of one facility
00:59:38 will surely mean a much more collaborative environment
00:59:42 for those brothers and sisters to work in.
00:59:44 And the end result, obviously, won’t affect the preaching work that we do
00:59:48 or the teaching that we get in our meetings, at the assemblies, and conventions.
00:59:53 To be able to consolidate the operations,
00:59:57 a design was put together
00:59:59 and costing was put to the design.
01:00:01 That was presented to the Governing Body,
01:00:04 and they gave us the OK to go ahead and then meet again
01:00:07 with the town of Ramapo
01:00:09 —which, now a decade later, was an entirely new group of officials—
01:00:13 to meet with them to see if we’d still get the same positive reception.
01:00:16 And we had an excellent reception from them.
01:00:20 They seemed to welcome us with open arms.
01:00:23 Obviously, we’re going to have to meet their code and criteria,
01:00:26 but they seem as though they want to have us
01:00:29 develop that site as an audio/video facility.
01:00:33 Over the period of time that we held the property,
01:00:35 we tried to sell it at different times.
01:00:38 But despite our best efforts
01:00:41 and a variety of different marketing exercises,
01:00:45 there was very little interest expressed
01:00:49 in the property at the time.
01:00:52 And so when we began thinking about expansion again,
01:00:55 it was logical to look to a property we already owned.
01:00:58 For almost a year now, we’ve been working
01:01:01 with preconstruction activities.
01:01:03 And, of course, that means thousands and thousands of hours
01:01:06 in project planning and project design
01:01:09 to be able to meet the requirements
01:01:11 of the town and the state to be able to obtain
01:01:15 a building permit for the project.
01:01:17 And, of course, once that building permit is obtained
01:01:21 and we’ve actually put shovel to the ground,
01:01:23 then we would expect that we’d have four years or less
01:01:27 to actually deliver the project.
01:01:29 In recent projects
01:01:31 that the Governing Body has directed,
01:01:34 such as the Britain branch,
01:01:37 adaptability was foremost in the design of the offices.
01:01:41 So, therefore, office space
01:01:43 could be reconfigured as the needs of departments
01:01:47 and functions at the branch changed.
01:01:49 On the Britain project, some of the exciting
01:01:52 new design features were, for example—
01:01:54 There was no central laundry.
01:01:55 So each room has laundry facilities in it
01:02:00 so that the occupant can do their own laundry.
01:02:03 The multipurpose building on that site is a building
01:02:06 that can be easily configured
01:02:08 for various different functions.
01:02:10 Creating a building
01:02:12 that is modular allows the brothers,
01:02:15 as the needs evolve,
01:02:17 to modify the building with the smallest
01:02:20 amount of renovation cost possible.
01:02:22 These new design features are very flexible in their nature,
01:02:26 and that’s very helpful because our dynamic organization
01:02:29 is moving quickly, and change is coming fast as well.
01:02:32 That allows us to move with it.
01:02:34 We can reconfigure spaces without any major expense
01:02:38 and keep up with those changes that are being made.
01:02:41 The Ramapo audio/video studios
01:02:44 will be the largest in our organization.
01:02:46 There have been other audio/video studios constructed around the world,
01:02:49 and lessons learned from these are already being brought forward
01:02:53 to the Ramapo AV studio.
01:02:56 But that means we need you.
01:03:00 We need your prayers, your support, your strong backs
01:03:03 because this project  will call for thousands of volunteers,
01:03:07 with as many as 1,500 volunteers a day
01:03:11 during the peak of construction.
01:03:14 But we have utmost confidence
01:03:16 at Psalm 110:3, where it says:
01:03:19 “Your people will offer themselves willingly
01:03:22 on the day of your military force.”
01:03:25 So do not hold back.
01:03:28 Do whatever you can to support this exciting new initiative.
01:03:33 We will need thousands upon thousands of willing volunteers
01:03:36 who are available for one week to one month or six months,
01:03:40 whatever the case may be,
01:03:42 to help with this project.
01:03:44 On recent large-scale projects, we found it very successful
01:03:47 to hire contractors for the specialized
01:03:50 and for the heavily mechanized parts of the work,
01:03:53 such as the steel superstructures
01:03:55 or the concrete superstructures of the buildings,
01:03:58 the building envelopes,
01:03:59 cladding, or roofing,
01:04:01 and then to get volunteers
01:04:03 to carry out the all-important hidden work,
01:04:06 where the detail really makes the difference
01:04:08 —for example, the underground utilities for the site works,
01:04:11 the mechanical and electrical fit out of the buildings,
01:04:14 as well as the all-important finishes.
01:04:16 We want to work with the LDC
01:04:19 to identify brothers and sisters
01:04:21 that can help and be trained now.
01:04:23 They could either be assigned
01:04:25 to local projects with the LDC
01:04:27 or some of them could be invited  to start helping on renovation projects
01:04:30 like the one at Patterson.
01:04:32 And this will allow us to start giving them valuable training now
01:04:35 that will be useful on the Ramapo project.
01:04:38 We’re hoping that on the Ramapo project,
01:04:41 Jehovah’s spirit will energize the brotherhood again
01:04:45 as it did at Warwick and also on the Britain project.
01:04:47 Really, from the initial concept design
01:04:50 to the estimating and establishing budgets
01:04:52 and reviewing the personnel needs all the way
01:04:56 to the first initial meetings with the town,
01:04:58 prayerful consideration was given
01:05:00 by all the brothers and sisters involved.
01:05:02 And so we could really see in every one of those decisions
01:05:05 that Jehovah was steering this project,
01:05:07 and he knows already how it will be completed.
01:05:11 Going back more than a decade ago
01:05:13 from between 2005 to 2009
01:05:16 when we were searching for property,
01:05:18 these two properties became available,
01:05:20 and they both seemed as though they were suitable.
01:05:23 And it was the organization’s decision to go with one and not develop the other.
01:05:28 Now when it seems like there is a real need,
01:05:30 we can develop the second property that we already have (that we already own)
01:05:35 and that we already have a good reception with.
01:05:38 To me, those things are faith-strengthening because what I see
01:05:41 is that the work we were doing a decade ago
01:05:44 and that the brothers and sisters
01:05:46 were involved with (and the Branch Committee)—
01:05:48 We didn’t know what the outcome might be.
01:05:51 And we didn’t know what the use might be over this last decade.
01:05:54 But now what we have is something
01:05:57 that can be very suitable as we move forward, and to me that’s faith-strengthening.
01:06:00 I see Jehovah’s hand in that.
01:06:02 Projects like this, in addition to serving a very practical need,
01:06:07 offer an opportunity for Jehovah’s people
01:06:10 to show their thankfulness and their zeal for him.
01:06:15 And as we experienced with Warwick,
01:06:19 just the project alone and the participation
01:06:22 of our brothers and sisters from all over the country
01:06:26 resulted in a spiritual blessing
01:06:29 to thousands of individuals, their families, and their congregations.
01:06:34 And we fully expect this project
01:06:36 will have the same positive effect.
01:06:40 On a project of this scale,
01:06:43 the early strategic decisions are absolutely crucial.
01:06:46 Now with what we’ve seen;
01:06:48 with the design and project-planning teams coming together;
01:06:53 with the plans for the support, feeding,
01:06:56 housing, and care of the volunteers;
01:06:59 with the spirit that’s already evident among those who are involved in the project;
01:07:04 and also the strong backing of the Governing Body,
01:07:06 we clearly see that Jehovah’s hand is with us.
01:07:10 James 4:8 states:
01:07:13 “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”
01:07:17 Yes, Jehovah is allowing ones
01:07:20 every opportunity to draw close to him as never before.
01:07:25 And he is speaking to them through his inspired Word
01:07:29 as well as vivid artwork, beautiful music,
01:07:33 and heart-touching videos.
01:07:35 And it’s the feeling of the entire Governing Body
01:07:39 that this new site will allow us
01:07:42 to produce even more wonderful products
01:07:44 to help us to do just that.
01:08:27 It’s good to note your enthusiasm.
01:08:31 How encouraging to hear that information!
01:08:35 This was the first part.
01:08:37 In Parts 2 and 3 of the annual meeting,
01:08:40 you’ll hear six talks by Governing Body members
01:08:43 that refine our understanding of Bible truths
01:08:47 and strengthen our trust in Jehovah.
01:08:50 Make sure to watch them when they appear
01:08:53 in the Video On Demand section of JW Broadcasting
01:08:56 in the next few weeks.
01:08:59 To conclude this month’s program, let’s travel to Papua New Guinea.
01:09:04 It is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
01:09:07 Papua New Guinea covers
01:09:09 the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and includes
01:09:14 other islands and atolls.
01:09:16 There are three official languages in Papua New Guinea:
01:09:20 English, Hiri Motu,
01:09:22 and the most widely used official language —Tok Pisin.
01:09:26 Besides these 3 official languages,
01:09:29 it is estimated that there are
01:09:32 over 800 other languages spoken here.
01:09:36 Many of these have fewer than 1,000 people.
01:09:41 This presents a huge challenge in the ministry.
01:09:45 Our brothers use preaching carts in high-traffic areas
01:09:49 to catch the attention of those passing by,
01:09:53 and they use the videos available in the local language
01:09:57 to teach the good news.
01:09:59 In the Kwaivagolo Congregation,
01:10:02 they walk up to five hours
01:10:05 just to reach their scattered territory.
01:10:07 Their determination in the preaching work
01:10:10 is producing good fruit.
01:10:12 The 34 publishers
01:10:14 are conducting an average of 38 Bible studies.
01:10:19 They hold their congregation meetings in Hiri Motu,
01:10:22 and their preaching is done primarily
01:10:25 in the local language of Tubulamo.
01:10:29 When building the Kingdom Hall,
01:10:31 these brothers did all of the excavation manually,
01:10:34 since machines were not available.
01:10:37 Then they carried all of the building supplies
01:10:40 up the mountain by hand
01:10:42 —a trip that takes two to three hours.
01:10:47 Our brothers send you their warm love and greetings,
01:10:52 and we send ours in return.
01:10:55 May Jehovah bless their love and their zeal for his name.
01:11:00 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:11:03 this is JW Broadcasting.

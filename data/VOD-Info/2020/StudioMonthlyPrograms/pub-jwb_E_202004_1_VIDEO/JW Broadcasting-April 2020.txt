00:00:01 Welcome to our program.
00:00:04 This month’s theme is
00:00:06 “You Are Precious to Jehovah.”
00:00:09 Here are some highlights.
00:00:11 When we’re going through difficult times,
00:00:13 does Jehovah notice?
00:00:15 As we’ll learn in Malu’s experience,
00:00:18 Jehovah does care and he helps us overcome
00:00:22 even the most challenging circumstances.
00:00:25 Prayer is a powerful way
00:00:27 that we can ask for and receive loving comfort from Jehovah.
00:00:31 We’ll see that in our new music video.
00:00:34 Soon, all over the earth,
00:00:36 Jehovah’s Witnesses will be inviting people
00:00:38 to this year’s conventions.
00:00:40 Can attending a convention change a person’s life?
00:00:44 We’ll find out in this report.
00:00:47 Welcome to the April 2020 edition
00:00:50 of JW Broadcasting®!
00:01:12 We begin with the experience of Juan Pablo Zermeño.
00:01:16 Notice how he found a life of real meaning and purpose.
00:01:25 When you’re little, you just want to be happy.
00:01:36 But sadly, my father had a problem with alcohol,
00:01:47 and no child wants to live through that.
00:01:51 One day, my family from the United States came to visit us.
00:01:58 They looked so happy!
00:02:00 The way they talked, it was as though they only had fun
00:02:04 —a good life with no economic problems.
00:02:10 I was shocked.
00:02:12 I asked myself, ‘How can we live
00:02:14 in such poverty while their life is so great?’
00:02:17 That was the life I wanted for my family.
00:02:29 So when I was nine years old,
00:02:35 I left my mother and the rest of my family
00:02:37 to cross the border into the United States.
00:02:42 I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood.
00:02:46 So I joined a local gym to learn how to defend myself.
00:02:53 The trainer, Leo, was like a father to me.
00:02:57 He always tried to give us good advice.
00:03:01 Raymond was part of the boxing team.
00:03:05 He was a good friend.
00:03:07 We got along really well.
00:03:09 He respected me, and he looked after me.
00:03:13 After several years of being around Raymond
00:03:15 and the other members of the team, I felt really comfortable.
00:03:20 To some extent, I admired him
00:03:22 because I could see that he was really doing well,
00:03:25 because Raymond was selling drugs.
00:03:28 I knew that it wasn’t right.
00:03:31 But in time,
00:03:33 I began to sell drugs as well.
00:03:36 Raymond was in a drug deal gone wrong,
00:03:40 and he was murdered.
00:03:45 I said to myself, ‘This could happen to me too.’
00:03:50 It had been six years since I had seen my mom and my siblings.
00:04:06 My mother was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:12 It helped her to cope with a lot of suffering.
00:04:14 It brought her peace.
00:04:16 She was so happy.
00:04:21 I began to realize that this was what I really needed.
00:04:26 I also thought about my friends at the gym.
00:04:28 I wanted them to understand why life was so hard for all of us,
00:04:33 so I returned to the United States.
00:04:36 But they weren’t interested.
00:04:40 My trainer, Leo, told me that I didn’t need to sell drugs anymore;
00:04:44 he could make me a professional boxer,
00:04:48 and I could help out my family in that way.
00:04:50 He even gave me the nickname The Bible Boy.
00:05:03 But I realized that that was just a temporary solution.
00:05:07 What I was learning was going to help me forever.
00:05:10 I was determined to serve Jehovah.
00:05:14 I returned to Mexico.
00:05:16 I started to study the Bible and take it seriously.
00:05:19 I began to view Jehovah as my Father
00:05:22 because he helped me to find real relief from my pain,
00:05:26 to have peace —a tranquility that makes you
00:05:29 feel accepted, loved, and wanted.
00:05:34 I have enjoyed an incredible life serving Jehovah.
00:05:42 Decades later, my father was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:05:47 Jehovah has been so kind to me,
00:05:49 my family, and my siblings.
00:05:52 Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah for the life he’s given me.
00:05:59 I’ve had so many blessings in my life: a wonderful wife
00:06:03 and great friends,
00:06:05 including those that I serve
00:06:07 alongside of in Bethel.
00:06:09 I’m not on my own anymore.
00:06:12 Jehovah has given me a life full of real meaning, purpose,
00:06:17 and so much happiness.
00:06:21 Can you imagine leaving your home at the age of nine?
00:06:26 Juan Pablo sought a better life,
00:06:28 but that only led to danger and disappointment.
00:06:32 Juan Pablo said that it was Jehovah who gave him
00:06:35 “a life full of real meaning, purpose, and . . . happiness.”
00:06:39 Juan Pablo is precious to Jehovah.
00:06:44 As we mentioned—
00:06:45 Our theme for this month’s program is
00:06:48 “You Are Precious to Jehovah.”
00:06:51 How vital it is
00:06:53 that we remind ourselves of that!
00:06:55 Why?
00:06:57 Well, let’s consider three reasons.
00:07:00 First, Satan wants us to believe
00:07:02 that Jehovah doesn’t love us or value our service.
00:07:06 He wanted Job to believe that.
00:07:09 But that was a lie in Job’s day, and it’s still a lie today.
00:07:16 A second reason that we need to be reminded that we’re precious to Jehovah
00:07:20 is because of negative circumstances
00:07:22 or events that have taken place in our life.
00:07:26 Severe illness, advancing years, injustices,
00:07:30 mistreatment, a difficult family life, or other situations
00:07:35 may cause some brothers and sisters to feel that they’re just not worth loving.
00:07:41 Some may question why Jehovah allows those things to happen.
00:07:46 Finally, we need reminders of how Jehovah feels about us
00:07:50 because our imperfection can cause us to have negative thoughts.
00:07:55 Some may still punish themselves for past mistakes,
00:07:58 doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them
00:08:01 or that he could ever love them.
00:08:03 Others wage a constant battle against feelings of worthlessness.
00:08:09 One Witness wrote:
00:08:11 “Satan has done an excellent job of making
00:08:14 “even those who love Jehovah feel worthless and unlovable.
00:08:19 “. . . I never felt worthy of Jehovah’s love,
00:08:22 “so I tried to do more and more in his service
00:08:24 “as a way of earning that love.
00:08:27 “. . . So no matter how many hours I spent in the ministry,
00:08:30 “or how many people I helped, I felt it was not enough.
00:08:34 I saw only the lack in me.”
00:08:38 One brother stated:
00:08:41 “I came from a family that showed little love.
00:08:44 “I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.
00:08:48 “So, early in life I felt worthless.
00:08:52 “I still carry entrenched feelings from my past
00:08:55 “that beat me down when I experience calamity.
00:08:59 “When I stopped serving as a congregation elder,
00:09:02 “I felt like a failure as usual
00:09:05 —to God, my family, and my brothers in the congregation.”
00:09:11 If you’ve experienced such feelings,
00:09:14 you’re not alone.
00:09:16 So how can you be assured of Jehovah’s interest?
00:09:20 Let’s examine three lines of evidence
00:09:22 that prove you’re precious to Jehovah.
00:09:26 First, we’ll examine Jehovah’s feelings for the nation of Israel.
00:09:31 Second, we’ll reflect on an event recorded in the Gospels.
00:09:35 And third, we’ll consider a modern-day example
00:09:38 of one who was very precious to God.
00:09:44 By the end of the 16th century B.C.E.,
00:09:47 millions of Israelites were enslaved in Egypt,
00:09:49 where they were severely oppressed.
00:09:52 In their distress, the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.
00:09:57 How did he feel?
00:09:59 Turn with me to Isaiah 63:9.
00:10:03 The A portion reads:
00:10:05 “During all their distress
00:10:08 it was distressing to him.”
00:10:11 Did you notice?
00:10:13 Not only did Jehovah see their troubles
00:10:16 but he felt for his people,
00:10:18 and he was moved to act in their behalf.
00:10:21 Isaiah 63:9 goes on to say:
00:10:25 “In his love and compassion he repurchased them.”
00:10:31 Jehovah couldn’t see their suffering or hear their outcries
00:10:34 without feeling for them and doing something about it.
00:10:39 That may remind us of the loving concern
00:10:41 that a mother has for her newborn child.
00:10:44 When that baby cries,
00:10:46 the mother takes notice
00:10:48 and she feels for her child.
00:10:51 In fact, notice how this is expressed at Isaiah 49:15.
00:10:56 It reads:
00:10:58 “Can a woman forget her nursing child
00:11:01 “or have no compassion for the son of her womb?
00:11:05 “Even if these women forget,
00:11:08 I would never forget you.”
00:11:12 It’s hard to imagine a mother forgetting to nourish and care for her nursing child.
00:11:17 That baby is helpless
00:11:19 —day and night it needs its mother’s attention.
00:11:22 Sad to say, however,
00:11:24 that we hear at times of such maternal neglect.
00:11:28 But what did Jehovah say to reassure the Israelites?
00:11:32 “I would never forget you.”
00:11:36 Yes, the tender compassion that Jehovah felt for his servants
00:11:40 was immeasurably stronger
00:11:42 than one of the most tender and natural feelings we can imagine
00:11:47 —the compassion a mother normally feels for her baby.
00:11:52 Jehovah’s feelings for the Israelites
00:11:54 are summed up in another expression in the book of Isaiah.
00:11:57 Please read with me Isaiah 43:4:
00:12:01 “For you became precious in my eyes,
00:12:06 you were honored, and I have loved you.”
00:12:11 Jehovah clearly expressed his feelings for his people.
00:12:16 As one of Jehovah’s servants,
00:12:18 you can be sure that he also loves you most tenderly.
00:12:23 No matter what trials you’re facing now or have endured in the past,
00:12:27 Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.
00:12:31 When you hurt, he hurts.
00:12:34 You’re far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.
00:12:39 He remembers your past efforts,
00:12:41 and he sees your continuing efforts to please him.
00:12:46 Notice how Jehovah promises to sustain and comfort his people
00:12:50 according to Isaiah 66:12, 13:
00:12:55 “You will nurse and be carried on the hip,
00:12:59 “and you will be bounced on the knees.
00:13:03 “As a mother comforts her son,
00:13:05 so I will keep comforting you.”
00:13:09 What a heartwarming scene!
00:13:12 Imagine a loving mother carrying a baby on her hip
00:13:15 or bouncing him on her knees.
00:13:18 In this way,
00:13:20 Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity
00:13:23 and tenderness of his love for you.
00:13:26 Just as Jehovah loved his people, Israel,
00:13:29 he likewise feels that you are very precious and dear
00:13:34 —never doubt that!
00:13:38 A second example of how Jehovah feels
00:13:40 about his faithful servants can be found in the Gospels.
00:13:44 Let’s read what happened on one occasion
00:13:46 when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem
00:13:49 at Luke 21:1-4:
00:13:53 “Now as he looked up,
00:13:55 “he saw the rich dropping their gifts
00:13:57 “into the treasury chests.
00:14:00 “Then he saw a needy widow drop in
00:14:03 “two small coins of very little value,
00:14:07 “and he said:
00:14:09 “‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow
00:14:12 “‘put in more than they all did.
00:14:14 “‘For all of these put in gifts
00:14:16 “‘out of their surplus,
00:14:18 “‘but she, out of her want
00:14:21 “‘[or as the footnote says, “poverty”],
00:14:24 put in all the means of living she had.’”
00:14:29 The study note for verse 2
00:14:31 in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
00:14:34 tells us that the Greek word for “needy” may describe
00:14:37 “a person who lacks the basic necessities of life
00:14:41 “or someone for whom life is a great struggle.
00:14:44 In the Christian Greek Scriptures, it is used only here.”
00:14:49 Just think about the widow’s circumstances.
00:14:52 Not only had she experienced the grief
00:14:54 of losing her husband, her provider,
00:14:57 but she also lived in a religious climate
00:15:00 dominated by leaders who,
00:15:02 according to Luke 20:47,
00:15:05 would “devour the houses of the widows”
00:15:08 rather than help such vulnerable ones.
00:15:11 That widow was so poor that her contribution to the temple
00:15:16 was what a laborer might earn in just a few minutes.
00:15:19 Life wasn’t easy for her.
00:15:23 In fact, Jesus said that she
00:15:25 “put in all the means of living she had.”
00:15:30 Our publications have stated that the coins the widow contributed
00:15:34 were likely two lepta.
00:15:37 With eight lepta, a person could buy two sparrows,
00:15:41 which were among the cheapest birds used for food.
00:15:45 So the widow had only half the amount needed
00:15:48 to buy one sparrow,
00:15:51 hardly enough for a single meal.
00:15:53 Yet, both the widow and her contribution
00:15:56 were valuable to Jehovah.
00:15:58 Jesus said that her contribution was greater
00:16:02 than the contributions of the rich.
00:16:05 When she put those two small coins in the treasury chest,
00:16:09 they would be mixed with what the rich had put in.
00:16:11 To imperfect human eyes, they might seem lost, buried.
00:16:16 Yet, this precious widow was the one Jesus singled out for praise.
00:16:20 When the treasury workers came across the coins,
00:16:23 they wouldn’t have known how precious the coins and their donor
00:16:27 were to Jehovah.
00:16:29 But God’s view was the one that really mattered,
00:16:32 not what other people thought
00:16:34 or even how that dear widow viewed herself.
00:16:37 Like that widow,
00:16:39 you may find that circumstances limit
00:16:41 what you can contribute to Jehovah.
00:16:45 Age, infirmities, or other circumstances beyond your control
00:16:50 may limit the amount of time you’re able to spend in the ministry.
00:16:54 You might feel that your efforts are like those
00:16:57 “two small coins of very little value.”
00:17:01 Still, we learn from this account of the needy widow
00:17:05 that Jehovah notices and he treasures each act done for him,
00:17:10 especially when we do it despite difficult circumstances.
00:17:15 For a moment, think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year.
00:17:21 Some of you may feel that you accomplished little.
00:17:24 Your imperfect heart might cause you to wonder
00:17:27 whether Jehovah was pleased with your efforts.
00:17:30 However, did one of the hours you spent
00:17:34 require a special sacrifice on your part?
00:17:38 If Jehovah took notice of the widow
00:17:40 dropping in those two coins and valued her contribution,
00:17:45 don’t you think he also noticed
00:17:47 and valued what you did for him during that hour?
00:17:51 Jehovah values every gift, no matter how small,
00:17:55 that springs from a heart motivated by love.
00:17:58 He remembers, and he’ll reward
00:18:01 even the smallest contribution given in support of his Kingdom.
00:18:06 That’s proof of how Jehovah feels about you.
00:18:11 Finally, let’s consider a modern-day example
00:18:14 of one who was very precious to Jehovah.
00:18:17 It’s the experience of Sister Areti Pina.
00:18:21 Sister Pina lived on the southern coast of Albania
00:18:24 in the town of Vlorë.
00:18:26 She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.
00:18:31 There was a strong congregation  in Vlorë in the 1930’s,
00:18:34 and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer
00:18:37 who climbed up and down rugged mountains,
00:18:40 preaching with her Bible in hand.
00:18:43 In time, a congregation no longer existed in Vlorë,
00:18:47 and Sister Pina lost contact with the brothers.
00:18:50 Yet, she kept preaching faithfully on her own.
00:18:54 Do you think her efforts went unnoticed by Jehovah?
00:18:58 Well, years later, word reached the brothers
00:19:01 that there was an old, senile woman
00:19:03 who was reportedly preaching in Vlorë.
00:19:06 People thought she was crazy for keeping faith in God
00:19:09 during years of totalitarian rule.
00:19:12 Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80’s, was anything but senile.
00:19:18 When the brothers arrived at her home,
00:19:21 Sister Pina invited them in,
00:19:23 but she seemed somewhat reserved.
00:19:26 When they explained that they were her spiritual brothers,
00:19:29 she had no reaction.
00:19:32 After a few minutes,
00:19:34 Sister Pina started firing questions at the brothers:
00:19:37 “Do you believe in the Trinity? What is God’s name?
00:19:41 “Do you believe in hellfire? What happens when we die?
00:19:44 What about the earth? How many go to heaven?”
00:19:48 The brothers answered each question.
00:19:50 “Do you preach?” she then asked.
00:19:53 “Yes,” said one brother, “we preach.”
00:19:56 “But,” she responded,  “how do you preach?”
00:20:01 “We preach from house to house,” replied the brother.
00:20:05 “Now I know that you are my brothers!” she exclaimed.
00:20:09 “Only Jehovah’s people preach from house to house!”
00:20:13 Through her tears, Sister Pina stated:
00:20:17 “Jehovah is wonderful. He never forgot me!”
00:20:23 Sometime later, the brothers were notified that Sister Pina was ill
00:20:27 and that she wanted to meet with one of the responsible brothers.
00:20:31 When he arrived, she asked in part,
00:20:34 as she gasped for air,
00:20:37 “Has the book of Revelation been fulfilled?”
00:20:40 The brother responded, “Yes, Areti, most of it has.”
00:20:45 Sister Pina said: “Now I can die in peace.
00:20:50 I needed to know how close we are.”
00:20:54 Shortly after that conversation,
00:20:56 Sister Pina faithfully finished her earthly course.
00:21:01 What do you think?
00:21:03 During all those years of isolation
00:21:06 from the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization,
00:21:08 did Sister Pina’s efforts go unnoticed by Jehovah?
00:21:12 Absolutely not!
00:21:15 Just imagine Jehovah’s joy
00:21:17 as he watched her faithfully doing what she could in his service.
00:21:22 Do you think that Sister Pina was precious to Jehovah?
00:21:26 Without a doubt she was.
00:21:30 Well, your efforts in Jehovah’s service do not go unnoticed by him either.
00:21:35 Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.
00:21:40 So, what has this consideration helped us to realize?
00:21:44 We may have to contend with Satan’s lies,
00:21:47 negative circumstances and events in our lives,
00:21:50 and our own imperfections.
00:21:53 But we should never forget that Jehovah highly values his servants.
00:21:58 We saw that in his words to the Israelites through the prophet Isaiah.
00:22:03 You can be sure that Jehovah loves you most tenderly.
00:22:08 No matter what trials you’re facing now or have endured in the past,
00:22:12 Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.
00:22:16 When you hurt, he hurts.
00:22:19 You’re far too precious to Jehovah for him to forget you.
00:22:25 The account of the widow in Luke chapter 21
00:22:28 can assure you that although circumstances
00:22:30 may affect what you can contribute to Jehovah,
00:22:33 he notices and treasures each act you do for him,
00:22:38 especially when you do it in the face of difficult circumstances.
00:22:42 He remembers, and he will reward
00:22:45 even the smallest contribution given in support of his Kingdom.
00:22:50 And what beautiful modern-day examples we have in the organization
00:22:54 of brothers and sisters who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah
00:22:58 and are precious to him, like the example of Sister Pina!
00:23:04 Dear brothers and sisters, please,
00:23:06 never forget that you are precious to Jehovah!
00:23:13 Here’s another modern-day example
00:23:16 —Sister Malu Mørch.
00:23:18 As we’ll see, she faced a number
00:23:21 of serious hardships early in life.
00:23:24 Notice all the ways she received comfort from Jehovah.
00:23:39 My name is Malu Mørch.
00:23:41 No one can imagine
00:23:44 how much Jehovah has helped me.
00:23:52 I was raised in Sisimiut in Greenland.
00:23:55 My childhood was wonderful.
00:23:58 We were very often out in nature.
00:24:00 In the summer, we sailed.
00:24:02 And in the winter, we rode dog sledge
00:24:04 and we went hunting and fishing.
00:24:09 When I was a child, I was very close to my parents.
00:24:12 I was a “daddy’s girl.”
00:24:14 He called me “My Beloved,”
00:24:16 so “Beloved” became my nickname.
00:24:19 It has been so wonderful to be raised in the truth.
00:24:23 The greatest gift that I could get
00:24:25 is to know Jehovah through them.
00:24:31 When I was nine years old, my parents got divorced.
00:24:35 It was terrible.
00:24:37 I saw how my siblings were hurt.
00:24:39 It cannot be explained how— I mean, we were very wounded in our hearts.
00:24:44 When my parents divorced, my father was disfellowshipped.
00:24:47 It was very hard to be separated like that.
00:24:50 I missed my dad a lot.
00:24:53 When my mom started to drink,
00:24:56 I also felt abandoned.
00:25:00 Because I knew what she had been doing, I was not surprised when,
00:25:03 after some time, she was disfellowshipped.
00:25:06 But, of course, I felt very hurt and sad.
00:25:12 I supplicated Jehovah to help me stay in the truth.
00:25:17 The pioneer sister who studied with me helped me a lot.
00:25:23 She studied with me and sometimes took me
00:25:26 in the ministry and invited me to dinner.
00:25:30 When I was about 12 years old,
00:25:32 my father came back into the truth.
00:25:35 I was very happy that it finally happened.
00:25:40 I began to have a good relationship with him again.
00:25:43 We sailed a lot, drove snowmobiles, and rode dog sledge,
00:25:48 and my father and I watched movies in the evening.
00:25:51 I remember that when my dad heard that I was going to be baptized,
00:25:55 he shed a tear, and I could see that he was proud.
00:26:08 When I was 15 years old,
00:26:11 my world fell to pieces.
00:26:16 My father committed suicide.
00:26:20 It’s difficult to describe that my father was suddenly gone.
00:26:24 I can’t understand
00:26:26 why he would do such a selfish thing.
00:26:32 I missed him a lot.
00:26:37 It was like my heart was stabbed.
00:26:47 I was also very angry at him.
00:26:53 I wrote a lot.
00:26:55 And I wrote many letters to my father
00:26:58 about things that I wanted to tell him.
00:27:01 I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers.
00:27:06 I love Psalm 34:18
00:27:09 about Jehovah being close to “those who are crushed in spirit.”
00:27:13 That was how I felt.
00:27:15 And the thought that Jehovah is close to them
00:27:18 comforts me a lot.
00:27:20 I also did all I could to go to all the meetings,
00:27:23 even when I didn’t want to see anyone.
00:27:28 Even if I had cried before the meeting,
00:27:31 I went anyway.
00:27:35 One month after my father’s death, I got baptized.
00:27:40 I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.
00:27:44 When I was nine years old, I had promised Jehovah
00:27:47 to serve him for the rest of my life.
00:27:51 My relationship with my mother is much better now.
00:27:57 It is great to serve Jehovah together with her now.
00:28:02 We preach together every Sunday,
00:28:04 and I always look forward to going in the ministry together with her.
00:28:10 When I was 18 years old,
00:28:13 I began to help in the remote translation office.
00:28:16 Later, I started pioneering.
00:28:20 I have always learned a lot from King David.
00:28:24 No matter what circumstances he faced,
00:28:26 whether bad or good, he used them to draw close to Jehovah.
00:28:36 Jehovah has helped me to overcome
00:28:38 challenges through the congregation,
00:28:41 giving me “power beyond what is normal”
00:28:44 and taking me in as his daughter.
00:28:51 As a child, Malu’s nickname was Beloved.
00:28:55 Yet, for a while, she felt anything but loved.
00:28:58 She said that her “world fell to pieces.”
00:29:02 Have you ever felt that way?
00:29:05 Remember what helped Malu stay close to Jehovah:
00:29:09 A pioneer sister encouraged her;
00:29:11 personal study reminded Malu
00:29:13 that Jehovah helped his servants in the past;
00:29:16 she pursued spiritual goals, such as auxiliary pioneering;
00:29:21 and she went to as many Christian meetings as she could,
00:29:24 even when she wanted to be alone.
00:29:27 In all these ways,
00:29:29 Malu was reminded that she is precious to Jehovah.
00:29:33 As she said, ‘Jehovah has taken me in as his daughter.’
00:29:39 For some people, staying busy may seem like the right thing to do
00:29:43 when they’ve suffered a serious setback.
00:29:46 Does staying busy really help?
00:29:48 Let’s find out in this dramatization.
00:29:54 I, Steven, take you, Emily, to be my wedded wife.
00:30:00 I, Emily, take you, Steven, to be my wedded husband.
00:30:08 I had no doubt our vows were forever.
00:30:14 Nothing could have prepared me for the heartbreak.
00:30:19 I never expected her to be unfaithful
00:30:23 and unwilling to work things out.
00:30:40 I felt humiliated.
00:30:45 How could she do such a thing?
00:30:48 I was embarrassed,
00:30:50 and I didn’t want to talk to anyone.
00:31:00 I read somewhere that time would help me heal
00:31:03 and just to stay busy.
00:31:09 It seemed to work.
00:31:14 But I was constantly reminded of what I lost:
00:31:18 our spiritual goals,
00:31:20 the hopes and dreams we had
00:31:23 —all destroyed.
00:31:33 I didn’t want to dwell on the hurt,
00:31:36 but I just couldn’t ignore it.
00:31:49 Was I really coping?
00:31:53 Or was I leaving myself open to even more pain?
00:31:56 Brothers and sisters, we’re going to talk about marriage today.
00:32:00 If we turn to Ephesians chapter 5, . . .
00:32:02 I was angry, but not just with Emily.
00:32:06 I was angry with everything.
00:32:12 Steven! Steven!
00:32:14 Hey, let me stop by tomorrow.
00:32:23 What I had to say,
00:32:27 I wouldn’t have blamed Tom for judging me,
00:32:30 but he didn’t.
00:32:33 You’re right, Steven.
00:32:35 I can’t understand how you feel.
00:32:38 But you know who can.
00:32:43 Do you remember Psalm 34?
00:32:48 I think verse 18 says it best.
00:32:52 Can you read it for us?
00:32:56 “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;
00:33:00 he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”
00:33:03 Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?
00:33:06 Take advantage of Jehovah being that close to you,
00:33:10 and include him in everything.
00:33:13 Jehovah is  a loving Shepherd.
00:33:17 When we hurt, he cares.
00:33:20 I knew this, but in a way, I’d forgotten.
00:33:26 I realized I hadn’t included Jehovah
00:33:29 in the ways I tried to cope.
00:33:32 Staying busy was important,
00:33:34 but I needed to draw closer to God,
00:33:36 not push away.
00:33:39 And when I did,
00:33:41 the real healing began.
00:33:45 Even though the pain is still there,
00:33:49 Jehovah sees the tears;
00:33:54 Jehovah feels what I feel.
00:33:59 It is getting better, slowly,
00:34:11 because “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted.”
00:34:34 The vast majority of marriages among Jehovah’s people prosper
00:34:39 because Christian husbands and wives
00:34:41 apply Bible principles,
00:34:43 but a few fail to live up to their marriage commitment.
00:34:47 Are you among the brokenhearted?
00:34:50 If so, never forget that you are precious to Jehovah
00:34:55 and remember what will help you heal.
00:34:58 In our dramatization,
00:35:00 Steven kept himself busy with recreation and other activities.
00:35:04 But he experienced true comfort and healing
00:35:07 when he drew close to Jehovah.
00:35:10 Always remember how Jehovah is described
00:35:13 at Psalm 34:18:
00:35:16 “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;
00:35:19 he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”
00:35:24 Prayer is one of the most powerful ways
00:35:26 Jehovah helps us.
00:35:28 We’ll see that in our new music video.
00:35:49 When I called yesterday, I could tell you’d lost your way.
00:35:56 Be assured you are loved By our God up above.
00:36:06 So do not fear. When you’re broken, he is near.
00:36:18 Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:36:26 You’re not alone; you can pray. He hears your words; he feels your pain.
00:36:35 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:36:44 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:36:52 Raise your eyes up and see; The new world is in our reach—
00:37:00 No more tears, only love Through the gift of God’s dear Son.
00:37:10 But until then, We can endure down to the end
00:37:22 If we trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:37:30 We’re not alone; we can pray. He hears our words; he feels our pain.
00:37:39 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:37:49 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:38:30 Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in. Just let it go; roll it on him.
00:38:38 We’re not alone; we can pray. He hears our words; he feels our pain.
00:38:47 Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.
00:38:56 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:39:03 Roll it on him. Roll it on him.
00:39:17 What a beautiful reminder
00:39:20 that we can go to Jehovah in prayer at any time
00:39:22 and express our deepest feelings to him!
00:39:26 As the song says:
00:39:28 “Don’t keep that burden in. Roll it on him.”
00:39:33 When we’re experiencing pain and difficulty in life,
00:39:36 it may not be easy to see all that Jehovah is doing in our behalf.
00:39:41 In the following Morning Worship program,
00:39:44 Brother John Ekrann helps us to see Jehovah’s hand in action.
00:39:49 Sometimes, I think all of us would agree
00:39:51 that it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand
00:39:53 when things are going well
00:39:55 —when we get a court victory,
00:39:58 when someone’s health improves,
00:40:00 or maybe when someone really asked to come
00:40:03 to study the Bible with us and they’re at our meetings.
00:40:07 But it’s harder to see Jehovah’s hand when we see bad things happen
00:40:12 either to us or to our brothers and sisters.
00:40:15 So we may wonder, ‘How can we see Jehovah’s hand
00:40:19 when bad things are happening?’
00:40:21 Well, you can see my hand right now, right?
00:40:25 But if I put it away, you can’t see it.
00:40:29 Now, do you assume that because you can’t see my hand
00:40:33 that I don’t have a hand anymore?
00:40:35 Well, no.
00:40:36 You reason on the fact that since you see the rest of me,
00:40:38 and there’s probably still my hand attached.
00:40:41 So likewise, there are times when it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand,
00:40:46 and there are other times when we have to reason
00:40:49 on what we know about Jehovah in order to see his hand in action.
00:40:54 So let’s consider one thing.
00:40:56 What do we know about Jehovah
00:40:58 so that we could reason that his hand is in action?
00:41:02 Well, let’s reason on the point that he is a “happy God.”
00:41:07 Now, how does Jehovah stay happy,
00:41:11 seeing all the bad things that are happening?
00:41:13 Maybe you’ve wondered that. I know it’s crossed my mind.
00:41:16 How does Jehovah stay happy
00:41:19 when he sees all the suffering that’s going on?
00:41:22 And frankly, he sees all  the suffering;
00:41:25 he sees everything going on.
00:41:27 I know how I feel, and you probably know how you feel
00:41:30 just when you read about what’s happening
00:41:32 to our brothers in Venezuela or in Russia
00:41:35 or with all of the hurricanes
00:41:37 and earthquakes that we’ve had in recent times.
00:41:40 And we see the suffering
00:41:42 not only of our brothers and sisters but also of other people,
00:41:45 and we consider,
00:41:47 ‘How can Jehovah stay happy when he knows all of what is happening?’
00:41:51 Well, let’s consider three (I’m sure) of many reasons
00:41:54 why Jehovah can stay happy even though he knows all the suffering.
00:41:57 And then we can see how that could benefit us as well.
00:42:00 First of all,
00:42:02 his hand is hard at work preparing the new world for us.
00:42:07 And I think Jeremiah 29:11
00:42:10 really covers how Jehovah feels
00:42:14 about the future for us.
00:42:16 At Jeremiah 29:11, he says:
00:42:18 “‘For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’
00:42:21 “declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,
00:42:25 to give you a future and a hope.’”
00:42:29 So Jehovah is not simply just watching events occur.
00:42:34 He’s actively working on the solution.
00:42:37 He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels,
00:42:40 is working hard on the Kingdom.
00:42:42 Now, we can’t see into heaven right now,
00:42:47 but I want you to just imagine all the activity of the angels,
00:42:52 the resurrected anointed brothers,
00:42:54 and Jesus working hard on making preparations
00:42:58 for Armageddon and the new world.
00:43:01 Just think of all the work we’re doing just to prepare
00:43:03 for the annual meeting and dedication.
00:43:05 Can you imagine all the work going on in heaven that is there?
00:43:08 I mean, how far along are the new scrolls?
00:43:11 How are our basic needs  as far as clean water,
00:43:14 food, and homes going to be provided for the survivors?
00:43:18 So while we can’t see into heaven,
00:43:21 we know that his hand is there.
00:43:25 So Jehovah is happy because he’s actively working right now
00:43:28 to make things better for us.
00:43:30 What is the lesson for us?
00:43:32 We can be happy when we see the suffering around us
00:43:36 because we know what Jehovah and our brothers are doing up there
00:43:39 to prepare for the new world.
00:43:42 A second point about how Jehovah can be happy
00:43:45 is that he can comfort us right now.
00:43:47 He is happy when he can do that.
00:43:50 In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29,
00:43:54 Jehovah continued after saying that he was working on the future (he says):
00:43:59 “And you will call me and come and pray to me,
00:44:03 and I will listen to you.”
00:44:06 So I love this point because Jehovah is saying,
00:44:10 ‘Don’t worry; I’m taking care of building a better future for you.’
00:44:14 And we appreciate it.
00:44:15 If we’re going through some trial —some difficulty—
00:44:18 and a good friend of ours reminds us,
00:44:20 “Remember things are going to get better in the future;
00:44:23 Jehovah is going to change this; it’s going to get better,”
00:44:25 it is comforting.
00:44:27 But it is also comforting  (like Jehovah says here in verse 12)
00:44:30 when the person says, “What can I do for you right now?”
00:44:33 And Jehovah is saying right now, ‘Come, pray to me.’
00:44:37 Jehovah is there to comfort and help us.
00:44:41 We could kind of illustrate the way Jehovah feels
00:44:44 by thinking about parents and how they deal with a small child.
00:44:47 Have you ever seen a small child, maybe two or three years of age,
00:44:51 and they fall really badly and scrape their knees badly,
00:44:55 and they are screaming in pain?
00:44:57 There’s this red liquid leaking out of them.
00:45:00 They are distraught.
00:45:02 In fact, in that child’s mind,
00:45:04 he may think: ‘This is the end of it. This is the end of my life as I know it.
00:45:07 ‘I’m never going to recover from this.
00:45:10 I’m going to die.’
00:45:12 But for the parents, of course, their perspective is different, isn’t it?
00:45:16 But they comfort the child; they help to take care of the skinned knee.
00:45:20 They comfort them, and they tell them: “You’re going to live.
00:45:23 It’s going to be OK. It’s going to be all right.”
00:45:25 And why can the parent have that view?
00:45:27 Because they know that in a few hours maybe
00:45:30 (at least in a week or so),
00:45:32 the child is not even going to remember that skinned knee.
00:45:34 It’s going to be just a very distant memory.
00:45:37 Well, Jehovah also knows that whatever we’re going through right now
00:45:41 —whatever suffering we may be going through now—
00:45:45 that soon in that new world, we aren’t going to recall that suffering.
00:45:49 And he knows that he can solve any problem we’re facing
00:45:51 as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.
00:45:55 He knows our whole eternal lives are ahead of us.
00:45:58 So he comforts us; he listens to our heartfelt prayers.
00:46:03 And like a kind parent, he’s telling us
00:46:05 (through our brothers, the Bible, and holy spirit),
00:46:08 ‘You will live.’
00:46:11 Jehovah is happy because right now, what can he do?
00:46:14 He can comfort us and help us.
00:46:17 Well, what is the lesson for us?
00:46:19 We can comfort and help others.
00:46:22 We’re, really, kind of all in this “lifeboat” together,
00:46:24 trying to make it to the “new-world shore,”
00:46:26 and we can help one another.
00:46:30 Third, his hand is patiently waiting
00:46:34 for the right time to act.
00:46:36 Jehovah is waiting patiently
00:46:38 for the complete vindication of his sovereignty.
00:46:41 I really love what the June 2017 Watchtower  article
00:46:44 “Keep Your Eyes on the Big Issue” said:
00:46:48 “Let us not become so absorbed in our own lives
00:46:51 “that we lose sight of this big issue
00:46:54 “—the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:46:56 “And let us appreciate that our role in this vital issue
00:47:00 “entails remaining faithful
00:47:02 even under difficult circumstances.”
00:47:05 Isn’t that a beautiful quote to think about?
00:47:08 Jehovah knows that by his being patient now,
00:47:12 he and all his faithful servants will never have to go through this again.
00:47:16 The issue of sovereignty will be completely settled.
00:47:21 Don’t you admire Jehovah’s patience?
00:47:23 I mean, to watch all that is happening
00:47:26 and to have the self-control to wait for the appointed time
00:47:31 is truly an example of patience in action.
00:47:35 When we think about the different situations
00:47:37 our brothers and sisters and others face
00:47:39 —when a mother, for example,
00:47:41 watches a handicapped son struggle to walk or to talk
00:47:46 or a husband watches his wife struggle to breathe—
00:47:50 we want so much at that moment
00:47:52 to press that big, red, “start-the-new-world” button now.
00:47:57 But when you have that feeling,
00:48:00 remember our text for today:
00:48:03 “The hand of Jehovah will become known to his servants.”
00:48:09 What is the lesson for us?
00:48:11 We need to be patient
00:48:13 and keep our eyes on the big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:48:19 So let’s just review those three points.
00:48:22 How can we see Jehovah’s hand
00:48:25 and be happy when we see all of this suffering around us?
00:48:29 Well, we can be happy knowing
00:48:31 what Jehovah and Jesus and the resurrected anointed
00:48:34 are doing right now to prepare for the new world.
00:48:37 And we can be happy because we have a role
00:48:40 in comforting and helping others.
00:48:42 And we can be happy being patient,
00:48:46 knowing why we’re being patient.
00:48:48 We have our eyes on that big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
00:48:55 We may not always be able to see Jehovah’s hand,
00:48:58 but we can be sure, as our text for today says,
00:49:02 that Jehovah’s hand is there, and it will become known.
00:49:07 Every year, millions of people come together at our conventions
00:49:11 to learn about Jehovah and encourage each other.
00:49:15 Starting next month, “Always Rejoice”! Conventions
00:49:18 will be held all over the earth.
00:49:21 Jehovah’s Witnesses will be actively inviting their neighbors,
00:49:25 workmates, schoolmates, and all interested ones to join us.
00:49:30 What effect can receiving an invitation
00:49:32 have on a person’s life?
00:49:34 Let’s watch the following report.
00:49:44 I came to Greece as an immigrant when I was just 16 years old.
00:49:48 Because of that, I never felt safe
00:49:50 with people around me.
00:49:52 At that time, I was renting
00:49:54 an apartment from a man who was studying the Bible
00:49:57 with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:49:59 One day I joined the study,
00:50:02 and the brother invited me to the convention.
00:50:06 I was very cautious at the beginning, but the brother seemed trustworthy.
00:50:13 I always had questions about the true God,
00:50:16 and I wanted to learn more about Him, so I decided to go.
00:50:21 In 2016,
00:50:23 I received an invitation
00:50:24 from my son to attend
00:50:26 the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:50:28 He was getting baptized at that convention,
00:50:30 and it was important to him for me to be there,
00:50:33 and so he asked me to go.
00:50:35 Even though I was very active in another religion for 30 years,
00:50:39 I went in order to please him.
00:50:44 I learned the truth after I supplicated God with all my strength
00:50:49 because I was really lost.
00:50:51 I asked for answers to questions
00:50:53 that were yet unanswered.
00:50:55 And God answered me.
00:50:57 Jehovah gave me the answer to my prayers when I found this.
00:51:01 This invitation, “Deliverance at Hand!,” was the answer to my prayers.
00:51:07 Arriving there, at that convention, I observed the crowd—many people.
00:51:12 Starting right at the parking lot,
00:51:15 everything was organized; people were entering in an orderly manner.
00:51:19 Inside the Assembly Hall, everyone was very organized,
00:51:22 well-dressed, very loving.
00:51:25 And when the convention began,
00:51:27 I saw such spiritual food that I had never seen in my religion.
00:51:32 Thirty years in a religion —I thought I knew a lot,
00:51:35 but I didn’t know anything.
00:51:38 So I decided to study.
00:51:41 When I arrived at the convention, I started watching the people.
00:51:46 Their faces were smiling.
00:51:48 They seemed to be happy.
00:51:50 There were men, women, and children from different races and nationalities.
00:51:55 When they sang, I could sense their true joy and unity.
00:52:02 For the first time in my life, I felt very safe.
00:52:06 I was not in fear of being taken advantage of.
00:52:11 Also, what I learned at that convention
00:52:15 drew me to the true God.
00:52:18 I thought, ‘If all these people
00:52:20 ‘are truly happy and feel really safe being part of this organization
00:52:25 ‘—Jehovah’s organization—
00:52:28 then, indeed, this is what I was looking for.’
00:52:33 I went to the convention on Sunday.
00:52:36 I was really warmly welcomed by all the brothers and sisters there.
00:52:42 I listened to all of the morning program,
00:52:46 and at noon, I recognized the sound of the truth.
00:52:49 I was sure it was the truth.
00:52:52 I decided to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:52:56 and I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:52:58 I got baptized in 2017, and now I serve as a pioneer.
00:53:03 My first study was the following Wednesday.
00:53:07 I was happy to get to know Jehovah.
00:53:09 Now I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:53:12 and as much as I can, I participate in the invitation campaigns.
00:53:17 I really hope that it helps many people to be delivered.
00:53:21 I started attending meetings right after the convention.
00:53:26 I started a Bible study, and eventually I got baptized
00:53:28 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:53:32 My mother, one of my brothers,
00:53:34 and my two sisters are now serving Jehovah as well.
00:53:39 Later on, I got married to a faithful sister,
00:53:42 a very good wife, and we serve Jehovah together.
00:53:46 People need to feel safe,
00:53:49 and I know for sure that Jehovah’s organization is the safest place you can be.
00:53:58 Did you notice how the convention invitations were obtained?
00:54:02 They were given by a relative or an associate
00:54:05 or simply left at the door.
00:54:07 We never know how even a single invitation
00:54:10 can help a person come to know Jehovah.
00:54:14 Our diligence in the invitation campaign
00:54:17 can make a powerful difference.
00:54:20 This month’s program has helped us remember
00:54:22 that we are precious to Jehovah.
00:54:26 We learned that even if we had a hard start in life,
00:54:28 we don’t have to be a victim of our past.
00:54:32 We saw how Jehovah sees us,
00:54:34 cares for us, and provides loving help in many ways.
00:54:39 We were reminded that “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted”
00:54:43 and that through prayer, we can unburden ourselves
00:54:47 and receive comfort, knowing that whatever suffering
00:54:50 we’re enduring now will soon be forgotten.
00:54:55 Let’s conclude our program by visiting our brothers and sisters in Cuba.
00:54:59 The Republic of Cuba is a chain of 1,600 islands and islets
00:55:04 at the intersection of the Atlantic Ocean,
00:55:06 the Caribbean Sea,
00:55:08 and the Gulf of Mexico.
00:55:10 Cuba itself is by far the largest island in the chain,
00:55:14 with one major city: Havana.
00:55:17 Many are embracing the truth.
00:55:21 Cuba is home to almost 95,000 publishers
00:55:24 in 1,400 congregations.
00:55:28 They’re conducting more than 135,000 Bible studies.
00:55:33 Lush mountains and hills cover a quarter of Cuba.
00:55:37 At the western end of the island is Viñales,
00:55:41 famous for its towerlike hills called mogotes.
00:55:45 Caves and rivers run through many of them.
00:55:48 The Este de Viñales Congregation is located in this part of Cuba.
00:55:53 Here, 128 publishers conduct
00:55:56 275 Bible studies.
00:55:59 Because of its vast territory, the congregation has three groups.
00:56:03 One group that has only seven publishers
00:56:07 had 75 people attend last year’s Memorial.
00:56:11 To cover their territory, the brothers travel long distances,
00:56:15 sometimes by bicycle or motorcycle.
00:56:19 They witness to people wherever they are
00:56:22 —on farms and in their homes.
00:56:25 The brothers enjoy Christian fellowship,
00:56:28 good coffee,
00:56:30 and singing songs of praise to Jehovah.
00:56:33 Our brothers and sisters in the Este de Viñales Congregation
00:56:37 send their love to the worldwide brotherhood.

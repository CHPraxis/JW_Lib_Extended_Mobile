00:00:01 Welcome! Welcome!
00:00:05 Welcome to this month’s broadcast!
00:00:09 Here is a little sample
00:00:12 of what will be contained in our program.
00:00:15 We’ll meet brothers and sisters
00:00:18 who’ve learned to see and treat others impartially.
00:00:22 What helped them?
00:00:24 And how can all of us be united in a divided world?
00:00:29 We’ll find out.
00:00:31 Have you ever needed to muster up courage to do what’s right?
00:00:37 Are you enduring disappointment?
00:00:40 We’ll see what we can learn
00:00:43 from the example of Samuel.
00:00:45 And Jesus showed us how to see the good in people,
00:00:49 to be loving and kind
00:00:52 just like a child.
00:00:54 That’s the message
00:00:56 of our new music video.
00:01:00 Yes, there’s much to look forward to
00:01:03 in this May 2020 edition
00:01:06 of JW Broadcasting®.
00:01:27 “Always Rejoice!” is the appealing theme
00:01:31 of this year’s conventions.
00:01:34 The Governing Body would like to give you a preview of the program.
00:01:39 Let’s take a look.
00:01:44 Everyone wants to be happy.
00:01:47 But we all face problems,
00:01:49 problems that are hard to deal with.
00:01:56 So can you ever really be happy?
00:02:07 At the 2020 convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:02:11 you will learn how to find joy,
00:02:13 even when life is hard,
00:02:18 and how God has made it possible
00:02:20 for us to be happy now and forever!
00:02:27 Happiness might seem hard to find, but it isn’t!
00:02:32 Come and see for yourself!
00:02:41 That preview reminds us
00:02:43 of the wonderful convention program of last year,
00:02:47 including the feature Bible drama
00:02:49 about faithful Josiah.
00:02:53 What was involved in producing that drama?
00:02:56 Please watch the following video
00:02:59 that reveals what transpired
00:03:02 behind the scenes.
00:03:16 Where do you begin an important project
00:03:19 like The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad?
00:03:23 You begin with prayerful consideration.
00:03:26 It’s a serious responsibility —part of being loyal to Jehovah and his Word.
00:03:32 Therefore, many hours of careful research goes into the first step:
00:03:36 writing a script.
00:03:38 The script is then visualized through a step called storyboarding.
00:03:47 But it’s not just the script and storyboarding
00:03:49 that requires attention to accuracy.
00:03:52 Costumes must be thoroughly researched so that their components,
00:03:56 styles, colors, and even the types of fabric
00:04:00 appear as historically accurate as possible.
00:04:05 The production must also accurately depict the times
00:04:08 being represented while making the best use of donated funds.
00:04:12 How can this be done?
00:04:14 For The Story of Josiah,
00:04:16 the solution was to film at Bethel locations,
00:04:19 such as the studio spaces at Mount Ebo.
00:04:23 Set construction began early in 2018.
00:04:27 The production team designed and built three flexible sets
00:04:31 so that with easy prop adjustments,
00:04:33 they could be in multiple locations.
00:04:38 Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes
00:04:40 were filmed indoors.
00:04:50 Many brothers and sisters from local congregations
00:04:53 served as extras for the crowd scenes.
00:04:57 With an eye to Biblical and historical accuracy,
00:05:00 the makeup team transformed the actors
00:05:02 into characters from King Josiah’s time.
00:05:06 There were so many details to get right.
00:05:35 For a large portion of the drama, filming in front of a green screen
00:05:38 enabled the visual effects team to construct accurate environments digitally.
00:05:46 Many layers of character action, called plates, were assembled
00:05:50 with digital environments to produce complex visuals.
00:06:19 For the closing festival scene,
00:06:21 which required 14,000 Israelites
00:06:24 and many sheep,
00:06:26 3D models were made and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.
00:06:35 In July 2018, the production packed up
00:06:39 and moved to an outdoor location
00:06:41 at Watchtower Farms in Wallkill, New York.
00:06:46 And action!
00:07:00 In August, the last scene was filmed
00:07:03 back at the Mount Ebo studio.
00:07:06 After 45 days of filming
00:07:08 and with over 4 terabytes of footage captured,
00:07:11 the team had finished production.
00:07:14 The project moved to the editing facilities at Patterson, New York.
00:07:22 But what more could be done so that the account portrayed
00:07:25 could touch our hearts?
00:07:29 A colorist applied a look to the overall film
00:07:31 to enhance the picture’s quality and mood.
00:07:34 You have to get better.
00:07:36 I’m afraid of being alone.
00:07:37 Additional sound effects, such as footsteps
00:07:40 and the sound of dry grass being rustled,
00:07:43 were recorded to make the on-screen action more natural and compelling.
00:07:48 Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed,
00:07:50 recorded, and added to the movie to enhance the appeal to our hearts.
00:07:58 The work on The Story of Josiah: Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad
00:08:01 was done to strengthen Jehovah’s people worldwide.
00:08:06 You’re not alone.
00:08:08 Jehovah is with you.
00:08:12 This powerful story also assists parents as they teach their children
00:08:15 the power of God’s Word and promise.
00:08:20 “These words that I am commanding you today
00:08:23 “must be on your heart,
00:08:25 “and you must inculcate them in your sons
00:08:27 “and speak of them when you sit in your house
00:08:30 “and when you walk on the road
00:08:32 and when you lie down and when you get up.”
00:08:36 “So that it may always go well with you
00:08:38 “and your sons after you,
00:08:41 “because you are doing what is good
00:08:44 and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”
00:08:49 The Story of Josiah has proven to be yet another example
00:08:54 of how Jehovah continues to provide abundant spiritual food and support
00:08:58 for his people worldwide.
00:09:05 That video certainly brought the Bible account
00:09:09 to life for us!
00:09:11 You may want to go back and review
00:09:14 the full-feature Bible drama again from our website.
00:09:19 We might mention
00:09:20 that we’ve had just a few parents
00:09:22 write in expressing concern
00:09:25 that some of our videos depict scenes
00:09:28 that could have an effect on children
00:09:31 who’ve been protected from anything
00:09:33 even hinting at an act of violence.
00:09:37 We very much appreciate the concern.
00:09:40 However, when portraying a Bible account,
00:09:45 we cannot ignore the message Jehovah saw fit
00:09:49 to preserve in his Word.
00:09:51 We don’t feel comfortable watering down
00:09:54 the inspired insight that Jehovah
00:09:57 has preserved for the benefit of true worshippers.
00:10:01 However, as you’ve observed,
00:10:04 we do so as tastefully as possible.
00:10:07 We don’t show actual violent acts or bloodshed.
00:10:12 A Scriptural precedent might be found
00:10:16 in 2 Chronicles 20:13.
00:10:20 Jehoshaphat was describing
00:10:23 a great crowd of enemy nations
00:10:25 that were about to launch an attack against God’s people.
00:10:30 He described the possible disaster quite graphically,
00:10:34 referring to the possibility of death by the sword,
00:10:38 by pestilence, or by famine.
00:10:41 Who was he sharing this disturbing information with?
00:10:46 Second Chronicles 20:13 tells us:
00:10:51 “Meanwhile, all those of Judah
00:10:55 “were standing before Jehovah,
00:10:57 “along with their little ones,
00:10:59 their wives, and their children.”
00:11:03 Jehovah wanted all, including the young ones,
00:11:07 to understand what was coming.
00:11:10 Parents likewise need to give their children
00:11:14 a realistic idea
00:11:16 of what we all will face in the near future.
00:11:20 Many parents choose to help their children appreciate
00:11:23 the graphic visual imagery of a Bible-based video,
00:11:28 while at the same time building trust in Jehovah,
00:11:32 who will be with them in times of distress.
00:11:36 This is similar to what they’d do
00:11:39 when reading a graphic Biblical account
00:11:42 to their children from the Scriptures,
00:11:45 such as from the book of Revelation.
00:11:48 Be assured
00:11:50 that we’ll continue to be sensitive
00:11:53 to the feelings of you parents when we produce a video
00:11:57 that’s based on a Bible account
00:11:59 that includes descriptions of warfare
00:12:02 or other incidents of violent actions.
00:12:06 We’ll do so with care,
00:12:09 while not ignoring the powerful details
00:12:13 depicted in the inspired Word of God.
00:12:19 The theme for this program is
00:12:22 “Be Childlike—But Not Childish!”
00:12:28 First Corinthians 14:20
00:12:32 is our theme scripture:
00:12:35 “Brothers, do not become young children in your understanding,
00:12:40 “but be young children as to badness;
00:12:44 and become full-grown in your understanding.”
00:12:49 In this single verse,
00:12:52 we’re told not to be like a young child in one way
00:12:56 and we’re told to be like a young child in another way.
00:13:00 We should not be like a child when it comes to understanding,
00:13:05 and we should be like a child when it comes to badness.
00:13:10 During this discussion,
00:13:12 let’s focus on three ways
00:13:16 we should not be like a child
00:13:18 and then let’s talk about three ways we should be like a child.
00:13:23 Please turn to Hebrews 5:13, 14,
00:13:29 and let’s identify negative trait number one
00:13:34 that we do not want to imitate:
00:13:38 “For everyone who continues to feed on milk
00:13:42 “is unacquainted with the word of righteousness,
00:13:45 “for he is a young child.
00:13:48 “But solid food belongs to mature people,
00:13:53 “to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained
00:13:58 to distinguish both right and wrong.”
00:14:02 So the negative trait that children have
00:14:05 is immature feeding habits.
00:14:09 Think about it: Young children
00:14:12 have a tendency to eat what they like
00:14:16 regardless of its nutritional value.
00:14:19 Most young ones would be perfectly happy
00:14:23 eating ice cream, candy, cookies,
00:14:25 and other sweets for all of their meals.
00:14:29 But now we ask,
00:14:32 What do our spiritual appetites
00:14:35 and feeding habits reveal about us?
00:14:38 Consider: How do we spend our free time?
00:14:43 Do we squander voluminous hours watching television
00:14:47 or reading material that provides little or no spiritual nutrition?
00:14:52 Or do we make wise use of our free time
00:14:57 to take in solid spiritual food?
00:15:01 When we receive a new issue of The Watchtower,
00:15:04 do we merely scan through it, looking at a few highlights,
00:15:09 and then do something else?
00:15:11 Do we take time to research deeper spiritual truths
00:15:16 so as to fully understand them?
00:15:18 Do we take time to really meditate?
00:15:21 Meditation is not daydreaming.
00:15:24 Meditation is bridled, focused thought.
00:15:28 Pause your reading to ask questions such as:
00:15:32 ‘What does this teach me about Jehovah?
00:15:36 ‘With whom could I share this information?
00:15:40 ‘What’s Jehovah telling me?
00:15:43 ‘How does this fit in with other things I know about this subject?
00:15:48 How can I make application?’
00:15:52 James 1:25 encourages us
00:15:55 to peer into God’s Word.
00:15:58 According to the Reference Bible,
00:16:01 ‘peer’ literally means to ‘stoop beside.’
00:16:05 To illustrate: Simply reading through the Bible
00:16:09 could be likened to walking quickly through the world’s greatest museum
00:16:14 and periodically glancing at the various displays.
00:16:19 You will learn something.
00:16:22 But meditatively peering into God’s Word
00:16:25 can be likened to stopping all along the museum route
00:16:30 and even stooping down
00:16:32 and closely examining from different angles
00:16:35 the artifacts, exhibitions, and displays.
00:16:40 Now our knowledge and appreciation
00:16:44 are going to be enhanced much more.
00:16:48 Yes, our spiritual appetite and feeding habits
00:16:53 reveal much about whether we have done away
00:16:57 with the trait of a young child, namely,
00:17:00 immature feeding habits.
00:17:04 Now please turn to Ephesians 4:14.
00:17:09 Let’s discern from this scripture negative trait number two
00:17:14 that we don’t want to imitate:
00:17:18 “So we should no longer be children,
00:17:22 “tossed about as by waves and carried here and there
00:17:26 “by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men,
00:17:31 by means of cunning in deceptive schemes.”
00:17:37 So, what’s the negative trait?
00:17:39 Young children are easily tricked, or fooled.
00:17:45 This scripture likens being easily tricked about what’s right or wrong
00:17:50 to being tossed about by the waves of the ocean
00:17:54 and blown around by the wind.
00:17:57 If you think of a piece of wood floating in a turbulent ocean
00:18:02 or a piece of paper in a windstorm,
00:18:05 there’s no stability or direction.
00:18:08 Both can be easily maneuvered
00:18:12 to go anywhere—take any position.
00:18:16 Well, that’s true of very young children
00:18:19 who often can be easily deceived.
00:18:23 For example, if given a choice
00:18:26 between a shiny coin of little value
00:18:29 and paper money of great value,
00:18:33 the shiny coin will likely be chosen.
00:18:37 But now, here’s the point:
00:18:39 What do our spiritual choices reveal about us?
00:18:44 Do our choices in regard to music and other entertainment,
00:18:49 clothing, and grooming indicate that we’re being fooled
00:18:53 even slightly by Satan and his world?
00:18:57 Yes, Satan is bent on tricking us,
00:19:00 but Jehovah tells us
00:19:02 at 1 Corinthians 14:20 (the scripture we read earlier):
00:19:08 “Do not become young children in your understanding.”
00:19:15 But now, please turn to Matthew 11:16, 17.
00:19:21 Here we’ll find the third negative trait of a child
00:19:25 that we do not want to imitate:
00:19:29 “With whom will I compare this generation?
00:19:33 “It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces
00:19:37 “who call out to their playmates, saying:
00:19:41 “‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance;
00:19:45 we wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.’”
00:19:51 Jesus was saying that adult people
00:19:55 were acting like children.
00:19:57 Children love to play.
00:20:01 So the negative trait of young children
00:20:03 is that they prefer play over responsibility.
00:20:08 Think about it: The vast majority
00:20:12 of the waking hours of a small child
00:20:15 are spent playing
00:20:17 —play, play, and more play.
00:20:21 Most of their life is fun and games.
00:20:24 But later, when the child goes to school,
00:20:27 where does he get the time to do so?
00:20:31 He has to take it from his playtime.
00:20:35 But now, spiritually speaking, we can ask ourselves,
00:20:39 ‘How far have we progressed
00:20:42 in buying out time from our playtime?’
00:20:46 Ephesians 5:16 encourages us
00:20:50 to ‘make the best use of our time.’
00:20:53 Literally, according to the footnote,
00:20:56 this scripture is telling us
00:20:59 to ‘buy out the appointed time’
00:21:03 —that is, buy it from less important things.
00:21:07 So the question for all of us is,
00:21:10 Have we bought out the majority of our playtime
00:21:13 for more important spiritual responsibilities?
00:21:18 Now, we’ve discussed three negative traits
00:21:21 of a young child that we want to avoid.
00:21:25 If we had time, we could have discussed
00:21:27 other negative traits to be avoided,
00:21:30 such as how children tend to have a short attention span
00:21:35 (they’re easily distracted),
00:21:38 their curiosity often gets them into trouble,
00:21:42 and they generally need a lot of time and attention
00:21:47 (they’re high-maintenance).
00:21:50 But now let’s briefly discuss three positive traits
00:21:54 of a young child that we do well to imitate.
00:21:58 Positive characteristic number one
00:22:01 is at 1 Corinthians 14:20, which we read at the outset.
00:22:08 That scripture tells us
00:22:11 to “be young children as to badness.”
00:22:16 So, what’s the characteristic that we want to imitate?
00:22:20 Young children are innocent,
00:22:23 inexperienced, when it comes to badness.
00:22:28 Or put another way,
00:22:30 they haven’t done many truly bad things.
00:22:34 Like children, we don’t want
00:22:38 to gain knowledge or experience in what is bad.
00:22:42 For example, when it comes to pornography,
00:22:45 we want no experience whatsoever
00:22:49 in regard to this filthy thing of Satan’s world.
00:22:54 When it comes to television programs
00:22:57 that are designated for a “mature audience,”
00:23:01 remember to tell yourself,
00:23:04 ‘I’m not old enough; I’m a young child.’
00:23:09 For positive characteristic number two,
00:23:13 let’s consider Matthew 18:2-4:
00:23:20 “So calling a young child to him,
00:23:23 “he [Jesus] stood him in their midst and said:
00:23:28 “‘Truly I say to you, unless you turn around
00:23:33 “‘and become as young children,
00:23:35 “‘you will by no means enter into the Kingdom of the heavens.
00:23:40 “‘Therefore, whoever  will humble himself like this young child
00:23:45 is the one who is the greatest in the Kingdom of the heavens.’”
00:23:51 What’s the desirable trait?
00:23:53 Young children are humble and teachable.
00:23:57 Young children ask many questions because they want to learn,
00:24:01 but grown-ups are often hesitant to ask questions.
00:24:06 Why?
00:24:08 They don’t want to look uninformed.
00:24:11 But acting like we know something
00:24:14 when we don’t is actually dishonest
00:24:17 and probably motivated by pride.
00:24:21 The point is,
00:24:23 Don’t be afraid to reveal what you don’t know.
00:24:27 Remain humble and teachable like a child.
00:24:34 Now let’s identify desirable trait number three
00:24:38 by going to Matthew 21:15, 16:
00:24:44 “When the chief priests and the scribes
00:24:46 “saw the marvelous things he did
00:24:49 “and the boys who were shouting in the temple,
00:24:53 “‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’
00:24:55 “they became indignant and said to him:
00:24:59 “‘Do you hear what these are saying?’
00:25:02 “Jesus said to them
00:25:04 “‘Yes. Did you never read this,
00:25:07 “‘“Out of the mouth of children and infants
00:25:10 you have brought forth praise”?’”
00:25:13 So, what desirable characteristic can we identify?
00:25:17 Young children are exuberant and enthusiastic.
00:25:23 Well, in like manner,
00:25:25 we want to remain exuberant and expressive
00:25:29 about Jehovah, Jesus,
00:25:33 the Kingdom, and other spiritual things.
00:25:36 Psalm 145:7 encourages us to “bubble over”
00:25:41 and “shout joyfully” because of these wonderful things.
00:25:46 And we never want to lose that childlike enthusiasm.
00:25:52 Well, there we have three desirable traits of a young child
00:25:57 that we want to do our utmost to imitate.
00:26:01 If we had time, we could discuss
00:26:04 several other positive characteristics,
00:26:06 such as how children tend to be trusting,
00:26:11 not prejudiced, and not hypocritical.
00:26:18 But now in review, may each of us
00:26:21 prayerfully strive not to be childish
00:26:25 when it comes to (1) immature feeding habits,
00:26:30 (2) being easily tricked, or fooled,
00:26:36 and (3) preferring play over responsibility.
00:26:41 On the other hand,
00:26:44 may each of us prayerfully strive to be childlike
00:26:48 when it comes to being
00:26:51 (1) innocent and inexperienced concerning badness,
00:26:56 (2) humble and teachable,
00:27:00 and (3) exuberant and enthusiastic
00:27:06 about spiritual things!
00:27:11 The Bible contains many accounts
00:27:13 of faithful men and women.
00:27:16 We can learn from their examples.
00:27:19 In the following dramatization,
00:27:22 notice what a family learns from Samuel.
00:27:35 Samuel was only my age
00:27:37 when Jehovah spoke to him.
00:27:45 He respected Eli, but he had to stand up for what was right.
00:27:59 I never thought that I’d have to do something similar.
00:28:04 I loved my brother, and I always wanted to be like him.
00:28:10 But those pictures of him partying with kids
00:28:12 from school showed he was living a double life.
00:28:18 I didn’t want to get him in trouble.
00:28:30 But I knew I had to say something.
00:28:46 I told him he had to tell Mom and Dad.
00:28:52 He warned me not to tell.
00:29:01 But Samuel was courageous
00:29:03 and “did not hide anything,”
00:29:17 and “Jehovah himself was with him.”
00:29:23 I couldn’t hide this.
00:29:29 Talking to my parents wasn’t easy,
00:29:35 but I knew it was the right thing to do.
00:29:45 Of course, we were proud of Danny.
00:29:48 But . . .
00:29:51 . . . at the time, we were a little distracted.
00:29:54 Maybe, somehow it was all just a misunderstanding.
00:30:10 We needed to know what was going on.
00:30:26 We just wanted to help him.
00:30:37 We couldn’t help but blame ourselves for what was happening.
00:30:50 Then we thought back to Samuel’s example.
00:30:57 Samuel, you need to listen to us.
00:31:01 You’re getting old, Samuel, and your sons are not like you.
00:31:04 They cheat, and they take bribes.
00:31:06 They bend Jehovah’s rules
00:31:10 any way they please.
00:31:12 Even faithful Samuel had sons who deviated from Jehovah’s standards.
00:31:25 We wanted to help our son.
00:31:28 Just as Samuel didn’t alter his course
00:31:31 and Jehovah stood by him,
00:31:33 we knew that if we did things His way,
00:31:39 He’d stand by us.
00:32:04 Did you see the loyalty the younger son showed
00:32:08 by bringing the matter to the attention of his parents?
00:32:12 Did you also notice the loyalty the parents showed
00:32:16 by going to the elders for assistance?
00:32:20 After the parents were able to talk to the elders,
00:32:24 we hope that the older son
00:32:26 was able to get the help he needed
00:32:29 and that the discipline brought him to his senses.
00:32:34 Has your child left Jehovah?
00:32:37 Do you blame yourself?
00:32:39 If so, remember
00:32:42 that Jehovah stood by faithful Samuel,
00:32:45 and He will stand by you.
00:32:47 He’ll help you endure.
00:32:52 Another challenge we face today
00:32:54 is remaining united
00:32:57 in a deeply divided world.
00:33:00 During the 1950’s and 1960’s,
00:33:04 racial tensions in the United States
00:33:07 greatly intensified.
00:33:10 How were Jehovah’s people affected during that period?
00:33:14 And how did they maintain unity?
00:33:18 Let’s look for the answers to those questions
00:33:21 in the following report.
00:33:42 My mother always said,
00:33:44 “Jehovah did not intend for all of us to look alike.”
00:33:50 In those early days,
00:33:52 we would work every house in the county
00:33:56 —black families, white families, any color.
00:34:00 At school, there was pressure there
00:34:04 to be involved with the racial activity.
00:34:08 We would hear about the problems and the issues.
00:34:12 It would be in the news, and you would know
00:34:15 what was going on in the South.
00:34:18 Some may wonder,
00:34:20 ‘How is it that our people,
00:34:26 ‘that is, Jehovah’s Witnesses, black and white,
00:34:29 ‘could maintain such unity
00:34:34 when the world around them was falling apart?’
00:34:38 I grew up in central New York
00:34:39 —Utica, New York.
00:34:41 And I remember in the Kingdom Ministry  back in 1956,
00:34:46 there were articles about serving where the need is great.
00:34:50 They needed some of the black friends to serve in the South.
00:34:56 I married my husband, Earl McGee,
00:34:58 on June 2, 1956.
00:35:01 When we were married, Brother T. J. Sullivan gave a talk
00:35:05 at the Hallandale convention on serving where the need is greater.
00:35:10 He encouraged not only families but,
00:35:13 he said, newly married couples.
00:35:15 And so we planned for it, and he wrote the branch.
00:35:18 We were assigned to Florida,
00:35:21 and then in 1962, we started in the circuit work.
00:35:24 And our first circuit was in Alabama,
00:35:26 and it was not integrated.
00:35:30 We served together, Edna and I did,
00:35:34 in the pioneer work by assignment.
00:35:37 The last assignment was the Society assigning us
00:35:42 to North Carolina and then from there to the circuit work.
00:35:45 After the first circuit, which was in the Carolinas and Georgia,
00:35:50 we were assigned to Gilead.
00:35:56 I got married on April 23, 1949.
00:36:02 I’ve been in full-time service
00:36:04 70 years with my wife.
00:36:07 I was assigned
00:36:09 to Circuit 18 in Alabama.
00:36:14 My first circuit assignment was in Mississippi.
00:36:17 It had the reputation
00:36:20 as the worst state in the Union for race relations.
00:36:23 And then after we got there, there were three civil rights workers
00:36:27 who were killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi.
00:36:31 That was our circuit.
00:36:34 So those were the things we had to deal with.
00:36:39 We were busy in our ministry,
00:36:42 so it didn’t bother us very much.
00:36:45 The black worked the black, and the white worked the white.
00:36:50 So we just obeyed the customary law of staying segregated.
00:36:57 Lots of movements were happening, and people were, you know, very hostile.
00:37:03 When there was a march or any tension
00:37:05 where we were serving there in Alabama,
00:37:08 we wouldn’t go to the town on Saturday afternoon
00:37:11 to do street witnessing because if there was a rally
00:37:15 or something going on, we would just stay in the neighborhood.
00:37:18 A lot were what they used to call back then Freedom Riders,
00:37:22 people getting on buses going south,
00:37:24 and people coming in to register voters.
00:37:27 The fact is, some of the civil rights organizations
00:37:30 were set up in Mississippi and going pretty strong.
00:37:33 So as a result, they would think
00:37:36 that because we were active in going door to door,
00:37:38 we could just incorporate civil rights issues
00:37:41 and things like that into our work.
00:37:44 One of our classmates in the 27th class
00:37:48 was a black brother, a fellow student,
00:37:51 and we became very close friends there.
00:37:53 After we left Gilead, we were going to our assignments
00:37:57 and we stopped at a convention in Alabama.
00:38:00 And the convention was segregated
00:38:04 —one race on one side and one race on another.
00:38:07 And it was very difficult —painful—
00:38:10 for us not to be able to closely associate with our dear friend.
00:38:14 So we had this talk show on the television.
00:38:18 The circuit overseer and I went and also a Catholic priest
00:38:22 and an Episcopal minister.
00:38:24 So the Episcopal minister, a young minister,
00:38:27 asked what were we doing about the marching.
00:38:30 So I told him that we weren’t doing anything about the marching.
00:38:34 Well, that showed a contrast.
00:38:36 I’m black, and he’s white.
00:38:39 They weren’t stopping their marching to help us preach
00:38:42 the good news of the Kingdom, so we weren’t going to stop
00:38:44 preaching the good news of the Kingdom to help them march.
00:38:48 The brothers always were interested in each other.
00:38:53 So if there was a black congregation and a white congregation,
00:38:58 we had interest and fellow feeling for both.
00:39:02 The rule was we were not to meet together, and we couldn’t meet together.
00:39:06 But we could talk to one another, and we could visit one another.
00:39:10 So I think there was great support on both sides,
00:39:13 black and white brothers, back in those days.
00:39:17 If we had a problem getting a facility, for example,
00:39:20 they’d have contacts and they could get certain things done.
00:39:24 So, basically, we worked together.
00:39:27 The congregation started integrating
00:39:29 after certain civil rights laws were passed.
00:39:34 We had a big meeting of all the elders,
00:39:38 and we worked out the territory assignments
00:39:41 and whatever else was necessary
00:39:43 to have integrated congregations.
00:39:47 Some friends would feel,
00:39:49 and maybe rightly so at the time,
00:39:52 that there would be some violence if we integrated.
00:39:56 There probably were some Kingdom Halls damaged
00:39:59 and things like that as a result.
00:40:01 But the fact is,
00:40:03 there was integration going on in other places
00:40:06 —in the schools and things like that and in the universities and colleges.
00:40:10 And so it was obvious that if they could do it, then we even more so.
00:40:14 The process of integration
00:40:17 was successful
00:40:20 because it was under Jehovah’s direction.
00:40:23 Both black and white,
00:40:25 we had the same thing in common:
00:40:28 We loved Jehovah.
00:40:30 And despite us,
00:40:33 Jehovah got it done for us and brought us together.
00:40:38 And we have been unified ever since.
00:40:43 Everyone could see that we were united.
00:40:46 One brother was working from door to door,
00:40:49 black and white, and a lady came to the door (white),
00:40:53 and she said she was happy
00:40:56 to see this unity take place.
00:41:00 She had looked forward to it for a long time.
00:41:04 We have formed, with Jehovah’s help
00:41:07 by means of his holy spirit,
00:41:10 a worldwide brotherhood.
00:41:12 Granted, they have their imperfections,
00:41:15 but it is a brotherhood
00:41:17 and something to be truly marveled at.
00:41:21 The brothers began to feel
00:41:24 what we knew was true:
00:41:26 We’re all one organization.
00:41:30 They began to feel it.
00:41:31 They began to experience it.
00:41:33 We loved Jehovah, and we loved our brothers,
00:41:37 so there you have it.
00:41:40 How could you fail to have unity
00:41:43 when Jehovah had drawn you together?
00:41:49 Satan is the prime one to divide people.
00:41:52 Jesus died for the whole world of mankind,
00:41:57 so who would that exclude?
00:42:00 No one.
00:42:06 Did you notice what helped our brothers maintain unity
00:42:10 during that difficult time?
00:42:12 First: Despite prevailing customs,
00:42:16 our brothers —black and white—
00:42:20 supported each other, helped each other,
00:42:23 and worked together to advance Kingdom interests.
00:42:28 Second: They remained focused on the ministry
00:42:32 and did not get involved with social movements.
00:42:37 They wanted all to know that God’s Kingdom
00:42:40 is the only solution to mankind’s problems,
00:42:43 including the plague of prejudice
00:42:47 and racial inequality.
00:42:49 Third: They demonstrated love for Jehovah
00:42:54 and love for the brothers.
00:42:56 As Brother Benford said,
00:42:58 “How could you fail to have unity
00:43:02 when Jehovah had drawn you together?”
00:43:07 Impartiality, humility,
00:43:11 kindness—these are godly qualities
00:43:15 and childlike qualities
00:43:17 that our new music video illustrates.
00:43:31 Jesus kindly showed us That we must be as young ones,
00:43:41 Remembering that in a world of pride, We need a heart just like a child.
00:43:52 We value others, seeing what God sees through his impartial eyes.
00:44:01 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:44:14 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:44:24 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:44:35 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:44:46 And as we’re getting older In a world that’s getting colder,
00:44:55 We easily could question others’ ways, Their motives, and the things they say.
00:45:07 And seeing others as above us is rare this day and age.
00:45:17 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:45:28 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:45:39 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:45:50 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:46:00 Be just like a child.
00:46:07 While we keep growing, Serving Jehovah,
00:46:13 And finding joy in  The part we’re playing,
00:46:19 We must remember That in a world of pride,
00:46:25 We need a heart like that of a child.
00:46:50 Just like a child, we want to love one another,
00:47:02 With our eyes just seeing the good in each other.
00:47:12 Just like a child, we want to be full of kindness,
00:47:23 With our eyes not focused on what could divide us.
00:47:33 Be just like a child.
00:47:41 What a beautiful song!
00:47:44 We need a childlike heart more than ever.
00:47:49 In many parts of the world,
00:47:52 it’s customary to judge people
00:47:54 on the basis of their race or age
00:47:57 or by how much money they have.
00:47:59 In our next segment,
00:48:01 we’ll hear from brothers and sisters
00:48:04 who have successfully resisted such influences.
00:48:20 I grew up in a country where people judge you according to the color of your skin.
00:48:25 There was black, white, mixed race,
00:48:28 but we all kept separate.
00:48:34 I needed to learn, not to see color, but to see people.
00:48:39 Even though it’s such a multicultural area,
00:48:43 there is still this prejudice that exists.
00:48:46 I’ve witnessed times where ones from another country
00:48:49 are often left isolated or are treated in a way that they’re not welcome here.
00:48:54 If we’re not careful, these attitudes could creep into the congregation.
00:48:58 We could have isolated groups
00:49:00 of cultures that maybe would stick together.
00:49:05 In the area where I grew up,
00:49:07 young ones show great respect for older ones.
00:49:11 Older ones, however, do not give much importance to young people.
00:49:18 This attitude, or culture,
00:49:20 has a major impact on recommendations of young ones as elders in the congregation.
00:49:25 We might say, ‘In my opinion, he is too young
00:49:29 to be appointed as an elder in the congregation.’
00:49:34 In this area, people sort of open up to you when you appear rich.
00:49:39 In some areas, they would even wonder
00:49:41 what you are doing there if you don’t have the right kind of looks
00:49:45 in terms of what you can afford to wear,
00:49:47 what kind of car you can afford to drive, what your profession is.
00:49:51 If we brought that with us into the Christian congregation,
00:49:55 then what Solomon mentions
00:49:57 could be the case —that we actively seek the friendship
00:50:00 of those whom we regard to be rich and abandon those who are poor.
00:50:04 I like the example in Galatians of Peter.
00:50:07 He grew up in an area where there was a lot of prejudice.
00:50:11 It wasn’t something that he overcame straightaway.
00:50:14 If I’m not careful, I think it would be easy for me
00:50:17 to slide back and see people as a different race,
00:50:21 and that would affect the way I view my brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:50:26 The article mentions that when we use the Bible,
00:50:30 it helps us to make changes.
00:50:33 We need to constantly look at ourselves
00:50:36 so that we can continue to make progress.
00:50:41 In the article, it mentioned about ‘opening our hearts wide’
00:50:45 —whether it’d be working with them in the ministry
00:50:47 or having them over socially,
00:50:50 not just from the same group that we might be comfortable with,
00:50:53 but actually with different ones from different backgrounds.
00:50:58 Timothy was still a young man, but the apostle Paul
00:51:01 had given him heavy responsibility in the congregation.
00:51:05 The article mentions that ‘the Scriptures do not give an exact age
00:51:10 for recommendation of brothers as ministerial servants or elders.’
00:51:22 Recommending a younger brother as an elder in the congregation
00:51:26 has been a great blessing to us.
00:51:31 In the article, there was a little phrase
00:51:34 that has become a guiding principle for me.
00:51:37 Jehovah does not judge our relationship with him
00:51:40 by what we possess.
00:51:42 So when I meet new brothers and sisters
00:51:45 and for a moment I’m tempted
00:51:48 to judge, or view, them
00:51:51 according to those sentiments as to whether they are rich or poor,
00:51:55 that principle comes into my mind.
00:51:57 My focus, therefore, shifts to who they really are
00:52:01 in terms of their devotion to Jehovah —their faith.
00:52:05 That is what we build friendships on.
00:52:08 I have friends from different cultures, different races.
00:52:11 And I don’t see them as color,
00:52:14 but I see my brother or my sister.
00:52:17 I’ve got the most amazing friendships
00:52:19 with ones from different backgrounds and cultures
00:52:22 —something I will always, always cherish.
00:52:31 So our congregation is a wonderful place for everybody.
00:52:37 There is no emphasis on who is rich and who is poor.
00:52:39 Friendships are built on the basis of our love for Jehovah.
00:53:01 This month’s program
00:53:03 encouraged us to be childlike.
00:53:07 We learned from the encouraging example
00:53:09 of servants of Jehovah in the past.
00:53:13 We saw that love for Jehovah
00:53:16 and our brothers unites us,
00:53:19 even during times of social unrest.
00:53:23 We were reminded that, like a child,
00:53:26 we want to be impartial,
00:53:29 loving, and kind.
00:53:33 And we heard expressions from brothers
00:53:35 who have learned to treat others fairly
00:53:37 no matter their race, age,
00:53:40 wealth, or anything else
00:53:43 that could divide them.
00:53:46 Now it’s time for our video postcard,
00:53:51 which comes to us from the Czech Republic, also called Czechia.
00:53:55 Czechia is a land
00:53:57 of deep forests, farmland, vineyards,
00:54:01 as well as medieval castles, towns, and cities.
00:54:05 Prague, the capital, was established more than a thousand years ago.
00:54:10 It has a rich religious history.
00:54:14 God’s name can be found on many churches
00:54:17 and structures.
00:54:19 Czechia is home to more than 15,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:54:24 There are 32 congregations in Prague.
00:54:28 This is the Prague-Dejvice Congregation,
00:54:31 which has 84 publishers,
00:54:34 including 13 regular pioneers.
00:54:37 Their territory is large and diverse.
00:54:40 They preach in the historic center of Prague
00:54:44 in neighborhoods, parks, and on university campuses.
00:54:49 The congregation includes a Spanish-speaking group,
00:54:52 with 12 publishers,
00:54:55 of which 8 are regular pioneers.
00:54:58 This group serves the entire city.
00:55:02 Zbynek and Jarmila Bucifal
00:55:06 helped to secretly produce Bible literature
00:55:10 during the Communist regime,
00:55:12 when the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses was banned.
00:55:16 Zbynek was forced
00:55:19 to work in a coal mine for remaining neutral
00:55:22 and refusing to serve in the military.
00:55:26 After the regime change,
00:55:29 he served as a circuit overseer.
00:55:33 Our brothers and sisters in the Prague-Dejvice Congregation
00:55:38 send their warm, loving greetings
00:55:42 to all of you.
00:55:45 Earlier, we showed you a preview
00:55:48 of this year’s “Always Rejoice!” conventions.
00:55:52 But would you like a glimpse of this year’s feature Bible drama,
00:55:56 which brings to life the story of courageous Nehemiah?
00:56:02 Please enjoy!
00:56:07 Far from Israel lived a Jew
00:56:10 whom the king of Persia
00:56:11 trusted with his life.
00:56:15 He believed his people were carrying
00:56:17 on pure worship in Jerusalem
00:56:19 —until one day . . .
00:56:25 The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,
00:56:29 and its gates have been burned with fire.
00:56:33 Most of the people ignore God’s Law.
00:56:48 Rebuilding the walls was only the beginning.
00:56:50 We have many powerful enemies.
00:56:53 I recommend we turn
00:56:55 the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.
00:56:58 Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.
00:56:59 Who is going to tell him?
00:57:01 This is my province!
00:57:03 Out here, I decide what to do.
00:57:05 I have a right to live where I choose,
00:57:07 and so do you.
00:57:09 They would need help to face what
00:57:11 was about to come next.
00:57:12 Every man must find
00:57:14 his own joy, and I intend to find mine.
00:57:18 Why should you complain
00:57:19 when everyone else approves?
00:57:21 If we let mere threats
00:57:23 frighten us into stopping, they will have
00:57:24 achieved their goal.
00:57:25 Are you going to wait
00:57:26 until they start killing us?
00:57:28 We’re powerless to stop this.
00:57:34 Do remember me favorably, O my God.
00:57:42 We know you’ll enjoy the convention.
00:57:46 And it’s my pleasure to announce
00:57:49 that we’ll conclude the convention on Sunday
00:57:52 with a new original song.
00:57:54 The song and lyrics are now available
00:57:58 on jw.org®.
00:58:01 The Governing Body requests that everyone in the congregation
00:58:05 please practice the new song before going to the convention.
00:58:10 If someone in your congregation needs help to download the song,
00:58:15 please help them and practice with them.
00:58:19 Then together we’ll sing out
00:58:22 with all of our heart to Jehovah’s praise.
00:58:27 That brings this month’s program to an end.
00:58:31 Please know that the Governing Body loves
00:58:36 all of you brothers and sisters very much.
00:58:41 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:58:46 this is JW Broadcasting!

00:00:03 Welcome to our program!
00:00:06 This month’s theme is
00:00:08 “Are You Paying Attention?”
00:00:11 Strained relationships,
00:00:13 illnesses,
00:00:16 careers,
00:00:18 entertainment
00:00:20 —we’ll learn how to stay focused on Jehovah
00:00:25 despite these potential distractions.
00:00:28 We’ll see how our ministry is more effective
00:00:31 when we focus on reaching the hearts of people.
00:00:35 And our new song was written
00:00:37 especially for you young adults
00:00:40 to help you keep your eyes
00:00:42 on the prize of life.
00:00:44 This is JW Broadcasting®
00:00:47 for November 2020.
00:01:08 Are you paying attention?
00:01:11 Perhaps you’ve been asked that question
00:01:13 by your parents, a teacher,
00:01:16 or someone else in authority.
00:01:19 It’s a good question for each of us to ask ourselves.
00:01:24 Can you think of occasions associated with our worship
00:01:27 that require us to pay special attention?
00:01:31 For example, when reading the Bible, attending meetings,
00:01:36 elders when shepherding,
00:01:38 you children when being instructed by your parents.
00:01:43 We want to pay attention,
00:01:45 and yet there are so many distractions
00:01:48 —electronic gadgets,
00:01:50 the conversations and activities of those around us.
00:01:54 Truly, it can be a challenge to pay attention.
00:02:00 Did you know that the phrase “pay attention”
00:02:03 occurs dozens of times in the New World Translation?
00:02:07 In many of those occurrences,
00:02:10 Jehovah is instructing his people to pay attention.
00:02:15 What does it mean to “pay attention”?
00:02:17 And how important is it
00:02:20 that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?
00:02:25 The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15
00:02:28 will help us to answer those questions.
00:02:31 In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul
00:02:35 to strike down the Amalekites
00:02:37 and to devote them and everything they have to destruction.
00:02:43 However, verses 8 and 9 tell us
00:02:46 that Saul did not obey.
00:02:50 He spared the king of Amalek
00:02:52 and the best of the animals.
00:02:55 How did Saul respond
00:02:58 when Samuel confronted him?
00:03:02 As we read verses 13-15,
00:03:05 note how Saul tried to justify his disobedience:
00:03:11 “When Samuel finally came to him,
00:03:14 “Saul said to him:
00:03:16 “‘May Jehovah bless you.
00:03:18 “I have carried out the word of Jehovah.’
00:03:22 “But Samuel said:
00:03:24 “‘Then what is this sound of the flock in my ears
00:03:28 “and the sound of the cattle that I hear?’
00:03:31 “To this Saul said:
00:03:33 “‘They were brought from the Amalekites,
00:03:35 “‘because the people spared the best of the flock and the herd
00:03:40 “‘for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God;
00:03:44 but what was left we devoted to destruction.’”
00:03:49 Did you notice?
00:03:51 Saul attempted to justify his disobedience,
00:03:56 claiming that the animals would be sacrificed to Jehovah.
00:04:01 Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?
00:04:05 As we read verse 22,
00:04:07 please note the connection between paying attention
00:04:11 and obedience:
00:04:14 “Samuel then said:
00:04:17 “‘Does Jehovah take as much pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices
00:04:22 “‘as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?
00:04:26 “‘Look!
00:04:28 “‘To obey is better than a sacrifice,
00:04:32 and to pay attention than the fat of rams.’”
00:04:36 What was one of the causes of Saul’s disobedience?
00:04:41 He didn’t pay attention to Jehovah’s instructions.
00:04:46 His failure to pay attention resulted in disobedience
00:04:50 and brought Jehovah’s disapproval.
00:04:54 What a powerful lesson for us!
00:04:57 As happened with Saul,
00:04:59 our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah
00:05:02 if we fail to pay attention!
00:05:07 Now that we understand why it is important to pay attention,
00:05:12 let’s consider three aspects of paying attention
00:05:15 that are discussed in the Bible.
00:05:18 The first scripture we’ll consider
00:05:21 is 2 Chronicles 19:6:
00:05:27 “And he [Jehoshaphat] said to the judges:
00:05:32 “‘Pay attention to what you are doing,
00:05:36 “‘for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah,
00:05:41 and he is with you when you pass judgment.’”
00:05:46 This admonition to “pay attention”
00:05:50 was given by King Jehoshaphat
00:05:52 to appointed judges throughout the land of Judah.
00:05:55 What a sobering reminder!
00:05:59 Those judges had good reason
00:06:01 to pay attention to what they were doing.
00:06:04 Why?
00:06:06 They were responsible to Jehovah.
00:06:09 They represented him,
00:06:11 and their decisions affected the lives of fellow worshippers.
00:06:16 Thus, they needed to be familiar with Jehovah’s thinking on matters
00:06:20 and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint
00:06:23 when handling matters.
00:06:26 This is an excellent reminder for those who serve as elders.
00:06:30 Good elders are good students of the Bible
00:06:33 and Bible-based publications.
00:06:36 Why?
00:06:38 Their attentiveness to Jehovah
00:06:41 enables them to pay attention to what they are doing.
00:06:45 If they are going to represent Jehovah
00:06:48 and reflect his thinking accurately as they handle matters
00:06:52 —whether they’re shepherding the congregation,
00:06:55 delivering a part at a meeting,
00:06:57 caring for a challenging assignment,
00:07:00 or addressing wrongdoing
00:07:02 —they must pay attention to what they are doing.
00:07:06 That is why they must be familiar with Jehovah’s thinking
00:07:10 and then take care to follow his direction.
00:07:14 If they do, they show that they are paying attention
00:07:18 to what they are doing.
00:07:21 Jehovah’s interest in assisting the elders
00:07:24 is demonstrated in the ongoing education he provides.
00:07:28 Each time the circuit overseer visits the congregation,
00:07:32 he presents material prepared especially for the elders.
00:07:37 The Kingdom Ministry School and the School for Congregation Elders
00:07:41 provide more intensive instruction.
00:07:44 How important
00:07:46 that elders pay close attention to
00:07:49 and apply such instruction!
00:07:52 Their doing so protects, not just themselves
00:07:56 but also fellow worshippers.
00:07:59 By paying attention, elders will be able
00:08:02 to convey direction to the congregations accurately.
00:08:07 This can be especially important if our worship is banned
00:08:11 or restricted in the event of a natural disaster
00:08:15 or other catastrophic event.
00:08:18 This brings us to the second aspect of paying attention
00:08:21 that we’ll consider.
00:08:24 Let’s read Luke 8:18:
00:08:28 “Therefore,
00:08:31 “pay attention to how you listen,
00:08:35 “for whoever has will be given more,
00:08:38 “but whoever does not have,
00:08:41 even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.”
00:08:47 What did Jesus mean when he said:
00:08:49 “Pay attention to how you listen”?
00:08:54 Those in Jesus’ audience in the first century
00:08:57 had the wonderful privilege of hearing Jesus’ literal voice
00:09:02 as he instructed them.
00:09:04 Of course, we can’t hear the voice of Jesus today,
00:09:09 but we can read his words and learn of his actions
00:09:13 as revealed in the Gospel accounts.
00:09:15 In fact, we have many opportunities to listen
00:09:20 to Jehovah, Jesus,
00:09:23 “the faithful and discreet slave,”
00:09:25 the elders in our congregation,
00:09:28 our marriage mate,
00:09:30 and our children.
00:09:32 No wonder the Bible writer James stated
00:09:35 that “everyone must be quick to listen.”
00:09:40 Think about it:
00:09:42 If Saul had truly listened receptively
00:09:45 to Jehovah’s direction regarding the Amalekites,
00:09:48 he would likely have grasped the importance of the direction he received
00:09:53 and would have been motivated to obey.
00:09:56 However, his lack of attentiveness
00:09:59 led to disobedience and Jehovah’s disapproval.
00:10:05 If we don’t pay attention to how we listen,
00:10:08 we could find ourselves becoming critical
00:10:11 or unappreciative
00:10:13 or even disobedient.
00:10:17 So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,
00:10:21 we need to think about what we are being told,
00:10:24 ponder over its meaning,
00:10:26 mull it over in our mind and, most important,
00:10:30 apply the instruction in our own lives.
00:10:35 If you’re a young person,
00:10:37 how can you show that you’re paying attention
00:10:41 to how you listen?
00:10:43 Consider the admonition at Ephesians 6:1-3:
00:10:50 “Children, be obedient to your parents
00:10:54 “in union with the Lord,
00:10:56 “for this is righteous.
00:10:58 “‘Honor your father and your mother’
00:11:01 “is the first command with a promise:
00:11:03 “‘That it may go well with you
00:11:05 and you may remain a long time on the earth.’”
00:11:11 You children, who do you think is the source of this direction?
00:11:17 We know that these words come from Jehovah.
00:11:21 Did you notice that the verses state not only
00:11:24 that children should “be obedient” to their parents
00:11:28 but also that they should “honor” their parents?
00:11:35 How can you show that you’re paying attention
00:11:37 to how you listen to this direction?
00:11:41 When I was a boy, I can remember occasions
00:11:45 when my parents would ask me to do something,
00:11:47 perhaps to take out the trash.
00:11:51 I would always obey.
00:11:53 But at times, I’d make it very clear
00:11:56 that I didn’t really want to do what was asked.
00:12:00 I think you young ones know what I mean.
00:12:05 However, if we’re truly paying attention
00:12:07 to how we listen to Jehovah’s words,
00:12:11 we’ll be careful to honor our parents,
00:12:14 which is an essential element of obedience.
00:12:18 In this way, we contribute to the peace of the family,
00:12:22 and we make Jehovah’s heart glad.
00:12:27 Additionally, as the promise in verse 3 indicates,
00:12:32 paying attention to how you listen will protect you
00:12:36 and contribute to your success in other ways
00:12:39 throughout your adult life.
00:12:42 Of course, all of us should remember
00:12:45 that our everlasting welfare will depend
00:12:47 on our willingness to listen and obey.
00:12:52 How important, then, that all of us
00:12:55 pay attention to how we listen.
00:12:59 The third aspect of paying attention is found
00:13:03 at Luke 21:34, 35:
00:13:10 “But pay attention to yourselves
00:13:14 “that your hearts never become weighed down
00:13:17 “with overeating and heavy drinking
00:13:20 “and anxieties of life,
00:13:22 and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.”
00:13:30 When Jesus admonished his followers
00:13:32 to pay attention to themselves,
00:13:35 he didn’t have in mind the selfish thinking that characterized King Saul
00:13:40 and that’s so common, even encouraged, in today’s world.
00:13:46 Rather, Jesus’ words reveal
00:13:48 that the key to paying attention to ourselves
00:13:51 is knowing ourselves
00:13:54 —knowing what’s in our figurative heart.
00:13:58 This is a challenge for all of us.
00:14:00 Why?
00:14:02 The Bible explains at Jeremiah 17:9:
00:14:07 “The heart is more treacherous than anything else
00:14:11 “and is desperate.
00:14:13 Who can know it?”
00:14:16 Verse 10 answers:
00:14:19 “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart,
00:14:22 examining the innermost thoughts.”
00:14:26 So Jehovah knows what is in our heart,
00:14:29 and he can help us to know.
00:14:32 He can help us to examine our motives and goals
00:14:36 and to discern why we do certain things.
00:14:40 Carefully and honestly looking at ourselves in the mirror of God’s Word
00:14:45 can reveal areas in our thinking, words,
00:14:48 and actions
00:14:50 that need attention.
00:14:53 For example, some of Jehovah’s people
00:14:56 —including those of retirement age
00:14:58 who have enjoyed very comfortable circumstances—
00:15:01 have concluded that they needed to make adjustments in their lifestyle,
00:15:05 simplifying their lives
00:15:08 so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.
00:15:12 Some who have done so have had the privilege
00:15:15 of attending the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:15:19 Although it meant stepping out of their comfort zone,
00:15:22 perhaps moving to a new congregation,
00:15:26 they’ve experienced Jehovah’s blessing in ways that they couldn’t have anticipated
00:15:31 as they share the benefits of their experience
00:15:34 and theocratic education
00:15:36 in their new assignments.
00:15:39 How grateful we are
00:15:41 that Jehovah is providing ongoing, life-saving instruction
00:15:45 by means of his Word and organization.
00:15:49 May each of us be determined to “pay attention”
00:15:53 to what we are doing,
00:15:55 to how we listen,
00:15:57 and to ourselves.
00:16:00 By doing so, we’ll avoid falling into the trap of disobedience
00:16:05 as King Saul did.
00:16:07 Instead, as attentive and obedient servants,
00:16:12 we’ll enjoy Jehovah’s friendship forever.
00:16:17 Elders play an important role
00:16:19 in helping us stay focused on Jehovah,
00:16:22 particularly when we’re facing difficult problems.
00:16:26 In our first video,
00:16:28 notice how elders provide loving assistance.
00:16:33 Everything was going fine in my marriage
00:16:36 —or so I thought.
00:16:38 My ex-husband was disfellowshipped,
00:16:42 left home
00:16:43 and, in less than a month, we divorced.
00:16:51 Right after the divorce, I had to figure out
00:16:53 how I would provide for the girls,
00:17:00 so I began working as a cleaner.
00:17:04 I also had to provide for them spiritually.
00:17:10 But many times, because of discouragement and tiredness,
00:17:14 I couldn’t be there for them as much as they needed me to be.
00:17:20 Besides all of this,
00:17:22 I also had to deal with very negative feelings.
00:17:26 It was a very difficult time in my life.
00:17:38 I had never been so sick.
00:17:40 I couldn’t even get up to go to the hospital.
00:17:46 To cope with this problem, I just kept praying.
00:17:50 I was not able to walk, and I was not able to get to the meetings.
00:17:57 The elders realized that I was missing from the meetings.
00:18:06 The elders quickly came to my aid.
00:18:11 I remember that one of the things
00:18:14 that touched me the most
00:18:16 was when the elders read a scripture.
00:18:20 Psalm 139:3:
00:18:24 “You observe me when I travel and when I lie down;
00:18:28 you are familiar with all my ways.”
00:18:31 I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.
00:18:35 It was as if Jehovah was healing me.
00:18:38 I now knew that Jehovah was interested in me
00:18:42 and that he was looking after me.
00:18:44 He was making sure that I knew it.
00:18:47 Something else that I remember fondly
00:18:50 was after a meeting at the Kingdom Hall.
00:18:53 One of the elders gave me some scriptures to read at home
00:18:57 and said that if we needed any help,
00:19:00 the elders were there for us.
00:19:05 Two elders lovingly came to see me,
00:19:08 because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.
00:19:13 I live very far from the Kingdom Hall.
00:19:16 But the brothers made the sacrifice to get public transport,
00:19:19 get off at the main road,
00:19:21 and from there they walked 40 minutes
00:19:24 to reach my house.
00:19:26 I don’t know what I would have done.
00:19:30 When the elders arrived, they listened to me,
00:19:34 they cried with me, and they read the Bible with me.
00:19:40 Jehovah loves me.
00:19:42 When I started to feel better,
00:19:46 I went back to the group.
00:19:49 I was really happy to be back with my brothers.
00:19:57 Now, after all the help we have received, we are doing well.
00:20:03 The congregation is our second home, and we feel very good there.
00:20:09 Everything I have today, I owe to the brothers and sisters,
00:20:13 especially the elders.
00:20:16 I see shepherding calls as a very evident way
00:20:20 in which Jehovah demonstrates his full love for us.
00:20:25 I understand that at times
00:20:27 these visits might be a challenge for the elders,
00:20:31 but the results are really good.
00:20:33 Without a doubt, they can see that all the work
00:20:36 and all the effort is worthwhile.
00:20:39 I will never forget the help that I received from the elders.
00:20:43 This situation taught me that Jehovah will not let his sheep get lost,
00:20:47 not even one.
00:20:49 Jeremiah 23:4 says:
00:20:52 “‘And I will raise up over them shepherds
00:20:54 “‘who will really shepherd them.
00:20:56 “‘They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,
00:21:00 and none will be missing,’ declares Jehovah.”
00:21:04 How did the elders help Mariana and Elias?
00:21:08 As good shepherds,
00:21:10 they were attentive to Jehovah’s flock,
00:21:13 so they were quick to notice that help was needed.
00:21:16 They visited Mariana and Elias in their homes,
00:21:20 shared encouraging scriptures, and listened.
00:21:25 They showed that Jehovah cares for every one of his sheep.
00:21:30 Those brothers, like the elders in your congregation,
00:21:34 paid attention to the loving training and instruction
00:21:38 they’d received from Jehovah.
00:21:42 To expand their ministry,
00:21:44 many Witnesses have learned another language.
00:21:46 Have you?
00:21:48 If so, Jehovah knows your selfless effort and hard work
00:21:53 to preach and teach in that language.
00:21:57 But is preaching to people in their native language
00:22:00 sufficient to reach their heart?
00:22:03 Let’s see in this dramatization.
00:22:10 Our family had been learning Chinese for over a year.
00:22:13 It wasn’t easy.
00:22:16 God has many titles.
00:22:18 Did you know he has only one name?
00:22:21 [Speaking Chinese]
00:22:34 I was ready, or at least I thought so.
00:22:37 Matthew!
00:22:38 Yeah, I’ll be right there.
00:22:48 We were making progress,
00:22:50 and we weren’t giving up.
00:23:16 It seemed like most people just weren’t interested.
00:23:23 We were not having a good morning.
00:23:33 What happened?
00:23:35 Mom and Liz weren’t having a good morning either.
00:23:42 Brother and Sister Lin joined us.
00:23:44 They’ve been a big help to us.
00:23:48 We told them about our morning.
00:23:50 We were finally able to converse a little and give presentations,
00:23:54 but everything seemed to fall flat.
00:23:58 You ask good questions at the door
00:24:01 —but not always the right one.
00:24:04 You see, when you learn the language,
00:24:07 do not forget to learn about people.
00:24:11 He was right.
00:24:14 Our questions started conversations in our old territory, but not here.
00:24:20 Your pronunciation is very good, see.
00:24:22 Thanks, Brother Lin.
00:24:23 We needed a different approach
00:24:26 where we didn’t just learn the language
00:24:28 but also how to reach the heart of someone who speaks it.
00:24:34 In the July 2019 Watchtower,
00:24:36 we read about “Reaching the Hearts of Nonreligious People.”
00:24:39 Did you notice in paragraph 7,
00:24:41 how do you think that we could be more like the apostle Paul?
00:24:45 Well, Paul was a Jew,
00:24:47 but when he was talking to other people,
00:24:50 he had to adapt his presentation.
00:24:52 I like what 1 Corinthians 9:20-23 says:
00:24:56 “To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews;
00:25:00 to those under law I became . . .”
00:25:02 Liz was right.
00:25:04 When Paul spoke to fellow Jews in Athens,
00:25:07 he reasoned from the Scriptures.
00:25:10 But when he spoke to the Greeks at the Areopagus, he adapted,
00:25:14 reasoning with them first without the Bible.
00:25:16 He later wrote:
00:25:19 “I have become all things to people of all sorts,
00:25:22 so that I might by all possible means save some.”
00:25:27 That’s what we needed to do.
00:25:31 We learned more about the people.
00:25:38 We started to listen more and talk about things
00:25:42 that interested them.
00:25:50 We found different ways to start conversations.
00:26:00 And we kept learning more about the culture.
00:26:03 Part of a Chinese proverb I found says:
00:26:06 “He who comes near ink is stained black.”
00:26:09 It’s been a great way to introduce
00:26:11 Proverbs 13:20:
00:26:13 “The one walking with the wise will become wise.”
00:26:31 It all comes down to showing love.
00:26:48 The more we paid attention to how we were teaching,
00:26:53 the more we were able to show people the God who loves them.
00:27:03 What a beautiful reminder that in the ministry,
00:27:06 we want to pay attention to people
00:27:08 —to what interests them and to what helps them!
00:27:12 And as we saw,
00:27:14 we may need to analyze and adapt our teaching methods,
00:27:18 just as Paul did.
00:27:22 Even as we endeavor to reach the hearts of people in the ministry,
00:27:26 we must safeguard our own heart.
00:27:29 A recent Watchtower article
00:27:31 offered practical suggestions to help us do that.
00:27:35 In our next video,
00:27:37 notice how our brothers benefited from applying what they learned.
00:27:57 Well, very good friends of ours
00:27:59 decided they wanted to go their own way and leave Jehovah.
00:28:03 And in the interim, they became bad association for us.
00:28:07 We had many good times together.
00:28:09 We drove to isolated territory together;
00:28:13 we even visited a brother who was sick in the hospital to encourage him.
00:28:20 I feel heartbroken
00:28:22 that they’re no longer serving Jehovah.
00:28:24 It’s really hard to lose a friend spiritually —very hard.
00:28:27 I was about to enter into full-time service,
00:28:31 but I still needed reassurance.
00:28:34 I was raised by my mother as a Witness.
00:28:38 Even though I had very little contact with my father,
00:28:41 he still tried to oppose my spiritual progress.
00:28:43 I kept fighting for the truth,
00:28:46 and I got baptized when I was 11.
00:28:49 I guess I felt like I was doing OK.
00:28:52 And after high school, I went to university.
00:28:55 I had to make some changes in my choice of entertainment.
00:29:00 We really never stop learning.
00:29:05 I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.
00:29:09 But I must admit that it is more and more difficult
00:29:13 to find something decent to watch these days.
00:29:16 Well, I’m not saying that I watch bad programs.
00:29:19 I would never do that,
00:29:22 but still I wonder
00:29:25 if what I watch is spiritually healthy for me.
00:29:32 The way of thinking I was exposed to in university
00:29:36 was pressuring me to find security in my life through material things
00:29:41 —like having my own place to live and economic stability.
00:29:46 But at what cost?
00:29:52 I remember that paragraph.
00:29:54 It said that Satan promotes making money
00:29:57 as the only way
00:29:58 you can find security in this world.
00:30:00 But one could sacrifice
00:30:02 so much to achieve it.
00:30:04 You could even lose
00:30:05 your friendship with Jehovah.
00:30:06 That article—it was just what we needed.
00:30:09 It described a watchman
00:30:12 who would protect the city
00:30:13 by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.
00:30:17 And at sounding that alarm,
00:30:19 he would shut the gates to the city to protect the city.
00:30:22 And I needed to do that.
00:30:25 We both needed to do that.
00:30:27 It’s true.
00:30:28 And it’s not even a question.
00:30:31 Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first
00:30:33 —before we’re loyal to any friends we have in this world.
00:30:39 The Watchtower  said
00:30:41 that storytelling
00:30:43 does more than entertain us.
00:30:47 In Bana, the city of Cameroon where I was born,
00:30:52 mothers spend their evenings with their children, telling them stories.
00:30:57 And even though I was young,
00:30:59 the stories my mother told me
00:31:02 continue to influence me even today.
00:31:05 So I said to myself: ‘Oh, no. Wait a minute, Happy!
00:31:10 ‘It means that the stories that I watch on television
00:31:13 ‘will also affect me sooner or later,
00:31:17 and the Devil knows that too.’
00:31:20 So I decided to completely cut out a number
00:31:23 of programs that I used to watch.
00:31:27 Now I’m serving in full-time service,
00:31:29 and I love it!
00:31:31 Jehovah is really taking care of me,
00:31:34 but I don’t want to forget
00:31:36 the beautiful principles I’ve learned from that article.
00:31:38 I still have to safeguard my heart.
00:31:42 I want to give my best to my Father, Jehovah.
00:31:46 Not a day goes by where we don’t think about these friends of ours.
00:31:51 And it’s certainly our hope that they come back to Jehovah
00:31:53 and that we can serve Jehovah together shoulder to shoulder.
00:31:56 But we’ve also learned
00:31:59 to keep our “little watchman” in check.
00:32:01 We need to make sure he does his job to “sound the alarm” and “shut those gates.”
00:32:06 Hmm, we never stop learning.
00:32:09 Well, true, it’s easier said than done,
00:32:13 but it is up to us.
00:32:15 It’s so important to safeguard your heart!
00:32:32 We all enjoy reading The Watchtower
00:32:35 and commenting at the Watchtower  Study.
00:32:38 But truly paying attention
00:32:40 means putting what we learn into action.
00:32:44 What else goes into being a discerning student?
00:32:48 That was the topic of a recent Morning Worship program
00:32:52 presented by Brother Joel Dellinger.
00:32:56 Our focus in the Watchtower study article
00:32:59 is on how we can unleash
00:33:00 the power of God’s Word
00:33:02 when teaching from the platform.
00:33:05 But, you know, whether we’re teaching
00:33:07 in a congregation setting,
00:33:09 on a Bible study, or in the family,
00:33:11 isn’t it true that all of us, brothers and sisters,
00:33:14 need to ‘pay constant attention to ourselves and to our teaching’?
00:33:18 And we know why that’s so important —because lives are at stake.
00:33:23 And all of us, younger or older,
00:33:27 touch the lives of other people.
00:33:29 So when we teach effectively,
00:33:31 we are giving opportunity to others
00:33:34 to attain the wisdom and the discernment that God’s Word can give them.
00:33:39 That’s why we need to approach any teaching opportunity
00:33:42 seriously and prayerfully.
00:33:45 Over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me
00:33:49 some constructive counsel after a public talk.
00:33:51 And then, with a warm smile, he said this,
00:33:54 “Remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.”
00:33:59 Well, I’ll never forget that counsel.
00:34:02 Why were those observations so helpful?
00:34:05 Well, it reminded me that when teaching,
00:34:07 our model needs to be Jesus, the Great Teacher.
00:34:12 There’s more to learn from him.
00:34:14 And Jesus’ example reminds us of the need
00:34:17 to remain humble and diligent students of Jehovah
00:34:21 —the Grand Instructor.
00:34:24 Though all of us are teachers on occasion,
00:34:28 isn’t it true that most often
00:34:30 the role we play during spiritual programs
00:34:33 is that of students?
00:34:36 Just for a moment, think about the many hours
00:34:40 we spend as students —not teachers—
00:34:44 when we’re in the audience at congregation meetings,
00:34:47 at assemblies, and at conventions.
00:34:50 Add to that the time we are students
00:34:53 when we buy out time to watch the monthly broadcast,
00:34:56 to prepare for meetings, to engage in family and personal study.
00:35:01 And then think of the added privilege that many of us here have
00:35:05 —to enjoy morning worship five days a week.
00:35:09 You know, a typical program of morning worship
00:35:11 lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.
00:35:14 If you multiply that by 5 days a week and then by 52 weeks,
00:35:18 at a minimum, we are exposed
00:35:21 to at least 86 hours
00:35:24 of divine instruction each year.
00:35:27 But if we’re not careful,
00:35:29 some or much of that valuable instruction,
00:35:33 encouragement, and counsel could just wash over us.
00:35:37 So for the remaining time for our program this morning,
00:35:40 let’s consider some things all of us can do
00:35:42 to listen more effectively
00:35:45 at spiritual programs.
00:35:47 Please, for our first point, open your Bible
00:35:50 to Ezra 7:10,
00:35:53 and let’s consider Ezra’s example.
00:35:56 That’s Ezra 7:10,
00:36:01 and notice the reading carefully:
00:36:03 “Ezra had prepared his heart
00:36:07 “to consult the Law of Jehovah
00:36:09 “and to practice it,
00:36:11 “and to teach its regulations
00:36:13 and judgments in Israel.”
00:36:16 Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk
00:36:19 next to “prepared his heart,”
00:36:22 if you tap on that, you’ll notice that that could be rendered as
00:36:26 “had determined in his heart.”
00:36:29 Well, what do we learn from Ezra?
00:36:31 He had the right attitude going into a period of study.
00:36:35 He had the right approach to study and learning.
00:36:39 He recognized that it was Jehovah
00:36:41 who would be teaching him through His Law.
00:36:44 And as the verse goes on to say, he first recognized
00:36:48 that he needed to personally practice what he was learning.
00:36:53 Only then would he be in a rightful position
00:36:56 to effectively teach others.
00:36:58 Well, this scripture emphasizes the point we’ve already made, doesn’t it?
00:37:02 Though we are teachers on occasion,
00:37:05 we are always first and foremost
00:37:08 students of God’s Word.
00:37:11 How can we imitate Ezra’s example
00:37:13 and prepare our hearts before study,
00:37:17 before attending a spiritual program
00:37:19 (whether here at Bethel or in the congregation),
00:37:22 before watching a monthly broadcast?
00:37:26 Well, we need to prepare our hearts by specifically praying to Jehovah,
00:37:31 recognizing him as the Source of the teaching.
00:37:35 What should we pray specifically about?
00:37:38 Well, for one, we want to pray that we remain humble
00:37:43 while listening to theocratic instruction.
00:37:46 We need to listen
00:37:48 —no matter how long we’ve been in Jehovah’s classroom—
00:37:51 because none of us know it all,
00:37:54 nor will we ever know it all.
00:37:56 Proverbs 1:5 reminds us
00:37:59 that “a wise person listens and takes in more instruction.”
00:38:04 Well, this leads to another question:
00:38:06 What if we find we have a somewhat negative attitude
00:38:09 toward a certain presentation
00:38:12 —perhaps the material doesn’t interest us,
00:38:15 or we have a negative attitude toward a certain brother
00:38:19 and his teaching ability?
00:38:21 What should we do?
00:38:23 Prepare our heart.
00:38:25 Pray to Jehovah to recognize and appreciate
00:38:29 that the instruction is from him.
00:38:32 Pray to have a thankful spirit.
00:38:35 You know, back in 2002, The Watchtower  made this helpful point
00:38:39 in an article that was entitled “Pay More Than the Usual Attention.”
00:38:42 I quote: “Some may tend to gauge the quality of a meeting
00:38:47 “by the teaching abilities of the participants. . . .
00:38:50 “Though the teaching ability of participants is important,
00:38:53 “it is not the sole factor contributing to a meeting’s success.
00:38:57 “Do you not agree that our prime concern should be,
00:39:00 “not how well the speaker delivers his talk,
00:39:03 “but how well we incline our ear?
00:39:07 When we attend meetings,” the article continues,
00:39:10 “and pay attention to what is being presented,
00:39:13 “we are worshiping God in harmony with his will.
00:39:16 “That is what makes the meeting a success.
00:39:19 “If we are eager to take in the knowledge of God,
00:39:21 “we will benefit from meetings,
00:39:23 regardless of a speaker’s abilities.”
00:39:27 What a beautiful reminder for all of us!
00:39:29 So our first point: Like Ezra,
00:39:32 let’s prepare our hearts with prayer,
00:39:35 as students who are determined to always
00:39:39 accept and apply what Jehovah has to teach us.
00:39:44 Let’s consider a second point:
00:39:46 the need to focus our attention.
00:39:49 Have you faced the challenge of staying focused
00:39:52 during spiritual programs?
00:39:54 Our minds may be distracted
00:39:57 with anxieties and many other things.
00:40:00 Noise and movements around us could distract us.
00:40:04 If we’re watching morning worship
00:40:06 at a location other than the Bethel dining room,
00:40:08 likely we well know the numerous distractions
00:40:12 that fight for our attention.
00:40:15 Some of us have ailments and physical discomforts
00:40:17 that may make it difficult to concentrate.
00:40:20 Recently, a sister in our congregation
00:40:23 told us about her long-term battle with migraine headaches.
00:40:27 I tried to put myself in her shoes,
00:40:30 having a migraine headache while attending a spiritual program
00:40:34 —difficult to concentrate.
00:40:37 Well, whatever the case may be, we know —we admit—
00:40:39 that there are many challenges and distractions.
00:40:42 What can we do about it?
00:40:44 Well, since the eyes strongly influence
00:40:47 where we focus our attention,
00:40:49 the Benefit  book provides this suggestion:
00:40:52 “Use your eyes to help you concentrate by keeping them on the speaker.
00:40:56 “When he cites a Bible text —even a familiar one—
00:40:59 look it up, and follow along as he reads it.”
00:41:02 And then it said this: “Resist the temptation to turn your head
00:41:05 “in the direction of every noise or movement.
00:41:08 “If the eyes are flooding your mind with distracting information,
00:41:12 you will miss much of what is presented from the platform.”
00:41:17 And think about, too, the use of electronic devices.
00:41:21 Have you ever been alerted, messaged, or e-mailed
00:41:26 while looking at the Bible on your device?
00:41:29 How wise it is when we turn those devices to a mode
00:41:33 that eliminates unnecessary distractions!
00:41:37 Well, what about anxieties or disquieting thoughts?
00:41:41 What could we do about that?
00:41:43 Well, here, again, is where we can remember
00:41:46 who the Grand Instructor is and how close he can be to us
00:41:50 when we’re in a teaching environment.
00:41:53 Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94:19
00:41:57 to recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.
00:42:01 At Psalm 94:19,
00:42:07 we read:
00:42:09 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
00:42:11 you [Jehovah] comforted and soothed me.”
00:42:16 What a beautiful reminder!
00:42:18 Jehovah can soothe and comfort us
00:42:21 when attending spiritual programs
00:42:23 so that we can focus on what he’s teaching us.
00:42:27 Yes, spiritual programs are a provision from him
00:42:30 —a spiritual lifeline.
00:42:32 So as needed during a spiritual program,
00:42:35 we should pray to Jehovah to help us stay focused.
00:42:38 Pray repeatedly as needed.
00:42:42 Well, in summary, what have we learned?
00:42:44 All of us are teachers from time to time,
00:42:47 but first and foremost, we are students
00:42:51 in the classroom of the Great Teacher and the Grand Instructor.
00:42:55 Like Ezra, humility and appreciation
00:42:58 should move us to ‘prepare our hearts’ before every spiritual program.
00:43:02 We don’t want to miss anything
00:43:05 that Jehovah has for us.
00:43:08 We’re determined ‘to consult that Law
00:43:10 so that we can practice it and then teach it.’
00:43:13 And in view of all the potential distractions,
00:43:16 let’s make it our aim to use our eyes, our mind, and our heart
00:43:20 to focus attention on the goodness of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions.
00:43:27 If you are a young Christian who recently graduated from school
00:43:31 or will soon graduate,
00:43:33 you’ll make many decisions that will affect your future.
00:43:38 How, though, can you make decisions
00:43:41 that let you successfully run the race for life?
00:43:44 That’s the subject of our new music video.
00:43:51 Don’t look back To the things behind.
00:44:01 Keep your eyes straight ahead On that finish line.
00:44:10 Now’s the time to be strong. Keep building your faith.
00:44:20 Don’t let the world slow you down.
00:44:24 Put off ev’ry weight.
00:44:29 So let’s Run the race; run the race.
00:44:34 Run the race for life.
00:44:36 Let’s run the race; yes, run the race.
00:44:39 Keep your eye on the prize.
00:44:41 Let’s run the race; run the race.
00:44:44 You’ve got to keep on going— Got to keep on moving.
00:44:46 Let’s run the race. Let’s run the race.
00:44:50 The prize we gain— It’ll never fade away.
00:45:00 All the blessings in store— Soon we’ll see the day.
00:45:09 So let’s Run the race; run the race.
00:45:14 Run the race for life.
00:45:16 Let’s run the race; yes, run the race.
00:45:19 Keep your eye on the prize.
00:45:21 Let’s run the race; run the race.
00:45:24 You’ve got to keep on going— Got to keep on moving.
00:45:26 Let’s run the race. Let’s run the race.
00:45:30 Run the race for life.
00:45:37 This world would like to have you turn around
00:45:42 And lose yourself in this life. But don’t let your hands drop down.
00:45:48 So let’s Run the race; run the race.
00:45:54 Run the race; run the race.
00:45:57 So let’s Run the race; run the race.
00:46:01 Run the race for life.
00:46:04 Let’s run the race; yes, run the race.
00:46:07 Keep your eye on the prize.
00:46:09 Let’s run the race; run the race.
00:46:11 You’ve got to keep on going— Got to keep on moving.
00:46:14 Let’s run the race. Let’s run the race.
00:46:17 Run the race for life. Run the race for life.
00:46:28 You’ve got to run the race, yes. Come on, and run the race.
00:46:35 Run the race. Let’s run the race.
00:46:40 Run the race. Run the race for life!
00:46:49 Volunteering for theocratic construction projects
00:46:52 is a goal for many.
00:46:54 Recently, thousands of brothers and sisters
00:46:58 sacrificed their time and energy
00:47:01 to build a beautiful new branch facility in Britain.
00:47:05 Would you like to see the results of their hard work
00:47:08 and the blessings they received?
00:47:11 Please enjoy this report.
00:47:15 How will you feel when all we came here to do
00:47:19 is finally completed?
00:47:22 No doubt, we will find a moment to reflect
00:47:24 on the words of Philippians 2:13.
00:47:28 Yes, Jehovah energized us
00:47:31 and gave each and every one of us “both the desire
00:47:34 and the power to act.”
00:47:37 How has sharing on this project affected your life?
00:47:42 It all started over seven years ago.
00:48:00 Can you imagine how excited you’re going to be
00:48:04 when we hear that the new branch facility at Chelmsford
00:48:08 has been approved by the City Council?
00:48:10 Well, guess what?
00:48:12 Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.
00:50:45 Whilst the buildings are beautiful,
00:50:48 at the end of the day, they are just buildings.
00:50:51 The really special part of this project
00:50:53 has been the people;
00:50:56 even non-Witnesses saw that something special
00:51:00 was taking place on our site.
00:51:02 It’s a very friendly site to work on.
00:51:04 It’s just how friendly everyone is.
00:51:06 You walk in, and it just— I find it mind-blowing.
00:51:10 In a negative (sometimes) society,
00:51:12 when you come here, it just puts a smile on your face.
00:51:15 A truly unexpected success
00:51:18 was the visitors’ center.
00:51:20 How we underestimated the appreciation
00:51:22 Jehovah’s people have
00:51:25 for theocratic activities.
00:51:27 Visitors from all around the globe witnessed
00:51:30 the activities of Jehovah for themselves.
00:51:33 This is partly why
00:51:35 I’m actually studying the Bible to get baptized,
00:51:39 because when I came here, it just hit me somewhere, you know?
00:51:44 Me and Alicia can’t see,
00:51:47 so everyone has been so encouraging and thoughtful.
00:51:50 We really feel like Jehovah is with us and he’s supported us.
00:51:55 I really liked the ladies driving tractors.
00:52:01 Everyone wanted to have a part in the project.
00:52:05 Every single contribution warmed our hearts
00:52:08 and sometimes our heads too.
00:52:12 Another beautiful project highlight
00:52:15 was the day-volunteer program.
00:52:17 The effort and expense brothers and sisters
00:52:20 sacrificed reminded all of us
00:52:22 of what a privilege it is to work for Jehovah.
00:52:26 And how about the commuters who helped on the project?
00:52:29 Would the BRD family have had
00:52:32 the same spirit without our commuters?
00:52:37 Don’t you just love being a part of this amazing family?
00:52:45 We were regularly reminded that spirituality
00:52:48 is of the utmost importance.
00:52:51 Did you ever say that a monthly meeting
00:52:53 was the best one yet?
00:52:56 What lies outside the comfort zone
00:53:00 is the faith zone.
00:53:02 Don’t cry because it’s over;
00:53:04 smile because it happened.
00:53:08 What is your story?
00:53:12 The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.
00:53:15 He is the one who energized us;
00:53:18 he is the one who gave us both the desire
00:53:21 and the power to act.
00:53:23 He is the one we can thank
00:53:25 for the lifelong friendships we have formed,
00:53:27 the training we have received,
00:53:29 and the challenges we have been able to overcome.
00:53:32 Remember your story.
00:53:35 Really, it’s only just beginning.
00:53:48 In this month’s program,
00:53:50 we learned what it means to pay attention to Jehovah.
00:53:54 We saw how we can stay focused on Jehovah
00:53:58 despite potential distractions.
00:54:02 Elders are good shepherds
00:54:05 because they are attentive to Jehovah’s instruction.
00:54:10 Our ministry is more effective
00:54:13 when we focus on reaching the hearts of people.
00:54:18 And our new song
00:54:19 reminds our young adults to keep their eyes
00:54:23 on the prize of life.
00:54:27 Before we say goodbye,
00:54:29 let’s go to the southwest tip of Japan
00:54:32 and visit our brothers and sisters in the Ishigaki Congregation.
00:54:38 Their territory includes the Yaeyama Islands,
00:54:41 an archipelago
00:54:43 of 12 islands and more than 360 coral reefs.
00:54:47 Emerald-green waters surround these lush,
00:54:51 jungle-covered islands.
00:54:53 With almost no light pollution,
00:54:55 this is an ideal place to observe
00:54:59 Jehovah’s beautiful heavenly creation.
00:55:03 Vast distances between the islands make the ministry a challenge.
00:55:08 To reach remote communities,
00:55:11 publishers take ferries and small airplanes.
00:55:15 This is costly, and economic conditions here aren’t easy.
00:55:20 Transportation includes bicycles
00:55:24 as well as carts and wagons pulled by water buffalo.
00:55:29 Public witnessing is an effective way
00:55:31 to share the good news
00:55:33 with the many tourists who travel here.
00:55:35 More than one million
00:55:37 visited during one recent year.
00:55:41 Contact cards also produce good results.
00:55:45 The Ishigaki Congregation has 112 publishers,
00:55:49 including 35 regular pioneers.
00:55:53 They’re conducting more than 100 Bible studies every month.
00:55:59 The Kingdom Hall is in Ishigaki City on the main island.
00:56:03 Talks from this Kingdom Hall
00:56:05 are streamed to this small meeting place
00:56:08 for the seven brothers and sisters
00:56:10 who live on remote Iriomote Island.
00:56:15 The publishers work together to maintain the Kingdom Hall,
00:56:20 and they enjoy upbuilding association
00:56:23 in this beautiful land.
00:56:26 Our brothers and sisters in the Ishigaki Congregation
00:56:30 send their warm love and greetings.
00:56:32 From the World Headquarters
00:56:34 of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:56:36 this is JW Broadcasting.

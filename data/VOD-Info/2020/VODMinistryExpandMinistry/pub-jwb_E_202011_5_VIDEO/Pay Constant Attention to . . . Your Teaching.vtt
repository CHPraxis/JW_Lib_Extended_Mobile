00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family had been learning Chinese
for over a year.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has many titles.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know he has only one name?

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[Speaking Chinese]

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was ready, or at least I thought so.

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:33.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew!

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’ll be right there.

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were making progress,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we weren’t giving up.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed like most people
just weren’t interested.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not having a good morning.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Liz weren’t having
a good morning either.

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Lin joined us.

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been a big help to us.

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told them about our morning.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were finally able to converse a little
and give presentations,

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything seemed to fall flat.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You ask good questions at the door

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not always the right one.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when you learn the language,

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not forget to learn about people.

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:09.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was right.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our questions started conversations
in our old territory, but not here.

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your pronunciation is very good, see.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Brother Lin.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a different approach

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we didn’t just learn the language

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how to reach the heart
of someone who speaks it.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the July 2019 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read about “Reaching the Hearts
of Nonreligious People.”

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in paragraph 7,

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think that we could be more
like the apostle Paul?

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul was a Jew,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when he was talking to other people,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to adapt his presentation.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like what 1 Corinthians 9:20-23 says:

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the Jews I became as a Jew
in order to gain Jews;

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those under law I became . . .”

00:02:57.364 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Liz was right.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Paul spoke to fellow Jews in Athens,

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:04.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reasoned from the Scriptures.

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he spoke to the Greeks
at the Areopagus, he adapted,

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasoning with them first without the Bible.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He later wrote:

00:03:14.298 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I might by all possible means
save some.”

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we needed to do.

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:29.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned more about the people.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to listen more
and talk about things

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interested them.

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found different ways
to start conversations.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we kept learning more about the culture.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of a Chinese proverb I found says:

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He who comes near ink is stained black.”

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a great way to introduce

00:04:06.558 --> 00:04:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 13:20:

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise.”

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all comes down to showing love.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we paid attention
to how we were teaching,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we were able to show people
the God who loves them.

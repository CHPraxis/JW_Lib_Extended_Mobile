00:00:03 There are still many areas here in Madagascar without any publishers.
00:00:08 Jesus’ command to his disciples to go out and preach
00:00:10 definitely still applies in our territory.
00:00:13 I want to take part in fulfilling prophecy.
00:00:15 Watching the broadcasts has also helped me.
00:00:19 I am so glad I could have a share in this work.
00:00:22 This time, we had so many publishers
00:00:24 who wanted to take part
00:00:26 that we had to add more territories to preach in.
00:00:29 We hope that in the future,
00:00:30 each one of these territories will become a congregation.
00:00:34 The journey was difficult and painful at times,
00:00:37 but when we got there, oh, we were so happy.
00:00:42 Being with 80 publishers, all with different personalities,
00:00:45 really helped me to make changes to myself because we have to get along together.
00:00:50 Preaching to people of a different culture was amazing,
00:00:54 and seeing Jehovah’s wonderful creation made me so happy.
00:00:58 Last year, I made a lot of new friends.
00:01:01 But this year, I got to know
00:01:03 even more people because my new friends brought along their parents and others.
00:01:08 All the brothers and sisters were so happy,
00:01:11 showing unity and love
00:01:14 even though we all came from different regions.
00:01:18 Many householders were interested,
00:01:20 and we faced no opposition.
00:01:23 We made many return visits
00:01:25 and started many Bible studies.
00:01:28 This was the best and most enjoyable time
00:01:30 that we have ever had in the ministry.

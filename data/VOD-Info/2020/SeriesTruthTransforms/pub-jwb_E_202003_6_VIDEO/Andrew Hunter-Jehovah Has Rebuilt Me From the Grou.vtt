00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:04.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Dalby, Queensland.

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m the youngest of five children,

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:09.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mother and father
owned their own piggery.

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:13.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we lived on a little farm
about ten minutes out of town.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:17.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was eight years old,
my parents separated,

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which came as a huge shock to me.

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was devastating, and the consequences
just seemed to roll on for decades.

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:29.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would go and stay at the farm
with my father for school holidays,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but my dad abused alcohol

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and smoked cigarettes
and used bad language.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by the time I was a teenager,

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was doing exactly the same thing.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my late teens,
I was smoking marijuana every day

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was spending up to four nights a week

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at pubs and clubs and parties.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was addicted to alcohol,
cigarettes, marijuana,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pornography, and I had no power to stop.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, it was only a matter of time

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before that lifestyle affected my health.

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my social skills,
and I became depressed.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The turning point in my life

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came one afternoon when two

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked on my door.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of feeling so lost and so unhappy,

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had started to search
for answers and I’d begun looking

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at New Age teachings.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The timing felt too remarkable
to be just coincidence.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really felt like God
wanted me to take the book.

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never looked at New Age teachings again.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to read
the <i>Greatest Man </i> book instead.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A major key for me
to be able to make the necessary changes

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to cut off bad association.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in March 1994.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I finally took that step,

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I’d started on the right path.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was so grateful that Jehovah

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.274 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had found me and that he’d drawn me.

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really fell in love
with the thoughts of Psalm 8:1, 3, 4:

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah . . . ,

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when I see your heavens,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the works of your fingers,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the moon and the stars
that you have prepared,

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is mortal man
that you keep him in mind,

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the son of earthling man
that you take care of him?”

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:31.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so insignificant,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet Jehovah knew me.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hope of everlasting life
also really touched my heart,

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did Jehovah’s forgiveness.

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so grateful
that Jehovah could forgive me

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:48.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of my wrongdoing
and that I could have a fresh start.

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:52.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were invited to start circuit work,

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had serious doubts about my inadequacies.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not fast at preparing talks.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, it always felt like trying to fit

00:03:03.287 --> 00:03:05.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a square peg into a round hole.

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:07.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the very morning

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after receiving our assignment
to go in the circuit work full-time,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Bible reading was Exodus chapters 3 and 4,

00:03:15.132 --> 00:03:19.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Moses cited his inadequacies to Jehovah

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that he was not a fluent speaker.

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, Jehovah asked him,

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who is it that assigns a mouth?’

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like Jehovah was saying to me:

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry. I will help you.’

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make the changes that I did in life,

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just so grateful to Jehovah.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I learned the truth, I was lost.

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know who I was.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just a mess.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to be a man,

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:50.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t really ever know how to do it.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has rebuilt me from the ground up.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given me everything.

00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:06.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in the truth.

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I was about 14,
I became a publisher.

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:15.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was still 14,
I was no longer a publisher.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I became a thief

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and a drug dealer when I was a teenager

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.634 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—around 15 or 16 years old.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was older, I was arrested.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did a lot of bad things inside prison.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I basically fought with everyone in there.

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anything that would make us smile

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or any reasons we had to be happy
in prison were short-lived.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:56.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your joy is gone
because reality hits that you’re in prison.

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that I was
the reason that my situation

00:01:00.748 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kept getting worse and worse,

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I had to change.

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked Jehovah for help.

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I remembered
the account of Manasseh,

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sacrificed his own children,

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was forgiven by Jehovah.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That account really helped me to understand

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was hope for me

00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I could be forgiven.

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one day during inmate visitation,

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a brother inside there.

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I asked him
if he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said that he was.

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I started
my Bible study inside prison.

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After studying for six months,

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was transferred to an open prison

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I could work during the day
and return to prison at night.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then that’s when my situation
hit rock bottom again.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My situation was so bad 
that I came to the conclusion

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would be better to escape
from there because if I didn’t,

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would die
because of so much drug abuse.

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what I did.

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the first opportunity I had, I escaped.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I escaped,
I was determined again to change,

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah for help,
and to go back to the meetings.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would smoke, cry,
and talk to Jehovah all at the same time:

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:22.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help me get out of this situation
because I know your name,

00:02:22.454 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a person who knows
your name can’t use drugs!”

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time later,

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out about a group
of brothers and sisters

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:33.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who met at a Kingdom Hall near my house.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I started attending
the meetings again.

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped using drugs with Jehovah’s help.

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after some time passed,

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I expressed my desire to be a publisher.

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Up to this point,
I hadn’t told anything to my Bible teacher

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about my current situation with the law.

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on the day we considered the questions,

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked the questions, right?

00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we were
at the end of the consideration,

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he looked at me
and asked me just like this,

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You don’t have anything to tell me, do you?”

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he said:
“Do you know why I’m asking you this?

00:03:06.582 --> 00:03:10.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to the book of Acts chapter 5,
and let’s see what it says there.”

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:14.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I read the account
about Ananias and Sapphira,

00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sold some property
but kept part of the money,

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:20.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of their actions, they died.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t that they had lied to men,

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they had lied to Jehovah.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was at that moment that I realized

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I needed to tell him about my situation.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to turn myself in,

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I went back to the prison
that I ran away from.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:43.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told my Bible teacher
that was what I was going to do.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:45.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I arrived
at the front door of the penitentiary

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the police officer saw me,

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked if I was a lawyer.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was well-dressed and had a tie on.

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him: “No, no, Officer.

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m a fugitive,

00:03:57.424 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I came back here to serve my time.”

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if Jehovah had taken
a huge weight off my shoulders.

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that he was now truly helping me.

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:22.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being a publisher
for a few months back in prison,

00:04:22.032 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I expressed my desire
to make a dedication to Jehovah.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:28.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received the privilege
on the day of my baptism

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave the penitentiary
and go to the baptism location.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized,
and at the end of the day,

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back to prison.

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:42.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After some time had passed,
I received my freedom.

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:47.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Making the decision to turn myself in
and go back to prison

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:51.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best way that I found
to show my love for Jehovah.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s for this reason
that I have come to the conclusion

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:01.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that being imprisoned brought me freedom.

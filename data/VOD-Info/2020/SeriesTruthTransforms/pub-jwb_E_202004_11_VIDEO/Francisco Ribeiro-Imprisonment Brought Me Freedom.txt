00:00:04 I was born in the truth.
00:00:06 And when I was about 14, I became a publisher.
00:00:10 When I was still 14, I was no longer a publisher.
00:00:23 I became a thief
00:00:25 and a drug dealer when I was a teenager
00:00:27 —around 15 or 16 years old.
00:00:30 When I was older, I was arrested.
00:00:34 I did a lot of bad things inside prison.
00:00:38 I basically fought with everyone in there.
00:00:46 Anything that would make us smile
00:00:49 or any reasons we had to be happy in prison were short-lived.
00:00:52 Your joy is gone because reality hits that you’re in prison.
00:00:57 When I saw that I was the reason that my situation
00:01:00 kept getting worse and worse,
00:01:02 I knew I had to change.
00:01:07 I asked Jehovah for help.
00:01:09 And then I remembered the account of Manasseh,
00:01:11 who sacrificed his own children,
00:01:14 and he was forgiven by Jehovah.
00:01:19 That account really helped me to understand
00:01:21 that there was hope for me
00:01:23 and that I could be forgiven.
00:01:25 And then one day during inmate visitation,
00:01:28 I saw a brother inside there.
00:01:30 And I asked him if he was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:33 and he said that he was.
00:01:36 That’s when I started my Bible study inside prison.
00:01:39 After studying for six months,
00:01:42 I was transferred to an open prison
00:01:44 where I could work during the day and return to prison at night.
00:01:48 Then that’s when my situation hit rock bottom again.
00:01:51 My situation was so bad  that I came to the conclusion
00:01:55 that it would be better to escape from there because if I didn’t,
00:01:58 I would die because of so much drug abuse.
00:02:01 And that’s what I did.
00:02:03 At the first opportunity I had, I escaped.
00:02:07 After I escaped, I was determined again to change,
00:02:10 to ask Jehovah for help, and to go back to the meetings.
00:02:14 I would smoke, cry, and talk to Jehovah all at the same time:
00:02:18 “Help me get out of this situation because I know your name,
00:02:22 and a person who knows your name can’t use drugs!”
00:02:26 Some time later,
00:02:28 I found out about a group of brothers and sisters
00:02:30 who met at a Kingdom Hall near my house.
00:02:33 That’s when I started attending the meetings again.
00:02:35 I stopped using drugs with Jehovah’s help.
00:02:38 And after some time passed,
00:02:40 I expressed my desire to be a publisher.
00:02:43 Up to this point, I hadn’t told anything to my Bible teacher
00:02:47 about my current situation with the law.
00:02:50 So on the day we considered the questions,
00:02:52 he asked the questions, right?
00:02:54 And when we were at the end of the consideration,
00:02:57 he looked at me and asked me just like this,
00:03:00 “You don’t have anything to tell me, do you?”
00:03:03 Then he said: “Do you know why I’m asking you this?
00:03:06 Turn to the book of Acts chapter 5, and let’s see what it says there.”
00:03:10 So I read the account about Ananias and Sapphira,
00:03:14 who sold some property but kept part of the money,
00:03:17 and because of their actions, they died.
00:03:20 It wasn’t that they had lied to men,
00:03:22 but they had lied to Jehovah.
00:03:26 It was at that moment that I realized
00:03:28 that I needed to tell him about my situation.
00:03:32 I had to turn myself in,
00:03:35 so I went back to the prison that I ran away from.
00:03:39 So I told my Bible teacher that was what I was going to do.
00:03:43 When I arrived at the front door of the penitentiary
00:03:45 and the police officer saw me,
00:03:47 he asked if I was a lawyer.
00:03:49 I was well-dressed and had a tie on.
00:03:52 I told him: “No, no, Officer.
00:03:55 “I’m a fugitive,
00:03:57 and I came back here to serve my time.”
00:04:05 I felt as if Jehovah had taken a huge weight off my shoulders.
00:04:10 I felt that he was now truly helping me.
00:04:17 After being a publisher for a few months back in prison,
00:04:22 I expressed my desire to make a dedication to Jehovah.
00:04:25 I received the privilege on the day of my baptism
00:04:28 to leave the penitentiary and go to the baptism location.
00:04:31 I was baptized, and at the end of the day,
00:04:34 I went back to prison.
00:04:38 After some time had passed, I received my freedom.
00:04:44 Making the decision to turn myself in and go back to prison
00:04:47 was the best way that I found to show my love for Jehovah.
00:04:54 It’s for this reason that I have come to the conclusion
00:04:57 that being imprisoned brought me freedom.

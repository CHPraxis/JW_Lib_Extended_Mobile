The earth has more than 350,000 species

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of flowering plants.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pollination produces nutritious seeds,

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fruits, and vegetables.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The beautiful flower we see
may look like this to a bee.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that create a hard-to-miss target.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy more than
the flower’s beauty and aroma.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, some plants do not need
beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flowers, pollen,

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nectar, and aromas

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are costly for plants to produce.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those resources could be used
for other purposes.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, plants make flowers
in breathtaking abundance.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah generously created flowers

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:36.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that brings us joy

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reminds us
to trust him when we are anxious.

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“in all his glory

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.096 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was arrayed as one of these.”

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are sweet,

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
salty,

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sour,

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bitter,

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a rich, savory taste called umami.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we enjoy not just five flavors

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:40.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but possibly over 100,000.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chewing releases aromas

00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that pass up into our nose
through the back of our throat.

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taste and smell then combine

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our taste buds develop before we’re born.

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:18.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid,

00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may taste what its mother eats

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is more likely
to enjoy the same foods she does.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just eat to survive.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to eat!

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:39.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us happy.

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says why:

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That everyone should eat and drink

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:55.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is color?

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Objects that reflect all wavelengths
of visible light appear white.

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an object reflects
only some wavelengths,

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see color.

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cells in our eye detect light

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:39.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and send signals to our brain.

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three kinds of color-sensing cells:

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:48.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those that detect red,

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:51.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
green,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blue.

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we perceive other colors?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mixing red, green, and blue light

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changes the color we see.

00:05:07.494 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This flower is yellow because it reflects

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
red and green light into our eye.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:17.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just three kinds of color receptors,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can distinguish some ten million colors.

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:27.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Color triggers our emotions.

00:05:29.016 --> 00:05:32.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue and green can calm us.

00:05:33.145 --> 00:05:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Red and orange can excite!

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, descriptions that include

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
color help us learn.

00:05:42.237 --> 00:05:44.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there any doubt

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:47.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God gave us
the gift of color for our joy? 

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I put my rainbow in the cloud,

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will serve as a sign of the covenant

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:59.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between me and the earth.”

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way we move can be complex

00:06:23.278 --> 00:06:24.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or precise.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could require strength

00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:34.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stamina.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Walking involves 
the coordination of dozens of muscles.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Muscles are controlled
by our brain and nervous system.

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:52.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support and move our bones

00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:57.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are powered by the food we eat
and the oxygen we breathe.

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every body part is a marvel of engineering.

00:07:12.327 --> 00:07:15.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The knee is designed
to withstand repeated impact.

Surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:26.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Findings suggest that regular movement

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:29.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps prevent joint damage.

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:35.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a machine
that strengthens as we use it.

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:41.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Movement helps us
to stay healthy and feel good.

00:07:45.652 --> 00:07:49.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body is a credit to its Creator.

“For by him we have life

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:08:10.594 --> 00:08:13.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our world is full of sounds.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are natural.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:34.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others we create.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hear music before we’re born

00:08:40.749 --> 00:08:44.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:08:46.588 --> 00:08:48.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can compose music,

00:08:52.844 --> 00:08:55.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replay it in our minds.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:57.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Musical instruments

00:08:57.224 --> 00:09:01.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
typically combine a sound generator,
which produces tones

00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:04.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a resonator,
such as wood or metal,

00:09:04.189 --> 00:09:06.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which adds volume.

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:11.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:09:11.196 --> 00:09:13.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But few instruments

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:18.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:22.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:27.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can listen to things
that draw us closer to God

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use the voice he gave us

When we observe animals,

‎You know, our text today

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:04.587 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and the comments that we just heard

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.291 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎center our attention on our Christian hope.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Very soon, our loving Father, Jehovah,

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:15.632 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎is going to eliminate pain, suffering, death,

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and indeed, as has been commented on,

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the happy memories 
‎will just push out all the bad memories.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:25.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“The former things 
‎[will indeed] have passed away.” 

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, when I thought about Revelation 21:3, 4,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I thought to myself, 
‎‘I’ve heard those words hundreds of times,

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘and I’ve probably shared those words

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎hundreds of times in our ministry.’ 

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:42.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And while most of us through repetition

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎have probably memorized 
‎those sacred thoughts,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a good question I thought 
‎would be helpful to think about is,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Are these basic Scriptural truths

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎still strengthening me now?

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Are they, as Brother Cotton just mentioned,

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:03.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎still serving “as an anchor for [my] soul?”

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:07.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎With that thought in mind, 
‎let’s consider three questions:

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What is the hope 
‎as described in the Scriptures?

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Second, why do we need hope?

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And third, how can we strengthen our hope?

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎First, how would you define hope?

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Back in 1993, The Watchtower
‎quoted a writer who said this:

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Most people seem to think that hope

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is just a dopy form of denying the truth.”

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Others today would equate hope

00:01:38.448 --> 00:01:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with optimism or wishful thinking.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, of course, 
‎the Scriptures encourage positive thinking,

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and there are benefits
‎—emotionally and perhaps even physically.

00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:53.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But what do we call a desire or a wish

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that’s not based on truth?

00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What is a desire or a wish 
‎that does not take Jehovah into account? 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, that’s a dream; that’s an unreality.

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, of course, none of us as true Christians

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎want to live in La-La land, 
‎or in a dreamworld, do we? 

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Of course, the Bible 
‎does not use the word “optimism,”

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it does encourage us
‎to strengthen our hope.

00:02:21.157 --> 00:02:24.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What is hope according to the Scriptures? 

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:29.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The original language words 
‎used in the Bible that are translated “hope”

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎mean “to wait eagerly” and “to expect good.”

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the Scriptures, hope involves 
‎not only the desire for something good

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:43.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it includes the basis 
‎for believing that good will come. 

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s much more meaningful than optimism.

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:51.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Hope, like our faith, is based on evidence

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—convincing facts.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:58.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And though hope involves 
‎our eager desire for something good,

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it does not start with our desires
‎—what we want or what we wish for.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s first rooted in what God wants

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:12.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with regard to his purpose
‎and what God wants for us individually.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:14.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Romans 5:5 tells us

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that such “hope does not lead 
‎to disappointment.”

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So in a brief definition, 
‎we could say that Scriptural hope

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is eager expectation based on future realities,

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎rooted in what Jehovah has taught us.

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our second question:

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Why is hope essential for all Christians?

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:43.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Please open your Bible 
‎with me to Hebrews 11:1,

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:48.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and notice our well-known definition of faith,

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but then notice how hope is associated.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Hebrews 11:1 says:

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Faith is the assured expectation

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“of what is hoped for,

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“the evident demonstration

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of realities that are not seen.” 

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:11.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So just as faith is a requirement

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for us to serve Jehovah acceptably

00:04:14.203 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and for our worship not to be in vain,

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:19.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎hope, as an essential element of faith,

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:23.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is also necessary for all Christians.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎To see the connection 
‎between faith and hope a little better,

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we might think about the example of Abraham.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, from a human standpoint,

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:37.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Abraham and Sarah 
‎were way past childbearing age

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when Jehovah promised them a son.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s interesting that in the Scriptures

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎both Abraham and Sarah 
‎laughed at the angelic announcement.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It was an amazing and tickling prospect to them

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to think that they 
‎would have a baby in their older years.

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But how did Abraham respond to the promise?

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Notice, please, in Romans 4:18

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what the Bible says,

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎linked to this discussion of the need for hope.

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:12.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Romans 4:18 says:

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Although beyond hope, yet based on hope,

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“he had faith that he would become
‎the father of many nations

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“according to what had been said:

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘So your offspring will be.’”

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Faith “based on hope”

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—we see the connection better, don’t we?

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:34.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You see, Abraham’s God-given hope

00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎gave his faith that he would have a son

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:38.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎a firm foundation.

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎His faith, in turn, 
‎brightened and strengthened his hope.

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So it was not only this conviction in his heart

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but it was the eager anticipation of seeing

00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:53.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what Jehovah had promised come to fulfillment.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Another reason that we need hope

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎has to do with the storms 
‎that you and I are undoubtedly facing now

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or will face 
‎before the end of the system comes.

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In Paul’s letter to the Hebrews,
‎he illustrated hope

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“as an anchor for the soul,
‎both sure and firm.” 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So when confronting storms,

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:21.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what do sailors, 
‎both in ancient times and today, often do?

00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They lower the ship’s anchor.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Why?

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, if the anchor 
‎takes hold of the firm seabed,

00:06:28.337 --> 00:06:31.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it helps the ship ride out the storm.

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:35.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It keeps that ship 
‎away from dangerous reefs or the shoreline.

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Interestingly, 
‎when the apostle Paul was on that ship

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎en route to Rome in the year 58 C.E.,

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the ship was in danger of running aground.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Bible tells us 
‎that the sailors cast out four anchors

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—not just one, four—
‎from the stern,

00:06:53.296 --> 00:06:56.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and as a result, 
‎the ship safely rode out the storm.

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, it’s not hard to see the connection

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with hope and our stormy times today, is it?

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our “sure and firm” hope,

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our setting our mind with eager expectation
‎of what Jehovah has promised,

00:07:08.444 --> 00:07:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎keeps us emotionally, mentally,
‎and spiritually balanced

00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎no matter what 
‎is raging around us in our life

00:07:16.052 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—in full-time service, with our family,

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:21.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with our finances, with our health.

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We can weather the storms

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:27.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because of our eager expectation
‎of what Jehovah has promised. 

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Really, few things 
‎could be more stabilizing in our life

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎than this eager expectation of what Jehovah,

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the God who does not lie, has promised to us.

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, that leads to a third question:

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How can we strengthen our hope?

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, as has been commented on beautifully
‎by our four commenters,

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we need to think specifically

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about how Jehovah’s promises apply to us

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and what they will mean for us and our family

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:02.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in the near future.

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Though we serve Jehovah out of love

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:06.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—and that’s our principal motivation—

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:09.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah wants us to think about the rewards

00:08:09.372 --> 00:08:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that he has outlined for us in the Scriptures.

‎One sister, in referring to the beautiful artwork

00:08:20.283 --> 00:08:22.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that’s in our magazines, said this:

‎“When I see pictures

‎Daydreaming?

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎No.

00:08:40.736 --> 00:08:43.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Meditation on truths

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:47.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‎Notice, please, 
‎with me at 2 Peter 3:11, 12

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how the inspired counsel encourages us

00:08:57.053 --> 00:09:01.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to strengthen and build up 
‎our hope in view of what’s coming.

‎Second Peter chapter 3, 
‎let’s read together verses 11 and 12:

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Since all these things 
‎are to be dissolved in this way

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“[with regard to what 
‎we’re expecting in the near future

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“with the great tribulation 
‎leading into Armageddon],

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:19.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“consider what sort of people you ought to be

‎“in holy acts of conduct

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:27.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“as you await and keep close in mind

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“the presence of the day of Jehovah,

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:40.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Notice in verse 12 that expression,
‎“keep close in mind”

00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—“eagerly desire,” literally, “speed up.”

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Do you see how our positive meditation,

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎our visualizing what’s to come,
‎will strengthen us? 

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, meaningful prayer,

‎Jehovah’s day close in mind.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It will help us to “rejoice in the hope,”

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:08.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then we will experience the realization

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of all that we’ve hoped for
‎from the God “who cannot lie.”

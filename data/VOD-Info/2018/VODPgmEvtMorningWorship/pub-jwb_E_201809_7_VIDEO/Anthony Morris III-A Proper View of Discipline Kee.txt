00:01 ‎This morning I thought I’d discuss the matter
00:03 ‎of how a proper view of discipline
00:06 ‎keeps us close to Jehovah.
00:09 ‎Now, in the context of today’s text
00:11 ‎about Jehovah correcting
00:12 ‎to the proper degree,
00:14 ‎he’s talking to his people about being brought back to their land.
00:19 ‎He was not going to exterminate them  or leave them,
00:23 ‎and it helps us to appreciate  that he wanted them
00:26 ‎to keep their relationship with him.
00:29 ‎Now, today we receive  discipline in various ways.
00:34 ‎It might be from personal Bible study.
00:37 ‎And I was excited this morning
00:39 ‎(I don’t know when it happened,  maybe last night)
00:42 ‎to see that we have in JW Library®
00:44 ‎where we can put our personal notes,
00:46 ‎and I got started with some already.
00:49 ‎So that’ll be like thoughts  or discipline from Jehovah
00:53 ‎that is just between him and ourselves
00:56 ‎—a very beneficial and wise way  to go when it comes to discipline.
01:00 ‎It keeps us from veering off  in our relationship with him.
01:04 ‎It might be something  we read in a publication;
01:07 ‎might hear in a talk at a meeting,  at an assembly,
01:10 ‎or convention;  something in a JW Broadcast
01:14 ‎—various ways, any number of ways  Jehovah will discipline us.
01:19 ‎And we need to remember
01:21 ‎that he does it  so that we remain close to him.
01:25 ‎The problem is discipline  is not easy to take.
01:29 ‎It requires humility.
01:31 ‎And the proper view of discipline  is found here in Proverbs chapter 3,
01:37 ‎and this gives us the Scriptural basis
01:41 ‎to have this proper view of discipline
01:43 ‎that’ll keep us close to Jehovah God.
01:47 ‎Now, notice verses 11 and 12  of Proverbs chapter 3:
01:52 ‎“My son, do not reject  the discipline of Jehovah,
01:56 ‎“and do not loathe his reproof,
01:58 ‎“for those whom Jehovah loves  he reproves,
02:02 ‎just as a father does a son  in whom he delights.”
02:06 ‎So how might we reject  the discipline of Jehovah?
02:11 ‎Well, put yourself  in a position of being counseled.
02:15 ‎It’s come to the point  where overseers and elders
02:18 ‎have had to sit down with you.
02:21 ‎Now, for some,  as soon as the counsel begins to flow,
02:24 ‎there’s this quickness to be upset,
02:28 ‎to justify, to feel picked on.
02:32 ‎Well, Jehovah is saying, ‘Don’t reject this.’
02:35 ‎If they’re using the Scriptures  and thoughts from publications,
02:39 ‎view it as coming from Jehovah  so that we can stay close to him.
02:44 ‎Now, to give you an idea,
02:47 ‎sometimes reading something  will bring us close to Jehovah,
02:52 ‎especially if we veered off  and didn’t even realize it.
02:55 ‎I’m going to go way back  to some examples
02:59 ‎of Jehovah’s sheep  reading something in The Watchtower,
03:03 ‎and it just disciplined them  so that they could get close to Jehovah.
03:08 ‎And it goes way back to 1982,
03:10 ‎and it had to do with TV serials,  or soap operas.
03:14 ‎Some are saying,  “Well, that’s a long time ago.”
03:18 ‎Well, the fact is nothing has changed.
03:21 ‎Some of these soap operas  are still on that had the name
03:24 ‎that they had in 1982.
03:26 ‎They still have it.
03:28 ‎So many readers  personally benefited from the counsel.
03:32 ‎The counsel still applies  that was found there.
03:35 ‎But I think it’s very touching  and commendable
03:38 ‎for the ones who read that  that they recognized it.
03:42 ‎It impacted their relationship with Jehovah,
03:44 ‎and they wanted to get close to him.
03:46 ‎Now, the cover on The Watchtower was
03:50 ‎“TV Serials—Can They Corrupt the Heart?”
03:52 ‎And in the opening article, we did say:
03:56 ‎“Millions of women and men of all ages,
04:00 ‎races and backgrounds  will rarely miss a show.”
04:03 ‎Well, now you can record them  and have them anytime that you like.
04:08 ‎It’s still an ongoing problem  and an issue for a true Christian,
04:12 ‎a worshipper of Jehovah,  to make sure we’re not being corrupted
04:17 ‎by soap operas, or TV serials.
04:20 ‎Now, after the articles came out,
04:23 ‎we had some write in  to explain what happened to them.
04:27 ‎And so months later,  after this 1982 issue of The Watchtower
04:32 ‎(that was December 1),
04:35 ‎we went  to the ’83 Watchtower, December 1,
04:38 ‎and here’s the response  from some of the readers.
04:41 ‎And I found it very commendable.
04:43 ‎I think you’ll appreciate the humility  because it takes humility
04:47 ‎to accept and have  the proper view of discipline.
04:50 ‎So one of the dangers
04:53 ‎that the brothers  were warned about is that
04:56 ‎you can get emotionally attached  to the characters in the show.
05:00 ‎So here’s what one wrote:
05:03 ‎“I had grown up  watching this one soap opera
05:05 ‎“and the character ‘Julie’  was just like my ‘friend.’ . . .
05:10 ‎“One day ‘Julie’ had an accident
05:12 ‎“that left her beautiful face  badly scarred . . .
05:16 ‎“I was in front of the TV set every day
05:19 ‎“to make sure  she was going to pull through.
05:22 ‎“That night as I was saying my prayers,
05:26 ‎“before I even thought  what I was saying,
05:28 ‎I prayed,  ‘And Jehovah, please bless Julie.’”
05:35 ‎Well, she admits:  “‘I was shocked.
05:37 ‎“‘[She should’ve been.]
05:40 ‎“‘This plea to Jehovah for Julie  had come from my heart!’
05:45 ‎“Realizing how involved  she had become,
05:48 ‎“she stopped watching these programs.
05:50 ‎“She wrote: ‘If all readers
05:52 ‎“‘will take your article  on TV serials to heart,
05:56 ‎“‘they will feel a real sense of freedom,
05:59 ‎since our own everyday problems  are enough to cope with.’”
06:03 ‎So, you see, our sister  had the proper view of discipline,
06:07 ‎and she was able  to keep close to Jehovah.
06:11 ‎Now, another one,  after expressing appreciation, wrote:
06:15 ‎“I realized that I was ‘addicted’  to soap operas,
06:18 ‎“and that I had to do something about it.
06:20 ‎“I wondered, too, if my relationship  with Jehovah could be affected.
06:25 ‎“How could I have ‘them’ as friends
06:28 ‎“and also be a friend to Jehovah?
06:30 ‎“I had to quit all at once
06:32 ‎—it was the only way,  and how hard it was!” she admits.
06:36 ‎So, what did she  have to do to break free?
06:39 ‎She had to unplug her TV.
06:41 ‎She’d go outdoors  and work in the garden, call somebody
06:45 ‎—anything to stay busy  so that she wouldn’t go back
06:48 ‎to watching those soap operas.
06:51 ‎She took time for personal Bible study
06:53 ‎—that’ll keep you close to Jehovah—
06:55 ‎preparing for her meetings,  and other spiritual things.
06:59 ‎And then she confesses:  “How much better I felt!
07:03 ‎“It has been over two years now  [from this last writing]
07:07 ‎“since I have seen  those so-called friends.
07:10 ‎“I must admit  that at times I still wonder
07:12 ‎“what is going on with them,  but I fight it. . . .
07:16 ‎Perhaps many others  who have not yet broken free will now.”
07:20 ‎She says:  ‘Thank you, Jehovah and you brothers,
07:25 ‎for exposing  this “good-for-nothing thing.”’
07:28 ‎Then, finally, this third one says:
07:31 ‎“I cried when I read the articles,
07:34 ‎“for I discovered that my heart  was no longer complete toward Jehovah.
07:39 ‎“I promised my God
07:40 ‎“that I would no longer be  a slave to these serials
07:43 ‎“and asked him to help me  to get out of my home
07:46 ‎“on the day of the program. . . .
07:49 ‎“Two days later,  I was invited to attend a Bible study
07:52 ‎“on the very day and time of ‘my’ serial.
07:56 ‎“I happily accepted. . . .
07:58 ‎“[and notice] I now feel  closer to Jehovah,
08:02 ‎“and my relationship with him  is more intimate.
08:05 ‎How good Jehovah is  to discipline us through his Word!”
08:09 ‎Yes, she had  the proper view of discipline.
08:13 ‎Now, finally,  let’s look in Hebrews chapter 12,
08:19 ‎and we appreciate  these sincere comments
08:22 ‎and the counsel there certainly applies.
08:25 ‎Any kind of entertainment
08:27 ‎that has that corrupting influence
08:30 ‎would be avoided by a true Christian.
08:34 ‎So here at Hebrews chapter 12,
08:37 ‎notice verse 11:
08:39 ‎“True, no discipline seems  for the present to be joyous,
08:43 ‎“but it is painful;
08:45 ‎“yet afterward, it yields  the peaceable fruit of righteousness
08:49 ‎to those who have been trained by it.”
08:51 ‎So discipline is painful,
08:54 ‎but “the peaceable fruit  of righteousness”
08:56 ‎makes it worth it  to have a proper view of the discipline
09:01 ‎and to accept it humbly
09:03 ‎so that we can remain close  to our precious Father, Jehovah.

00:01.017 --> 00:03.987
‎This morning I thought I’d discuss the matter 

00:03.987 --> 00:06.456
‎of how a proper view of discipline 

00:06.456 --> 00:09.025
‎keeps us close to Jehovah. 

00:09.025 --> 00:11.394
‎Now, in the context of today’s text 

00:11.394 --> 00:12.662
‎about Jehovah correcting 

00:12.662 --> 00:14.764
‎to the proper degree, 

00:14.764 --> 00:19.069
‎he’s talking to his people
about being brought back to their land. 

00:19.069 --> 00:23.339
‎He was not going to exterminate them 
or leave them, 

00:23.339 --> 00:26.743
‎and it helps us to appreciate 
that he wanted them 

00:26.743 --> 00:29.479
‎to keep their relationship with him. 

00:29.479 --> 00:34.284
‎Now, today we receive 
discipline in various ways. 

00:34.284 --> 00:37.487
‎It might be from personal Bible study. 

00:37.487 --> 00:39.489
‎And I was excited this morning 

00:39.489 --> 00:42.459
‎(I don’t know when it happened, 
maybe last night) 

00:42.459 --> 00:44.894
‎to see that we have in JW Library® 

00:44.894 --> 00:46.896
‎where we can put our personal notes, 

00:46.896 --> 00:49.532
‎and I got started with some already. 

00:49.532 --> 00:53.169
‎So that’ll be like thoughts 
or discipline from Jehovah 

00:53.169 --> 00:56.573
‎that is just between him and ourselves 

00:56.573 --> 01:00.677
‎—a very beneficial and wise way 
to go when it comes to discipline. 

01:00.677 --> 01:04.481
‎It keeps us from veering off 
in our relationship with him. 

01:04.481 --> 01:07.283
‎It might be something 
we read in a publication; 

01:07.283 --> 01:10.453
‎might hear in a talk at a meeting, 
at an assembly, 

01:10.453 --> 01:14.290
‎or convention; 
something in a JW Broadcast 

01:14.290 --> 01:19.295
‎—various ways, any number of ways 
Jehovah will discipline us. 

01:19.295 --> 01:21.865
‎And we need to remember 

01:21.865 --> 01:25.135
‎that he does it 
so that we remain close to him. 

01:25.135 --> 01:29.472
‎The problem is discipline 
is not easy to take. 

01:29.472 --> 01:31.474
‎It requires humility. 

01:31.474 --> 01:35.979
‎And the proper view of discipline 
is found here in Proverbs chapter 3, 

01:37.714 --> 01:41.484
‎and this gives us the Scriptural basis 

01:41.484 --> 01:43.720
‎to have this proper view of discipline 

01:43.720 --> 01:47.190
‎that’ll keep us close to Jehovah God. 

01:47.190 --> 01:52.028
‎Now, notice verses 11 and 12 
of Proverbs chapter 3: 

01:52.028 --> 01:56.199
‎“My son, do not reject 
the discipline of Jehovah, 

01:56.199 --> 01:58.802
‎“and do not loathe his reproof, 

01:58.802 --> 02:02.405
‎“for those whom Jehovah loves 
he reproves, 

02:02.405 --> 02:06.776
‎just as a father does a son 
in whom he delights.” 

02:06.776 --> 02:11.181
‎So how might we reject 
the discipline of Jehovah? 

02:11.181 --> 02:15.084
‎Well, put yourself 
in a position of being counseled. 

02:15.084 --> 02:18.655
‎It’s come to the point 
where overseers and elders 

02:18.655 --> 02:21.224
‎have had to sit down with you. 

02:21.224 --> 02:24.861
‎Now, for some, 
as soon as the counsel begins to flow, 

02:24.861 --> 02:28.398
‎there’s this quickness to be upset, 

02:28.398 --> 02:32.068
‎to justify, to feel picked on. 

02:32.068 --> 02:35.638
‎Well, Jehovah is saying, ‘Don’t reject this.’ 

02:35.638 --> 02:39.809
‎If they’re using the Scriptures 
and thoughts from publications, 

02:39.809 --> 02:44.814
‎view it as coming from Jehovah 
so that we can stay close to him. 

02:44.814 --> 02:47.684
‎Now, to give you an idea, 

02:47.684 --> 02:52.355
‎sometimes reading something 
will bring us close to Jehovah, 

02:52.355 --> 02:55.925
‎especially if we veered off 
and didn’t even realize it. 

02:55.925 --> 02:59.162
‎I’m going to go way back 
to some examples 

02:59.162 --> 03:03.633
‎of Jehovah’s sheep 
reading something in The Watchtower, 

03:03.633 --> 03:08.004
‎and it just disciplined them 
so that they could get close to Jehovah. 

03:08.004 --> 03:10.907
‎And it goes way back to 1982, 

03:10.907 --> 03:14.944
‎and it had to do with TV serials, 
or soap operas. 

03:14.944 --> 03:18.181
‎Some are saying, 
“Well, that’s a long time ago.” 

03:18.181 --> 03:21.017
‎Well, the fact is nothing has changed. 

03:21.017 --> 03:24.988
‎Some of these soap operas 
are still on that had the name 

03:24.988 --> 03:26.990
‎that they had in 1982. 

03:26.990 --> 03:28.491
‎They still have it. 

03:28.491 --> 03:32.629
‎So many readers 
personally benefited from the counsel. 

03:32.629 --> 03:35.298
‎The counsel still applies 
that was found there. 

03:35.298 --> 03:38.101
‎But I think it’s very touching 
and commendable 

03:38.101 --> 03:42.906
‎for the ones who read that 
that they recognized it. 

03:42.906 --> 03:44.908
‎It impacted their relationship with Jehovah, 

03:44.908 --> 03:46.910
‎and they wanted to get close to him. 

03:46.910 --> 03:50.013
‎Now, the cover on The Watchtower was 

03:50.013 --> 03:52.949
‎“TV Serials—Can They Corrupt the Heart?” 

03:52.949 --> 03:56.252
‎And in the opening article, we did say: 

03:56.252 --> 04:00.023
‎“Millions of women and men of all ages, 

04:00.023 --> 04:03.359
‎races and backgrounds 
will rarely miss a show.” 

04:03.359 --> 04:08.097
‎Well, now you can record them 
and have them anytime that you like. 

04:08.097 --> 04:12.669
‎It’s still an ongoing problem 
and an issue for a true Christian, 

04:12.669 --> 04:17.140
‎a worshipper of Jehovah, 
to make sure we’re not being corrupted 

04:17.140 --> 04:20.243
‎by soap operas, or TV serials.

04:20.243 --> 04:23.246
‎Now, after the articles came out, 

04:23.246 --> 04:27.750
‎we had some write in 
to explain what happened to them. 

04:27.750 --> 04:32.755
‎And so months later, 
after this 1982 issue of The Watchtower 

04:32.755 --> 04:35.358
‎(that was December 1), 

04:35.358 --> 04:38.828
‎we went 
to the ’83 Watchtower, December 1, 

04:38.828 --> 04:41.197
‎and here’s the response 
from some of the readers. 

04:41.197 --> 04:43.566
‎And I found it very commendable. 

04:43.566 --> 04:47.804
‎I think you’ll appreciate the humility 
because it takes humility 

04:47.804 --> 04:50.573
‎to accept and have 
the proper view of discipline. 

04:50.573 --> 04:53.242
‎So one of the dangers 

04:53.242 --> 04:56.312
‎that the brothers 
were warned about is that 

04:56.312 --> 05:00.650
‎you can get emotionally attached 
to the characters in the show. 

05:00.650 --> 05:03.119
‎So here’s what one wrote: 

05:03.119 --> 05:05.888
‎“I had grown up 
watching this one soap opera 

05:05.888 --> 05:10.026
‎“and the character ‘Julie’ 
was just like my ‘friend.’ . . . 

05:10.026 --> 05:12.595
‎“One day ‘Julie’ had an accident 

05:12.595 --> 05:16.399
‎“that left her beautiful face 
badly scarred . . . 

05:16.399 --> 05:19.302
‎“I was in front of the TV set every day 

05:19.302 --> 05:22.605
‎“to make sure 
she was going to pull through. 

05:22.605 --> 05:26.342
‎“That night as I was saying my prayers, 

05:26.342 --> 05:28.511
‎“before I even thought 
what I was saying, 

05:28.511 --> 05:33.516
‎I prayed, 
‘And Jehovah, please bless Julie.’” 

05:35.051 --> 05:37.954
‎Well, she admits: 
“‘I was shocked. 

05:37.954 --> 05:40.890
‎“‘[She should’ve been.] 

05:40.890 --> 05:45.895
‎“‘This plea to Jehovah for Julie 
had come from my heart!’

05:45.895 --> 05:48.264
‎“Realizing how involved 
she had become, 

05:48.264 --> 05:50.867
‎“she stopped watching these programs. 

05:50.867 --> 05:52.869
‎“She wrote: ‘If all readers 

05:52.869 --> 05:56.406
‎“‘will take your article 
on TV serials to heart, 

05:56.406 --> 05:59.375
‎“‘they will feel a real sense of freedom, 

05:59.375 --> 06:03.479
‎since our own everyday problems 
are enough to cope with.’” 

06:03.479 --> 06:07.183
‎So, you see, our sister 
had the proper view of discipline, 

06:07.183 --> 06:11.687
‎and she was able 
to keep close to Jehovah. 

06:11.687 --> 06:15.358
‎Now, another one, 
after expressing appreciation, wrote: 

06:15.358 --> 06:18.961
‎“I realized that I was ‘addicted’ 
to soap operas, 

06:18.961 --> 06:20.963
‎“and that I had to do something about it. 

06:20.963 --> 06:25.368
‎“I wondered, too, if my relationship 
with Jehovah could be affected. 

06:25.368 --> 06:28.237
‎“How could I have ‘them’ as friends 

06:28.237 --> 06:30.773
‎“and also be a friend to Jehovah? 

06:30.773 --> 06:32.809
‎“I had to quit all at once

06:32.809 --> 06:36.879
‎—it was the only way, 
and how hard it was!” she admits. 

06:36.879 --> 06:39.115
‎So, what did she 
have to do to break free? 

06:39.115 --> 06:41.117
‎She had to unplug her TV. 

06:41.117 --> 06:45.121
‎She’d go outdoors 
and work in the garden, call somebody

06:45.121 --> 06:48.424
‎—anything to stay busy 
so that she wouldn’t go back 

06:48.424 --> 06:51.394
‎to watching those soap operas. 

06:51.394 --> 06:53.729
‎She took time for personal Bible study 

06:53.729 --> 06:55.731
‎—that’ll keep you close to Jehovah—

06:55.731 --> 06:59.302
‎preparing for her meetings, 
and other spiritual things. 

06:59.302 --> 07:03.139
‎And then she confesses: 
“How much better I felt! 

07:03.139 --> 07:07.009
‎“It has been over two years now 
[from this last writing] 

07:07.009 --> 07:10.046
‎“since I have seen 
those so-called friends. 

07:10.046 --> 07:12.715
‎“I must admit 
that at times I still wonder 

07:12.715 --> 07:16.419
‎“what is going on with them, 
but I fight it. . . . 

07:16.419 --> 07:20.857
‎Perhaps many others 
who have not yet broken free will now.” 

07:20.857 --> 07:25.194
‎She says: 
‘Thank you, Jehovah and you brothers, 

07:25.194 --> 07:28.798
‎for exposing 
this “good-for-nothing thing.”’

07:28.798 --> 07:31.701
‎Then, finally, this third one says: 

07:31.701 --> 07:34.537
‎“I cried when I read the articles, 

07:34.537 --> 07:39.175
‎“for I discovered that my heart 
was no longer complete toward Jehovah. 

07:39.175 --> 07:40.943
‎“I promised my God

07:40.943 --> 07:43.913
‎“that I would no longer be 
a slave to these serials 

07:43.913 --> 07:46.883
‎“and asked him to help me 
to get out of my home 

07:46.883 --> 07:49.785
‎“on the day of the program. . . . 

07:49.785 --> 07:52.755
‎“Two days later, 
I was invited to attend a Bible study 

07:52.755 --> 07:56.325
‎“on the very day and time of ‘my’ serial. 

07:56.325 --> 07:58.327
‎“I happily accepted. . . . 

07:58.327 --> 08:02.198
‎“[and notice] I now feel 
closer to Jehovah, 

08:02.198 --> 08:05.368
‎“and my relationship with him 
is more intimate. 

08:05.368 --> 08:09.472
‎How good Jehovah is 
to discipline us through his Word!” 

08:09.472 --> 08:13.609
‎Yes, she had 
the proper view of discipline. 

08:13.609 --> 08:17.847
‎Now, finally, 
let’s look in Hebrews chapter 12, 

08:19.615 --> 08:22.285
‎and we appreciate 
these sincere comments 

08:22.285 --> 08:25.521
‎and the counsel there certainly applies. 

08:25.521 --> 08:27.523
‎Any kind of entertainment 

08:27.523 --> 08:30.993
‎that has that corrupting influence 

08:30.993 --> 08:34.063
‎would be avoided by a true Christian. 

08:34.063 --> 08:37.099
‎So here at Hebrews chapter 12, 

08:37.099 --> 08:39.669
‎notice verse 11: 

08:39.669 --> 08:43.839
‎“True, no discipline seems 
for the present to be joyous, 

08:43.839 --> 08:45.841
‎“but it is painful; 

08:45.841 --> 08:49.779
‎“yet afterward, it yields 
the peaceable fruit of righteousness 

08:49.779 --> 08:51.914
‎to those who have been trained by it.” 

08:51.914 --> 08:54.617
‎So discipline is painful, 

08:54.617 --> 08:56.652
‎but “the peaceable fruit 
of righteousness”

08:56.652 --> 09:01.324
‎makes it worth it 
to have a proper view of the discipline 

09:01.324 --> 09:03.759
‎and to accept it humbly 

09:03.759 --> 09:14.697
‎so that we can remain close 
to our precious Father, Jehovah.

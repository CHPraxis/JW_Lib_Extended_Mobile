00:01.583 --> 00:02.985
The text today is taken 


00:02.985 --> 00:06.422
from The Watchtower of 2016, January, 


00:06.422 --> 00:08.425
and the theme 


00:08.425 --> 00:10.427
“Be Compelled 


00:10.427 --> 00:15.000
by God’s ‘Indescribable Free Gift.’” 


00:16.132 --> 00:18.869
Well, this Memorial season 
really does move us 


00:18.868 --> 00:22.771
to contemplate what Jehovah has done for us, 


00:22.772 --> 00:25.809
and we should be compelled. 


00:25.808 --> 00:29.711
The Insight volume has 
a very interesting article 


00:29.712 --> 00:31.982
on this matter of forgiveness. 


00:31.982 --> 00:34.550
And in one of the statements it mentions 


00:34.550 --> 00:38.220
that “the Hebrew verb sa·lachʹ 


00:38.220 --> 00:40.323
“[for] (forgive) 


00:40.323 --> 00:45.328
is used only with regard 
to [Jehovah’s] pardoning a sinner.” 


00:45.328 --> 00:50.200
It’s never used in connection 
with a human forgiving a human. 


00:50.200 --> 00:55.205
So the extent of 
and reasons for Jehovah’s forgiveness 


00:55.205 --> 00:58.408
really are unmatchable. 


00:58.408 --> 01:02.245
So, what should we be compelled to do? 


01:02.245 --> 01:05.515
Well, let’s reflect 
on the illustration that Jesus gave 


01:05.515 --> 01:09.485
in Matthew chapter 18, 
and if you turn there 


01:09.485 --> 01:13.022
you’ll recall that in verse 21 


01:13.022 --> 01:16.159
Peter had asked: 


01:16.158 --> 01:19.761
‘Lord, how many times am I to forgive 


01:19.762 --> 01:22.532
‘my brother if he sins against me? 


01:22.532 --> 01:24.634
Up to seven times?’ 


01:24.633 --> 01:27.703
Now, what was wrong with that question? 


01:27.703 --> 01:32.708
Well, Peter had been influenced 
by a hard-hearted spirit 


01:32.708 --> 01:37.000
that was prevalent in those days, 
and in some instances even today. 


01:38.380 --> 01:40.383
Well, what do we mean? 


01:40.383 --> 01:44.720
Well, Peter measured forgiveness, 


01:44.720 --> 01:48.858
and that was common among the Pharisees. 


01:48.858 --> 01:52.495
Jesus went on to say what in verse 22? 


01:52.495 --> 01:54.963
We know it very well: 
“I say to you, 


01:54.963 --> 01:58.000
not up to seven times, 
but up to 77 times.” 


01:58.000 --> 02:01.972
And then, in connection 
with divine forgiveness he


02:01.972 --> 02:04.774
—Jesus—
responds in a way 


02:04.773 --> 02:07.343
that helps us to see the contrast 


02:07.343 --> 02:10.646
in the human understanding 
of forgiveness and God’s. 


02:10.647 --> 02:13.850
Notice what he says in verse 23: 


02:13.850 --> 02:17.320
“That is why the Kingdom of the heavens 


02:17.320 --> 02:20.323
“may be likened 
to a king who wanted 


02:20.323 --> 02:23.325
to settle accounts with his slaves.” 


02:23.325 --> 02:27.063
Now notice, 
the king wanted to settle accounts. 


02:27.063 --> 02:29.431
It wasn’t the slaves. 


02:29.432 --> 02:33.637
The slaves had built up a debt with the king, 


02:33.637 --> 02:38.642
and justice called for the king 
to handle matters 


02:38.642 --> 02:41.044
—balance the books, as it were. 


02:41.043 --> 02:43.846
But then, he found one slave 


02:43.847 --> 02:46.917
“who owed him 10,000 talents” 


02:46.917 --> 02:49.319
—40 million dollars. 


02:49.318 --> 02:51.921
That’s a lot of money.


02:51.922 --> 02:54.290
Jehovah


02:54.290 --> 02:58.528
—if we think about that illustration—
is telling us something. 


02:58.528 --> 03:01.898
He has given those 


03:01.898 --> 03:04.966
that are his slaves
—us—


03:04.967 --> 03:08.237
a lot of leeway. 


03:08.237 --> 03:12.509
He has forgiven us 


03:12.508 --> 03:16.845
thousands of times, 
so often that we are not aware, 


03:16.845 --> 03:20.983
really, of the many sins 
we commit against Jehovah. 


03:20.983 --> 03:24.486
Now, going back to the illustration, 
verse 26. 


03:24.487 --> 03:29.392
This slave begs 
because he can’t afford to pay, 


03:29.392 --> 03:32.129
and he says to the master: 
‘Be patient with me, 


03:32.128 --> 03:35.063
and I’ll pay everything I owe you.’ 


03:35.063 --> 03:37.166
Well, how in the world could he do that? 


03:37.167 --> 03:39.969
He was a slave. 
How could he pay back 40 million dollars? 


03:39.968 --> 03:44.000
And the master knew that there 
was no way he could pay this back. 


03:45.775 --> 03:48.745
Well now, putting the illustration 
in today’s terms, 


03:48.745 --> 03:52.048
the average yearly wage 
for the United States


03:52.048 --> 03:54.883
—I googled this—


03:54.883 --> 03:58.153
in 2014 


03:58.153 --> 04:00.256
was almost 52,000 dollars. 


04:00.257 --> 04:02.659
That’s just averaging out everybody. 


04:02.658 --> 04:04.660
There’s a lot of people 
who don’t make that much, 


04:04.660 --> 04:09.565
and many who make more than that, 
but the average was 52,000 dollars. 


04:09.565 --> 04:14.570
Now, if the 10,000 talents 
equaled 40 million dollars, 


04:14.570 --> 04:18.642
it would take a man 770 years 


04:18.642 --> 04:20.644
to pay off that debt 


04:20.643 --> 04:23.746
if he gave everything that he made 
to pay off the debt. 


04:23.747 --> 04:25.749
So the master knew, 


04:25.748 --> 04:28.985
‘This slave, he can’t—
he can’t pay me.’ 


04:28.985 --> 04:32.988
So verse 27 says: 
“Moved with pity at this, 


04:32.988 --> 04:37.926
the master of that slave 
let him off and canceled his debt.” 


04:37.927 --> 04:41.230
Oh, boy, what a relief that would be. 


04:41.230 --> 04:46.068
But the slave 
should have recognized something. 


04:46.068 --> 04:50.038
He could never be 
in the same position as the master. 


04:50.038 --> 04:52.941
He didn’t have the resources. 


04:52.942 --> 04:57.947
Nor could anyone possibly owe him 


04:57.947 --> 05:01.150
what he owed the master. 


05:01.150 --> 05:03.653
Now, if he had captured the spirit 


05:03.653 --> 05:06.021
of forgiveness shown to him, 


05:06.022 --> 05:09.192
there would hardly be any debt owed to him 


05:09.192 --> 05:12.662
that he couldn’t tolerate or even forget. 


05:12.662 --> 05:15.999
But in verse 28, look at his attitude: 


05:15.998 --> 05:19.835
“That slave went out 
and found one of his fellow slaves, 


05:19.835 --> 05:24.000
[on the same plane as him] 
who owed him 100 denarii [70 dollars].” 


05:26.108 --> 05:30.546
Now notice, 
he “went out and found” that slave. 


05:30.547 --> 05:35.552
So rather than looking to overlook 


05:35.552 --> 05:39.489
the debts of those who were indebted to him, 


05:39.488 --> 05:44.000
he was looking for those who owed him. 


05:45.060 --> 05:47.597
Now, we’re going to read 


05:47.597 --> 05:53.302
verses 29, 30, 32, 33, and 35. 


05:53.302 --> 05:55.304
Notice: 


05:55.303 --> 05:57.706
“So his fellow slave fell down 


05:57.707 --> 06:00.109
“and began to beg him, saying, 


06:00.108 --> 06:04.213
“‘Be patient with me, 
and I will pay you back.’ 


06:04.213 --> 06:07.550
However, he was not willing.” 


06:07.550 --> 06:09.685
Now, let’s stop there. 


06:09.685 --> 06:13.188
Is it possible that this slave 
that owed him could pay him back? 


06:13.188 --> 06:15.858
Yes, it was possible he could work it out 


06:15.858 --> 06:19.028
within his resources
—70 dollars. 


06:19.028 --> 06:23.198
But then, what was the reaction? 


06:23.198 --> 06:26.201
The account says: 
“He went and had him thrown into prison 


06:26.202 --> 06:29.239
until he could pay back what he owed.” 


06:29.238 --> 06:33.575
Boy, how petty. 


06:33.575 --> 06:37.580
Verse 32: “Then [the] master 
summoned him and said to him: 


06:37.580 --> 06:41.217
“‘Wicked slave, I canceled 
all that debt for you 


06:41.217 --> 06:43.219
“‘when you pleaded with me 


06:43.218 --> 06:46.388
“‘[that debt that you 
could never have paid off]. 


06:46.388 --> 06:50.560
“‘Should you not also have shown mercy 
to your fellow slave 


06:50.560 --> 06:55.498
“‘[that slave who possibly 
could have paid it off the same] 


06:55.498 --> 06:57.766
as I showed mercy to you?’” 


06:57.767 --> 07:02.372
And then the clincher, 
verse 35, Jesus’ point: 


07:02.372 --> 07:06.275
“My heavenly Father will also deal with you 


07:06.275 --> 07:08.878
“[that’s me, and that’s you] 


07:08.878 --> 07:10.946
“in the same way 


07:10.947 --> 07:14.484
if each of you 
does not forgive your brother.” 


07:14.483 --> 07:16.818
Not by rote, 


07:16.818 --> 07:20.000
not by formula, 
but ‘from our heart.’


07:21.390 --> 07:23.392
Now the king, as we said, 


07:23.392 --> 07:27.297
forgave the debt of 40 million dollars. 


07:27.297 --> 07:30.265
That slave was unwilling 
to forgive his fellow slave 


07:30.265 --> 07:33.102
for the amount of 70 dollars. 


07:33.102 --> 07:35.939
Jehovah is a big Forgiver, 


07:35.938 --> 07:37.940
and we thank him for that. 


07:37.940 --> 07:41.843
Last evening helped us to see how big. 


07:41.843 --> 07:46.848
Really, grasping the depth 
of our indebtedness to Jehovah 


07:46.848 --> 07:50.385
and the depth of his forgiveness 


07:50.385 --> 07:53.957
should compel us to constantly work 


07:53.957 --> 07:56.000
at having a forgiving spirit. 


07:57.460 --> 08:00.563
The Insight volume says that in the Bible 


08:00.563 --> 08:02.965
“the Hebrew word na·saʼʹ 


08:02.965 --> 08:05.635
“may denote the pardon, or forgiveness, 


08:05.635 --> 08:08.570
extended by God or by humans.” 


08:08.570 --> 08:10.573
But as we stated originally, 


08:10.573 --> 08:12.575
“sa·lachʹ 


08:12.575 --> 08:16.112
“is used exclusively 
[for] God’s forgiveness, 


08:16.112 --> 08:19.382
the act by which [a] sinner 
is restored to divine favor.” 


08:19.382 --> 08:22.017
Now remember, our forgiveness 


08:22.017 --> 08:26.255
can’t begin to match Jehovah’s. 


08:26.255 --> 08:28.823
So there’s nothing that any human 


08:28.823 --> 08:32.861
can do to us that matches what we


08:32.862 --> 08:37.434
—born in sin, alienated from God, 
inclined to do wrong—


08:37.433 --> 08:39.901
have done to offend Jehovah. 


08:39.902 --> 08:41.904
And yet 


08:41.903 --> 08:46.508
—as we discussed yesterday, 
last evening, and we’re reminded of—


08:46.508 --> 08:50.078
God recommends his own love to us, 


08:50.078 --> 08:54.150
and that “while we were yet sinners” 


08:54.150 --> 08:56.452
he had his Son die for us. 


08:56.452 --> 09:00.255
I’d like to quote to you 
The Watchtower of October 15, 1999, 


09:00.255 --> 09:04.093
page 13
—October 15, 1999. 


09:04.093 --> 09:06.828
The article is “Forgive From Your Heart.” 


09:06.828 --> 09:08.830
It says this: 


09:08.830 --> 09:12.568
“You should see in God’s willingness 
to forgive a pattern 


09:12.568 --> 09:15.905
“as to how you ought to treat other humans. 


09:15.905 --> 09:18.173
“Paul focused on this, writing: 


09:18.173 --> 09:20.676
“‘Become kind to one another, 


09:20.677 --> 09:24.947
tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving.’” 


09:24.947 --> 09:27.317
Not like an accountant keeping track, 


09:27.317 --> 09:29.819
but “freely forgiving one another 


09:29.818 --> 09:33.155
just as God also by Christ 
freely forgave you.” 


09:33.155 --> 09:37.527
Then The Watchtower says this: 
“Do you see the link? 


09:37.527 --> 09:41.730
“Jehovah God forgave you, [that’s me]


09:41.730 --> 09:45.500
“so
—Paul forcefully reasons—


09:45.500 --> 09:47.603
“you need to imitate [God] Him 


09:47.603 --> 09:51.673
and be ‘tenderly compassionate, 
freely forgiving’ of others.” 


09:51.673 --> 09:54.876
And then The Watchtower asked 
some penetrating questions. 


09:54.877 --> 09:58.847
It said: “Ask yourself, 
‘Am I [really] doing that? 


09:58.847 --> 10:02.785
“‘If it is not [in] my nature, 
am I working in that direction, 


10:02.785 --> 10:06.955
really striving to imitate God 
in being forgiving?’” 


10:06.955 --> 10:08.958
Now, we might say: 
‘Well, I’m forgiving. 


10:08.958 --> 10:11.493
I forgive a lot of people.’ 


10:11.493 --> 10:13.495
Proof? 


10:13.495 --> 10:15.965
Proverbs 17:9: 


10:15.965 --> 10:18.968
“Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love, 


10:18.968 --> 10:23.571
but the one who keeps harping 
on a matter separates close friends.” 


10:23.572 --> 10:26.309
If we keep talking about 
what somebody has done to us, 


10:26.308 --> 10:28.776
we haven’t forgiven in the heart. 


10:28.777 --> 10:31.114
Jehovah doesn’t do that. 


10:31.113 --> 10:33.548
So forgiving others for personal offenses, 


10:33.548 --> 10:35.583
regardless of the number of times involved, 


10:35.583 --> 10:37.886
is a Christian requirement. 


10:37.887 --> 10:40.990
God’s forgiveness is not extended 


10:40.990 --> 10:43.592
toward those who refuse to forgive. 


10:43.592 --> 10:46.829
Remember what Jesus said: 
“Forgive us our debts, 


10:46.828 --> 10:50.733
as we also have forgiven our debtors.” 


10:50.733 --> 10:53.168
And what a beautiful God we have. 


10:53.168 --> 10:56.338
His action and that of his Son compels us 


10:56.338 --> 11:04.763
to be freely forgiving.

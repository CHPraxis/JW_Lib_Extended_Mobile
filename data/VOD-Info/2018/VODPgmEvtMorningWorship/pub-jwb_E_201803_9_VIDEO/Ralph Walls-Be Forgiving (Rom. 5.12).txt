00:01 The text today is taken
00:02 from The Watchtower of 2016, January,
00:06 and the theme
00:08 “Be Compelled
00:10 by God’s ‘Indescribable Free Gift.’”
00:16 Well, this Memorial season  really does move us
00:18 to contemplate what Jehovah has done for us,
00:22 and we should be compelled.
00:25 The Insight volume has  a very interesting article
00:29 on this matter of forgiveness.
00:31 And in one of the statements it mentions
00:34 that “the Hebrew verb sa·lachʹ
00:38 “[for] (forgive)
00:40 is used only with regard  to [Jehovah’s] pardoning a sinner.”
00:45 It’s never used in connection  with a human forgiving a human.
00:50 So the extent of  and reasons for Jehovah’s forgiveness
00:55 really are unmatchable.
00:58 So, what should we be compelled to do?
01:02 Well, let’s reflect  on the illustration that Jesus gave
01:05 in Matthew chapter 18,  and if you turn there
01:09 you’ll recall that in verse 21
01:13 Peter had asked:
01:16 ‘Lord, how many times am I to forgive
01:19 ‘my brother if he sins against me?
01:22 Up to seven times?’
01:24 Now, what was wrong with that question?
01:27 Well, Peter had been influenced  by a hard-hearted spirit
01:32 that was prevalent in those days,  and in some instances even today.
01:38 Well, what do we mean?
01:40 Well, Peter measured forgiveness,
01:44 and that was common among the Pharisees.
01:48 Jesus went on to say what in verse 22?
01:52 We know it very well:  “I say to you,
01:54 not up to seven times,  but up to 77 times.”
01:58 And then, in connection  with divine forgiveness he
02:01 —Jesus— responds in a way
02:04 that helps us to see the contrast
02:07 in the human understanding  of forgiveness and God’s.
02:10 Notice what he says in verse 23:
02:13 “That is why the Kingdom of the heavens
02:17 “may be likened  to a king who wanted
02:20 to settle accounts with his slaves.”
02:23 Now notice,  the king wanted to settle accounts.
02:27 It wasn’t the slaves.
02:29 The slaves had built up a debt with the king,
02:33 and justice called for the king  to handle matters
02:38 —balance the books, as it were.
02:41 But then, he found one slave
02:43 “who owed him 10,000 talents”
02:46 —40 million dollars.
02:49 That’s a lot of money.
02:51 Jehovah
02:54 —if we think about that illustration— is telling us something.
02:58 He has given those
03:01 that are his slaves —us—
03:04 a lot of leeway.
03:08 He has forgiven us
03:12 thousands of times,  so often that we are not aware,
03:16 really, of the many sins  we commit against Jehovah.
03:20 Now, going back to the illustration,  verse 26.
03:24 This slave begs  because he can’t afford to pay,
03:29 and he says to the master:  ‘Be patient with me,
03:32 and I’ll pay everything I owe you.’
03:35 Well, how in the world could he do that?
03:37 He was a slave.  How could he pay back 40 million dollars?
03:39 And the master knew that there  was no way he could pay this back.
03:45 Well now, putting the illustration  in today’s terms,
03:48 the average yearly wage  for the United States
03:52 —I googled this—
03:54 in 2014
03:58 was almost 52,000 dollars.
04:00 That’s just averaging out everybody.
04:02 There’s a lot of people  who don’t make that much,
04:04 and many who make more than that,  but the average was 52,000 dollars.
04:09 Now, if the 10,000 talents  equaled 40 million dollars,
04:14 it would take a man 770 years
04:18 to pay off that debt
04:20 if he gave everything that he made  to pay off the debt.
04:23 So the master knew,
04:25 ‘This slave, he can’t— he can’t pay me.’
04:28 So verse 27 says:  “Moved with pity at this,
04:32 the master of that slave  let him off and canceled his debt.”
04:37 Oh, boy, what a relief that would be.
04:41 But the slave  should have recognized something.
04:46 He could never be  in the same position as the master.
04:50 He didn’t have the resources.
04:52 Nor could anyone possibly owe him
04:57 what he owed the master.
05:01 Now, if he had captured the spirit
05:03 of forgiveness shown to him,
05:06 there would hardly be any debt owed to him
05:09 that he couldn’t tolerate or even forget.
05:12 But in verse 28, look at his attitude:
05:15 “That slave went out  and found one of his fellow slaves,
05:19 [on the same plane as him]  who owed him 100 denarii [70 dollars].”
05:26 Now notice,  he “went out and found” that slave.
05:30 So rather than looking to overlook
05:35 the debts of those who were indebted to him,
05:39 he was looking for those who owed him.
05:45 Now, we’re going to read
05:47 verses 29, 30, 32, 33, and 35.
05:53 Notice:
05:55 “So his fellow slave fell down
05:57 “and began to beg him, saying,
06:00 “‘Be patient with me,  and I will pay you back.’
06:04 However, he was not willing.”
06:07 Now, let’s stop there.
06:09 Is it possible that this slave  that owed him could pay him back?
06:13 Yes, it was possible he could work it out
06:15 within his resources —70 dollars.
06:19 But then, what was the reaction?
06:23 The account says:  “He went and had him thrown into prison
06:26 until he could pay back what he owed.”
06:29 Boy, how petty.
06:33 Verse 32: “Then [the] master  summoned him and said to him:
06:37 “‘Wicked slave, I canceled  all that debt for you
06:41 “‘when you pleaded with me
06:43 “‘[that debt that you  could never have paid off].
06:46 “‘Should you not also have shown mercy  to your fellow slave
06:50 “‘[that slave who possibly  could have paid it off the same]
06:55 as I showed mercy to you?’”
06:57 And then the clincher,  verse 35, Jesus’ point:
07:02 “My heavenly Father will also deal with you
07:06 “[that’s me, and that’s you]
07:08 “in the same way
07:10 if each of you  does not forgive your brother.”
07:14 Not by rote,
07:16 not by formula,  but ‘from our heart.’
07:21 Now the king, as we said,
07:23 forgave the debt of 40 million dollars.
07:27 That slave was unwilling  to forgive his fellow slave
07:30 for the amount of 70 dollars.
07:33 Jehovah is a big Forgiver,
07:35 and we thank him for that.
07:37 Last evening helped us to see how big.
07:41 Really, grasping the depth  of our indebtedness to Jehovah
07:46 and the depth of his forgiveness
07:50 should compel us to constantly work
07:53 at having a forgiving spirit.
07:57 The Insight volume says that in the Bible
08:00 “the Hebrew word na·saʼʹ
08:02 “may denote the pardon, or forgiveness,
08:05 extended by God or by humans.”
08:08 But as we stated originally,
08:10 “sa·lachʹ
08:12 “is used exclusively  [for] God’s forgiveness,
08:16 the act by which [a] sinner  is restored to divine favor.”
08:19 Now remember, our forgiveness
08:22 can’t begin to match Jehovah’s.
08:26 So there’s nothing that any human
08:28 can do to us that matches what we
08:32 —born in sin, alienated from God,  inclined to do wrong—
08:37 have done to offend Jehovah.
08:39 And yet
08:41 —as we discussed yesterday,  last evening, and we’re reminded of—
08:46 God recommends his own love to us,
08:50 and that “while we were yet sinners”
08:54 he had his Son die for us.
08:56 I’d like to quote to you  The Watchtower of October 15, 1999,
09:00 page 13 —October 15, 1999.
09:04 The article is “Forgive From Your Heart.”
09:06 It says this:
09:08 “You should see in God’s willingness  to forgive a pattern
09:12 “as to how you ought to treat other humans.
09:15 “Paul focused on this, writing:
09:18 “‘Become kind to one another,
09:20 tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving.’”
09:24 Not like an accountant keeping track,
09:27 but “freely forgiving one another
09:29 just as God also by Christ  freely forgave you.”
09:33 Then The Watchtower says this:  “Do you see the link?
09:37 “Jehovah God forgave you, [that’s me]
09:41 “so —Paul forcefully reasons—
09:45 “you need to imitate [God] Him
09:47 and be ‘tenderly compassionate,  freely forgiving’ of others.”
09:51 And then The Watchtower asked  some penetrating questions.
09:54 It said: “Ask yourself,  ‘Am I [really] doing that?
09:58 “‘If it is not [in] my nature,  am I working in that direction,
10:02 really striving to imitate God  in being forgiving?’”
10:06 Now, we might say:  ‘Well, I’m forgiving.
10:08 I forgive a lot of people.’
10:11 Proof?
10:13 Proverbs 17:9:
10:15 “Whoever forgives a transgression seeks love,
10:18 but the one who keeps harping  on a matter separates close friends.”
10:23 If we keep talking about  what somebody has done to us,
10:26 we haven’t forgiven in the heart.
10:28 Jehovah doesn’t do that.
10:31 So forgiving others for personal offenses,
10:33 regardless of the number of times involved,
10:35 is a Christian requirement.
10:37 God’s forgiveness is not extended
10:40 toward those who refuse to forgive.
10:43 Remember what Jesus said:  “Forgive us our debts,
10:46 as we also have forgiven our debtors.”
10:50 And what a beautiful God we have.
10:53 His action and that of his Son compels us
10:56 to be freely forgiving.

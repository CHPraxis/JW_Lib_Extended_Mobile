00:01 “If they have persecuted me,
00:03 they will also persecute you”
00:06 —Jesus’ words.
00:07 And Paul saw the truth of Jesus’ words.
00:11 As a follower of Jesus, Paul experienced
00:14 much persecution and tribulation.
00:17 And isn’t it true  that we see the same today?
00:19 Satan still challenges  the integrity of Jehovah’s people.
00:24 In fact, the Bible indicates  that Satan will increase his attacks
00:28 on Jehovah’s people in these last days.
00:31 And we see this happening.
00:32 As we look at the attacks being made  on Jehovah’s people around the world,
00:35 we think of our brothers in Eritrea,
00:38 our brothers in Korea,  in Russia, other places,
00:41 and even smaller attacks
00:43 that we may not even personally hear about.
00:45 Truly, Jesus’ words  are being fulfilled today.
00:49 But the question  we want to consider today is,
00:51 What about us personally?
00:54 See, the text says  that ‘if they’ve persecuted me,’
00:57 Jesus said,  ‘they will persecute you.’
01:00 At 2 Timothy 3:12, it says:
01:04 “All those desiring  to live with godly devotion . . .
01:08 will also be persecuted.”
01:10 So that means we’re not exempt.
01:12 And as our text highlights,  things can quickly turn.
01:15 Sometimes it’s outright persecution  from governments
01:19 or opposition from family members.
01:21 In other cases,  it may be efforts to block our work
01:24 or hamper a theocratic project  or another initiative.
01:29 How will we do
01:31 when faced with persecution  and opposition?
01:35 Now, it’s easy to say “Trust in Jehovah,”  and we know we need to do that.
01:38 But what does that mean?
01:39 How do we know what decisions to make?
01:41 What’s the right decision?
01:43 What’s not the right decision?
01:45 Are there principles that can guide us?
01:48 Well, let’s consider three of them.
01:50 The first one is  that the apparent easy solution
01:54 out of a situation
01:56 may not be the right solution.
01:59 Look in Isaiah chapter 30,
02:01 and we’ll look at a solution  that the kings of Israel and Judah
02:06 fell back on from time to time.
02:08 Isaiah chapter 30,  and let’s read verses 1 and 2.
02:14 It says:  “‘Woe to the stubborn sons,’
02:16 “declares Jehovah,
02:18 “‘who carry out plans that are not mine,
02:22 “‘who make alliances, but not by my spirit,
02:25 “‘in order to add sin to sin.
02:28 “‘They go down to Egypt  without consulting me,
02:31 “‘to take shelter under Pharaoh’s protection
02:34 and to take refuge  in the shadow of Egypt!’”
02:38 You see, the nation  thought it was a good solution
02:40 to enlist Egypt’s aid  to keep off the Babylonians and others.
02:45 That seemed to be the best choice,  and we saw over and over again
02:49 that the unfaithful kings  of Israel and Judah did that.
02:52 They chose to strike deals  with Jehovah’s enemies
02:55 to protect them  from other enemies of Jehovah.
02:59 And so when under attack,  when facing opposition,
03:03 we too may be encouraged to strike a deal
03:07 —maybe a bit of a compromise  to lessen the pressure.
03:11 But now, at other times,  we notice that Paul and others
03:14 did appeal to government officials  or appealed to Caesar,
03:18 and Jehovah blessed that.
03:20 So what’s the lesson?
03:22 Well, the lesson is that we need  to make sure that we’re following a course
03:26 that is in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose
03:28 and that is backed by his spirit.
03:30 So we need to prayerfully make sure
03:32 that the arrangement  that we’re working out is Jehovah’s will
03:36 and to remember that the logical solution
03:39 from man’s perspective
03:41 may not always be Jehovah’s solution.
03:45 Second principle:
03:47 and that is not to become distracted  from our main focus and our main work.
03:51 And we have a good example of that  when considering Nehemiah.
03:54 As we know, Nehemiah  was blocked by enemies of Jehovah
03:58 who were trying to stop him  from completing his theocratic project.
04:02 Look, for example, at Nehemiah 6:2.
04:07 Nehemiah 6:2, and it says:
04:10 “Sanballat and Geshem  immediately sent this message to me:
04:14 “‘Come, and let us  set a time to meet together
04:17 “in the villages of the Valley Plain of Ono.’
04:19 But they were scheming to harm me.”
04:22 Now, the distance between Jerusalem  and the Valley Plain of Ono
04:25 was about 30 to 35 miles,  or about 50 kilometers, away.
04:29 Sanballat was not looking  to get together with Nehemiah
04:32 to work out how they could help them.
04:34 He was scheming to divert the work,  to slow down the work,
04:37 to oppose the work;  and Nehemiah knew what they were up to.
04:41 Notice what he says in verse 3.
04:44 He says:  “I sent messengers to them, saying:
04:47 “‘I am engaged in a great work,  and I am not able to go down.
04:51 Why should the work stop  while I leave it to come to you?’”
04:55 See, Nehemiah did not allow himself
04:57 to become distracted  from his main assignment
05:00 —from the work  that he had been given to do.
05:03 Now, when that didn’t work,  his opposers tried
05:05 to get him to choose a solution
05:07 that would harm his reputation  and bring reproach on Jehovah’s name.
05:11 Look over in verse 10.
05:13 See, this says:  ‘Well, come into the temple.
05:15 Let’s shut the doors of the temple  because they’re coming to kill you.’
05:18 Well, look at verse 13.
05:20 He says: “He had been hired  to frighten me and to cause me to sin,
05:25 “so that they would have grounds  to damage my reputation
05:28 in order to reproach me.”
05:31 Well see, likewise,  at times we may be offered
05:34 solutions out of a situation  or to relieve pressure from opposition
05:38 which will distract us
05:40 from our primary work  —our service to Jehovah.
05:43 Or it may be an initiative  that’s a little bit in a gray area.
05:46 Yes, everybody does it,  but it’s a gray area.
05:49 And it could damage our reputation  or bring reproach on Jehovah’s name.
05:53 So again, what do we do?
05:55 Will we seek Jehovah’s direction?
05:57 Will this solution distract us  from our main commission?
06:02 How will it appear to onlookers?
06:04 What will it do to Jehovah’s name?
06:07 Now, these first two principles  do not mean that we do not do anything;
06:11 and that leads to our third principle.
06:13 And that is we do what we can  from a practical standpoint.
06:17 We give Jehovah something to bless,  and then we wait on Jehovah.
06:22 And the account of Hezekiah  is a beautiful example of that.
06:25 We had the drama  at our convention this year,
06:27 where the ruthless king of Assyria  was determined to take Jerusalem.
06:32 Rabshakeh taunted Hezekiah  and tried to get the people to surrender
06:36 and make a deal with Assyria.
06:39 What did Hezekiah do?
06:41 Well, he displayed  wisdom and military strategy
06:44 while waiting on Jehovah.
06:46 He did what he could  to give Jehovah something to bless.
06:50 Remember what they did?
06:51 They went and diverted  the water sources outside the city
06:55 so that if there was a siege,
06:56 the Assyrians  would have trouble getting water.
06:59 They strengthened the city’s fortification  —the walls.
07:02 They made missiles in abundance and shields.
07:05 They did what they could,  but they trusted in Jehovah.
07:09 Remember what Hezekiah said to the people  as recorded at 2 Chronicles 32:7, 8?
07:14 He says:  “Be courageous and strong. . . .
07:16 There are more with us  than there are with him.”
07:19 So they did what they could,
07:22 but they relied on Jehovah  for the real solution.
07:25 And interestingly, in this case,
07:26 Jehovah did not use  anything of what they did.
07:29 He provided an angel to deliver them.
07:32 So likewise,  when facing persecution today,
07:35 facing opposition today,  we do what’s in the power of our hand to do
07:39 while keeping in mind  those first two principles
07:42 and then we see  what Jehovah works out in our behalf.
07:47 So, what’s the lesson for us?
07:49 Well, the lesson  is that in the face of persecution,
07:52 when we’re going through opposition,
07:54 the way through the situation  may not be clear.
07:58 It may not be readily apparent.
08:01 But look for principles  that can help us to make good decisions.
08:06 And, really, it all boils down  to our most effective means
08:09 of dealing with persecution and opposition.
08:12 Notice what it says at Psalm 9:10.
08:18 Psalm 9:10,
08:21 it says:  “Those knowing your name will trust in you;
08:26 you will never abandon  those seeking you, O Jehovah.”
08:30 “Those knowing your name will trust in you.”
08:35 We know Jehovah.
08:37 We know Jehovah’s name.
08:39 We know what his name means.
08:41 We know that Jehovah can become,  he can cause us to become,
08:44 he can cause any of his creation
08:46 to become whatever is needed  to fulfill his purpose.
08:49 We just need to trust in him.
08:52 He will never abandon us.
08:55 So yes, as followers of Jesus,  we will be persecuted.
09:00 We will face opposition.
09:04 When those days come, how will we do?
09:08 Well, may these and other principles  help us to make good decisions,
09:12 and may we ultimately trust in  and wait on Jehovah,
09:16 convinced that he will never abandon us.

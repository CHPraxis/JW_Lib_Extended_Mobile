00:00:01 ‎By the time the apostle Peter
00:00:03 ‎wrote the words of today’s text,
00:00:05 ‎individuals who were Jews,
00:00:07 ‎proselytes, Samaritans,
00:00:09 ‎and Gentiles had been brought
00:00:11 ‎into the Christian congregation
00:00:12 ‎as God’s people,
00:00:14 ‎the spiritual Israel of God.
00:00:16 ‎In the verse before today’s text,
00:00:19 ‎Peter outlined what their mission was.
00:00:22 ‎Let’s open  to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read that.
00:00:26 ‎It’s in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.
00:00:31 ‎He wrote:
00:00:32 ‎“But you are ‘a chosen race,  a royal priesthood,
00:00:36 ‎“‘a holy nation,  a people for special possession,
00:00:41 ‎“that you should declare abroad  the excellencies’
00:00:44 ‎“of the One who called you  out of darkness into his wonderful light.
00:00:48 ‎“For you were once not a people,
00:00:50 ‎but now you are God’s people.”
00:00:53 ‎And, of course, this refers  to the spirit-anointed members
00:00:57 ‎of the congregation  who would be responsible
00:01:00 ‎for glorifying Jehovah’s name  as his Witnesses.
00:01:04 ‎And this harmonizes  with what Peter had said years earlier
00:01:08 ‎in the first-century governing body meeting,
00:01:11 ‎as reported in Acts chapter 15.
00:01:14 ‎So let’s turn there, Acts 15,
00:01:17 ‎and we will begin with verse 14.
00:01:20 ‎It says:  “Symeon has related thoroughly how God
00:01:24 ‎“for the first time  turned his attention to the nations
00:01:26 ‎“to take out of them a people for his name.
00:01:30 ‎“And with this the words  of the Prophets agree,
00:01:32 ‎“just as it is written:
00:01:34 ‎“‘After these things  I will return and raise up again
00:01:37 ‎“‘the tent of David that is fallen down;
00:01:39 ‎“‘I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,
00:01:42 ‎“‘so that the men who remain  may earnestly seek Jehovah,
00:01:46 ‎“‘together with people of all the nations,
00:01:48 ‎“‘people who are called by my name,
00:01:50 ‎says Jehovah, who is doing these things.’”
00:01:55 ‎Now, what about the rest of us
00:01:57 ‎who are not anointed Christians
00:01:59 ‎but who call ourselves Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:02:02 ‎Are we also God’s people?
00:02:04 ‎Well, most certainly!
00:02:06 ‎And what a proud honor it is for us
00:02:09 ‎to bear the name of the only true God.
00:02:12 ‎But with that name comes responsibility,
00:02:15 ‎one that other religious groups  do not want to take on.
00:02:19 ‎You see, we are under obligation
00:02:21 ‎to bear witness to Jehovah,
00:02:23 ‎to tell the truth about him,
00:02:25 ‎and to expose false teachings
00:02:28 ‎that misrepresent Jehovah.
00:02:30 ‎And a classic example  of an unscriptural dogma
00:02:34 ‎that God’s people have exposed is the Trinity,
00:02:37 ‎which reminds me of another hoax
00:02:40 ‎that fooled many people  who should have known better.
00:02:43 ‎It’s the true story  about a man named van Meegeren,
00:02:47 ‎a Dutch artist, born in 1889,
00:02:51 ‎who perpetrated what may have been
00:02:53 ‎the most sensational art hoax of all time.
00:02:57 ‎You see, he never won the critical acclaim
00:03:00 ‎that he thought he was due as an artist.
00:03:02 ‎So to get back at the art critics,
00:03:04 ‎he decided to demonstrate his talent
00:03:06 ‎by producing a painting that would fool them all,
00:03:09 ‎and he set out to imitate
00:03:11 ‎the famous 17th-century Dutch impressionist,
00:03:15 ‎Johannes Vermeer.
00:03:17 ‎Well, van Meegeren spent 4 years figuring out
00:03:21 ‎how to make  a new painting look 300 years old.
00:03:24 ‎The canvas was the easy part.
00:03:26 ‎He just took a lesser-known painting
00:03:28 ‎from the 17th century  and removed the picture.
00:03:31 ‎His biggest problem was getting oil paint
00:03:33 ‎to harden thoroughly,  which usually takes 50 years.
00:03:37 ‎He solved it  by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin
00:03:41 ‎instead of oil and then baking the canvas.
00:03:45 ‎Well, van Meegeren produced six paintings
00:03:47 ‎that were passed off as Vermeers.
00:03:50 ‎His greatest sold in 1937.
00:03:53 ‎It was entitled  Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.
00:03:57 ‎The most authoritative art historian of the day
00:04:00 ‎said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece,
00:04:03 ‎untouched, on the original canvas,
00:04:06 ‎and that it had no restoration done to it.
00:04:08 ‎But in reality, it was a fake.
00:04:11 ‎The critic’s opinion was taken  as gospel in the art world,
00:04:15 ‎so much so that this critic  had been nicknamed “The Pope.”
00:04:20 ‎Eventually, though,  a chemical analysis proved
00:04:23 ‎that the paint contained  an ingredient that had not been discovered
00:04:26 ‎until two centuries after Vermeer died,
00:04:28 ‎and that’s what exposed  van Meegeren as a fraud.
00:04:33 ‎Well, something similar  went on during the apostasy
00:04:36 ‎that took place  after the death of the apostles.
00:04:39 ‎Less than 300 years  after the Bible was completed,
00:04:42 ‎a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5:7 the words
00:04:46 ‎“in heaven, the Father,  the Word, and the Holy Ghost:
00:04:51 ‎and these three are one.”
00:04:54 ‎However, this addition does not appear
00:04:56 ‎in the oldest Greek manuscripts,
00:04:58 ‎proving it’s a fake;  it’s a corruption of God’s Word.
00:05:02 ‎And yet for centuries,  the churches propagated the Trinity doctrine.
00:05:07 ‎As recently as the 19th century,
00:05:09 ‎almost all Bible translations
00:05:11 ‎had this spurious addition.
00:05:14 ‎As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII
00:05:17 ‎upheld the corrupted text
00:05:19 ‎of the Latin Vulgate.
00:05:21 ‎Interestingly, the New Catholic Encyclopedia
00:05:24 ‎comments on this  and says: “The Trinitarian dogma
00:05:27 ‎“is in the last analysis  a late 4th century invention.
00:05:32 ‎“Among the Apostolic Fathers,
00:05:34 ‎“there had been nothing  even remotely approaching
00:05:36 ‎such a mentality or perspective.”
00:05:39 ‎Well, Jehovah’s anointed Witnesses
00:05:42 ‎firmly rejected Christendom’s Trinity dogma.
00:05:46 ‎In 1915,  The Watch Tower exposed the foolishness
00:05:50 ‎of teaching a doctrine  that contradicts the Bible.
00:05:53 ‎The Watch Tower said:
00:05:55 ‎“In what a jumble of contradictions
00:05:58 ‎“and confusion  do they find themselves who say
00:06:00 ‎“that Jesus and the Father are one God!
00:06:03 ‎“This would involve the idea
00:06:05 ‎“that our Lord Jesus acted  the hypocrite when on earth
00:06:08 ‎“and only pretended  to address God in prayer,
00:06:10 ‎“when He Himself was the same God. . . .
00:06:13 ‎“The Father has always been immortal,  hence could not die.
00:06:16 ‎“How then, could Jesus have died? . . .
00:06:18 ‎“The Scriptures declare,  however, that He did die. . . .
00:06:21 ‎“If they admit that Jesus really died,  they take the other horn of the dilemma;
00:06:25 ‎“for believing that their three Gods
00:06:27 ‎“are all one person as many do,
00:06:29 ‎“when Jesus died  they must all three have died.
00:06:33 ‎“If they all died, who raised them to life?
00:06:35 ‎“How foolish all this sounds! . . .
00:06:38 ‎“Shall we thus contradict the Apostles  and Prophets and Jesus Himself,
00:06:42 ‎“and ignore reason  and common sense, in order to hold
00:06:45 ‎“to a dogma handed to us  from the dark, superstitious past,
00:06:48 ‎“by a corrupt apostate Church?
00:06:51 ‎Nay!” says The Watch Tower.
00:06:55 ‎Well, Jehovah’s people  continue to uphold the excellencies
00:06:59 ‎ of the only true God.
00:07:01 ‎Whether in ancient times,  as with the natural Israelites
00:07:05 ‎or in modern times, as with spiritual Israel,
00:07:07 ‎Jehovah’s words through Isaiah are still true.
00:07:11 ‎Look at it at Isaiah 43:21.
00:07:16 ‎Of course,  we know in Isaiah chapter 43
00:07:19 ‎Jehovah declares:  “You are my witnesses.”
00:07:22 ‎And in verse 21 he says:
00:07:25 ‎“The people whom I formed for myself
00:07:29 ‎so that they might declare my praise.”
00:07:33 ‎And the effort that Jehovah’s Witnesses​
00:07:35 ‎—God’s people​— have put forth to expose
00:07:38 ‎ Bible teachings that are false,
00:07:43 ‎to teach the truth about Jehovah,
00:07:45 ‎and to sanctify God’s name  has taken on proportions
00:07:48 ‎never attained by any other religious group.
00:07:50 ‎And Jehovah takes notice of that.
00:07:53 ‎Look at Malachi the 3rd chapter.
00:07:56 ‎Malachi chapter 3,
00:07:59 ‎beginning with verse 16.
00:08:03 ‎Malachi 3:​16:
00:08:06 ‎“At that time those  who feared Jehovah spoke with one another,
00:08:10 ‎“each one with his companion,
00:08:12 ‎“and Jehovah kept paying  attention and listening.
00:08:14 ‎“And a book of remembrance  was written before him
00:08:17 ‎“for those fearing Jehovah  and for those meditating on
00:08:21 ‎“[or the footnote says,  possibly, “treasuring”] his name.
00:08:25 ‎“‘And they will be mine,’  says Jehovah of armies,
00:08:28 ‎‘in the day when I produce  a special property.’”
00:08:32 ‎So Jehovah truly does love those
00:08:35 ‎who fear him and treasure his name,
00:08:38 ‎making them truly God’s people.

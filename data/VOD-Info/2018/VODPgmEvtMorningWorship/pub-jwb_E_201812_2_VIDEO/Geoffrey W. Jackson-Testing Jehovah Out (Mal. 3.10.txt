00:00:01 ‎The scripture that we’re considering this morning
00:00:03 ‎raises a very interesting question,
00:00:05 ‎and that is,
00:00:07 ‎How is it that we can ‘test Jehovah out’?
00:00:11 ‎Didn’t Jesus say that we shouldn’t test Jehovah?
00:00:15 ‎Well, the simple answer to that question
00:00:18 ‎was given  ‎in The Watchtower back in 1957.
00:00:21 ‎It simply stated:  ‎“There is a wrong way
00:00:25 ‎and a right way  ‎to put Jehovah to the test.”
00:00:28 ‎Now, how do we know ‎what is the right way
00:00:31 ‎and what is the wrong way?
00:00:33 ‎Well, again, put simply,
00:00:36 ‎it means knowing the difference  ‎between faith and stupidity.
00:00:42 ‎When we consider  ‎what the Scriptures tell us,
00:00:45 ‎it helps us to see the line
00:00:47 ‎that is the demarcation  ‎between faith and stupidity.
00:00:51 ‎Consider, first of all, the good way
00:00:54 ‎that we can test out Jehovah.
00:00:56 ‎When we think about  ‎showing faith in Jehovah,
00:01:00 ‎having trust in him,  ‎and then obeying him
00:01:03 ‎—not waiting for Jehovah ‎to make the first move
00:01:06 ‎but rather for us, ‎first of all, to obey him,
00:01:09 ‎to reach out  ‎and do what he wants us to do
00:01:11 ‎—that, in a figurative way, ‎is putting him to the test,
00:01:15 ‎because he’s already promised to bless us.
00:01:18 ‎By us obeying him,  ‎it means that we are showing faith.
00:01:22 ‎It also means that we  ‎don’t complain about the things
00:01:26 ‎that Jehovah  ‎allows to occur in our life,
00:01:28 ‎and we don’t take unnecessary risks.
00:01:31 ‎We don’t try to fool him
00:01:33 ‎by acting one way
00:01:36 ‎but then pretending to be another way.
00:01:38 ‎So put quite simply, again,
00:01:41 ‎the right way for us to test out Jehovah
00:01:44 ‎means to trust him,
00:01:46 ‎to have faith in him,
00:01:48 ‎to obey him
00:01:50 ‎even if it may be difficult to do so.
00:01:53 ‎Well, what about the wrong way ‎to test out Jehovah?
00:01:57 ‎Well, if we were to selfishly complain
00:02:02 ‎about the things  ‎that Jehovah allows to occur in our life
00:02:06 ‎or if we were to do
00:02:08 ‎something stupid,  ‎something careless,
00:02:11 ‎and expect that Jehovah  ‎is going to perform a miracle to save us
00:02:16 ‎or perhaps  ‎we keep pushing Jehovah
00:02:19 ‎to do something ‎that really is not in harmony with his will
00:02:24 ‎or if we try to fool him
00:02:27 ‎by pretending to serve him
00:02:29 ‎but actually are doing things ‎that displease him,
00:02:32 ‎all of those things really would be ‎a stupid act on our part.
00:02:36 ‎Now, what do we really need to consider ‎with regard to this?
00:02:40 ‎Well, let’s think about when Jesus ‎made that answer to Satan
00:02:45 ‎and said, ‎‘You shouldn’t put Jehovah to the test.’
00:02:47 ‎Let’s have a look at the scripture  ‎that he based that comment on.
00:02:51 ‎It’s found at Deuteronomy 6:16,
00:02:56 ‎and this gives us  ‎a little context to the meaning.
00:03:00 ‎In verse 16, it says:
00:03:02 ‎“You must not  ‎put Jehovah your God to the test
00:03:05 ‎the way you put him  ‎to the test at Massah.”
00:03:08 ‎Now, really, what was it
00:03:10 ‎that the Israelites did ‎at this particular time
00:03:13 ‎where the name of the location
00:03:15 ‎where they were  ‎meant “Testing” or “Trial”?
00:03:18 ‎Well, if we turn back to Exodus 17:7,
00:03:23 ‎it gives us some idea  ‎of what this really involved.
00:03:27 ‎Exodus 17:7:
00:03:30 ‎“So he named the place ‎Massah and Meribah
00:03:34 ‎“because of the quarreling of the Israelites
00:03:36 ‎“and because they put Jehovah to the test
00:03:39 ‎by saying:  ‎‘Is Jehovah in our midst or not?’”
00:03:44 ‎So, what did the Israelites do here?
00:03:47 ‎Obviously, they didn’t trust Jehovah enough.
00:03:51 ‎They didn’t have enough  ‎faith in Jehovah to realize
00:03:54 ‎that he wasn’t going  ‎to let them all die in the wilderness.
00:03:57 ‎But they pushed him.
00:04:00 ‎They wanted something immediately.
00:04:02 ‎They wanted to satisfy their selfish desires.
00:04:05 ‎Well, that’s a very good lesson for us ‎—isn’t it?—
00:04:08 ‎because this shows a lack of faith.
00:04:12 ‎We could consider  ‎when the Israelites decided
00:04:16 ‎that they didn’t want to go ‎into the Promised Land.
00:04:19 ‎Remember,  ‎they were so upset with the report
00:04:22 ‎of the two good chieftains  ‎who had spied out the land
00:04:26 ‎that they wanted to kill them.
00:04:28 ‎They accepted the report ‎of the ten who had a negative report.
00:04:31 ‎And why did they do that?
00:04:33 ‎Again, lack of faith in Jehovah.
00:04:36 ‎But then when Jehovah told them ‎what was going to happen,
00:04:40 ‎the punishment  ‎that was going to come on them,
00:04:42 ‎what did they do?
00:04:44 ‎They went straight ahead  ‎and decided to go into the Promised Land.
00:04:47 ‎And what happened?
00:04:49 ‎You see, it was an act of stupidity.
00:04:51 ‎They were going on their own,
00:04:53 ‎and Jehovah  ‎wasn’t going to give them support,
00:04:56 ‎and that’s exactly what happened.
00:04:57 ‎They were defeated.
00:04:59 ‎So we see  ‎this is a very interesting example
00:05:02 ‎for us to understand the difference
00:05:05 ‎between the wrong way ‎and the right way
00:05:07 ‎of putting Jehovah to the test.
00:05:09 ‎And, more important,  ‎we need to remember
00:05:13 ‎how Jehovah feels
00:05:15 ‎when we put him to the test in the wrong way.
00:05:18 ‎We can see this  ‎if we turn to the book of Psalms,
00:05:21 ‎Psalm 78:40, 41:
00:05:27 ‎“How often they rebelled against him
00:05:30 ‎“in the wilderness  ‎and made him feel hurt in the desert!
00:05:34 ‎“Again and again  ‎they put God to the test,
00:05:37 ‎and they grieved  ‎the Holy One of Israel.”
00:05:41 ‎Yes, by their lack of faith ‎and by doing things
00:05:46 ‎that we could say  ‎irritated or disappointed Jehovah,
00:05:50 ‎they grieved Jehovah.
00:05:52 ‎So this is  ‎a very important matter for us:
00:05:54 ‎to realize the difference ‎between the right and wrong way
00:05:57 ‎of putting Jehovah to the test.
00:06:00 ‎With regard to this,
00:06:02 ‎what sort of things  ‎do we need to avoid?
00:06:04 ‎Well, we need to avoid dictating, ‎or demanding,
00:06:07 ‎that Jehovah do  ‎certain special things for us.
00:06:11 ‎We need to avoid  ‎complaining to him
00:06:14 ‎about our expectations.
00:06:17 ‎We need to avoid  ‎taking unnecessary risks and chances.
00:06:22 ‎And that’s why we have  ‎a very important group of brothers
00:06:25 ‎that help to remind us about safety.
00:06:28 ‎We do need to remember  ‎safety standards.
00:06:31 ‎Now, some perhaps do not realize
00:06:34 ‎the difference between faith and stupidity,
00:06:36 ‎and they may have the viewpoint,
00:06:38 ‎‘Well, Jehovah will look after me  ‎if I’m doing whatever I’m doing.’
00:06:42 ‎But notice what the Awake! magazine ‎said back in 1953.
00:06:47 ‎It was in the article entitled  ‎“You Must Not Put God to the Test.”
00:06:52 ‎And this is what it says:
00:06:54 ‎“It really amounts  ‎to considering ourselves very important
00:06:58 ‎“when we act as though  ‎nothing could happen to us
00:07:02 ‎“because we are serving Jehovah. . . .
00:07:04 ‎“We dare not put God to the test
00:07:07 ‎“with irrational actions and carelessness.
00:07:11 ‎“We simply cannot expect God
00:07:13 ‎“to furnish us angels  ‎to keep us from harm and accident
00:07:17 ‎in spite of what we may or may not do.”
00:07:22 ‎Well, that’s a good reminder ‎for all of us, isn’t it?
00:07:24 ‎I know, as a missionary,
00:07:26 ‎this was a lesson  ‎I had to learn over the years
00:07:29 ‎—the difference  ‎between faith and stupidity.
00:07:32 ‎When I look back on the first few years
00:07:35 ‎I was in my missionary assignment
00:07:37 ‎and some of the scary things we did
00:07:39 ‎—jumping off ships into little boats  ‎in the open sea without life jackets—
00:07:44 ‎at the time,  ‎I thought it was an act of faith,
00:07:48 ‎but now I view it a little differently.
00:07:51 ‎So we do need to be careful  ‎to measure what we’re doing
00:07:55 ‎and see if it really is an act of faith
00:07:58 ‎or if it’s just doing something stupid.
00:08:02 ‎Jesus showed great wisdom ‎in this regard, didn’t he?
00:08:06 ‎When he served Jehovah ‎here on earth,
00:08:10 ‎no doubt many times  ‎his life was endangered
00:08:14 ‎because the Pharisees  ‎and the Sadducees opposed him.
00:08:17 ‎They were looking  ‎for ways to kill him.
00:08:19 ‎But because he was serving Jehovah ‎and doing what Jehovah wanted,
00:08:22 ‎he had trust in Jehovah
00:08:24 ‎that he wouldn’t be killed ‎before the due time.
00:08:28 ‎But on the other hand,  ‎when Satan tempted him
00:08:32 ‎in a way to boldly show off
00:08:35 ‎and jump off the temple,
00:08:38 ‎what did Jesus say?
00:08:40 ‎‘You mustn’t test Jehovah.’
00:08:42 ‎You see, Jesus realized that ‎that would have been an act of stupidity.
00:08:47 ‎So for us today, it’s likewise important
00:08:50 ‎when we’re making decisions
00:08:52 ‎to balance out very carefully
00:08:54 ‎what Jehovah wants us to do.
00:08:56 ‎Yes, when Jehovah  ‎makes a promise and says,
00:08:59 ‎‘If you put the Kingdom first
00:09:01 ‎and you do  ‎what I want you to do, I will bless you’
00:09:04 ‎and then we reach out and we do that,
00:09:07 ‎we can be confident  ‎that Jehovah will ultimately bless us.
00:09:11 ‎But never may we ever  ‎take the viewpoint
00:09:15 ‎that we will just put ‎Jehovah to the test
00:09:17 ‎by taking chances  ‎and doing rash things.
00:09:21 ‎Yes, whenever we make a decision,
00:09:23 ‎let’s stop and prayerfully consider,
00:09:26 ‎Is this an act of faith or stupidity?

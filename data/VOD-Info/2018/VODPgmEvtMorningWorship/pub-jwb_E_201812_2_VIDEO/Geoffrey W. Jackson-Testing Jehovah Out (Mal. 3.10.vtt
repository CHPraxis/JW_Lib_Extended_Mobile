‎The scripture that we’re considering this morning

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎raises a very interesting question,

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and that is,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎How is it that we can ‘test Jehovah out’?

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Didn’t Jesus say that we shouldn’t test Jehovah?

00:00:15.832 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, the simple answer to that question

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was given 
‎in The Watchtower back in 1957.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It simply stated: 
‎“There is a wrong way

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and a right way 
‎to put Jehovah to the test.”

00:00:28.878 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, how do we know
‎what is the right way

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and what is the wrong way?

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:36.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, again, put simply,

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it means knowing the difference 
‎between faith and stupidity.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we consider 
‎what the Scriptures tell us,

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it helps us to see the line

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that is the demarcation 
‎between faith and stupidity.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Consider, first of all, the good way

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:56.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that we can test out Jehovah.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we think about 
‎showing faith in Jehovah,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎having trust in him, 
‎and then obeying him

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—not waiting for Jehovah
‎to make the first move

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but rather for us,
‎first of all, to obey him,

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to reach out 
‎and do what he wants us to do

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—that, in a figurative way,
‎is putting him to the test,

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because he’s already promised to bless us.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎By us obeying him, 
‎it means that we are showing faith.

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:26.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It also means that we 
‎don’t complain about the things

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:28.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Jehovah 
‎allows to occur in our life,

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we don’t take unnecessary risks.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We don’t try to fool him

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:36.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by acting one way

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but then pretending to be another way.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So put quite simply, again,

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the right way for us to test out Jehovah

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎means to trust him,

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to have faith in him,

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to obey him

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:53.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even if it may be difficult to do so.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, what about the wrong way
‎to test out Jehovah? 

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, if we were to selfishly complain

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:06.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about the things 
‎that Jehovah allows to occur in our life

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or if we were to do

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎something stupid, 
‎something careless,

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and expect that Jehovah 
‎is going to perform a miracle to save us

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or perhaps 
‎we keep pushing Jehovah

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:24.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to do something
‎that really is not in harmony with his will

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:27.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or if we try to fool him

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by pretending to serve him

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but actually are doing things
‎that displease him,

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all of those things really would be
‎a stupid act on our part.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, what do we really need to consider
‎with regard to this? 

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, let’s think about when Jesus
‎made that answer to Satan 

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:47.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and said,
‎‘You shouldn’t put Jehovah to the test.’

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:51.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Let’s have a look at the scripture 
‎that he based that comment on. 

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s found at Deuteronomy 6:16,

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and this gives us 
‎a little context to the meaning.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In verse 16, it says:

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“You must not 
‎put Jehovah your God to the test

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the way you put him 
‎to the test at Massah.”

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, really, what was it

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that the Israelites did
‎at this particular time

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where the name of the location

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where they were 
‎meant “Testing” or “Trial”?

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, if we turn back to Exodus 17:7,

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:27.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it gives us some idea 
‎of what this really involved.

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Exodus 17:7:

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“So he named the place
‎Massah and Meribah

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“because of the quarreling of the Israelites

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:39.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and because they put Jehovah to the test

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:44.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by saying: 
‎‘Is Jehovah in our midst or not?’”

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So, what did the Israelites do here?

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Obviously, they didn’t trust Jehovah enough.

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They didn’t have enough 
‎faith in Jehovah to realize

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that he wasn’t going 
‎to let them all die in the wilderness.

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:00.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But they pushed him.

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:02.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They wanted something immediately.

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They wanted to satisfy their selfish desires.

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, that’s a very good lesson for us
‎—isn’t it?—

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because this shows a lack of faith.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We could consider 
‎when the Israelites decided

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they didn’t want to go
‎into the Promised Land. 

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Remember, 
‎they were so upset with the report

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:26.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the two good chieftains 
‎who had spied out the land

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that they wanted to kill them.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They accepted the report
‎of the ten who had a negative report.

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:33.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And why did they do that?

00:04:33.823 --> 00:04:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Again, lack of faith in Jehovah.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:40.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But then when Jehovah told them
‎what was going to happen,

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the punishment 
‎that was going to come on them,

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what did they do?

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They went straight ahead 
‎and decided to go into the Promised Land.

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:49.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And what happened?

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:51.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You see, it was an act of stupidity.

00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:53.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were going on their own,

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Jehovah 
‎wasn’t going to give them support,

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and that’s exactly what happened.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were defeated.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So we see 
‎this is a very interesting example

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for us to understand the difference

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎between the wrong way
‎and the right way

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of putting Jehovah to the test.

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, more important, 
‎we need to remember

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how Jehovah feels

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:18.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when we put him to the test in the wrong way.

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:21.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We can see this 
‎if we turn to the book of Psalms,

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Psalm 78:40, 41:

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“How often they rebelled against him

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“in the wilderness 
‎and made him feel hurt in the desert!

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:37.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Again and again 
‎they put God to the test,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they grieved 
‎the Holy One of Israel.”

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, by their lack of faith
‎and by doing things

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that we could say 
‎irritated or disappointed Jehovah,

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:52.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they grieved Jehovah.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:54.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So this is 
‎a very important matter for us:

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to realize the difference
‎between the right and wrong way

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of putting Jehovah to the test.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎With regard to this,

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what sort of things 
‎do we need to avoid?

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, we need to avoid dictating,
‎or demanding,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that Jehovah do 
‎certain special things for us.

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We need to avoid 
‎complaining to him

00:06:14.557 --> 00:06:17.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about our expectations.

00:06:17.427 --> 00:06:22.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We need to avoid 
‎taking unnecessary risks and chances.

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And that’s why we have 
‎a very important group of brothers

00:06:25.902 --> 00:06:28.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that help to remind us about safety.

00:06:28.438 --> 00:06:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We do need to remember 
‎safety standards.

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:34.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, some perhaps do not realize

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:36.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the difference between faith and stupidity,

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they may have the viewpoint,

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘Well, Jehovah will look after me 
‎if I’m doing whatever I’m doing.’

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:47.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But notice what the Awake! magazine
‎said back in 1953. 

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It was in the article entitled 
‎“You Must Not Put God to the Test.”

00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:54.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And this is what it says:

00:06:54.163 --> 00:06:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“It really amounts 
‎to considering ourselves very important

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“when we act as though 
‎nothing could happen to us

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“because we are serving Jehovah. . . .

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“We dare not put God to the test

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:11.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“with irrational actions and carelessness.

00:07:11.114 --> 00:07:13.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“We simply cannot expect God

00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“to furnish us angels

‎in spite of what we may or may not do.”

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, that’s a good reminder
‎for all of us, isn’t it? 

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:26.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I know, as a missionary,

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎this was a lesson 
‎I had to learn over the years

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—the difference 
‎between faith and stupidity.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When I look back on the first few years

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was in my missionary assignment

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:39.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and some of the scary things we did

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:44.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—jumping off ships into little boats 
‎in the open sea without life jackets—

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at the time, 
‎I thought it was an act of faith,

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but now I view it a little differently.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So we do need to be careful 
‎to measure what we’re doing

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and see if it really is an act of faith

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or if it’s just doing something stupid.

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jesus showed great wisdom
‎in this regard, didn’t he? 

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When he served Jehovah
‎here on earth,

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎no doubt many times 
‎his life was endangered

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because the Pharisees 
‎and the Sadducees opposed him.

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:19.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They were looking 
‎for ways to kill him.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:22.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But because he was serving Jehovah
‎and doing what Jehovah wanted,

00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:24.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he had trust in Jehovah

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that he wouldn’t be killed
‎before the due time. 

00:08:28.724 --> 00:08:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But on the other hand, 
‎when Satan tempted him

00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in a way to boldly show off

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:38.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and jump off the temple,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what did Jesus say?

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘You mustn’t test Jehovah.’

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You see, Jesus realized that
‎that would have been an act of stupidity.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So for us today, it’s likewise important

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when we’re making decisions

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to balance out very carefully

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what Jehovah wants us to do.

00:08:56.852 --> 00:08:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, when Jehovah 
‎makes a promise and says,

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘If you put the Kingdom first

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and you do 
‎what I want you to do, I will bless you’

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:07.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and then we reach out and we do that,

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we can be confident 
‎that Jehovah will ultimately bless us.

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But never may we ever 
‎take the viewpoint

00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that we will just put
‎Jehovah to the test

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎by taking chances 
‎and doing rash things.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, whenever we make a decision,

00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎let’s stop and prayerfully consider,

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:29.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Is this an act of faith or stupidity?

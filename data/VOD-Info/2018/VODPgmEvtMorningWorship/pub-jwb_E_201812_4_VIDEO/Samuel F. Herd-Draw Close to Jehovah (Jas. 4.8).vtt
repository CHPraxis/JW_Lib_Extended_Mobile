‎Have you ever heard

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎a brother pray to Jehovah

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:07.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and it just sort of touches your heart

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎—the words he uses

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and his mannerisms and so forth?

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:14.230 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎And you may say to yourself,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎‘Well, I wish I could talk to Jehovah like that.’

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, maybe the way you talk to Jehovah

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is not like that.

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:29.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You may not have 
‎all those words to use, and so forth,

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎due to a lack of education

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when it comes 
‎to the English language, and so forth,

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but what you do have is in your heart.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And when you pour your heart out to Jehovah,

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he hears you and he blesses you

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎just like he would bless 
‎the one who has all the words

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:51.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the good mannerisms, and so forth.

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So don’t worry about it.

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Just pray to Jehovah from your heart.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s not the words that he’s that interested in;

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it’s what comes out of the heart.

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So, no doubt, 
‎you are just as close to Jehovah

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as that one that you admire.

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:12.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And there’s certainly nothing wrong

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:16.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with admiring a brother 
‎who has that ability, or a sister.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But don’t worry about it;

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that is not the main thing that Jehovah looks at.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Your approach has to come from the heart,

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:33.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and if it does, it pleases Jehovah.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Notice something 
‎here in the Bible at 1 Samuel 16:7.

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:45.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It says:
‎“But Jehovah said to Samuel:

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘Do not pay attention 
‎to his appearance and how tall he is,

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘for I have rejected him.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘For the way man sees 
‎  is not the way God sees,

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“‘because mere man sees
‎   what appears to the eyes,

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:07.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s a beautiful scripture,

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:13.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and it is one that humbles us before Jehovah.

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We’re glad that he looks at our heart,

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:18.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we certainly want him to do that.

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I’d like to tell you about something.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It has to do with a brother, an older brother,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎years ago in one of the circuits I had.

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:33.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And we were at the dinner table.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎His wife wasn’t in the truth, 
‎but she prepared a fine meal for us.

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:41.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He was a fine brother
‎—elder in the congregation.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And it got around to:

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“What did you do before you got the truth?

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:49.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What kind of work did you do?”
‎and so forth. 

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And he said,

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“I was a professional brother who prayed.”

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He said, “The preachers in our town hired me

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to go to their churches on Sunday and pray.”

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He said: 
‎“I had the ability to use right words.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“And my deep voice and mannerism

00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“just caused them 
‎to reach deep into their billfolds

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and pocketbooks and give money.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“So afterward, the preachers 
‎would divvy it up and pay me off.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“So I made quite a bit of money that way

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—‘professional prayer.’”

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, of course, he got the truth,

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he learned that that business was no good,

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but he still could pray and reach the heart.

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:54.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And that’s what prayer is all about, isn’t it?

00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:58.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our text today 
‎deals with drawing close to Jehovah.

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And one of the main ways that we 
‎draw close to Jehovah is through prayer.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Whether we’re on our knees

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:09.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or standing or lying down, it matters not.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Jehovah still hears.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Silent prayers he hears.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We can pray as we’re driving the automobile

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:17.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or doing anything else,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he hears our prayers

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎if they come out of the heart.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, of course, 
‎we have to pray in the right way.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Years ago, we had a program
‎out in the traveling work

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎called “New Things Learned.” 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, we changed that later on
‎to “Continue in the Things That You Learned.”

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But at this particular time, 
‎it was “New Things Learned.” 

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And I was a circuit overseer,

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so I had the program on a Saturday evening

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—“New Things Learned.” 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:48.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎One of my questions was,

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:52.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“When you pray to Jehovah,

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:56.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“do you go through Jesus at the beginning

00:04:56.212 --> 00:05:00.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“or during your prayer or at the end,

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:02.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or does it matter?”

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, we got all kinds of answers.

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:06.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I tell you the truth.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You wouldn’t believe it if you were there

00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—all kinds of answers!

00:05:10.693 --> 00:05:14.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So anyway, we finally gave them
‎the correct answer, and so forth. 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎At the end of the meeting,

00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I called on an older brother 
‎(very fine brother in the truth) to pray.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And he prayed to Jesus.

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I said, 
‎“Brother, why did you pray to Jesus?”

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He said: 
‎“I didn’t know who to pray to.

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was so confused.”

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So Gloria, my wife, said,

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:43.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Please, don’t use that 
‎on the ‘New Things Learned’ anymore.”

00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But that was truly a new thing learned.

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎‘We just hope you unlearned it, congregation.’

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Anyway, we feel that 
‎that prayer was heard by Jehovah.

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He takes into consideration who we are,

00:05:57.206 --> 00:06:00.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎what we have to give, 
‎and how we can do it, and so forth.

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But we wouldn’t practice a thing like that.

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We wouldn’t deliberately ignore him
‎and pray to Jesus; that’s for sure. 

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But prayer is necessary.

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We’re really not qualified to judge

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎whether the prayers of our brothers

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are received favorably by Jehovah or not.

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some words come 
‎from the brain and out of the mouth,

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎while others come 
‎from the heart and out of the mouth.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We ask ourselves,
‎‘Am I speaking to Jehovah from my heart

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:38.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or only from my brain?’

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:42.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we speak to Jehovah,
‎we want to use truthful words

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that come from the heart

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—words “seasoned with salt,”
‎the Bible tells us,

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“gracious,”

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎words that are in good taste,

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎respectful,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and wholesome.

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:59.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Job’s short prayer came from the heart

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎at Job 1:21

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—just a real short prayer—

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but Jehovah heard it.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, of course, 
‎he was with Job all the way. 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎If he hadn’t been with Job,

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Job would have had a hard time,
‎wouldn’t he, worse than he had?

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But here’s his prayer.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He said: 
‎“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb,

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:21.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“and naked I will return.

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Jehovah has given, 
‎and Jehovah has taken away.

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Let the name of Jehovah

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎continue to be praised.”

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Beautiful, isn’t it?

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Solomon also gave 
‎a beautiful prayer at 1 Kings 3:6-10.

00:07:36.739 --> 00:07:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We won’t read that; it’s lengthy.

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When we need help,

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:47.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎talk to Jehovah from your heart like Asa did.

00:07:47.316 --> 00:07:49.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And at the very end,

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎when Asa asked Jehovah to help him

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because they had a million people against them

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—they were warriors, 
‎and he had a small group—

00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:02.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎well, Jehovah blessed that prayer.

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Asa drew close to Jehovah,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Jehovah drew close to Asa

00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:11.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎so much so that he defeated the Ethiopians

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎before Asa and before Judah,
‎and the Ethiopians fled.

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They ran away.

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Why? 

00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, Asa drew close to Jehovah
‎—that’s why.

00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And, of course, 
‎we want to draw close to Jehovah.

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:28.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Another way that we draw close to Jehovah

00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is through meditation.

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We want to think about what we pray.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:40.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They say a sheep 
‎has four compartments in his stomach.

00:08:40.236 --> 00:08:43.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So it takes a long time, 
‎sometimes two days or longer,

00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to digest his food.

00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, some things 
‎that we take in, too, are hard to digest. 

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It takes awhile,
‎and we digest it basically through meditation.

00:08:54.283 --> 00:08:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We have to think about it over and over again.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Sometimes we even have to ask others:

00:08:59.388 --> 00:09:02.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“How do you feel about this?
‎ How did you understand it?

00:09:02.725 --> 00:09:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What did it do for you?”
‎and so forth. 

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And they’ll help us.

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:11.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So prayer and meditation
‎—these are the two key things

00:09:11.067 --> 00:09:13.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that we will want to think about

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as we endeavor to draw close to Jehovah.

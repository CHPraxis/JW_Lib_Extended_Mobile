00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.454 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the words of today’s text

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.257 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎may have reminded you of the admonition

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:10.060 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at 1 Corinthians 6:18,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.062 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where Paul wrote:

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:15.165 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Flee from sexual immorality!”

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.835 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or perhaps the words 
at 2 Timothy 2:22, 

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:21.771 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where he wrote to Timothy:

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:25.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Flee from youthful desires.” 

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In today’s text,

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a father is counseling his son

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and encouraging him to stay away

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:37.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from sexual immorality. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In Proverbs chapter 7, 
the counsel is strengthened

00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by means of an experience. 

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The king describes a scene

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he personally witnessed,

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we read about it 
in Proverbs chapter 7, 

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.669 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beginning in verse 6. 

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:54.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So why don’t we turn there together? 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At Proverbs 7:6,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can imagine a father

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎encouraging a son

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:10.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he relates this experience:

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.589 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“From the window of my house,

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“through my lattice, I looked down,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and as I observed the naive ones

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[or as the footnote says,
the “inexperienced” ones

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“—like you, son,
the inexperienced ones],

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I discerned among the youths a young man

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“lacking good sense

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎[or, “in want of heart,” ftn.].”

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, that’s the first strike

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎against the young man, isn’t it? 

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’s young and, as a result, 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he’s inexperienced
—the two go together.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.693 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the father proceeds to describe 

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what he observed
and the progression of events

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that led to a tragic outcome
for the young man. 

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:01.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So it says in verse 8

00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:05.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the young man 
“passed along the street near her corner.”

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, the “her”

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.814 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is a prostitute. 

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:13.216 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What is he doing in the neighborhood? 

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we’re told that “he marched

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:20.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the direction of her house.” 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.827 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The word “march”

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎implies a sense of confidence, doesn’t it? 

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Isn’t it interesting

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:33.102 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that a young person is often confident

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:36.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even in risky situations? 

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why? 

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:41.144 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because a young person lacks experience

00:02:41.144 --> 00:02:43.713 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and can’t always foresee

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the implications of a situation

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or the outcome. 

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Another factor is highlighted in verse 9:

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In the twilight, in the evening, 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.530 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at the approach of night and darkness.” 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.766 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So now we have inexperience;

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we have a bad neighborhood;

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.642 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we have a young man who is confident,

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who evidently has no intention 
of committing immorality 

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:21.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and may even feel
that he’s in control of the circumstances; 

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it’s nighttime. 

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, I know as a young man where I grew up,

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎everybody knew there were certain places,

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:35.531 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or parts of town,
where you didn’t go after dark 

00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it was a recipe for disaster.

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:43.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In verse 10, the inevitable happens. 

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The young man 
is confronted by a prostitute,

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and rather than turning around

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and leaving the situation,

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he engages with her in conversation. 

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:02.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And in verse 22,

00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we read the result

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the culmination—
of this progression 

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:10.533 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of ingredients: 

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Suddenly he goes after her,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“like a bull to the slaughter,

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:19.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎like a fool to be punished in the stocks.” 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what do we learn

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from this word “suddenly”? 

00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, simply this:

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In any situation, we can cross a line

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where we no longer control 
the circumstances;

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rather, the circumstances control us. 

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:41.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And isn’t that what happened 
to the young man? 

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He put himself in a situation

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—going down a path

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that eventuated, or culminated, 

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:54.644 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in his committing sexual immorality.

00:04:54.644 --> 00:04:57.613 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the seriousness of the matter 

00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:01.584 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is highlighted 
in the “b” portion of verse 23, 

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where it says: 
“It will cost him his life.” 

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So there’s a ripple effect. 

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:11.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Certainly, his relationship 
with Jehovah was damaged. 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His relationship 
with his family would be affected. 

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And there are even physical factors

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—illnesses that can result

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from sexual immorality. 

00:05:24.273 --> 00:05:28.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, note in verse 26,

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:32.749 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the father says:
“She has caused many to fall down slain,

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and those she has killed are numerous.” 

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And as our Watchtower 
recently made the point,

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:44.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎thousands are disfellowshipped every year

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:46.729 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from Jehovah’s family

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because of sexual immorality. 

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.303 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, a question 
that Brother Kittle addressed,

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:56.606 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is it only the inexperienced

00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:00.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that fall victim to this sad progression? 

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.478 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, let’s look at an illustration that appeared

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Watchtower article. 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.250 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll probably remember this illustration. 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And here we see two married couples 

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:13.222 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎having supper together,

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a seemingly innocent situation. 

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what are the two folks sitting closest

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the camera doing? 

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They’re flirting, aren’t they? 

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You see the sister twirling 
her hair with her finger,

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the brother is saying,

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in essence, ‘I only have eyes for you.’ 

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:43.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And you can see wedding rings on all four

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:45.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of those individuals’ hands. 

00:06:45.688 --> 00:06:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s a start down a slippery slope, isn’t it? 

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.028 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And as portrayed in The Watchtower, 

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:56.199 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this couple 
would later accidentally “on purpose” bump

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.035 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into each other 
in the parking lot of the Kingdom Hall

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎after an evening meeting,

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:03.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎engage in conversation,

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that progressed to texting. 

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:10.146 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, the good news is,
as depicted in The Watchtower,

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:12.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎these folks realized 

00:07:12.315 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that they were headed 
down a dangerous path

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and took steps to correct it. 

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:19.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But wouldn’t it have been better

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if they hadn’t gone 
down the road to begin with? 

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:25.094 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s a good reminder for all of us,

00:07:25.094 --> 00:07:29.265 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎whatever our age or circumstance.

00:07:29.265 --> 00:07:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Here at Bethel, 
we interact with ones of the opposite sex

00:07:33.836 --> 00:07:37.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and many of us are married,

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:40.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but many are not. 

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But as we were reminded,

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we want to make sure our conduct is chaste 

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and pleasing to Jehovah. 

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:52.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The same holds true at the Kingdom Hall

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and in our use of the Internet

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and in our choice of entertainment. 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We don’t want to start down a path

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:06.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that could take us away from Jehovah. 

00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:08.938 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’ll never forget a pioneer sister

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who used to counsel us young people

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the congregation, and we loved her. 

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:20.049 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But she had an expression 
that she would tell us,

00:08:20.049 --> 00:08:23.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If you’re not going to burn down the barn,

00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎don’t strike the match.” 

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what’s the point of her statement? 

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:32.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why start a progression of events

00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we know will lead 
to sadness and tragedy? 

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So we don’t even go there. 

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:43.105 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And even if we’re inexperienced, 
we can act wisely. 

00:08:43.105 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What did the psalmist say? 

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said: ‘How can a young man 
keep his path clean? 

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.115 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘By keeping on guard

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎according to Jehovah’s word.’ 

00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So Jehovah has given us everything we need

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to remain clean.

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So talk to Jehovah about it. 

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:07.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Be alert to identify and be determined

00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:11.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to avoid dangerous situations,

00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then we don’t have to experience 

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the sad outcome 
of the young man described

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Proverbs chapter 7. 

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:21.978 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Instead, we can succeed

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fleeing from sexual immorality.

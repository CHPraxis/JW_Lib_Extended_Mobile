00:00 “He does not go back on his promise.”
00:03 Now, those words say a lot
00:05 about a person, don’t they?
00:06 What Bible examples are there of those
00:09 who please Jehovah by keeping their promise?
00:12 And what is in store for those who do so,
00:14 even when it is bad for them?
00:18 Well, we know Jesus, of course,  is the foremost example
00:21 of one who kept his promise  to do Jehovah’s will.
00:24 But imperfect people too
00:26 have displayed loyalty  by keeping their promises.
00:30 For instance, in Joshua chapter 9,
00:34 we read that the Gibeonites  tricked the chieftains of Israel
00:38 into concluding  a covenant of peace with them.
00:42 Unwittingly, the Israelites  promised not to destroy Gibeon.
00:47 What makes this of special interest
00:49 is that those disguised men  were part of the Hivite nation,
00:54 which was considered  to be a threat to Israel.
00:57 At Joshua 10:2,
00:59 it says  that ‘all of Gibeon’s men were warriors.’
01:05 What happened when Israel learned the truth?
01:08 Joshua 9:18 tells us:
01:11 “The Israelites did not attack them,
01:14 “because the chieftains of the assembly
01:16 “had sworn an oath to them
01:19 by Jehovah the God of Israel.”
01:22 Did Jehovah approve  of their decision not to attack them?
01:26 Yes, he did, as events recorded
01:29 in Joshua chapter 10 go on to prove.
01:32 And we’ll come back to that in a few minutes.
01:35 In another example,  Mordecai urged Esther
01:38 to go in before King Ahasuerus
01:41 and plead for his favor  on behalf of the Jews.
01:44 Now, Esther knew  that going in unannounced
01:47 could mean her life.
01:49 Mordecai, however,  reasoned with her about the matter
01:52 and the importance of doing so,
01:55 and Esther gave him her word  that she would go in.
01:59 Please notice what she says
02:01 in Esther 4:16,
02:05 in the final part of that verse.
02:07 She’s really giving her word.
02:09 She says:  “I will go in to the king,
02:12 “which is against the law,
02:14 and if I am to perish, I will perish.”
02:19 Well, we know how it turned out  for Esther, Mordecai, and the Jews.
02:23 Esther kept her word,
02:25 and they were all blessed for it,  weren’t they?
02:28 Why did such ones live up to their word?
02:31 Because, among other things,  they had qualities,
02:33 such as faith, loyalty,  and love for Jehovah and for others.
02:38 The chieftains of Israel had faith  and viewed Jehovah as real
02:43 and were aware  of their promise to the Gibeonites.
02:47 Out of faith and loyalty,  they would not go back on their word.
02:52 Also, Esther was moved by love  to see the greater good
02:56 and to put her own life at risk  in order to help her people.
03:01 Now, going back to our second question,
03:03 What is in store for those  who keep their promises
03:06 even when it is bad for them?
03:09 Let’s look at the principle  found at Mark 4:24.
03:15 Now, here Jesus said in part:
03:21 “With the measure that you are measuring out,
03:23 “you will have it measured out to you,
03:26 yes, you will have more added to you.”
03:30 Well, what is the principle here?
03:33 As the context shows,
03:35 Jesus was speaking about a person
03:38 receiving information and enlightenment
03:42 by paying attention to his words.
03:45 But this thought of having “more added”
03:48 can be seen in many ways.
03:50 For example,  when we’re loyal to Jehovah,
03:54 he often blesses us  with more than we might expect.
03:58 At times, even a surprise.
04:00 Psalm 84:11 says of him:
04:03 “Jehovah will not hold back anything good
04:07 from those walking in integrity.”
04:10 Now, going back to what happened  with Israel and the Gibeonites,
04:14 we read in Joshua chapter 8
04:16 that in an earlier battle against Ai,
04:20 Jehovah helped Israel  with a strategy that led to victory.
04:24 But the account does not say
04:26 that He performed  astounding miracles in doing so.
04:30 On the other hand, in Joshua chapter 10,
04:34 we find something more.
04:37 After the Gibeonites  tricked the chieftains of Israel
04:40 into making that covenant of peace with them,
04:43 the Gibeonites were threatened  by an alliance of five kings of the Amorites.
04:48 What would the Israelites do?
04:50 Well, as we know, they kept their promise
04:53 and went out to defend the Gibeonites.
04:56 In verse 7 of chapter 10,
04:59 we read that Joshua  and all his fighting men went out to do this,
05:04 and as they kept their word,  Jehovah blessed them.
05:08 In verse 8, he said to them:  “Do not be afraid . . .
05:11 Not one of them  will be able to stand against you.”
05:16 Well, Jehovah was pleased  with their decision, wasn’t he?
05:19 He showed his approval in a marvelous way.
05:22 Giant hailstones  dropped down on their enemies,
05:26 and even the sun  remained motionless in the sky
05:30 for about a whole day.
05:32 Chapter 10 and verse 14 says:
05:35 “There has never been a day like that one,
05:38 “either before it or after it,
05:40 “when Jehovah listened to the voice of a man,
05:43 for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.”
05:47 Yes, Jehovah really loved the Israelites,
05:49 didn’t he —for keeping their promise?
05:51 And when the Israelites went to war  for Gibeon, He supported them.
05:55 Or as they say, “He poured it on.”
05:58 Have you ever sensed  Jehovah doing that for you
06:01 when you stick to a difficult task,  to a promise?
06:05 Isn’t it true that when we do so,
06:07 we often look back and see blessings  that we never anticipated?
06:12 Among other things,  we might be surprised
06:14 at how our faith has grown,
06:16 how our love has deepened,
06:19 and how things that we  may have once viewed as overwhelming
06:24 are now manageable.
06:26 One Bethelite who endured in his assignment
06:29 in spite of the loss of his mother said this
06:32 —he also included  some mistreatment by others—
06:35 he said:  “Sometimes we go through something
06:38 “we’ve never experienced before,
06:40 “and we may not understand why Jehovah
06:42 “does not do a specific thing we request.
06:45 “But when we endure, we see,
06:48 “one, his greater comprehension  of the overall situation
06:53 “and, two, his desire for us to rely on him
06:57 “and know that he’s there for us,
06:59 “and that we’ve not lost his favor
07:02 “when we experience  a difficult time in our life.
07:05 “As Jehovah helps us,
07:07 “we have to do as Genesis 24:21 says
07:10 and ‘stare in amazement’  as he answers our prayers.”
07:16 Well, that’s a beautiful thought.
07:18 And so the blessings may take a while,
07:20 but we can trust that Jehovah  will be there to help us
07:24 at the right time.
07:26 That happened with Job.
07:28 He once said: “Until I die,  I will not renounce my integrity!”
07:33 And he lived up to those words, didn’t he?
07:35 So much so that after enduring  great sorrow and suffering
07:39 he was able to say:
07:41 “My ears have heard about you,
07:43 but now I do see you with my eyes.”
07:47 Yes, Job’s faith grew.
07:49 And, as we know,  Jehovah eventually restored Job’s health,
07:53 doubled his wealth,  and blessed him with a beautiful family.
07:58 We benefit from such Bible accounts.
08:01 Like Jehovah’s servants in the past,
08:04 we may suffer from persecution,
08:06 injustice, disasters, grief,
08:10 disappointments, or serious illness.
08:13 In addition,  we may have to work hard
08:16 to fulfill our promise  to be a good husband, wife,
08:20 or a friend in time of need.
08:22 The list is long.
08:24 And despite the difficulties  or even the pain at times, we can do it.
08:29 We can imitate the faith  of past and present examples
08:33 and live up to our promises
08:36 —including, of course,  our dedication vow to Jehovah.
08:41 Since Jehovah often does more  for us than we might expect,
08:45 we’re confident  that what he holds out for our future
08:50 is greater than we can now imagine.
08:52 As Psalm 31:19 says of Jehovah:
08:56 “How abundant your goodness is!
08:59 You have stored it up  for those who fear you.”

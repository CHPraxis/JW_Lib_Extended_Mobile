00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:03.720 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Scripture text is Matthew 10:16. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We invite you to open to Matthew chapter 10. 

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:11.494 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’ll take a look at our text in the context. 

00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:14.130 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, if you notice, in the first few verses,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the 12 apostles are listed. 

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But look at verse 5:

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“These 12 Jesus sent out, 
giving them these instructions.” 

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:25.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the instructions, as you’ll see,

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:29.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎included that they 
initially just go to the house of Israel. 

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you look at verse 7, it says:

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Preach the Kingdom of the heavens.’ 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 8 says:

00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Cure people;
raise some dead ones; expel demons.’ 

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:41.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then if you look at verses 9 and 10,

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:45.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it tells them how their ministry 
is going to be financed

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:47.764 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—primarily by contributions. 

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then in verses 11-14,
he tells them about their territory.

00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:54.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He alludes to the door-to-door,
or house-to-house work,

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.440 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how to follow up on interest,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how to handle rejection.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But now we come to verse 16,

00:01:03.313 --> 00:01:08.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it’s a continuation 
of this meeting for service.

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And now Jesus tells them something

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that might be a little more intimidating

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when they think about their upcoming role. 

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so let’s read verse 16 in its entirety:

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Look! I am sending you out
as sheep among wolves;

00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“so prove yourselves cautious as serpents

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and yet innocent as doves.”

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:33.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that was Jesus’ introduction

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:36.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the following circumstances.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.181 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at verse 17. 

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘You’ll be handed over to courts and scourged’

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:43.987 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and, verse 18,
“brought before governors and kings”

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:45.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for being Christians. 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, that was a lot for the apostles to absorb. 

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And we can just imagine them 
looking at each other nervously,

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.466 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎maybe some anxiety playing on their faces. 

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His followers, though,

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:02.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎came to understand 
what Jesus meant in verse 16. 

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He used four different animal types. 

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.144 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said:

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I am sending you 
out as sheep among wolves.” 

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:14.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, they would have immediately understood 
that illustration. 

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That was used in the Hebrew Scriptures. 

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:20.790 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Psalm 100:3 says:

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“We are his people 
and the sheep of his pasture.” 

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They understood. 

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:28.031 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And they would have understood 
the analogy of wolves;

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they knew wolves 
were vicious predators on sheep. 

00:02:31.034 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they got the picture: 
We’re not going to be well-received by all. 

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:40.844 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was Jesus’ way 
of warning them of potential trouble.

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:45.849 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what about this other analogy 
of serpents and doves? 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You know, being described as a snake

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:53.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was not complimentary 
back then, nor is it today. 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So why did Jesus say that? 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You know, probably the reason
why it’s not complimentary

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:01.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is “the original serpent[’s]” reputation

00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he wreaked havoc on the human race. 

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But our text says: ‘Be like serpents.’ 

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:10.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what way? 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Remember, Genesis described the serpent

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as ‘the most cautious 
of all the animals Jehovah had made.’ 

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.717 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That natural characteristic

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:23.686 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is what Jesus 
was highlighting for his followers. 

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They were to be cautious in the ministry,

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎particularly when facing opposition.

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, are snakes really cautious? 

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:36.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You know, many of us 
don’t even like to look at a snake,

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎let alone carefully study 
its personality characteristics. 

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I’m going to quote a British zoologist. 

00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said that even when attacking an enemy,

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a serpent is cautious. 

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It tries to make sure that its strike

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:58.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is going to be accurate and deadly. 

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:01.691 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so the zoologist said that often they’ll make

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎several lunges toward the enemy,

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and yet they fall short on purpose. 

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.402 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And sometimes when they make their lunge,
they don’t even open their mouth. 

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why? 

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because it’s just practicing. 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s being cautious. 

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the same zoologist said 
that oftentimes, at this point,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can see the snake 
sometimes carefully uncoiling itself,

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎being ready for a hasty departure

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if the enemy is too aggressive in return. 

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:36.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The snake is being cautious. 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And remember, Jesus was involved 
in the creation of the serpent,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.033 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so he would have well-known 
this cautious nature. 

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:48.972 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s what he said his followers 
should try to include in their personality

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—exercising caution—

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎particularly when facing wolflike opposition.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, how did Jesus 
balance that characteristic

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by including the dove in the illustration? 

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, if we were all “serpent” and no “dove,”

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.625 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎then much of the warmth

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of sharing the good news would be lost,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so Jesus included the dove. 

00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what’s the natural characteristic of the dove? 

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, a dove is so soft 
and gentle in appearance;

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:25.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it has an appealing disposition. 

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, the dove is so gentle and appealing

00:05:27.877 --> 00:05:31.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that it has actually earned the description

00:05:31.514 --> 00:05:36.152 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of being the sheep of the bird world. 

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:38.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what an appropriate way

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for Jehovah to describe 
this other aspect of his followers!

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:44.360 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what’s the downside

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of being all lovey-dovey and no serpent?

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Insight says:
“Doves are quite trusting of humans

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and are rather easily entrapped
or snared with a net.”

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So Jesus added this to the equation:

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Be cautious as serpents.’ 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So in this way,
our gentle Christian personality

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:09.685 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will not be taken advantage of. 

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We will not easily be trapped or ensnared.

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We invite you to turn to Mark chapter 12. 

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:23.232 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, we know Jesus had dovelike qualities. 

00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:26.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He was gentle; he was kind; 
he was compassionate. 

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But was he ‘cautious as a serpent’? 

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, if you look in Mark chapter 12 
at the last sentence in verse 14:

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?” 

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:44.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, these proud Jewish religious Pharisees

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were trying to trap Jesus

00:06:47.023 --> 00:06:51.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and get him to say something 
against Roman nationalism. 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.431 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the direct answer to that question

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from an “innocent dove” would be,

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:03.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Yes, it’s proper to pay taxes to Rome.’ 

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But that would have been a volatile response

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as far as the Pharisees were concerned. 

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So notice how Jesus used caution
—‘cautious as a serpent.’ 

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.251 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In verses 15 to 17, the Pharisees asked:

00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Should we pay, or should we not pay?’ 

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Detecting their hypocrisy, he said to them:

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Why do you put me to the test?

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Bring me a denarius to look at.’ 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They brought one, and he said to them:

00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Whose image and inscription is this?’ 

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They said to him: ‘Caesar’s.’ 

00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Jesus then said:

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:43.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“but God’s things to God.’ 

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And they were amazed at him.” 

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They were amazed at him.” 

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, if he had innocently said,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Yes, pay the Romans the tax,’

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:54.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they would have been infuriated, 
not amazed.

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus diffused the situation by using caution.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what are some situations we might face

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:06.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where it would be prudent to exercise caution? 

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.838 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, one is our conversations. 

00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to avoid 
either praising or criticizing

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:17.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the policy of a political party or leader. 

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Following Jesus’ example 
and the comments of Romans chapter 13,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we are to be respectful 
of the superior authority

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:29.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even if it’s dishonest, corrupt, inept. 

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And one brother

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎(I won’t say which country 
he’s from, but he recently told me)

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:40.036 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎said,
“The greatest challenge to my neutrality

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is not saying something negative 
about the current government.” 

00:08:44.307 --> 00:08:46.442 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I think we understand. 

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, this is also true 
when speaking to refugees. 

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many countries have thousands 
of refugees pouring into their land

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because of opposition

00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:58.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from some regime or ethnic attacks. 

00:08:58.387 --> 00:09:01.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And these ones likely are seething in pain,

00:09:01.524 --> 00:09:05.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they want to talk 
about—besmirch—the regime

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that has pushed them out of the country.

00:09:07.597 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how can we 
share the good news ‘like a dove’

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:14.170 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and yet be “cautious as serpents”?

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:17.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we need to be patient ‘like a dove.’ 

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:21.978 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Listen to the refugee, 
and they will likely tell some of their horrors.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:25.248 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But now we need to be ‘cautious as a serpent’

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:29.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by avoiding getting involved in a discussion

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the political elements involved. 

00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:33.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Instead, 
follow the directions of the branch office,

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and share the good news in such a way

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so as not to put yourself or others at risk.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And when talking to refugees,

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it’s good to exercise caution

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.436 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when it comes to our clothing,

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎jewelry, and our grooming

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:53.075 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that we’re not offensive to their culture. 

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:55.211 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, in Myanmar,

00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:59.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if a woman’s clothing reveals,
or exposes, her shoulder,

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that’s viewed as quite offensive.

00:10:01.984 --> 00:10:04.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when we’re talking to refugees,

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we need to be mindful of customs like that.

00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, how about the media? 

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.963 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is there a need to be “cautious as serpents”? 

00:10:13.963 --> 00:10:15.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, you know, in some lands

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:19.669 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they have State-controlled news reports

00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that are blatantly slanted,

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:27.276 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and sometimes 
Jehovah’s Witnesses are slandered

00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:31.080 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or ridiculous charges 
are trumped up against them. 

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.317 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A “dove” could be ensnared by these reports

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and start to tremble. 

00:10:36.452 --> 00:10:38.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But because of this counsel from Jesus

00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:41.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to also be “cautious as serpents,”

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’re not easily duped. 

00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:47.263 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And how about even in a “free” country? 

00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:49.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What about the news media 
in a “free” country?

00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:52.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Christians need to be careful

00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:56.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not to adopt the bias 
of a particular news commentator. 

00:10:56.772 --> 00:10:58.774 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Instead of getting involved

00:10:58.774 --> 00:11:03.112 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the political leanings 
of that news broadcast,

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:08.117 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we should remember 
the words of Paul at 2 Timothy 1:13. 

00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At 2 Timothy 1:13, he said:

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Keep holding 
to the standard of wholesome words . . .

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“with the faith and love

00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:23.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that result from union with Christ Jesus.” 

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:25.868 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So in harmony with our text today,

00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if we’re in “union with Christ Jesus,”

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎then we need to prove ourselves

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“cautious as serpents” but “innocent as doves.”

00:01.952 --> 00:03.954
This morning I’d like you to imagine 


00:03.953 --> 00:04.953
for a few moments 


00:04.953 --> 00:06.990
that you’ve been asked to write 


00:06.990 --> 00:09.692
your life story for The Watchtower. 


00:09.692 --> 00:11.895
Well, once you get over the shock, 


00:11.895 --> 00:14.297
how would you go about doing that? 


00:14.297 --> 00:18.902
You’ve probably noticed with many 
of the life experiences in The Watchtower, 


00:18.902 --> 00:21.237
usually the first paragraph, 


00:21.237 --> 00:25.675
have a defining moment in that person’s life. 


00:25.675 --> 00:30.580
For example, Brother Eric Beveridge, 
who serves with us here in the United States, 


00:30.580 --> 00:32.815
he started off this way: 


00:32.815 --> 00:36.452
“‘I hereby sentence you 
to six months in prison.’ 


00:36.452 --> 00:39.889
“With those words ringing in my ears, 
I was taken off to . . . 


00:39.888 --> 00:41.891
“[p]rison in Manchester, England. . . . 


00:41.892 --> 00:45.862
“I had just faced 
one of the toughest tests of my young life 


00:45.862 --> 00:49.699
—I had refused to be conscripted 
for military service.”


00:49.698 --> 00:52.035
Or another brother, Brother Harley Harris, 


00:52.035 --> 00:54.970
who served as a missionary 
in Ecuador for many years, 


00:54.970 --> 00:58.808
he referred to the date September 2, 1950. 


00:58.808 --> 01:02.611
He said: “We were at a circuit assembly, 
surrounded by a mob. 


01:02.612 --> 01:07.084
“The mayor brought in the National Guard 
to protect us from the unruly crowd. 


01:07.083 --> 01:11.053
“Soldiers with drawn rifles 
and bayonets lined the street. 


01:11.053 --> 01:14.756
“Amid insults, 
we walked to our cars and drove to . . . 


01:14.757 --> 01:16.927
“the remaining sessions of the assembly. 


01:16.927 --> 01:20.000
It was there 
that I was baptized at the age of 14.” 


01:21.330 --> 01:23.398
Or another brother, Brother Don MacLean 


01:23.398 --> 01:26.001
—who serves 
on the Branch Committee in Australasia, 


01:26.002 --> 01:28.304
a brother originally from Canada— 


01:28.303 --> 01:30.306
made this comment. 


01:30.307 --> 01:32.509
He started his life experience: 


01:32.508 --> 01:34.843
“There I sat, hour after hour, 


01:34.843 --> 01:38.046
“with one of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police by my side. 


01:38.047 --> 01:40.049
“I was his prisoner. 


01:40.048 --> 01:43.418
“We were headed 
for the prison camp at . . . Ontario, Canada, 


01:43.418 --> 01:46.990
“and it seemed 
[that] the 1,500-mile train trip 


01:46.990 --> 01:49.825
would never end.”


01:49.825 --> 01:52.128
Well, those certainly were defining moments 


01:52.128 --> 01:54.163
in the lives of those brothers. 


01:54.163 --> 01:56.165
What about you? 


01:56.165 --> 01:59.402
What is your defining moment? 


01:59.402 --> 02:01.670
Well, you might be thinking, 


02:01.670 --> 02:05.142
‘No one put a gun 
to my head and said, 


02:05.142 --> 02:08.479
“Decide now whether 
you’ll serve Jehovah or not.”’ 


02:08.478 --> 02:12.981
But for many of us, there have been 
defining moments in our lives. 


02:12.982 --> 02:17.487
Perhaps it’s the moment 
you decided to serve Jehovah 


02:17.487 --> 02:21.674
or the moment you decided 
to become a full-time servant. 


02:21.673 --> 02:26.011
Perhaps it involved some decisions, 
such as selling a home, 


02:26.012 --> 02:29.782
selling a business, 
deciding to move to Bethel, 


02:29.782 --> 02:33.820
or perhaps leaving your country 
and going somewhere else. 


02:33.820 --> 02:37.723
Or it may have involved 
certain tests or trials, 


02:37.723 --> 02:40.943
perhaps giving up 
opportunities for education 


02:40.943 --> 02:44.463
or for lucrative job opportunities. 


02:44.463 --> 02:46.531
Well, whatever the case, 


02:46.532 --> 02:50.437
I’m sure most of us 
have had some defining moments 


02:50.437 --> 02:52.439
in our lives that we remember 


02:52.438 --> 02:57.443
—the decisions that were made 
that resulted in much good.


02:57.443 --> 03:01.413
Let’s think for a moment 
about the faithful man Abraham. 


03:01.413 --> 03:04.483
What was the defining moment in his life? 


03:04.483 --> 03:08.688
Well, if you take your Bibles 
and turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11, 


03:08.688 --> 03:13.710
of course, here we see 
the apostle Paul giving us an outline 


03:13.710 --> 03:16.678
or history of many 
of the defining moments 


03:16.678 --> 03:19.365
in the lives of faithful ones. 


03:19.365 --> 03:23.782
At Hebrews 11:8, 
it says of Abraham: 


03:23.782 --> 03:27.324
“By faith Abraham, when he was called, 


03:27.323 --> 03:29.991
“obeyed by going out to a place 


03:29.992 --> 03:32.929
“he was to receive as an inheritance; 


03:32.928 --> 03:36.000
he went out, 
although not knowing where he was going.” 


03:37.400 --> 03:42.105
Yes, that was a defining moment 
in the life of Abraham, wasn’t it? 


03:42.105 --> 03:47.110
He decided to obey Jehovah, 
to leave Ur, 


03:47.110 --> 03:52.000
and to travel to a distant country 
that he didn’t really know about. 


03:53.448 --> 03:56.618
But was that all that was involved 


03:56.618 --> 03:59.688
with Abraham receiving the reward? 


03:59.688 --> 04:00.690
No. 


04:00.690 --> 04:04.443
Let’s read on a little further in verse 9. 


04:04.443 --> 04:05.730
There it says: 


04:05.730 --> 04:08.230
“By faith he lived as a foreigner 


04:08.230 --> 04:11.248
“in the land of the promise 
as in a foreign land, 


04:11.248 --> 04:14.670
“living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, 


04:14.670 --> 04:18.675
the heirs with him 
of the very same promise.” 


04:18.675 --> 04:21.843
Now, this is not a defining moment, is it? 


04:21.843 --> 04:24.413
This is a course of faithfulness, 


04:24.413 --> 04:27.365
day in, day out. 


04:27.365 --> 04:29.385
So, what’s the point? 


04:29.385 --> 04:31.387
Well, in the case of Abraham, 


04:31.387 --> 04:34.957
we remember 
that eventually he and his family 


04:34.957 --> 04:37.960
crossed the Euphrates River 
and into the Promised Land 


04:37.960 --> 04:41.113
in the year 1943 B.C.E. 


04:41.113 --> 04:45.885
But he had to wait 25 years 
before his son Isaac was born 


04:45.885 --> 04:48.553
and then another 60 years 


04:48.553 --> 04:51.840
before his grandsons 
Esau and Jacob were born. 


04:51.840 --> 04:55.378
And eventually, 
he died after being in the Promised Land 


04:55.378 --> 04:59.148
as a foreigner for about 100 years.


04:59.148 --> 05:01.150
So, what’s the point? 


05:01.150 --> 05:04.553
Although there was 
a definite decision he made 


05:04.553 --> 05:07.223
—a defining moment in his life—


05:07.223 --> 05:10.310
that was backed up as verse 9 says, 


05:10.310 --> 05:12.478
by his faithfulness 


05:12.478 --> 05:14.980
—day in, day out—


05:14.980 --> 05:17.100
serving Jehovah. 


05:17.100 --> 05:20.152
So the lesson we learn from that is 


05:20.152 --> 05:23.522
that it’s not just the defining moments 


05:23.522 --> 05:25.892
that define who we are. 


05:25.892 --> 05:29.695
Rather, those moments and those decisions 


05:29.695 --> 05:33.098
need to be backed up by faithful service. 


05:33.098 --> 05:35.335
Let’s be quite frank. 


05:35.335 --> 05:38.938
Many of the life experiences 
that we read in The Watchtower 


05:38.938 --> 05:42.241
may have a very exciting first paragraph. 


05:42.242 --> 05:44.377
“Yes, they put a gun to my head. 


05:44.377 --> 05:45.579
“Make your decision. 


05:45.578 --> 05:47.046
“Will you die? 


05:47.047 --> 05:49.482
Would you be willing to die for Jehovah?” 


05:49.482 --> 05:52.419
But then, 
when you read the rest of the article, 


05:52.418 --> 05:56.121
nothing really exciting 
happened in that person’s life. 


05:56.122 --> 05:58.657
I’m sorry to say it. 


05:58.657 --> 06:02.329
That includes my life experience as well. 


06:02.328 --> 06:03.763
Why? 


06:03.763 --> 06:06.665
Because the majority of our lives 


06:06.665 --> 06:09.935
are not involved with defining moments 


06:09.935 --> 06:12.305
—exciting things that are happening. 


06:12.305 --> 06:16.675
Rather, they involve 
our faithfulness to Jehovah. 


06:16.675 --> 06:20.847
So we can’t just rely 
upon these defining moments and say, 


06:20.847 --> 06:23.497
“Well, I made this decision 
to serve Jehovah; 


06:23.497 --> 06:26.985
I passed this test, 
so everything is good.” 


06:26.985 --> 06:32.007
No, we need to continue 
to back up those defining moments 


06:32.007 --> 06:34.344
with faithful service. 


06:34.343 --> 06:36.345
Remember that in the Scriptures, 


06:36.345 --> 06:39.448
there were many who had 
defining moments in their lives. 


06:39.448 --> 06:41.616
Take, for example, Solomon. 


06:41.617 --> 06:45.455
He had a defining moment, didn’t he, 
when he prayed to Jehovah 


06:45.455 --> 06:50.000
and he was praised for the fact 
that he asked for wisdom rather than wealth? 


06:51.230 --> 06:54.597
But that wasn’t backed up by faithfulness. 


06:54.597 --> 06:57.630
Eventually, that defining moment in his life 


06:57.630 --> 07:00.933
really wasn’t as valuable as it could’ve been 


07:00.933 --> 07:04.090
because of his lack of faithfulness.


07:04.090 --> 07:06.625
And what about Judas Iscariot? 


07:06.625 --> 07:09.978
Were there some defining moments in his life? 


07:09.978 --> 07:13.800
Obviously, he decided 
to follow Jesus at one point. 


07:13.800 --> 07:17.002
And during that time, 
when he faithfully followed Jesus, 


07:17.002 --> 07:21.690
no doubt, there were very exciting, 
interesting things that happened. 


07:21.690 --> 07:26.028
But again, 
those defining moments in his life 


07:26.028 --> 07:28.030
proved to be of little value 


07:28.030 --> 07:31.717
because of the lack 
of faithfulness on his part. 


07:31.717 --> 07:33.920
So that helps us to understand 


07:33.920 --> 07:37.390
why the apostle Paul 
said some very interesting points 


07:37.390 --> 07:42.060
just before he started this list 
that he gives us in Hebrews chapter 11. 


07:42.060 --> 07:45.000
Let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 10, 


07:46.832 --> 07:52.000
Hebrews 10:35-39. 


07:53.255 --> 07:58.260
Notice, this is the point 
that we should gain from this lesson. 


07:58.260 --> 08:01.563
Paul says starting in verse 35: 


08:01.563 --> 08:04.933
“Therefore, do not throw away your boldness, 


08:04.933 --> 08:07.936
“which will be richly rewarded. 


08:07.937 --> 08:10.372
For you need endurance,” 


08:10.372 --> 08:12.992
now, that reminds us of what Jesus said 


08:12.992 --> 08:16.512
about ‘the one who endures 
to the end will be saved,’ 


08:16.512 --> 08:19.615
“so that after you 
have done the will of God, 


08:19.615 --> 08:22.952
“you may receive 
the fulfillment of the promise. 


08:22.952 --> 08:25.187
“For yet ‘a very little while,’ 


08:25.187 --> 08:30.025
“and ‘the one who is coming 
will arrive and will not delay.’ 


08:30.025 --> 08:34.530
“‘But my righteous one 
will live by reason of faith,’ 


08:34.530 --> 08:39.202
“and ‘if he shrinks back, 
I have no pleasure in him.’ 


08:39.202 --> 08:43.039
“Now we are not the sort 
who shrink back to destruction, 


08:43.038 --> 08:48.043
but the sort who have faith 
for the preserving of our lives.” 


08:48.043 --> 08:51.030
What a very positive comment that is. 


08:51.030 --> 08:54.933
So when we think of our life experience, 


08:54.933 --> 08:59.055
don’t be disappointed if you 
don’t have some spectacular things 


08:59.055 --> 09:01.673
that you can mention as defining moments. 


09:01.673 --> 09:04.510
Remember, the important thing 


09:04.510 --> 09:08.280
is not just the decisions 
that we make along the way 


09:08.280 --> 09:11.717
but the fact that we remain 
faithful to Jehovah 


09:11.717 --> 09:20.360
day in, day out.

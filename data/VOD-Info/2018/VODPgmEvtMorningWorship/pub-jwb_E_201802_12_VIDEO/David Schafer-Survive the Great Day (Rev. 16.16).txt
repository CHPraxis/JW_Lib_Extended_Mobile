00:02 “They.”
00:04 “They gathered them together
00:08 “to the place that is called in Hebrew
00:11 Armageddon.”
00:13 Who are “they”?
00:17 Who is being “gathered”?
00:19 And what is the significance of that to us
00:22 as we go about our sacred service today?
00:24 The answers can be found in the context.
00:27 I invite you to find Revelation chapter 16,
00:31 and let’s begin reading in verse 13,
00:37 which says:
00:39 “And I saw three
00:41 “unclean inspired expressions
00:46 “that looked like frogs
00:49 “come out of the mouth of the dragon
00:51 “and out of the mouth of the wild beast
00:54 “and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
00:57 “They are, in fact,  expressions inspired by demons
01:02 “and they perform signs,
01:04 “and they go out to the kings  of the entire inhabited earth,
01:08 to gather them together to the war  of the great day of God the Almighty.”
01:13 And verse 16 says:
01:15 “And they [these “expressions”]
01:19 “gathered them  [“the kings of the entire inhabited earth”]
01:22 to the place that is called  in Hebrew Armageddon.”
01:26 “Expressions.”
01:28 Now, these must be  very persuasive expressions
01:33 because they compel
01:35 not just a few isolated kings here and there
01:38 but “the kings of the entire inhabited earth”
01:41 to this situation called Armageddon.
01:45 Now, these expressions,  you notice, are unclean,
01:49 so they cannot originate with Jehovah.
01:53 And yet, they are inspired
01:56 —“inspired by demons.”
01:59 And yet,  they have their ultimate source
02:01 in “the mouth of the dragon,”  Satan the Devil
02:05 —“the father of the lie.”
02:07 But, now,  who actually gives voice
02:10 to these expressions?
02:12 Well, notice in verse 13 that the expressions
02:15 also ‘come out of the mouths  of the wild beast and the false prophet’
02:20 —political entities of Satan’s world.
02:22 So here we have  unclean expressions inspired by demons
02:26 —originating with Satan but voiced, repeated,
02:29 parroted, and echoed by people
02:34 who constitute Satan’s wicked world.
02:37 But, now, just what are these expressions
02:40 that are so persuasive  that they compel kings?
02:45 What concept would be so compelling?
02:51 Since 1914,  Satan has been stepping up his efforts
02:56 to mislead “the entire inhabited earth.”
02:59 And one of his goals
03:01 is to deceive mankind  into thinking that humans
03:06 —that Satan’s way of ruling is the best—
03:08 that humans can actually achieve
03:12 peace and security
03:14 through their own systems and governments.
03:17 Moreover,  according to 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3,
03:21 they will soon be saying  that they have actually achieved
03:26 “peace and security.”
03:28 Now, adding to the power  of these inspired expressions
03:32 are the signs.
03:35 The signs make it seem
03:38 as if these expressions  are actually coming true
03:41 and perhaps that they  even have the backing of God.
03:45 But the only god backing  these particular inspired expressions
03:50 is “the god of this system of things.”
03:54 Is it unprecedented
03:57 that Satan the Devil would use miracles
04:01 in an attempt to lend credibility
04:04 to his ideas, his wicked lies?
04:09 At Exodus 7:10-12,
04:13 Jehovah empowers Aaron’s rod  to become a snake,
04:17 but Pharaoh’s magic-practicing priests
04:20 mimicked that very sign.
04:24 Likewise, they mimicked the first  and the second of the Ten Plagues.
04:29 OK, but what about after the Christian  congregation came into existence?
04:33 Paul indicated at 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12
04:37 that the apostate movement,
04:39 which eventually gave birth  to the clergy of Christendom,
04:42 would be backed  “by the operation of Satan
04:47 “with every powerful work
04:50 and lying signs and wonders.”
04:53 —2 Thessalonians 2:9.
04:55 Moreover, Mark 13:22 says—
04:59 In the prophecy of the last days, Jesus said:
05:02 “False Christs and false prophets
05:05 “will arise and will perform signs
05:08 “and wonders to lead astray, if possible,
05:11 [even] the chosen ones.”
05:14 So, clearly, demons teach.
05:16 And it is not beyond Satan and the demons
05:19 to back up their false claims  with wonders at times,
05:24 although, obviously,  their power in that regard is limited.
05:28 A subtle reminder of that fact
05:31 is found at Revelation 16:16,
05:35 which says that they are ‘gathered together  to the place called Armageddon,’
05:39 “to the war of the great day  of God the Almighty.”
05:42 “The Almighty” —only Jehovah can hold that title.
05:46 And that very word  is a guarantee that Jehovah’s will
05:51 will ultimately prevail.
05:54 Still, is it possible
05:57 that some professed Christians  could start to believe
06:02 “expressions inspired by demons”
06:06 that “perform signs”?
06:08 If it weren’t possible,  at least for individuals,
06:11 then why would  Revelation chapter 16 contain this warning
06:16 right in the middle of the discussion  about Armageddon that we just read?
06:19 The verse that we skipped, verse 15,
06:22 contains a very relevant reminder
06:25 for each and every one of us.
06:27 Now, sometimes we skip it
06:29 because we keep all the verses  about Armageddon together.
06:31 But, this is not an afterthought, a sidebar,
06:33 just a wise saying  plunked in for no apparent reason.
06:36 It’s totally relevant.
06:38 Let’s read it:
06:39 “Look! [verse 15]
06:42 “I am coming as a thief.
06:44 “Happy is the one who stays awake  and keeps his outer garments,
06:48 “so that he may not walk naked
06:51 and people look upon his shamefulness.”
06:56 So here we are, right on the cusp
06:59 of the outbreak of the great tribulation.
07:04 You have an identity —“garments”—
07:07 an identity  as a faithful witness of Jehovah God.
07:12 Keep your identity.
07:13 How?
07:14 By keeping awake spiritually.
07:16 The article from which our text is taken,
07:18 entitled “‘Your Deliverance Is Getting Near’!”
07:20 in the July 15, 2015, issue  of The Watchtower, points out
07:24 —in harmony with the Scriptures,  boiling down a number of Scriptural facts—
07:28 that Babylon the Great will be destroyed.
07:31 Then, the initial part  of the great tribulation will be cut short.
07:35 There will be a brief respite,
07:38 during which the majority of mankind
07:40 will seek refuge in human organizations.
07:43 Our message of good news  will change to one of judgment.
07:48 Then, the coalition of nations  referred to as Gog of Magog
07:53 will be bent on attacking  Jehovah’s anointed ones
07:57 and their associates.
08:00 Now, only loyal love for Jehovah
08:03 and obedient support  of his anointed ones will get us through.
08:08 That will mean everything!
08:11 So, what must we do now?
08:14 Stay awake.
08:15 You have an identity
08:17 —not just a Bethelite or Gilead graduate.
08:21 No.
08:22 You’ve worked hard, with Jehovah’s help,
08:24 to establish an identity
08:26 as a Christian worshipper of Jehovah
08:30 —keep it.
08:31 Perform “holy acts of conduct.”
08:35 We could say,  things we don’t do
08:39 —things we don’t watch,  things we don’t read,
08:43 things we don’t think about,  things we don’t say.
08:47 Don’t let the demons tamper  with your identity as a Christian
08:52 with their “unclean inspired expressions.”
08:56 Perform “deeds of godly devotion,”
08:58 we could say,  things we do
09:00 —preaching, lingering in prayer,
09:02 continuing in your personal study.
09:05 Much is covered in Gilead,  yes, but not everything.
09:10 The online Study Bible is amazing,
09:12 and it just keeps getting  better day after day,
09:14 helping us to forge a closer bond,
09:18 a close personal attachment,  with Jehovah.
09:20 Continue devoting time  to such “deeds of godly devotion” now
09:25 and you will succeed then.
09:27 You will not be duped by the expressions
09:31 that perform signs,
09:33 as others are.
09:35 No, you will survive
09:37 “the great day of God the Almighty,”
09:41 now so very near at hand.

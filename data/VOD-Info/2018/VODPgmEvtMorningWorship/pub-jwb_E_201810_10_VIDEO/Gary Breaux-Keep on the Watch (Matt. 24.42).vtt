00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:03.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you look at Matthew chapter 24

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎(you may want to open your Bibles there

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.558 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because the text of the day comes from there),

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:10.593 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we find in chapter 24,

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎starting in verse 29 through chapter 25,

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.932 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus is actually talking

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:18.201 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the conditions of the time of the end

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.503 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we’re, in fact, in right now

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:24.340 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and, also, what we can expect 
in the great tribulation. 

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:30.513 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So our scripture is at Matthew 24:42. 

00:00:30.513 --> 00:00:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s read it. 

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.719 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says:
“Keep on the watch, therefore,

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because you do not know 
on what day your Lord is coming.” 

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:45.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what is referred to as “coming”? 

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, this is speaking about a future time. 

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:50.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus will be coming as Judge. 

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When is he coming? 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what did he say there? 

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘You do not know the day.’ 

00:00:57.507 --> 00:00:59.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But if you go to the next verse,

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he sort of narrows his comment 
and gives us a little bit of a clue. 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.351 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’s talking about a householder 
being on watch for a thief. 

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s read it in verse 43. 

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says:
“But know one thing:

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:17.127 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If the householder had known 
in what watch the thief was coming,

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he would have kept awake 
and not allowed his house to be broken into.” 

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:27.370 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So if you notice the footnote, 
it says “at what time of night.” 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So Jesus said, well, 
the householder knew either day or night. 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re going to narrow it down to the night

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:35.678 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—that’s when you need to be on the watch. 

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:40.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so it is that we are in the last days
—that’s what he’s speaking about. 

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:44.554 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, the “coming” would be 
at some point in the last days.

00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s another reason 
this illustration is good for us,

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because he says 
that the watch will be at night. 

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what happens at nighttime? 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, at nighttime 
is usually when there’s adversity

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if there’s going to be adversity. 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There is gloom

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—obscurity—
at nighttime. 

00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:06.810 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s when the thieves come in
—those who want to do evil. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.815 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s when sometimes armies 
will launch surprise attacks. 

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:15.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s where beasts will roam
—when they’ll roam. 

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And as a result, 
notice what Jesus said in verse 44. 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:24.227 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He says:
“On this account [because of that, he said],

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“you too prove yourselves ready,

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because the Son of man is coming 
at an hour that you do not think to be it.” 

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:34.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what message was he giving us here? 

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, in verse 42: 
“Keep on the watch.” 

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:42.779 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 44, ahh, 
‘Prove ourselves ready.’

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now let’s take the “keep on the watch,” first. 

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:48.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During the times we’re living in right now,

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why is it that people are not on the watch? 

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:54.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They don’t understand 
what’s happening around us. 

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, to understand,

00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we can go to Isaiah 56:10

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it gives some indication. 

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Isaiah 56:10

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—speaking about the leaders of Judah—

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and listen to what it says. 

00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says: “His watchmen are blind,

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“none of them have taken note.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:21.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎All of them are speechless dogs, 
unable to bark.”

00:03:21.484 --> 00:03:24.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So the leaders were to be “watchmen”

00:03:24.888 --> 00:03:27.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but, instead,
he says they were “speechless.” 

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, dogs have 
this very keen sense of hearing,

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and so they hear before humans. 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s why they can bark, giving a warning. 

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But these leaders weren’t doing it. 

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They weren’t warning 
the people of the dangers,

00:03:41.704 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and thus the spiritual condition
that they found themselves in. 

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So the leaders of Judah

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:52.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎actually are a fitting symbol

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of Christendom’s religious clergy today

00:03:56.452 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they’re not warning the people. 

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:01.824 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s why the masses don’t understand

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the serious times we’re living in. 

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:08.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, they are spiritually asleep.

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:13.403 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now let’s contrast 
those speechless dogs, so to speak,

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:17.941 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with Jehovah’s watchman, 
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just think of what they’ve done for us:

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They keep us alert 
to the sign of Christ’s presence.

00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:28.751 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They help us to avoid 
the snares of Satan the Devil.

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They help us to understand

00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and stay focused 
on the unfulfilled prophecies.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, just think 
of the amount of spiritual food

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:40.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that they’re giving us. 

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Truly, they are in fact on the watch

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and, as a result,
they’re helping us to stay on the watch.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But remember, 
Jesus now narrowed it down to an individual.

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We have to ‘prove ourselves ready,’ he said. 

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:59.349 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So to stay ready, we cannot have

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this ‘speechless dog’ tendency in ourselves. 

00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:06.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what do we mean? 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, think about this:

00:05:08.424 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If our night watchman 
is on his shift and he’s going around

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he sees water damage, 
rather, a water leak

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—what is he going to do about it? 

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Will he simply take note of it? 

00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, if he only takes note of it,

00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:25.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the result is going to be major damage. 

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So inherent within being a watchman

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is that you have to do something about it. 

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You can’t just see it and not act on it. 

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.987 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so it is with each one of us. 

00:05:37.987 --> 00:05:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we look 
at “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.860 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what a beautiful example they’re giving us. 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They’re fulfilling their assignment 
in a superior way. 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we must each ask ourselves,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Is my internal dog barking?’

00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, the words of Peter here 
in 2 Peter chapter 3

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:04.147 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are going to help us to answer 
and to reason on that question. 

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:10.820 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s at 2 Peter 3:10. 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says:
“Jehovah’s day will come as a thief.” 

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎OK, in verse 11, 
it says that we need to figure out

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘what sort of persons’ we are in these areas

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—‘in our holy acts of conduct 
and our deeds of godly devotion.’ 

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then in verse 14, we’ll read it:

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Therefore, beloved ones, 
since you are awaiting these things,

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“do your utmost to be found finally by him

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎spotless and unblemished and in peace.” 

00:06:40.416 --> 00:06:43.286 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, obviously, spotless means

00:06:43.286 --> 00:06:45.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that when there was a spot, 
we got rid of it,

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or when there was a blemish, 
we did something about it. 

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:54.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So to manifest these holy acts of conduct

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:56.566 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that verse 11 is talking about,

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we have to stay morally clean. 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.506 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, we’re living in a world 
that doesn’t want us to be morally clean. 

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:07.243 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They’re doing everything 
to try to get us to think wrong

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:11.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—to do things that Jehovah objects to. 

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we have the first indication

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that our thinking is not right,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎maybe there’s an unclean thought or idea

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:24.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that comes into our mind, what do we do? 

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:26.896 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, remember the watchman. 

00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:30.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When he sees the leak, 
he needs to do something about it. 

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Otherwise, there’ll be damage. 

00:07:32.902 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And so it is with us. 

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:37.507 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even if we are thinking
—if we have a thought—

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of deviating from Jehovah’s moral standards,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎then the figurative dog better start barking

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:48.818 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we better do something about it. 

00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If we don’t do so,

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:55.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎listen to the comments
of the March 2015 Watchtower.

00:07:55.258 --> 00:07:58.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says:
“Are we finding the gap

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“between our moral standards
and those of the world widening?

00:08:02.965 --> 00:08:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If not, we have cause for concern. 

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Could it be that our personal standards,

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“though higher than those of the world,
are eroding?

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If so, we need to take positive action

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:22.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to correct matters in order to please God.” 

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So if we detect a spiritual spot,

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.325 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or blemish,

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎let’s go to Jehovah God in prayer

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and ask him for help. 

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.800 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s do research in a way that helps us

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.503 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to identify the weakness

00:08:40.503 --> 00:08:43.506 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and also how to fix it. 

00:08:43.506 --> 00:08:47.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And if needed, let’s reach out for help.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Have you ever lived next to a neighbor

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:53.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that had a dog that barked all the time? 

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It barked for days, 
for weeks, for months,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎barking and barking. 

00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:03.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Pretty soon 
you became oblivious to the bark.

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, may that never happen

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when our internal dog is barking. 

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:13.636 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, may we all be determined
to heed Jesus direction:

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Keep on the watch.” 

00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Prove ourselves ready.’

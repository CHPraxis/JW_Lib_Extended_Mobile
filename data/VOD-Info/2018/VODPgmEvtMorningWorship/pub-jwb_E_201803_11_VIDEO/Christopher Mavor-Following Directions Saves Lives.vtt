00:01.150 --> 00:03.018
There’s a railroad sign 


00:03.018 --> 00:04.820
that most of us have seen 


00:04.820 --> 00:07.057
before we cross a railroad track. 


00:07.057 --> 00:09.892
It says: “Stop, Look, 


00:09.892 --> 00:12.295
[and] Listen.” 


00:12.295 --> 00:15.465
And some will say: 
“and Live.” 


00:15.465 --> 00:19.202
Now, why is 
this sign there? 


00:19.202 --> 00:23.105
Because we know that 
crossing a railroad track 


00:23.105 --> 00:25.875
can endanger our lives. 


00:25.875 --> 00:29.078
But the danger 
is not so evident; 


00:29.078 --> 00:31.213
it’s not immediately seen. 


00:31.213 --> 00:33.348
It must be deduced 


00:33.348 --> 00:35.518
—you must use 
your thinking abilities. 


00:35.518 --> 00:37.920
And that’s why 
one sign says: 


00:37.920 --> 00:41.825
“See Tracks? Think Train!” 


00:41.825 --> 00:45.428
So we first must stop 


00:45.428 --> 00:48.230
and then look both ways 


00:48.230 --> 00:52.635
and then even engage 
the sense of hearing to listen. 


00:52.635 --> 00:55.738
Do we hear a rumble? 
a vibration in the earth? 


00:55.738 --> 00:59.475
Do we see a headlight coming our way? 


00:59.475 --> 01:01.477
Is a whistle blowing? 


01:01.477 --> 01:04.047
You see, all these indicate a danger. 


01:04.047 --> 01:07.717
The train is not in front of us immediately, 


01:07.717 --> 01:11.687
but we have to be aware 
of the danger because, 


01:11.687 --> 01:15.092
as this picture shows, a fast moving train 


01:15.092 --> 01:17.660
just cannot stop immediately 


01:17.660 --> 01:21.630
if we happen to be in the middle 
of the railroad tracks. 


01:21.630 --> 01:26.268
If we were there, 
we definitely would be killed.


01:26.268 --> 01:28.538
To avoid such a tragedy, 


01:28.538 --> 01:31.106
we therefore must use what the Bible calls 


01:31.107 --> 01:33.544
our “perceptive powers” 


01:33.543 --> 01:37.546
to discern the danger that is before us. 


01:37.547 --> 01:41.017
And then we must take appropriate action 


01:41.017 --> 01:46.655
to find safety to make sure 
that we are not victimized by the danger. 


01:46.655 --> 01:50.660
Now, this well illustrates 
what Jehovah has been telling us 


01:50.660 --> 01:53.997
through his Word 
and through his organization. 


01:53.997 --> 01:57.934
Jehovah is telling us today to stop, 


01:57.933 --> 02:01.436
look, and listen. 


02:01.437 --> 02:03.439
Look around you. 


02:03.438 --> 02:05.841
Discern the times that we’re living in. 


02:05.842 --> 02:08.310
We’re living in the last days. 


02:08.310 --> 02:10.380
The end is very near. 


02:10.380 --> 02:14.383
The great tribulation is about to take place. 


02:14.383 --> 02:17.686
Now, it’s necessary to have discernment 


02:17.687 --> 02:19.989
in order to come to this conclusion. 


02:19.988 --> 02:23.091
Jesus said you would need discernment. 


02:23.092 --> 02:25.000
At Luke 17:20, 21, 


02:26.248 --> 02:28.396
he says that the Kingdom 


02:28.397 --> 02:33.102
would not be “coming 
with striking observableness.” 


02:33.102 --> 02:37.374
It would take discernment 
to understand the signs 


02:37.373 --> 02:41.343
and what it would mean 
and what action to take. 


02:41.343 --> 02:45.548
This ability to discern requires cultivation 


02:45.548 --> 02:47.550
—we need to work on it. 


02:47.550 --> 02:50.420
The Bible at Hebrews 5:14 


02:50.420 --> 02:53.523
calls it the “powers of discernment” 


02:53.523 --> 02:57.160
or what we used to call 
the “perceptive powers.” 


02:57.160 --> 03:01.097
And as we learned in yesterday’s text 
when it referred to the prophet Daniel, 


03:01.097 --> 03:03.165
he was exemplary 


03:03.165 --> 03:06.502
in using his perceptive powers 


03:06.502 --> 03:10.072
to perceive, or to discern, the will of God. 


03:10.072 --> 03:12.542
And it was necessary for him to do so 


03:12.542 --> 03:15.245
in order to avoid the dangerous situation 


03:15.245 --> 03:17.847
that he and his companions were in 


03:17.847 --> 03:21.217
there at the palace in Babylon. 


03:21.217 --> 03:23.887
Now, Daniel continued to cultivate 


03:23.887 --> 03:26.555
these powers of discernment. 


03:26.555 --> 03:28.758
Later on in his life, 


03:28.758 --> 03:31.726
he made a deep study of the prophecies, 


03:31.727 --> 03:33.797
especially those of Jeremiah. 


03:33.797 --> 03:36.099
And then he concluded, or discerned, 


03:36.098 --> 03:38.100
where they were in the stream of time 


03:38.100 --> 03:41.637
—that the end 
of the 70-year desolation of Jerusalem 


03:41.637 --> 03:44.374
was coming to its conclusion. 


03:44.373 --> 03:48.678
And this moved him to take 
specific action to prepare himself 


03:48.678 --> 03:52.248
as well as other faithful Jews 


03:52.248 --> 03:57.120
so that they could proceed 
with Jehovah’s will and purpose. 


03:57.120 --> 04:01.290
He therefore understood the times 
and events that were taking place 


04:01.290 --> 04:03.727
because of the deep study that he did, 


04:03.727 --> 04:05.995
and he was able to discern 


04:05.995 --> 04:09.465
what was taking place 
in the world around him.


04:09.465 --> 04:13.268
Now, Jesus taught us to do 
something very similar. 


04:13.268 --> 04:16.671
He told us to cultivate discernment, 


04:16.672 --> 04:19.442
and he used 
a beautiful illustration to do that. 


04:19.442 --> 04:23.780
Open your Bibles, please, 
to the book of Luke, 


04:23.780 --> 04:26.448
and we’ll look at chapter 21 


04:26.448 --> 04:29.718
and verses 29-31. 


04:29.718 --> 04:34.023
And here Jesus uses this technique 
of “stop, look, listen, and live.” 


04:34.023 --> 04:36.558
He says in verse 29: 


04:36.558 --> 04:39.461
“Notice the fig tree 
and all the other trees.” 


04:39.462 --> 04:42.765
So stop and look around you, he says. 


04:42.765 --> 04:45.435
And verse 30, it says: 
“[And] when they are budding.” 


04:45.435 --> 04:47.537
In other words, look at these plants 


04:47.537 --> 04:49.939
and “you see it for yourselves 


04:49.938 --> 04:52.375
and know that now the summer is near.” 


04:52.375 --> 04:56.878
So discern it; 
perceive what is taking place here. 


04:56.878 --> 05:00.516
And then he tells us and listen in verse 31: 


05:00.517 --> 05:04.354
“Likewise also you, 
when you see these things happening, 


05:04.353 --> 05:08.223
know that the Kingdom of God is near.” 


05:08.223 --> 05:12.728
So here Jesus was telling us 
to stop, look, listen, 


05:12.728 --> 05:16.765
and then we would live.


05:16.765 --> 05:18.868
Now, “the faithful and discreet slave” 


05:18.868 --> 05:22.938
—they’re guided by the head 
of the congregation, Jesus Christ. 


05:22.938 --> 05:27.510
And he is providing direction 
to us in a very similar way 


05:27.510 --> 05:30.713
to help us sharpen 
our powers of discernment 


05:30.713 --> 05:34.950
to comprehend and understand 
what’s going on around us. 


05:34.950 --> 05:37.620
It’s through the pages of The Watchtower 


05:37.620 --> 05:40.022
and our assemblies and conventions 


05:40.022 --> 05:44.627
that we are told to stop
—leave off your everyday life and concerns 


05:44.627 --> 05:46.795
and stop for a moment; 


05:46.795 --> 05:50.367
and then look into God’s Word 


05:50.367 --> 05:53.837
—read it and see what the Bible has to say 


05:53.837 --> 05:57.740
about Jehovah’s will and purpose 
and especially our time period; 


05:57.740 --> 06:00.877
and then take time to listen 


06:00.877 --> 06:03.445
to the explanations provided 


06:03.445 --> 06:06.715
through “the faithful and discreet slave” 


06:06.715 --> 06:09.752
about prophecies and about our time period 


06:09.752 --> 06:12.955
and the nearness of the great tribulation. 


06:12.955 --> 06:17.827
Now, today, we are receiving 
a very clear message 


06:17.827 --> 06:20.029
from Jehovah God’s organization 


06:20.028 --> 06:23.131
through Jesus Christ 
and through “the faithful and discreet slave” 


06:23.132 --> 06:27.870
that the great tribulation is imminent. 


06:27.870 --> 06:32.308
Now, how should this information affect us? 


06:32.308 --> 06:35.645
Well, for one thing, the anxieties of life 


06:35.645 --> 06:38.982
—the things that immediately confront us 
on a day-to-day basis—


06:38.982 --> 06:42.652
can sap our energy 
and can totally distract us 


06:42.652 --> 06:45.187
away from the bigger issues. 


06:45.187 --> 06:47.457
And Jesus warned us against this. 


06:47.457 --> 06:50.827
In fact, going back to the book 
of Luke chapter 17, 


06:50.827 --> 06:53.595
there Jesus uses the accounts 


06:53.595 --> 06:58.600
of Noah as well as Sodom and Gomorrah 
to be a warning to us. 


06:58.600 --> 07:01.337
There He says that the days of the Son of man 


07:01.337 --> 07:03.372
would be like the days of Noah and Sodom. 


07:03.372 --> 07:06.542
And why? 
Because people would be distracted 


07:06.542 --> 07:09.879
with the mundane cares of life. 


07:09.878 --> 07:12.515
It’s these mundane cares of life 


07:12.515 --> 07:17.520
that can truly dull our powers of perception. 


07:17.520 --> 07:19.922
We would not be able to discern 


07:19.922 --> 07:21.924
where we are in the stream of time 


07:21.923 --> 07:26.295
or the danger that is confronting us. 


07:26.295 --> 07:30.198
So we have to really be careful 
that we don’t allow these things 


07:30.198 --> 07:33.068
to dull our powers of discernment. 


07:33.068 --> 07:36.671
Otherwise, we can find ourselves 
just wandering onto a railroad track 


07:36.672 --> 07:40.877
and not really looking, 
not listening, being distracted, 


07:40.877 --> 07:43.814
and before you know it, 
a train could overtake us. 


07:43.813 --> 07:46.781
And that’s exactly what is happening 
to people in the world today. 


07:46.782 --> 07:50.687
They’re distracted by these things, 
and they’re failing to take notice 


07:50.687 --> 07:54.824
that Jehovah God is coming 
at them at full speed 


07:54.823 --> 07:58.793
to execute judgment 
against Satan’s wicked world. 


07:58.793 --> 08:02.298
However, when we sharpen 
our powers of discernment, 


08:02.298 --> 08:04.300
we clearly see the signs. 


08:04.300 --> 08:06.302
And Jesus said that you would. 


08:06.302 --> 08:08.704
He said at Luke 17:24 


08:08.703 --> 08:11.240
that it would be like lightning flashing 


08:11.240 --> 08:14.377
from one end of the sky 
to the other end of the sky. 


08:14.377 --> 08:17.780
But it would be only 
because our powers of discernment 


08:17.780 --> 08:21.450
would see these things and understand them. 


08:21.450 --> 08:23.452
Now, we see very clearly. 


08:23.452 --> 08:25.454
We look around at the political world today, 


08:25.453 --> 08:28.323
and we can see 
these “lightning flashes” all around us. 


08:28.323 --> 08:32.026
In Daniel’s vision of chapter 2 


08:32.027 --> 08:34.864
—the iron and the clay 
of the final world power— 


08:34.863 --> 08:36.865
we see how fragmented they are, 


08:36.865 --> 08:39.568
how weak and ineffectual 
this world government is. 


08:39.568 --> 08:43.238
At 2 Timothy 3:1-5, the attitudes of people, 


08:43.238 --> 08:46.408
including those who are leaders in the world, 


08:46.408 --> 08:49.478
are arrogant and blasphemous and haughty. 


08:49.478 --> 08:51.780
These are clear indications 


08:51.780 --> 08:54.517
that we are very near the time of the end. 


08:54.517 --> 08:57.687
In fact, these individuals 
and these governments 


08:57.687 --> 09:00.289
are very much like 
an illustration that we saw 


09:00.288 --> 09:04.693
in the October 15, 1971, 
issue of The Watchtower 


09:04.693 --> 09:07.863
of a little ant standing on a railroad track, 


09:07.863 --> 09:10.165
and here we see 
God’s Kingdom coming at them. 


09:10.165 --> 09:14.170
And we, obviously, 
see what the outcome will be. 


09:14.170 --> 09:17.640
They will be completely pulverized 


09:17.640 --> 09:19.842
by the power and speed 


09:19.842 --> 09:22.912
of Jehovah’s executional forces.


09:22.912 --> 09:26.582
So we see, therefore, it’s important 


09:26.582 --> 09:31.020
for us to sharpen our powers of discernment 


09:31.020 --> 09:34.657
—to cultivate this quality—
so that we are not caught off guard, 


09:34.657 --> 09:38.727
we always see the danger, 
and we can take appropriate action. 


09:38.727 --> 09:41.864
So every day, let us stop, look, 


09:41.863 --> 09:45.266
and listen to Jehovah’s warnings. 


09:45.267 --> 09:48.637
This will help us stay out 
of the danger zone, 


09:48.637 --> 09:52.007
and we’ll be able to survive 
the end of this system of things, 


09:52.007 --> 10:01.267
and the great tribulation 
will not catch us off guard.

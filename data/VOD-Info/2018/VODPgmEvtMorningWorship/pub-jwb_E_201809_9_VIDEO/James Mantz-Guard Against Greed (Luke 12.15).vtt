00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:03.853 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do you need? 

00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:06.156 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do you want? 

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:08.258 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There’s a big difference between things

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.894 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that are absolutely necessary

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:12.929 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and things that we might enjoy

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.664 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or things that would make our life

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a little more comfortable,
even though they’re not essential. 

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:24.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1956, a newspaper columnist 
made an interesting observation. 

00:00:24.074 --> 00:00:28.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He estimated that 100 years earlier, in 1856,

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:31.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎man basically had 72 wants,

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ of which only 16 were necessities,

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and men of that day 
were being urged by advertisers

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to buy about 200 items. 

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But by 1956,

00:00:44.327 --> 00:00:48.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the number of wants had grown to 474,

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of which 94 were viewed as necessities,

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and men were being bombarded with ads

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.908 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to buy about 32,000 articles. 

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:01.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The columnist’s conclusion:

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Man’s necessities are few;

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.784 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his wants, infinite. 

00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:10.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, if he’d made the same estimates today,

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:12.689 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’m sure the figures would be a lot higher. 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The commercial world constantly pressures us

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not only to buy things
but to view as necessities

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎things that should really be classified as wants.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:29.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Seeing the clear difference 
between our needs and our wants

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:34.911 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is a key to avoiding the snare of materialism,

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:38.081 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we appreciate the frequent reminders

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we receive 
from “the faithful and discreet slave.” 

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These help us to have 
the proper view of material things. 

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
the text today is taken from an article

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that had the very clear title 
“Seek the Kingdom, Not Things.” 

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:58.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the theme scripture 
was Luke 12:31, where it says:

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:03.006 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Keep seeking his Kingdom, 
and these things will be added to you.” 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s essential 
that we have faith in those words. 

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We fully trust 
that Jehovah is going to provide

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for our physical needs

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.555 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as long as we put 
his worship first in our lives. 

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There was a simple definition 
of materialism in the study article;

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it’s found in paragraph 3. 

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:27.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, it didn’t say that materialism 
is having a large bank account,

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:31.601 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎living in a big house, 
or driving a fancy automobile. 

00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Rather, it said:

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:37.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Materialism is the preoccupation

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘with material things

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rather than with spiritual riches.’ 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So materialism really is a condition

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of our mind and our heart. 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So it’s good to ask ourselves:

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘What am I constantly thinking about? 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I get together with my friends, 
what is the subject of our conversation?’

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As our commenters pointed out,

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the spirit of materialism can infect anyone

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:08.371 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—even pioneers, even Bethelites. 

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It infected Christians in the first century. 

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:14.744 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please open your Bibles to Revelation chapter 3,

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we’ll notice here 
that apparently many in the congregation

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had become contaminated 
by the materialistic environment

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:25.822 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the city of Laodicea. 

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:29.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And notice the strong counsel that Jesus gave

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to those who were putting 
their trust in material riches. 

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Revelation 3:17 says:

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Because you say,

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:44.941 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘I am rich and have acquired riches
and do not need anything at all,’

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“but you do not know that you are miserable

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and pitiful and poor and blind and naked.” 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.752 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, were these Christians materially rich? 

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:57.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes. 

00:03:57.353 --> 00:04:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But Jesus said they were in spiritual poverty. 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.692 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Did they wear fine clothing? 

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No doubt. 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in Jesus’ eyes, they were naked,

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so we can see that they 
were in a bad spiritual state.

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:19.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Was there any cure 
for the Laodicean’s spiritual sickness? 

00:04:19.275 --> 00:04:20.376 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes. 

00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look back at chapter 3 
and the first part of verse 18. 

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Interestingly, Jesus told them that the remedy

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for trusting in riches was to ‘buy gold.’ 

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what kind of gold? 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.992 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He said: “I advise you

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to buy from me gold refined by fire

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that you may become rich.” 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, spiritual riches are what are important. 

00:04:47.103 --> 00:04:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Only spiritual treasures are lasting. 

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Material possessions 
are merely a means to an end. 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need them to keep on living,

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we need them 
to carry out our worship of Jehovah.

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:00.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So we need to ask ourselves:

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘What are my priorities? 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Where is my focus?’ 

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:09.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Sally and I found ourselves 
asking these questions

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎during a recent branch visit. 

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We met brothers in countries

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the Kingdom work 
is under various degrees of restriction. 

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They have no witnessing carts. 

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:22.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They can’t offer literature door to door. 

00:05:22.205 --> 00:05:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In one country, brothers can be arrested

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and fined the equivalent of six weeks’ wages

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just for witnessing in public. 

00:05:31.147 --> 00:05:34.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In some places, police would confiscate 
your phone or your tablet

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:39.022 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if they found that it contained 
the JW Library® app. 

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:43.860 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In another country, when police 
would find JW Library® on your device,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they would just erase the app

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then give the device 
back to the publisher. 

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in spite of these obstacles and threats,

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our brothers are finding 
true joy in serving Jehovah. 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.108 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And you can imagine,
it was inspiring

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to be able to work 
with them during this time. 

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:04.747 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In one country, 
we met with circuit overseers

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from three different language groups. 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.788 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I asked them the question, 
“What do our brothers need most?” 

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In unison, they immediately replied,
“Armageddon.” 

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That really put things in perspective for me. 

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:27.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These brothers 
are not preoccupied with material things. 

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For them, 
every day is a matter of spiritual survival. 

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:38.181 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Stay faithful, 
meet regularly, and preach informally

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—these are the most important things, 
the things that really matter. 

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how fitting is the reminder 
at Proverbs 11:4, where it says:

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but righteousness 
is what will rescue from death”! 

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:59.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, we may have some possessions 
that we view as very valuable. 

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We may treasure them. 

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:04.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe it’s something 
we received as a family heirloom,

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:07.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but we should not expect 
that any of our possessions,

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:11.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎regardless of how treasured 
or how valuable they may be,

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:15.751 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will survive with us 
through the great tribulation.

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:20.490 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please open your Bibles 
to Jeremiah chapter 45. 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re going to read verse 5,

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and this scripture will help us to maintain 
the proper viewpoint

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:28.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of material things. 

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:33.136 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These are words that were directed 
to Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch. 

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:35.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jeremiah 45:5 says:

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘But you are seeking 
great things for yourself.

‎“‘Stop seeking such things. 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,’

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“declares Jehovah,

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘and wherever you may go,

00:07:48.484 --> 00:07:52.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I will grant you your life as a spoil.’”

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:55.858 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Whether these “great things” 
Baruch was seeking

00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were material possessions, 
we do not know. 

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:04.033 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What we do know 
is that when the great tribulation breaks out,

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎all of us will be grateful 
to come out of that tribulation

00:08:08.437 --> 00:08:11.774 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with our “life as a spoil.” 

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And whether we survive 
that great tribulation or not,

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:20.349 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎could very well depend on how 
we answer these two questions right now:

00:08:20.349 --> 00:08:22.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do I want? 

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do I need?

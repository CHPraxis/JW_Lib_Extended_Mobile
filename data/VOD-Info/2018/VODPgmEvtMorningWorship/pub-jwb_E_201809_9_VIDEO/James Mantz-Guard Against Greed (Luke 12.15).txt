00:00:01 ‎What do you need?
00:00:03 ‎What do you want?
00:00:06 ‎There’s a big difference between things
00:00:08 ‎that are absolutely necessary
00:00:10 ‎and things that we might enjoy
00:00:12 ‎or things that would make our life
00:00:14 ‎a little more comfortable, even though they’re not essential.
00:00:19 ‎In 1956, a newspaper columnist  made an interesting observation.
00:00:24 ‎He estimated that 100 years earlier, in 1856,
00:00:28 ‎man basically had 72 wants,
00:00:31 ‎ of which only 16 were necessities,
00:00:35 ‎and men of that day  were being urged by advertisers
00:00:38 ‎to buy about 200 items.
00:00:41 ‎But by 1956,
00:00:44 ‎the number of wants had grown to 474,
00:00:48 ‎of which 94 were viewed as necessities,
00:00:52 ‎and men were being bombarded with ads
00:00:54 ‎to buy about 32,000 articles.
00:00:58 ‎The columnist’s conclusion:
00:01:01 ‎Man’s necessities are few;
00:01:04 ‎his wants, infinite.
00:01:07 ‎Now, if he’d made the same estimates today,
00:01:10 ‎I’m sure the figures would be a lot higher.
00:01:12 ‎The commercial world constantly pressures us
00:01:15 ‎not only to buy things but to view as necessities
00:01:20 ‎things that should really be classified as wants.
00:01:24 ‎Seeing the clear difference  between our needs and our wants
00:01:29 ‎is a key to avoiding the snare of materialism,
00:01:34 ‎and we appreciate the frequent reminders
00:01:38 ‎that we receive  from “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:01:41 ‎These help us to have  the proper view of material things.
00:01:45 ‎For example,  the text today is taken from an article
00:01:48 ‎that had the very clear title  “Seek the Kingdom, Not Things.”
00:01:53 ‎And the theme scripture  was Luke 12:31, where it says:
00:01:58 ‎“Keep seeking his Kingdom,  and these things will be added to you.”
00:02:04 ‎It’s essential  that we have faith in those words.
00:02:08 ‎We fully trust  that Jehovah is going to provide
00:02:12 ‎for our physical needs
00:02:14 ‎as long as we put  his worship first in our lives.
00:02:18 ‎There was a simple definition  of materialism in the study article;
00:02:22 ‎it’s found in paragraph 3.
00:02:24 ‎Now, it didn’t say that materialism  is having a large bank account,
00:02:27 ‎living in a big house,  or driving a fancy automobile.
00:02:31 ‎Rather, it said:
00:02:33 ‎‘Materialism is the preoccupation
00:02:37 ‎‘with material things
00:02:39 ‎rather than with spiritual riches.’
00:02:42 ‎So materialism really is a condition
00:02:46 ‎of our mind and our heart.
00:02:49 ‎So it’s good to ask ourselves:
00:02:51 ‎‘What am I constantly thinking about?
00:02:54 ‎When I get together with my friends,  what is the subject of our conversation?’
00:02:59 ‎As our commenters pointed out,
00:03:01 ‎the spirit of materialism can infect anyone
00:03:04 ‎—even pioneers, even Bethelites.
00:03:08 ‎It infected Christians in the first century.
00:03:11 ‎Please open your Bibles to Revelation chapter 3,
00:03:14 ‎and we’ll notice here  that apparently many in the congregation
00:03:18 ‎had become contaminated  by the materialistic environment
00:03:23 ‎in the city of Laodicea.
00:03:25 ‎And notice the strong counsel that Jesus gave
00:03:29 ‎to those who were putting  their trust in material riches.
00:03:34 ‎Revelation 3:17 says:
00:03:37 ‎“Because you say,
00:03:39 ‎“‘I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,’
00:03:44 ‎“but you do not know that you are miserable
00:03:48 ‎and pitiful and poor and blind and naked.”
00:03:53 ‎Now, were these Christians materially rich?
00:03:55 ‎Yes.
00:03:57 ‎But Jesus said they were in spiritual poverty.
00:04:00 ‎Did they wear fine clothing?
00:04:02 ‎No doubt.
00:04:04 ‎But in Jesus’ eyes, they were naked,
00:04:10 ‎so we can see that they  were in a bad spiritual state.
00:04:15 ‎Was there any cure  for the Laodicean’s spiritual sickness?
00:04:19 ‎Yes.
00:04:20 ‎Look back at chapter 3  and the first part of verse 18.
00:04:23 ‎Interestingly, Jesus told them that the remedy
00:04:27 ‎for trusting in riches was to ‘buy gold.’
00:04:31 ‎But what kind of gold?
00:04:33 ‎He said: “I advise you
00:04:35 ‎“to buy from me gold refined by fire
00:04:40 ‎so that you may become rich.”
00:04:42 ‎Yes, spiritual riches are what are important.
00:04:47 ‎Only spiritual treasures are lasting.
00:04:50 ‎Material possessions  are merely a means to an end.
00:04:53 ‎We need them to keep on living,
00:04:55 ‎and we need them  to carry out our worship of Jehovah.
00:04:58 ‎So we need to ask ourselves:
00:05:00 ‎‘What are my priorities?
00:05:03 ‎Where is my focus?’
00:05:06 ‎Sally and I found ourselves  asking these questions
00:05:09 ‎during a recent branch visit.
00:05:11 ‎We met brothers in countries
00:05:13 ‎where the Kingdom work  is under various degrees of restriction.
00:05:17 ‎They have no witnessing carts.
00:05:19 ‎They can’t offer literature door to door.
00:05:22 ‎In one country, brothers can be arrested
00:05:24 ‎and fined the equivalent of six weeks’ wages
00:05:28 ‎just for witnessing in public.
00:05:31 ‎In some places, police would confiscate  your phone or your tablet
00:05:34 ‎if they found that it contained  the JW Library® app.
00:05:39 ‎In another country, when police  would find JW Library® on your device,
00:05:43 ‎they would just erase the app
00:05:45 ‎and then give the device  back to the publisher.
00:05:48 ‎But in spite of these obstacles and threats,
00:05:52 ‎our brothers are finding  true joy in serving Jehovah.
00:05:56 ‎And you can imagine, it was inspiring
00:05:59 ‎to be able to work  with them during this time.
00:06:02 ‎In one country,  we met with circuit overseers
00:06:04 ‎from three different language groups.
00:06:06 ‎I asked them the question,  “What do our brothers need most?”
00:06:11 ‎In unison, they immediately replied, “Armageddon.”
00:06:19 ‎That really put things in perspective for me.
00:06:22 ‎These brothers  are not preoccupied with material things.
00:06:27 ‎For them,  every day is a matter of spiritual survival.
00:06:33 ‎Stay faithful,  meet regularly, and preach informally
00:06:38 ‎—these are the most important things,  the things that really matter.
00:06:43 ‎So how fitting is the reminder  at Proverbs 11:4, where it says:
00:06:48 ‎“Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,
00:06:51 ‎but righteousness  is what will rescue from death”!
00:06:55 ‎Yes, we may have some possessions  that we view as very valuable.
00:06:59 ‎We may treasure them.
00:07:01 ‎Maybe it’s something  we received as a family heirloom,
00:07:04 ‎but we should not expect  that any of our possessions,
00:07:07 ‎regardless of how treasured  or how valuable they may be,
00:07:11 ‎will survive with us  through the great tribulation.
00:07:15 ‎Please open your Bibles  to Jeremiah chapter 45.
00:07:20 ‎We’re going to read verse 5,
00:07:22 ‎and this scripture will help us to maintain  the proper viewpoint
00:07:26 ‎of material things.
00:07:28 ‎These are words that were directed  to Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch.
00:07:33 ‎Jeremiah 45:5 says:
00:07:35 ‎“‘But you are seeking  great things for yourself.
00:07:38 ‎“‘Stop seeking such things.
00:07:41 ‎“For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,’
00:07:44 ‎“declares Jehovah,
00:07:46 ‎“‘and wherever you may go,
00:07:48 ‎I will grant you your life as a spoil.’”
00:07:53 ‎Whether these “great things”  Baruch was seeking
00:07:55 ‎were material possessions,  we do not know.
00:07:59 ‎What we do know  is that when the great tribulation breaks out,
00:08:04 ‎all of us will be grateful  to come out of that tribulation
00:08:08 ‎with our “life as a spoil.”
00:08:11 ‎And whether we survive  that great tribulation or not,
00:08:15 ‎could very well depend on how  we answer these two questions right now:
00:08:20 ‎What do I want?
00:08:22 ‎What do I need?

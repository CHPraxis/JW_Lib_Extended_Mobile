00:01.483 --> 00:04.020
Is it possible to survive 


00:04.020 --> 00:06.890
the attack of a roaring lion? 


00:06.890 --> 00:08.892
Well, now, I did some 


00:08.892 --> 00:11.995
—just quick—
checking on various wildlife websites, 


00:11.995 --> 00:13.997
and here’s what they say. 


00:13.997 --> 00:16.599
Basically, they all give the same advice 


00:16.598 --> 00:18.868
if you’re being attacked by a lion. 


00:18.868 --> 00:21.470
They say: “Hold your ground. 


00:21.470 --> 00:24.740
Never run or turn back.” 


00:24.740 --> 00:27.610
In fact, one website says: 


00:27.610 --> 00:30.980
“A lion can run 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). 


00:30.980 --> 00:33.115
“So stand still. 


00:33.115 --> 00:37.000
If you run, you will only die tired.” 


00:38.353 --> 00:40.456
Well, that’s true. 


00:40.457 --> 00:43.727
First Peter 5:9 


00:43.727 --> 00:47.130
gives us exactly the same advice. 


00:47.130 --> 00:51.400
It says: “Take your stand against him.” 


00:51.400 --> 00:54.770
Well, in this case 
not against a literal lion, 


00:54.770 --> 00:58.475
but against that “roaring lion,” 
Satan the Devil, 


00:58.475 --> 01:03.345
who is seeking to devour 
every single one of us. 


01:03.345 --> 01:07.950
Our ability to stand firm 
when facing this lion 


01:07.950 --> 01:10.087
—to be able to oppose him, 


01:10.087 --> 01:13.490
to refuse to be intimidated by him, 


01:13.490 --> 01:17.493
to refuse to run away or turn back— 


01:17.493 --> 01:22.131
requires what the apostle Peter 
next mentions there in verse 9, 


01:22.132 --> 01:25.135
and Brother Crane 
so nicely covered in his comment. 


01:25.135 --> 01:28.738
We have to: “Take [our] stand against him, 


01:28.738 --> 01:31.440
firm in the faith.” 


01:31.440 --> 01:35.712
To be successful, 
we must have complete trust 


01:35.712 --> 01:39.415
and complete confidence in Jehovah.


01:39.415 --> 01:42.885
Well, now, in that regard, 
let’s look at an example 


01:42.885 --> 01:47.357
of someone in Bible times who had 
that kind of confidence in Jehovah. 


01:47.357 --> 01:50.894
This is in the days of King Jehoshaphat, 


01:50.893 --> 01:54.330
when Judah was threatened 
by the combined forces 


01:54.330 --> 01:56.332
of Moab, Ammon, 


01:56.332 --> 01:59.369
and the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir. 


01:59.368 --> 02:02.098
Now let’s begin by opening our Bibles 


02:02.098 --> 02:08.110
and reading 2 Chronicles 20:12. 


02:08.110 --> 02:10.913
So here Jehoshaphat is praying to Jehovah; 


02:10.913 --> 02:14.716
he’s pouring out his heart to him, 
and see what he says: 


02:14.717 --> 02:19.722
“O our God, 
will you not execute judgment on them? 


02:19.722 --> 02:23.225
“For we are powerless before this large crowd 


02:23.225 --> 02:25.228
“that is coming against us; 


02:25.228 --> 02:28.531
“and we do not know what we should do, 


02:28.532 --> 02:32.535
but our eyes are toward you.” 


02:32.535 --> 02:36.505
Well, Jehoshaphat was facing the lion. 


02:36.505 --> 02:40.543
He said to Jehovah: 
‘We don’t know what to do.’ 


02:40.543 --> 02:45.548
But Jehoshaphat had complete and total trust; 


02:45.548 --> 02:48.383
he had firm faith in Jehovah. 


02:48.383 --> 02:51.686
Well, what did Jehovah 
tell Jehoshaphat to do? 


02:51.687 --> 02:54.390
See verse 17: 


02:54.390 --> 02:57.660
“You will not need to fight this battle. 


02:57.660 --> 02:59.762
Take your position.” 


02:59.762 --> 03:01.764
Does that sound familiar? 


03:01.763 --> 03:05.568
“Take your position, stand still, 


03:05.568 --> 03:09.538
“and see the salvation of Jehovah 
in your behalf. 


03:09.538 --> 03:11.540
“O Judah and Jerusalem, 


03:11.540 --> 03:13.977
“do not be afraid or be terrified. 


03:13.977 --> 03:16.412
“Tomorrow go out against them, 


03:16.412 --> 03:19.449
and Jehovah will be with you.” 


03:19.448 --> 03:22.218
Well, what did Jehovah tell them to do? 


03:22.218 --> 03:27.090
He said: ‘Take a position 
in opposition to that military force, 


03:27.090 --> 03:30.693
‘stand firm, refuse to run away, 


03:30.693 --> 03:34.796
and see the salvation 
that will come from Jehovah.’ 


03:34.797 --> 03:36.799
Well, in order to do that, 


03:36.798 --> 03:39.101
Jehoshaphat and the people with him 


03:39.102 --> 03:44.482
would need to have strong, firm, solid faith. 


03:44.482 --> 03:46.484
Well, now, to help the people, 


03:46.483 --> 03:48.578
look at what Jehoshaphat said to them 


03:48.578 --> 03:50.680
as they were getting ready for this battle. 


03:50.680 --> 03:55.385
In verse 20, you see, 
just about the middle of the verse, 


03:55.385 --> 03:58.520
it says: 
“Jehoshaphat stood up and said: 


03:58.520 --> 04:02.992
“‘Listen to me, O Judah 
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! 


04:02.992 --> 04:06.762
“‘Put faith in Jehovah your God 


04:06.762 --> 04:10.334
“‘so that you may be able to stand firm. 


04:10.333 --> 04:12.968
“‘Put faith in his prophets, 


04:12.968 --> 04:16.605
and you will be successful.’” 


04:16.605 --> 04:18.975
Well, that’s exactly what happened. 


04:18.975 --> 04:21.277
See, with that kind of confidence in Jehovah, 


04:21.277 --> 04:25.549
with that firm trust in him, 
with that standing firm, 


04:25.548 --> 04:27.550
what did Jehovah do? 


04:27.550 --> 04:30.320
Well, according to verses 22 and 23


04:30.320 --> 04:32.332
—you’ll remember what happened—


04:32.332 --> 04:35.559
the men of Ammon, Moab, 
and the inhabitants 


04:35.558 --> 04:37.893
of the mountainous region of Seir, 


04:37.893 --> 04:41.196
they all went to striking down one another. 


04:41.197 --> 04:43.499
And verse 23 says: 


04:43.498 --> 04:45.768
“And the Ammonites and the Moabites 


04:45.768 --> 04:49.505
“turned against the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir 


04:49.505 --> 04:51.907
“to destroy and annihilate them; 


04:51.907 --> 04:54.777
“and when they finished 
with the inhabitants of Seir, 


04:54.777 --> 04:58.147
they helped to destroy one another.” 


04:58.147 --> 05:03.152
Well, Jehovah had rewarded 
their firm faith in him. 


05:03.152 --> 05:05.422
The weapons that had been formed 


05:05.422 --> 05:10.192
against Jehoshaphat and his people 
had no success. 


05:10.192 --> 05:12.762
Well, now, 
sometimes we think, of course, 


05:12.762 --> 05:17.534
that these kinds of situations 
only happened in Bible times. 


05:17.533 --> 05:21.870
But it’s amazing to see 
how our brothers in our modern day 


05:21.870 --> 05:23.940
have had that same kind of faith 


05:23.940 --> 05:27.277
and have stood firm against the lion. 


05:27.277 --> 05:29.279
Here are just a couple of experiences 


05:29.278 --> 05:31.713
that really touched my heart. 


05:31.713 --> 05:35.751
Here’s one about a brother 
named Pavel from Russia. 


05:35.752 --> 05:37.754
In 1958, 


05:37.753 --> 05:41.023
Pavel was arrested for religious activities. 


05:41.023 --> 05:43.491
“Accompanying me to the train,” he says, 


05:43.492 --> 05:45.729
“the officer [with me] said, 


05:45.728 --> 05:48.530
“‘Look at your wife for the last time 


05:48.530 --> 05:51.400
because you will never see her again.’” 


05:51.400 --> 05:53.535
Well, there’s the lion. 


05:53.535 --> 05:58.207
“I spent six months 
in solitary confinement before my trial. 


05:58.207 --> 06:01.910
“During interrogations, . . . 
the investigators did everything 


06:01.910 --> 06:04.013
“to undermine my faith. 


06:04.013 --> 06:06.581
“Sometimes violence was used. 


06:06.582 --> 06:11.587
I begged Jehovah 
to give me the strength to stay firm.” 


06:11.587 --> 06:14.190
But now look what happened. 


06:14.190 --> 06:16.892
“During a routine interrogation, 


06:16.892 --> 06:20.964
“the investigator called me 
into his study and [he] said: 


06:20.963 --> 06:24.466
“‘Now we will show you 
what your organization is doing. 


06:24.467 --> 06:27.804
“Then you can see 
if it is God’s work or not!’ 


06:27.803 --> 06:31.106
“Looking at me intently, he continued: 


06:31.107 --> 06:34.510
“‘This year your convention in New York 


06:34.510 --> 06:37.780
“‘was attended by 253,000 people 


06:37.780 --> 06:39.782
“‘in two stadiums. 


06:39.782 --> 06:42.885
“The convention lasted eight days.’ 


06:42.885 --> 06:46.222
“The investigator strewed 
the table with photographs. 


06:46.222 --> 06:49.025
“In one of them, 
I saw happy delegates 


06:49.025 --> 06:52.262
“in colorful native dress 
embracing one another. 


06:52.262 --> 06:55.499
“Another photo showed 
Brother Knorr giving a talk, 


06:55.498 --> 06:58.533
“and yet others showed the baptism. 


06:58.533 --> 07:02.738
“The investigator could not even imagine 


07:02.738 --> 07:04.940
“what I was feeling at that moment. 


07:04.940 --> 07:07.610
“I felt that I was attending the convention 


07:07.610 --> 07:10.447
“without ever having left the prison. 


07:10.447 --> 07:14.184
“I felt new strength flooding into me. 


07:14.183 --> 07:17.253
“[It was just what] I had needed. 


07:17.253 --> 07:21.456
“. . . And Jehovah generously 
blessed me in a special way. 


07:21.457 --> 07:24.194
I was ready to endure further.” 


07:24.193 --> 07:26.195
Isn’t that amazing?


07:26.195 --> 07:28.430
Here’s another similar experience, 


07:28.430 --> 07:31.167
1960, also in Russia, 


07:31.167 --> 07:34.670
a large publicized trial 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


07:34.670 --> 07:37.840
About 300 persons 
were present in the courtroom, 


07:37.840 --> 07:41.010
including many of our brothers and sisters. 


07:41.010 --> 07:43.012
Well, as the evidence—


07:43.012 --> 07:45.147
As evidence against the brothers, 


07:45.147 --> 07:50.152
the prosecutor decided to present 
a letter from Nathan H. Knorr. 


07:50.152 --> 07:53.689
One of the brothers 
who attended the trial said this: 


07:53.688 --> 07:57.058
“The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter 


07:57.058 --> 07:59.661
“that had been intercepted by the KGB 


07:59.662 --> 08:03.065
“from Brother Knorr 
to the brothers in the Soviet Union. 


08:03.065 --> 08:06.268
“For all of us Witnesses present in the hall, 


08:06.268 --> 08:08.971
“it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah. 


08:08.972 --> 08:11.340
“This letter warmed our hearts! 


08:11.340 --> 08:14.077
“We heard wise counsel from the Bible 


08:14.077 --> 08:17.547
“and encouragement to serve 
our fellow believers lovingly 


08:17.547 --> 08:20.684
“and to stay faithful [even] under trials. 


08:20.683 --> 08:23.151
“The prosecutor read the letter 


08:23.152 --> 08:26.055
“from the beginning to the very end. 


08:26.055 --> 08:28.723
“We listened with rapt attention. 


08:28.723 --> 08:32.000
It seemed to us that we were 
attending a convention!”


08:33.997 --> 08:37.165
Well, now, brothers, what additional lessons 


08:37.165 --> 08:40.770
do we learn from these two experiences? 


08:40.770 --> 08:44.573
When we stand our ground against Satan, 


08:44.573 --> 08:46.575
firm in the faith, 


08:46.575 --> 08:49.478
then Jehovah will do just what he promised 


08:49.478 --> 08:52.381
at 1 Peter 5:10. 


08:52.382 --> 08:54.517
Do you see what it says there? 


08:54.517 --> 08:57.854
“But after you have suffered a little while, 


08:57.853 --> 09:00.723
“the God of all undeserved kindness, 


09:00.723 --> 09:04.493
“who called you to his everlasting glory 
in union with Christ, 


09:04.493 --> 09:07.796
“will himself finish your training. 


09:07.797 --> 09:09.799
“He will make you firm, 


09:09.798 --> 09:11.900
“he will make you strong, 


09:11.900 --> 09:14.837
he will firmly ground you.” 


09:14.837 --> 09:16.839
So, brothers, 


09:16.838 --> 09:21.110
can we survive the attack of a roaring lion? 


09:21.110 --> 09:23.112
Absolutely! 


09:23.112 --> 09:27.182
With firm faith, let’s stand fast 


09:27.182 --> 09:36.677
and see the salvation from Jehovah.

00:01.317 --> 00:04.320
Let’s consider the account that’s referred to

00:04.320 --> 00:06.356
in our Watchtower comments.

00:06.356 --> 00:08.191
If you turn with me in your Bibles

00:08.191 --> 00:10.193
to the book of Luke,

00:10.193 --> 00:12.195
we’ll read this in its entirety.

00:12.195 --> 00:13.730
Follow with me, please,

00:13.730 --> 00:17.734
at Luke 10:38-42.

00:22.405 --> 00:24.607
It says: 
“Now as they went on their way,

00:24.607 --> 00:26.910
“he entered into a certain village.

00:26.910 --> 00:31.548
“Here a woman named Martha 
received him as a guest in her house.

00:31.548 --> 00:35.418
“She also had a sister called Mary, 
who sat down at the feet of the Lord

00:35.418 --> 00:38.021
“and kept listening to what he was saying.

00:38.021 --> 00:40.023
“Martha, on the other hand,

00:40.023 --> 00:43.993
“was distracted 
with attending to many duties.

00:43.993 --> 00:46.096
“So she came to him and said:

00:46.096 --> 00:48.832
“‘Lord, does it not matter to you

00:48.832 --> 00:52.135
“‘that my sister 
has left me alone to attend to things?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.504
“Tell her to come and help me.’

00:54.504 --> 00:56.506
“In answer the Lord said to her:

00:56.506 --> 00:59.175
“‘Martha, Martha,

00:59.175 --> 01:02.912
“‘you are anxious 
and disturbed about many things.

01:02.912 --> 01:06.916
“‘A few things, though, 
are needed, or just one.

01:06.916 --> 01:10.787
“‘For her part, 
Mary chose the good portion,

01:10.787 --> 01:13.523
and it will not be taken away from her.’”

01:14.958 --> 01:17.961
Did you note in verse 40, 
it said that Martha

01:17.961 --> 01:22.665
“was distracted 
with attending to many duties”?

01:23.500 --> 01:27.670
It’s quite likely that Martha 
may not have felt that way.

01:27.670 --> 01:31.074
After all, she was not engaged 
in some sort of hobby

01:31.074 --> 01:33.076
or materialistic pursuit,

01:33.076 --> 01:36.146
and her duties were certainly not trivial.

01:36.146 --> 01:39.983
She was tending to the needs of Jesus.

01:39.983 --> 01:44.487
Now, we think about that
—taking care of the Messiah, the Son of God.

01:44.487 --> 01:47.056
That had to be one of the greatest privileges

01:47.056 --> 01:50.160
and one of the greatest honors 
an individual could have.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.495
So it’s no wonder that in verse 40

01:52.495 --> 01:56.032
she encourages Jesus 
to tell her sister, Mary,

01:56.032 --> 01:58.768
to come and help her.

01:58.768 --> 02:03.239
But this raises an interesting question:

02:03.239 --> 02:06.342
Is it possible for Christians today

02:06.342 --> 02:09.212
to become distracted

02:09.212 --> 02:13.950
even while engaging 
in worthwhile theocratic pursuits?

02:14.918 --> 02:17.353
Well, consider three examples.

02:17.353 --> 02:19.823
We want to do more in the ministry,

02:19.823 --> 02:23.426
so we decide to learn a new language.

02:23.426 --> 02:28.198
We focus on learning the language, 
but in the process,

02:28.198 --> 02:32.969
we neglect time to read 
and study the Bible in our mother tongue.

02:34.270 --> 02:39.008
Or perhaps we decide we’re going to move 
and serve where the need is greater,

02:39.008 --> 02:44.047
and we begin to occupy so much 
of our time in learning about the country

02:44.047 --> 02:46.482
—its customs and the food—

02:46.482 --> 02:49.452
that that begins to overshadow

02:49.452 --> 02:52.455
our family worship and personal study.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.192
Or how about our Bethel assignment?

02:56.192 --> 02:58.194
We love our assignment.

02:58.194 --> 02:59.562
Our work is very interesting.

02:59.562 --> 03:02.165
We enjoy working hard.

03:02.165 --> 03:06.369
But we become so absorbed 
in staying ahead in our work

03:06.369 --> 03:08.371
and keeping things moving

03:08.371 --> 03:13.209
that we begin to do 
self-imposed overtime work

03:13.209 --> 03:15.378
on a regular basis,

03:15.378 --> 03:17.914
neglecting our meeting attendance

03:17.914 --> 03:20.416
and perhaps even time with our mate.

03:21.718 --> 03:23.720
Did you notice that each situation

03:23.720 --> 03:27.891
began as a worthwhile theocratic endeavor?

03:27.891 --> 03:30.994
But can we see how it’s possible

03:30.994 --> 03:33.897
that each hypothetical situation

03:33.897 --> 03:36.900
could become a realistic distraction?

03:38.101 --> 03:41.604
Now, let’s just go back 
for a moment to the account in Luke

03:41.604 --> 03:45.141
because it’s important 
to note that Jesus never said

03:45.141 --> 03:48.645
that what Martha was doing was wrong.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.247
Like our text mentioned, he loved Martha.

03:51.247 --> 03:52.849
She was a spiritual woman,

03:52.849 --> 03:57.020
and he was very appreciative 
for what she was doing in his behalf.

03:57.020 --> 04:01.524
But he very kindly reminds her and shows her

04:01.524 --> 04:04.327
that her meal preparations 
were distracting her

04:04.327 --> 04:07.797
to the point 
that it interfered with her receiving

04:07.797 --> 04:12.802
what he refers to in verse 42 
as “the good portion”

04:12.802 --> 04:17.473
—a spiritual activity, 
listening to his teachings.

04:17.473 --> 04:22.111
Martha was not taking advantage 
of a unique opportunity

04:22.111 --> 04:24.781
to deepen her faith.

04:24.781 --> 04:28.251
Very interestingly, 
the September 1, 1999, Watchtower

04:28.251 --> 04:32.588
elaborates on this account, 
and it makes this comment.

04:32.588 --> 04:34.991
It says: 
“Moved by love, some [today]

04:34.991 --> 04:38.161
“—much like Martha— 
do their utmost to minister

04:38.161 --> 04:40.229
“to the needs of fellow believers.

04:40.229 --> 04:43.232
“They are practical-minded 
and quick to take action,

04:43.232 --> 04:47.337
“and Jehovah promises 
to reward their labors of love.

04:47.337 --> 04:51.641
“Others perhaps more closely resemble Mary.

04:51.641 --> 04:54.143
“They are quiet and contemplative.

04:54.143 --> 04:56.879
“Their eagerness to meditate upon God’s Word

04:56.879 --> 05:00.984
helps them 
to stay solidly rooted in the faith.”

05:00.984 --> 05:04.020
But then it says this:

05:04.020 --> 05:09.025
“Both . . . fill a vital need 
in the Christian congregation.”

05:09.025 --> 05:13.329
And by extension, 
we’ll just add in the Bethel family as well.

05:13.329 --> 05:15.732
It continues: 
“In the end, however,

05:15.732 --> 05:18.267
“all should ‘choose the good portion’

05:18.267 --> 05:21.704
“by putting [spiritual or] primary emphasis

05:21.704 --> 05:24.273
on spiritual things.”

05:24.273 --> 05:27.343
Well, that helps us 
to see the balance, doesn’t it?

05:27.343 --> 05:30.546
It makes me think, 
perhaps in a modern-day application,

05:30.546 --> 05:34.484
what if the circuit overseer 
came to visit our congregation

05:34.484 --> 05:38.721
and everyone wanted to go out 
and work with him in the ministry,

05:38.721 --> 05:43.559
but no one was willing to stop 
and provide him with a meal?

05:43.559 --> 05:46.896
That wouldn’t be good, 
would it, or hospitable?

05:46.896 --> 05:51.234
Just like it wouldn’t be balanced 
for him to have multiple meal invitations,

05:51.234 --> 05:55.438
and then no one showed up 
to support him and his wife in the ministry.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.341
So the point is, 
we want to make sure

05:58.341 --> 06:01.310
that we care for our needs 
and the needs of others

06:01.310 --> 06:06.315
but also make sure 
that we remember our priorities.

06:06.315 --> 06:08.718
So, what’s the key to ensuring

06:08.718 --> 06:11.954
that our endeavors 
will not become distractions?

06:11.954 --> 06:14.457
Well, notice how the Bible explains this.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.793
Turn with me, please, 
to Philippians chapter 1.

06:20.229 --> 06:23.900
At Philippians chapter 1, 
notice verses 9 and 10:

06:27.503 --> 06:30.273
“And this is what I continue praying,

06:30.273 --> 06:33.409
“that your love 
may abound still more and more

06:33.409 --> 06:35.978
“with accurate knowledge 
and full discernment;

06:35.978 --> 06:39.816
“that you may make sure 
of the more important things,

06:39.816 --> 06:43.119
“so that you may be flawless 
and not stumbling others

06:43.119 --> 06:45.788
up to the day of Christ.”

06:45.788 --> 06:50.593
So before we undertake 
any endeavor, any assignment,

06:50.593 --> 06:54.697
you notice we want to pray, 
reason things out,

06:54.697 --> 06:57.567
use accurate knowledge, and discernment.

06:57.567 --> 07:01.771
And if we’re able to use that insight 
—good judgment—

07:01.771 --> 07:06.109
then it’s going to help us 
to discern, or perceive,

07:06.109 --> 07:09.011
what is most important to God.

07:09.011 --> 07:13.349
And when we know that, 
well, then, we can harmonize our thoughts,

07:13.349 --> 07:16.519
our actions, 
and our decisions accordingly.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.322
By making sure 
of the more important things,

07:19.322 --> 07:22.825
we gain Jehovah’s blessing and favor.

07:22.825 --> 07:26.329
So think about those situations we mentioned.

07:26.329 --> 07:28.464
If we’re going to learn a new language

07:28.464 --> 07:30.466
or move where the need is greater,

07:30.466 --> 07:32.502
well, that’s amazing!

07:32.502 --> 07:35.071
It’s appreciated, and it’s definitely needed.

07:35.071 --> 07:38.407
In fact, we’re encouraged to do it 
if we have the circumstances.

07:38.407 --> 07:42.812
And, of course, in our Bethel assignment, 
who of us does not want to work hard,

07:42.812 --> 07:46.582
to get to know our work well, 
and give our all to Jehovah?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.219
But we can appreciate

07:50.219 --> 07:54.090
how Jesus shows us 
a valuable and balanced lesson

07:54.090 --> 07:58.094
—that even in worthwhile theocratic pursuits,

07:58.094 --> 08:01.130
we should not let anything distract

08:01.130 --> 08:04.267
or impede our spiritual progress.

08:04.267 --> 08:07.970
We don’t want to miss 
opportunities to strengthen our faith,

08:07.970 --> 08:10.806
to bond with our brothers and sisters,

08:10.806 --> 08:13.976
and, most importantly, to bond with Jehovah.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.079
If we just go back to Luke,

08:17.079 --> 08:21.017
notice how Jesus 
concluded his words to Martha.

08:21.017 --> 08:23.152
In verse 42, he says

08:23.152 --> 08:26.155
that because ‘Mary chose the good portion,

08:26.155 --> 08:30.159
it will not be taken away from her.’

08:30.159 --> 08:32.695
So, what she learned that day

08:32.695 --> 08:36.866
—the commendation, 
the spiritual instruction from Jesus—

08:36.866 --> 08:38.935
Mary would never forget that.

08:38.935 --> 08:43.306
That would stay with her 
for the rest of her life.

08:43.306 --> 08:48.311
And likely, 
we can recall a similar account

08:48.311 --> 08:53.182
—maybe a talk, a meeting, 
something that was said at the convention,

08:53.182 --> 08:55.751
a spiritual discussion 
that we had with someone—

08:55.751 --> 08:58.287
and that conversation, or discussion,

08:58.287 --> 09:03.159
had a profound impact on our faith 
and our relationship with Jehovah.

09:03.859 --> 09:05.861
Well, if you’ve had situations like that,

09:05.861 --> 09:07.930
you know that those are precious;

09:07.930 --> 09:09.932
they’re very special.

09:09.932 --> 09:12.935
And those are things 
that we want to hold on to.

09:14.270 --> 09:16.439
So, what a beautiful reminder we had today.

09:16.439 --> 09:18.975
And let’s not be distracted.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.110
May we work to strengthen our spirituality

09:21.110 --> 09:23.112
and relationship with Jehovah

09:23.112 --> 09:26.215
by always choosing “the good portion,”

09:26.215 --> 09:37.620
and if we do, we can be assured 
that Jehovah will bless our efforts.

00:01 ‎Over 100 years ago,
00:04 ‎on October 31, 1916,
00:07 ‎Brother Charles Taze Russell
00:10 ‎was traveling on a train
00:12 ‎as part of a lecture tour
00:13 ‎across the United States.
00:15 ‎Quite unexpectedly,
00:17 ‎and at the young age of 64,
00:21 ‎Brother Russell died.
00:23 ‎For years, he had been traveling continually.
00:27 ‎You know, it’s been said  that Brother Russell covered
00:31 ‎more than a million miles.
00:33 ‎Now, of course, some of you  may have accomplished that feat,
00:36 ‎but at that time, of course,  we were not talking about air travel.
00:40 ‎Brother Russell  had to accomplish that by train and ship
00:44 ‎and goodness knows what other means —quite an accomplishment!
00:47 ‎In addition to that, he had delivered
00:50 ‎more than 30,000 sermons, lectures, and talks.
00:55 ‎He had written books and other material
00:58 ‎totaling over 50,000 pages.
01:01 ‎Yet, despite all of the privileges  that he had enjoyed
01:05 ‎​—his tremendous Bible knowledge
01:07 ‎and the powerful way  that Jehovah had used him​—
01:11 ‎in just a moment he was gone.
01:15 ‎It really illustrates  the truth of what James says here
01:19 ‎at James 4:​13, 14.
01:22 ‎Let’s read this together,
01:25 ‎James 4:​13.
01:28 ‎It says: “Come, now, you who say:
01:30 ‎“‘Today or tomorrow we will travel
01:32 ‎“‘to this city and will spend a year there,
01:34 ‎“and we will do business and make some profit,’
01:38 ‎“whereas you do not know  what your life will be like tomorrow.
01:43 ‎“For you are a mist  that appears for a little while
01:46 ‎and then disappears.”
01:48 ‎Well, that’s true.
01:50 ‎You see, really, no matter  what privileges we may enjoy​
01:54 ‎—how skilled a teacher we may be,  what knowledge we’ve accumulated​—
01:58 ‎we are all just like
02:00 ‎‘a mist appearing for a while  and then disappearing.’
02:04 ‎Well, this is an idea
02:06 ‎that occurs over and over again  in the Scriptures
02:09 ‎and, really, with the purpose
02:11 ‎of encouraging all of us
02:13 ‎to take  a close and sober and serious look
02:18 ‎at the way that we use our lives.
02:20 ‎And even more importantly,
02:22 ‎how we use them to serve Jehovah.
02:25 ‎In Luke chapter 12,
02:27 ‎you’ll remember that Jesus taught  an illustration regarding a rich man.
02:31 ‎Do you remember this?
02:32 ‎Let’s open our Bibles and read it together,
02:34 ‎Luke 12:16.
02:38 ‎Now, just before we read it,  you’ll remember that the purpose
02:41 ‎of Jesus giving this illustration  was to emphasize the importance
02:45 ‎of being rich toward God.
02:47 ‎Now, let’s read  what he says here in verse 16:
02:50 ‎“The land of a rich man produced well.
02:53 ‎“So he began reasoning within himself,
02:56 ‎“‘What should I do now that I have  nowhere to gather my crops?’
03:00 ‎“Then he said, ‘I will do this:
03:03 ‎“‘I will tear down  my storehouses and build bigger ones,
03:06 ‎“‘and there I will gather  all my grain and all my goods,
03:10 ‎“‘and I will say to myself:
03:12 ‎“‘“You have many  good things stored up for many years;
03:16 ‎take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’
03:21 ‎“But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one,
03:25 ‎“‘this night they are demanding  your life from you.
03:29 ‎“Who, then, is to have  the things you stored up?’
03:33 ‎“So it goes with the man  who stores up treasure for himself
03:37 ‎but is not rich toward God.”
03:41 ‎Well, what was the problem with this man?
03:44 ‎In the 2007 Watchtower,  August 1st issue,
03:48 ‎this illustration was discussed.
03:50 ‎And The Watchtower said  that “the rich man’s plan
03:55 ‎“provided [really] only a false sense of security.
03:59 ‎“Practical as it might have seemed [to him],
04:02 ‎“it left out one vital element​—God’s will.
04:07 ‎“The man was only thinking about himself,
04:09 ‎“how he would be able to take his ease
04:12 ‎“and eat, drink, and enjoy himself.
04:15 ‎“He thought that because [he had]  ‘many good things,’
04:19 ‎he would also have ‘many years.’”
04:22 ‎Isn’t that an interesting point?
04:24 ‎You see, he thought the abundance  of things that he possessed
04:27 ‎would somehow equate  to the length of his life.
04:30 ‎But The Watchtower went on to say:
04:32 ‎“Too bad for him,  things did not work out that way.
04:36 ‎“Just as Jesus said earlier,  ‘even when a person has an abundance
04:41 ‎his life does not result  from the things he possesses.’”
04:46 ‎Well, that brings us back to James chapter 4.
04:49 ‎Let’s go back there again,
04:52 ‎and look at what verse 15 says.
04:54 ‎See, after commenting on how  a life is just like a mist appearing,
04:58 ‎then verse 15 says:
05:00 ‎“Instead, you should say:  ‘If Jehovah wills,
05:04 ‎we will live and do this or that.’”
05:08 ‎You see, the Bible makes it clear  that we should never ever develop
05:12 ‎overconfidence —overconfidence in anything​—
05:15 ‎in our position, our knowledge,  our wisdom, our wealth.
05:19 ‎But instead, you see,  have complete confidence in Jehovah.
05:24 ‎Really, our only hope,
05:27 ‎our only confidence is with Jehovah.
05:30 ‎Now, this applies  not just to our view of life itself
05:34 ‎but, really,  also to our view of all of our activities.
05:38 ‎You see, in that verse in James chapter 4,
05:42 ‎it says that it’s not just about our life
05:44 ‎but about whether we will do this or do that.
05:47 ‎So it really applies to all
05:49 ‎of the different things that we do every day.
05:52 ‎Recently, we’ve been hearing reports
05:56 ‎of increasing persecution  in various lands, including Russia.
06:01 ‎Now, when we hear those reports,
06:03 ‎perhaps we begin to think right away
06:06 ‎that this is something  that could only happen in a faraway land.
06:10 ‎You see, in countries like  the United States and Canada
06:13 ‎(those who are listening to this program),
06:15 ‎perhaps we have the attitude that, well,
06:19 ‎this freedom of worship that we enjoy
06:22 ‎is always going to be here,  and it will never change.
06:26 ‎But it’s interesting  to consider what happened in one case
06:29 ‎in 1972 in the country of Singapore.
06:33 ‎On January 12, 1972,
06:37 ‎a missionary  who was serving at the branch,
06:40 ‎received a letter suddenly ​—hand delivered to him​—
06:44 ‎saying that he was banished  from the country
06:47 ‎and must leave within two weeks.
06:49 ‎Now, this brother  had been serving there peacefully
06:52 ‎for 23 years;
06:55 ‎everything was going along very smoothly.
06:58 ‎Two days later,  the Kingdom Hall was padlocked,
07:01 ‎all the literature was banned in the country,
07:05 ‎the bank accounts  that belonged to the branch
07:08 ‎and to the congregation were all seized.
07:11 ‎Well, suddenly  and very unexpectedly our work
07:16 ‎and all of our activities  had been banned in that country.
07:20 ‎Well, now, what do we learn from this?
07:22 ‎Is it to teach us that we should live  in some kind of morbid fear
07:27 ‎that our work is going to be banned  at any moment?
07:31 ‎Well, what’s the real reality  of what happened in Singapore?
07:35 ‎How did those unexpected events
07:38 ‎affect our brothers in that land?
07:41 ‎Well, they were not broken.
07:43 ‎Looking to Jehovah  with complete confidence,
07:46 ‎they continued to find ways  to worship Jehovah.
07:50 ‎And Jehovah has blessed their efforts
07:52 ‎right up until this present day.
07:56 ‎So, brothers, it’s true,
07:58 ‎as James chapter 4 teaches us,
08:00 ‎life in this system  is really filled with uncertainty.
08:05 ‎But if we have made Jehovah our confidence
08:09 ‎and if we are truly rich toward God,
08:12 ‎then, really, whatever may come,
08:15 ‎whatever situation may befall us
08:17 ‎​—even our untimely death​—
08:21 ‎we are completely  and totally safe with Jehovah.
08:26 ‎And he is the One ​—because we’ve made him our confidence​—
08:29 ‎who will care for us in every way.

00:01.351 --> 00:05.021
Imitation really is built into human nature.

00:05.021 --> 00:07.424
It’s one of our most used

00:07.424 --> 00:09.492
and powerful learning tools.

00:09.492 --> 00:11.027
I mean, think of all the things

00:11.027 --> 00:12.629
that you’ve learned by imitation.

00:12.629 --> 00:13.630
Even just think

00:13.630 --> 00:15.331
of the current work assignments you have

00:15.331 --> 00:16.866
or your job.

00:16.866 --> 00:21.337
How much of it did you learn 
by just watching someone else do that work?

00:21.337 --> 00:25.208
Children imitate their parents 
when they learn how to speak,

00:25.208 --> 00:28.478
think, eat, and even walk just like them.

00:28.478 --> 00:32.582
Children even learn to imitate 
the very subtle accents of their parents,

00:32.582 --> 00:36.519
and those accents get passed on 
from one generation to the next.

00:36.519 --> 00:40.557
I’ve had people say to me, 
“John, you walk just like your father.”

00:40.557 --> 00:42.559
I have no idea how that happened.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.165
Sometimes we imitate others, 
and we don’t even know that we’re doing it.

00:49.165 --> 00:51.601
Have you ever been listening to the radio,

00:51.601 --> 00:54.904
and a few hours later 
you’re humming or singing a song,

00:54.904 --> 00:57.607
and you realize that that was the very song

00:57.607 --> 01:01.344
that was on the radio several hours ago?

01:01.344 --> 01:04.314
Imitation is such a part

01:04.314 --> 01:07.984
of the human learning experience 
that we’re doing it all the time.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.386
We can’t turn it off.

01:10.386 --> 01:13.456
Imitation is also used by animals

01:13.456 --> 01:16.226
to learn their skills 
by watching their parents.

01:16.226 --> 01:18.294
I saw the cutest example of this

01:18.294 --> 01:21.564
when we were watching 
a herd of elephants in Zambia.

01:21.564 --> 01:24.734
The mother elephant 
and the baby elephant were walking by,

01:24.734 --> 01:28.538
and the baby elephant 
was trying to grab some grass

01:28.538 --> 01:32.108
and tear it off and put it in his mouth 
like his mother was;

01:32.108 --> 01:35.512
but every time he did it, 
he ended up with nothing.

01:35.512 --> 01:39.182
But he was sure watching his mom 
—how she was doing it—

01:39.182 --> 01:43.453
and seeing how he could imitate 
and get some of that for himself.

01:44.420 --> 01:49.259
Well, since imitation 
is such a powerful learning tool

01:49.259 --> 01:51.628
and has such an effect on the person we are

01:51.628 --> 01:54.264
and the person that we are to become,

01:54.264 --> 01:57.400
we need to be very careful 
about who we choose to imitate.

01:58.401 --> 02:01.504
Who do you choose to imitate?

02:01.504 --> 02:06.075
Well, see, who we choose to imitate 
determines who we want to become.

02:06.075 --> 02:10.680
That’s why there’s so much caution 
in the Scriptures about our association,

02:10.680 --> 02:15.185
because who we choose to imitate 
rubs off on us, so to speak,

02:15.185 --> 02:18.688
in subtle ways 
that we might not even notice right away.

02:18.688 --> 02:21.224
Notice the counsel given to the Israelites

02:21.224 --> 02:24.327
about not imitating the nations around them.

02:24.327 --> 02:28.898
If you look at Exodus 23:24,

02:28.898 --> 02:31.901
notice the counsel 
that Jehovah gave to the Israelites.

02:33.203 --> 02:36.139
He said: 
“You must not bow down to their gods

02:36.139 --> 02:38.641
“or be persuaded to serve them,

02:38.641 --> 02:42.979
and you must not imitate their practices.”

02:42.979 --> 02:47.984
And he continues this thought 
at Deuteronomy 18:9.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.959
Deuteronomy 18:9, it says:

02:55.959 --> 02:59.362
“When you have entered into the land 
that Jehovah your God is giving you,

02:59.362 --> 03:02.332
“you must not learn to imitate

03:02.332 --> 03:06.069
the detestable practices of those nations.”

03:07.003 --> 03:11.274
Well, what happened when the Israelites 
chose to imitate the nations around them,

03:11.274 --> 03:14.344
to ignore the advice Jehovah had given them?

03:14.344 --> 03:18.414
Well, let’s look at 2 Kings 17:15.

03:20.750 --> 03:24.287
Second Kings 17:15:

03:28.157 --> 03:31.461
“They continued rejecting 
his regulations and his covenant

03:31.461 --> 03:33.396
“that he had made with their forefathers

03:33.396 --> 03:36.065
“and his reminders 
that he had given to warn them,

03:36.065 --> 03:38.968
“and they kept following worthless idols

03:38.968 --> 03:41.337
“[And notice what happened 
to them when they did that.]

03:41.337 --> 03:43.806
“and became worthless themselves,

03:43.806 --> 03:46.276
“imitating the nations all around them

03:46.276 --> 03:50.380
that Jehovah 
had commanded them not to imitate.”

03:50.380 --> 03:54.517
So if we imitate worthless things, 
what’s going to happen to us?

03:54.517 --> 03:56.586
We’re going to be worthless.

03:56.586 --> 03:58.955
If we fast-forward to Christian times,

03:58.955 --> 04:02.659
we can see 
that the same advice was given to us.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.528
If we look at 3 John 11,

04:10.133 --> 04:12.135
it’s very straightforward advice:

04:12.135 --> 04:16.172
“Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad,

04:16.172 --> 04:19.142
“but imitate what is good.

04:19.142 --> 04:21.778
“The one who does good originates with God.

04:21.778 --> 04:25.014
The one who does bad has not seen God.”

04:25.014 --> 04:26.683
Well, the message is clear.

04:26.683 --> 04:31.087
If we want to ‘see God,’ 
or have a good relationship with Jehovah,

04:31.087 --> 04:33.890
then we need to imitate what is good.

04:33.890 --> 04:37.393
And our text for today at Ephesians 5:1

04:37.393 --> 04:41.331
really says it 
about as simply and clearly as we can:

04:41.331 --> 04:44.100
“Become imitators of God.”

04:44.100 --> 04:48.438
So Jehovah is telling us 
in our text for today: ‘Imitate me.’

04:48.438 --> 04:51.607
So if someone asks us,
“Who do you choose to imitate?”

04:51.607 --> 04:54.177
we follow the advice of Ephesians 5:1;

04:54.177 --> 04:56.879
we want to imitate Jehovah.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.415
Well, how can we imitate Jehovah?

04:59.415 --> 05:02.852
Well, first, one way is by reading the Bible.

05:02.852 --> 05:06.856
We have learned love, hope, faith, loyalty,

05:06.856 --> 05:09.058
and so many other fine qualities

05:09.058 --> 05:13.162
by reading about how Jehovah 
wants us to conduct ourselves.

05:13.162 --> 05:17.400
I mean, look at the Law 
that Jehovah gave to the nation of Israel.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.236
We can learn so much about how Jehovah

05:20.236 --> 05:25.241
feels about being honest, clean, fair, just.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.278
Or in different Bible examples, 
we see Jehovah’s patience

05:29.278 --> 05:33.950
in dealing with Jonah 
and His mercy in dealing with the Ninevites.

05:35.051 --> 05:38.121
Reading the Bible 
gives us a very clear picture

05:38.121 --> 05:40.590
of our perfect God, Jehovah, 
who we worship.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.260
And he gives us 
the perfect role model to imitate.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.096
When we read the Bible 
and continually ask ourselves,

05:47.096 --> 05:51.534
‘What do I learn about Jehovah, 
and how can I learn to imitate him?’

05:51.534 --> 05:55.505
that really is like us keeping our eye 
on Jehovah, with our mind’s eye,

05:55.505 --> 05:59.208
and watching what he’s doing, 
and we’re imitating him.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.678
Another way that we can imitate Jehovah

06:02.678 --> 06:05.848
is by imitating others who are imitating him.

06:05.848 --> 06:08.051
Jehovah has used the pages of the Bible

06:08.051 --> 06:11.654
to give us real-life stories 
of people who we can imitate.

06:11.654 --> 06:14.557
I mean, we’ve never met Abraham and Sarah,

06:14.557 --> 06:16.959
but don’t you feel like you know them?

06:16.959 --> 06:19.295
I’m sure there’s much more that we can learn

06:19.295 --> 06:22.465
about these beautiful, spiritual people 
in the new world,

06:22.465 --> 06:25.601
but what is laid out 
in the Scriptures is enough

06:25.601 --> 06:29.272
for us to imitate 
the beautiful examples they set for us.

06:29.272 --> 06:30.873
Or what about Jesus?

06:30.873 --> 06:32.875
We’ve never met Jesus,

06:32.875 --> 06:34.944
but by reading the Bible accounts,

06:34.944 --> 06:36.946
don’t you feel like you know him

06:36.946 --> 06:40.950
and you know how he would react 
and think about certain situations?

06:41.884 --> 06:45.121
The apostle Paul simply explained this

06:45.121 --> 06:47.957
at 1 Corinthians 11:1.

06:47.957 --> 06:51.861
He said: “Become imitators of me, 
. . . as I am of Christ.”

06:51.861 --> 06:55.665
So we have Jesus Christ 
as an example of imitating his Father.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.768
The apostle Paul was imitating Christ.

06:58.768 --> 07:01.137
Now, the apostle Paul, 
of course, wasn’t saying,

07:01.137 --> 07:03.906
“Imitate the way I give my talks; 
imitate the way I move;

07:03.906 --> 07:06.642
imitate the way I walk or say things.”

07:06.642 --> 07:10.713
But at Hebrews 13:7,

07:10.713 --> 07:14.517
he stressed what it was that we 
were to imitate about others,

07:15.818 --> 07:17.820
Hebrews 13:7:

07:17.820 --> 07:20.456
“Remember those who 
are taking the lead among you,

07:20.456 --> 07:22.925
“who have spoken the word of God to you,

07:22.925 --> 07:26.662
“and as you contemplate 
how their conduct turns out,

07:26.662 --> 07:29.665
imitate their faith.”

07:29.665 --> 07:33.169
So we are to imitate the faith

07:33.169 --> 07:38.174
and example that others set in imitating 
Jesus and imitating Jehovah.

07:39.842 --> 07:44.313
Now, to illustrate the choice 
that we have of who we’re going to imitate,

07:44.313 --> 07:46.315
I’d like you to imagine in your mind

07:46.315 --> 07:50.086
two big, huge machines with lots of parts.

07:50.086 --> 07:54.257
Now, one machine is run 
by Jehovah and Jesus Christ,

07:54.257 --> 07:58.427
and the other machine 
is run by Satan and the world.

07:58.427 --> 08:02.298
And I want you to imagine 
that you’re a part on the mechanics bench.

08:02.298 --> 08:06.702
When Jehovah goes to pick you up 
and look at you and see,

08:06.702 --> 08:11.073
Do you fit as a part in his organization?

08:11.073 --> 08:14.210
well, we can if we imitate him

08:14.210 --> 08:17.813
and other spiritual people 
who are useful to Jehovah.

08:17.813 --> 08:21.984
We can become a useful part 
of his beautiful organization.

08:23.486 --> 08:28.491
If we imitate Jehovah, 
then if Satan goes over to that bench

08:28.491 --> 08:31.460
and picks us up 
and tries to put us into his machine,

08:31.460 --> 08:33.462
we’re not going to fit anywhere.

08:33.462 --> 08:38.134
We are no part of his world or organization.

08:38.134 --> 08:40.136
I mean, how sad it would be

08:40.136 --> 08:44.073
if we shaped 
and imitated ourselves after the world

08:44.073 --> 08:46.943
and when Satan picked us up we fit right in

08:46.943 --> 08:49.779
with his machine and organization!

08:50.713 --> 08:53.216
So who do you choose to imitate?

08:53.216 --> 08:55.918
We choose to imitate Jehovah.

08:55.918 --> 08:59.322
We want to be just like him when we grow up.

09:00.423 --> 09:03.392
How can we imitate Jehovah?

09:03.392 --> 09:07.296
By getting to know him personally 
through reading the Bible

09:07.296 --> 09:17.834
and imitating others who are imitating him.

00:16.912 --> 00:20.040
It was really nice of Maria 
to invite me in service.

00:23.252 --> 00:25.921
But I already have plans with Sarah.

00:34.513 --> 00:36.640
We have similar service schedules,

00:36.640 --> 00:39.894
and we really enjoy working together.

00:48.569 --> 00:51.488
I try to get most of my time 
during the week, . . .

00:55.326 --> 00:57.286
Anyone made plans to work together?

00:57.286 --> 01:00.998
. . . though I do meet with the group 
sometimes on Saturday.

01:00.998 --> 01:04.001
Sister Martin, 
can you work with Rachel today?

01:07.087 --> 01:08.589
Thanks, everyone.

01:08.589 --> 01:10.883
Anyone made plans to work together?

01:13.052 --> 01:16.388
OK. 
Joanna, you can work with Sarah.

01:23.020 --> 01:25.022
Anyone made plans to work together?

01:25.022 --> 01:26.273
Sarah, do you want to go with me 
to a Bible study?

01:26.273 --> 01:27.191
Could I work with Alisha?

01:27.191 --> 01:28.567
Uh-huh.

01:28.567 --> 01:29.902
OK, let’s work together.

01:29.902 --> 01:31.612
Joanna, could you two work together, please?

01:31.612 --> 01:34.031
Um, I’d love to.

01:34.031 --> 01:36.033
But I’ve just arranged to work with Sarah.

01:36.033 --> 01:37.159
I’m so sorry.

01:37.159 --> 01:40.496
Uh-huh. 
No problem.

01:40.496 --> 01:43.123
Maria, could you work with this sister?

02:03.227 --> 02:06.105
While doing my Bible reading that night,

02:06.105 --> 02:07.982
I was really affected

02:07.982 --> 02:12.695
by the words found 
at 2 Corinthians 6:12, 13:

02:12.695 --> 02:16.907
“You are restricted 
in your own tender affections . . .

02:16.907 --> 02:19.952
Open your hearts wide.”

02:24.456 --> 02:27.042
It struck me that some in the congregation

02:27.042 --> 02:29.712
missed out on a beautiful blessing

02:29.712 --> 02:33.549
by drawing away from the apostle Paul.

02:36.176 --> 02:39.805
I realized I was limiting my joy as well

02:40.806 --> 02:44.184
by not working with more in the ministry.

02:44.184 --> 02:47.563
I was going through the motions 
of pioneering,

02:47.563 --> 02:50.691
but I was stuck in the same routine.

02:50.691 --> 02:52.484
How are you, Maria?

02:52.484 --> 02:54.153
Good. And you?

02:54.153 --> 02:55.154
Let me ask you something.

02:55.154 --> 02:57.281
Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?

02:57.281 --> 02:58.282
Oh, I’d love that! Uh-huh.

02:58.282 --> 02:59.158
That’s great.

02:59.158 --> 03:00.909
So later we’ll make the arrangements. OK?

03:00.909 --> 03:02.161
The meeting is starting.

03:02.161 --> 03:03.662
We’d like to invite everyone 
to take your seats

03:03.662 --> 03:04.663
because our meeting is about to begin.

03:11.128 --> 03:15.924
My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.

03:15.924 --> 03:18.510
I really learned a lot from them.

03:24.475 --> 03:27.478
I started going out regularly 
on the weekends . . .

03:29.480 --> 03:32.107
Anyone made plans to work together?

03:32.107 --> 03:36.820
. . . and working with different ones 
in the ministry.

03:38.238 --> 03:40.991
And I learned more about Sister Martin

03:40.991 --> 03:43.535
after one day in the ministry

03:43.535 --> 03:48.165
than I had in years 
of seeing her at meetings.

03:48.165 --> 03:52.169
Sarah and I still enjoy working together.

03:52.169 --> 03:55.839
But I’ve found that by working 
with a variety of friends,

03:55.839 --> 03:59.843
my own joy has increased.

04:11.230 --> 04:39.781
I’m so glad I ‘opened my heart wide.’

00:11.240 --> 00:13.492
It was one of those mornings 


00:13.492 --> 00:18.955
when everything seemed to be going right. 


00:18.955 --> 00:21.667
In fact, this whole year was going right 


00:21.667 --> 00:24.920
ever since I got baptized. 


00:24.920 --> 00:27.000
My family is closer than ever. 


00:28.340 --> 00:32.177
I’ve made some good friends 
in the congregation. 


00:32.177 --> 00:35.555
I even started a Bible study. 


00:35.555 --> 00:38.350
It felt good to let go of my fears 


00:38.350 --> 00:41.000
and serve Jehovah with everything I have. 


00:44.815 --> 00:47.000
But things can change very quickly.


00:58.453 --> 00:59.955
Uh, I’m sorry. 
You know what? 


00:59.955 --> 01:02.667
I think I saw Grayson 
over the weekend on Saturday. 


01:02.667 --> 01:04.877
I think he might be one of those people 
that tells you about the Bible. 


01:04.877 --> 01:05.460
One of those, uh—


01:05.460 --> 01:08.713
You’re saying Grayson is a Jehovah’s Witness?


01:08.713 --> 01:11.258
Yeah. 
Let me go ask him.


01:11.258 --> 01:13.260
Hey, Grayson?


01:13.260 --> 01:15.345
Hey, how’s it going, Ron?


01:15.345 --> 01:17.097
Did I see you on Saturday morning 
over on Main Street?


01:17.097 --> 01:19.684
Yeah. 
You know, I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


01:19.683 --> 01:21.893
And what we do, 
we go out and talk to people about—


01:21.893 --> 01:24.355
I’m sorry. 
I just don’t get it. 


01:24.355 --> 01:26.273
You’ll go knocking on strangers’ doors 


01:26.273 --> 01:29.776
to support your own religion, 
yet you won’t stand and support this country. 


01:29.777 --> 01:31.320
Why don’t you people 


01:31.320 --> 01:35.000
get involved and make 
a real difference for once?


01:44.207 --> 01:47.754
I was really disappointed in myself. 


01:47.753 --> 01:51.000
I guess I hadn’t moved past 
all my fears like I thought. 


01:53.133 --> 01:55.343
Later that night, 
for family worship, 


01:55.343 --> 01:58.221
we sat down and discussed 
our brothers who were in prison 


01:58.222 --> 02:00.015
for their faith.


02:00.015 --> 02:02.685
Mom, why are they in prison?


02:02.685 --> 02:04.520
They don’t want to fight; 
they don’t want to kill people.


02:04.520 --> 02:07.940
It really touched Aiden. 


02:07.940 --> 02:10.000
He was moved to pray for them that night. 


02:11.943 --> 02:14.446
His prayer touched my heart. 


02:14.447 --> 02:18.159
And with so much on my mind, 
I couldn’t sleep. 


02:18.158 --> 02:21.370
So I decided to get up 
and do some research. 


02:21.370 --> 02:24.873
I found some information 
on the apostle Peter. 


02:24.873 --> 02:27.625
Despite his zeal, 


02:27.625 --> 02:29.712
he also struggled at times 


02:29.712 --> 02:31.964
with fear of man 


02:31.963 --> 02:35.000
like when he denied Jesus three times. 


02:37.845 --> 02:41.000
But eventually, he overcame that fear.


02:42.808 --> 02:44.601
We strictly ordered you 


02:44.602 --> 02:48.730
not to keep teaching 
on the basis of this name, 


02:48.730 --> 02:51.275
and yet look! 


02:51.275 --> 02:53.318
you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, 


02:53.318 --> 02:55.403
and you are determined 


02:55.403 --> 02:57.613
to bring the blood of this man upon us.


02:57.613 --> 03:01.201
We must obey God as ruler rather than men. 


03:01.202 --> 03:03.995
The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, 


03:03.995 --> 03:07.000
whom you killed, 
hanging him on a stake.


03:26.060 --> 03:28.895
“Always ready to make a defense 


03:28.895 --> 03:32.942
“before everyone who demands of you a reason


03:32.942 --> 03:35.000
for the hope you have”


03:36.320 --> 03:39.363
—Peter focused on his hope, 


03:39.363 --> 03:41.658
not his fear. 


03:41.658 --> 03:46.455
Just like these faithful brothers 
have been doing, 


03:46.455 --> 03:51.000
I want to be like them 
and make Jehovah proud of me.


04:01.595 --> 04:03.597
The next day I woke up, 


04:03.597 --> 04:06.225
and I was thinking about the apostle Peter 


04:06.225 --> 04:09.000
and our brothers 
who were in prison for their faith. 


04:15.067 --> 04:17.194
And even though I was still a little nervous, 


04:17.193 --> 04:21.000
I felt ready to talk to Eric.


04:23.242 --> 04:25.244
Hey, Ron, Eric. 


04:25.243 --> 04:27.495
Sorry I didn’t get a chance 
to explain the other day, 


04:27.495 --> 04:29.623
but if you have a moment now, 
I’d love to be able to talk to you.


04:29.623 --> 04:31.000
I don’t want to hear it.


04:32.625 --> 04:35.837
Sorry, Grayson.


04:35.837 --> 04:38.000
And I thought that was it. 


04:41.050 --> 04:43.845
But it wasn’t. 


04:43.845 --> 04:47.000
Ron said he wanted to know more. 


04:49.142 --> 04:52.312
Maybe I’ll never completely 
get rid of my fears. 


04:52.312 --> 04:54.105
But my love for Jehovah 


04:54.105 --> 04:56.775
and the example of his courageous servants 


04:56.775 --> 04:59.277
helps me to be ready to meet the challenge.


04:59.277 --> 05:09.434
The other day I wanted to show you something.

00:14.327 --> 00:15.327
Bye, Buddy.


00:15.327 --> 00:16.000
Bye.


01:26.440 --> 01:29.568
How did I give her the wrong idea? 


01:29.568 --> 01:32.195
How did I let my guard down? 


01:32.195 --> 01:36.117
If I see her again, 
I’ll make sure she gets the right message. 


01:36.117 --> 01:38.452
In the past, 
I would have witnessed immediately 


01:38.452 --> 01:40.745
in a situation like that. 


01:40.745 --> 01:43.000
What changed? 


01:44.165 --> 01:47.502
I’ve always been busy, 
but maybe I’ve let my busy life 


01:47.502 --> 01:50.297
start to crowd out the important things, 


01:50.297 --> 01:54.000
like my Bible reading. 


01:56.887 --> 01:59.474
That night I did some research, 


01:59.473 --> 02:02.810
and I found Ephesians 5:25. 


02:02.810 --> 02:05.937
“Husbands, continue loving your wives, 


02:05.937 --> 02:09.484
just as the Christ 
also loved the congregation.” 


02:09.483 --> 02:11.318
I needed more though. 


02:11.318 --> 02:13.320
Verse 26 stood out to me. 


02:13.320 --> 02:16.032
There it says what Jesus 
does for the congregation, 


02:16.032 --> 02:18.617
“. . . cleansing it with the bath of water 


02:18.617 --> 02:21.204
by means of the word.” 


02:21.203 --> 02:24.665
If I’m going to stay 
morally and spiritually clean, 


02:24.665 --> 03:02.557
I need to read God’s Word every day.

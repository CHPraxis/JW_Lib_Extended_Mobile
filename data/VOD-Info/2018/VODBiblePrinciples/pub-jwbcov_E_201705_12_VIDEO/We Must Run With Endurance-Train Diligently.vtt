Order up.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really thought that this was behind me.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:11.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I haven’t smoked in nearly a year.

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But every day at lunch this happens,

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cravings get so intense.

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe this is just a symptom

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of other areas in my life

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I haven’t been
as focused as I should be.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I keep thinking about the scripture

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 9:25:

00:02:02.935 --> 00:02:05.980 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Now everyone competing in a contest

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.400 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
exercises self-control in all things.”

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m going to continue
to exercise control with this,

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to be exercising it
in other areas too,

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which means getting back

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a good spiritual routine.

00:05 When Thomas and I first learned  I was pregnant,
00:08 we were both really shocked.
00:16 But then we grew more and more excited.
00:22 And we were so thrilled when we saw  our little girl for the first time.
00:32 We really didn’t care  if it was a boy or a girl;
00:34 we just wanted the baby to be healthy.
00:52 Unfortunately, our hopes  were completely destroyed
00:56 when the doctor told us  that the baby would likely be born
00:59 with severe problems and could even die.
01:11 My husband and his parents  are not Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:15 but they do feel abortion is wrong.
01:26 Still, they thought that we should listen  to our doctor’s advice.
01:33 I couldn’t believe this was happening.
01:35 I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it.
01:39 I really felt it was more than I could bear.
01:45 Thomas asked me what I wanted to do,
01:48 and I told him  that I could never have an abortion.
01:51 He agreed that normally it would be wrong
01:54 but felt that in our situation  God would understand.
02:02 I was so overwhelmed.
02:04 I was being pressured  to make a decision I knew was wrong
02:08 but that everyone  was telling me was best for my child.
02:15 I had never felt so alone.
02:20 I needed Jehovah more than ever,
02:23 so I poured out my heart to him in prayer.
02:35 And then I did research.
02:56 I showed Thomas the scripture I had found.
03:15 “If men should struggle with each other
03:17 “and they hurt a pregnant woman
03:21 “. . . if a fatality does occur,
03:24 then you must give life for life.”
03:28 Jehovah views even the unintentional killing
03:31 of an unborn child as a serious sin.
03:34 So how could we intentionally take  the life of our child?
03:43 I made my decision clear to our doctor
03:52 and to my in-laws.
03:57 There was a chance  the diagnosis was incorrect,
04:00 and I’d love to say that’s what occurred;
04:03 but it did not.
04:06 My daughter Chloe only lived  a few weeks after she was born,
04:10 and losing her was the hardest thing  I’ve ever had to endure.
04:14 But Jehovah gave me the courage  to explain my beliefs to my husband,
04:18 my in-laws, and the medical staff,
04:21 and they all expressed admiration  for my strong faith.
04:25 And I’ve never regretted the decision I made.
04:30 Even though Chloe only lived those few weeks,
04:33 I’m so grateful for the time I had with her.
04:36 I know Jehovah remembers  every detail about her,
04:40 and he’ll give her back to me  in the resurrection in perfect health,
04:44 because all life  is truly precious in his eyes.

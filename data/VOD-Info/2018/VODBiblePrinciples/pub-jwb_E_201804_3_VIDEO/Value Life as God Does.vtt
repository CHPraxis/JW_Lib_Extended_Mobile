00:05.067 --> 00:08.279
When Thomas and I first learned 
I was pregnant, 


00:08.278 --> 00:11.000
we were both really shocked. 


00:16.287 --> 00:19.000
But then we grew more and more excited. 


00:22.333 --> 00:27.000
And we were so thrilled when we saw 
our little girl for the first time. 


00:32.093 --> 00:34.805
We really didn’t care 
if it was a boy or a girl; 


00:34.805 --> 00:37.000
we just wanted the baby to be healthy. 


00:52.113 --> 00:56.285
Unfortunately, our hopes 
were completely destroyed 


00:56.285 --> 00:59.538
when the doctor told us 
that the baby would likely be born 


00:59.538 --> 01:04.000
with severe problems and could even die.


01:11.758 --> 01:15.511
My husband and his parents 
are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


01:15.512 --> 01:18.000
but they do feel abortion is wrong. 


01:26.482 --> 01:30.000
Still, they thought that we should listen 
to our doctor’s advice. 


01:33.113 --> 01:35.865
I couldn’t believe this was happening. 


01:35.865 --> 01:39.202
I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it. 


01:39.202 --> 01:43.000
I really felt it was more than I could bear. 


01:45.625 --> 01:48.045
Thomas asked me what I wanted to do, 


01:48.045 --> 01:51.798
and I told him 
that I could never have an abortion. 


01:51.798 --> 01:54.843
He agreed that normally it would be wrong 


01:54.843 --> 01:58.000
but felt that in our situation 
God would understand. 


02:02.600 --> 02:04.812
I was so overwhelmed. 


02:04.812 --> 02:08.899
I was being pressured 
to make a decision I knew was wrong 


02:08.898 --> 02:12.000
but that everyone 
was telling me was best for my child. 


02:15.322 --> 02:19.000
I had never felt so alone. 


02:20.327 --> 02:23.080
I needed Jehovah more than ever, 


02:23.080 --> 02:27.000
so I poured out my heart to him in prayer. 


02:35.467 --> 02:38.000
And then I did research. 


02:56.863 --> 03:00.000
I showed Thomas the scripture I had found. 


03:15.173 --> 03:17.718
“If men should struggle with each other 


03:17.718 --> 03:20.000
“and they hurt a pregnant woman 


03:21.513 --> 03:24.475
“. . . if a fatality does occur, 


03:24.475 --> 03:28.687
then you must give life for life.”


03:28.687 --> 03:31.690
Jehovah views even the unintentional killing 


03:31.690 --> 03:34.735
of an unborn child as a serious sin. 


03:34.735 --> 03:39.000
So how could we intentionally take 
the life of our child? 


03:43.535 --> 03:48.000
I made my decision clear to our doctor 


03:52.252 --> 03:56.000
and to my in-laws. 


03:57.215 --> 04:00.885
There was a chance 
the diagnosis was incorrect, 


04:00.885 --> 04:03.972
and I’d love to say that’s what occurred; 


04:03.972 --> 04:06.142
but it did not. 


04:06.142 --> 04:10.354
My daughter Chloe only lived 
a few weeks after she was born, 


04:10.353 --> 04:14.733
and losing her was the hardest thing 
I’ve ever had to endure. 


04:14.733 --> 04:18.861
But Jehovah gave me the courage 
to explain my beliefs to my husband, 


04:18.862 --> 04:21.907
my in-laws, and the medical staff, 


04:21.907 --> 04:25.952
and they all expressed admiration 
for my strong faith. 


04:25.952 --> 04:29.000
And I’ve never regretted the decision I made. 


04:30.748 --> 04:33.918
Even though Chloe only lived those few weeks, 


04:33.918 --> 04:36.338
I’m so grateful for the time I had with her. 


04:36.338 --> 04:40.341
I know Jehovah remembers 
every detail about her, 


04:40.342 --> 04:44.847
and he’ll give her back to me 
in the resurrection in perfect health, 


04:44.847 --> 05:00.050
because all life 
is truly precious in his eyes.

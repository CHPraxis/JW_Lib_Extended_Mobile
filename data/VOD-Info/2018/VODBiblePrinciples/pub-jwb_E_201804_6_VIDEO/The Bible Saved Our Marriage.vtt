00:01.450 --> 00:05.188
Can the Bible save 
a marriage that’s in danger? 


00:05.188 --> 00:08.658
The following interviews, 
while very frank, 


00:08.658 --> 00:13.061
will show the exceeding value 
of God’s own Word, the Bible, 


00:13.062 --> 00:15.565
to preserve that divine union. 


00:15.565 --> 00:17.733
Almost from the start of the marriage, 


00:17.733 --> 00:22.771
it was not running smoothly, 
to say the least. 


00:22.772 --> 00:25.542
We were fighting constantly. 


00:25.542 --> 00:30.080
Even the smallest things 
we would argue over, 


00:30.080 --> 00:33.182
and it would just get blown 
out of proportion. 


00:33.182 --> 00:37.087
We couldn’t communicate 
without it being an argument. 


00:37.087 --> 00:40.624
Steadily the arguments increased 


00:40.623 --> 00:43.960
in frequency and intensity. 


00:43.960 --> 00:47.163
And you think, ‘Well, I’m not happy here,’ 


00:47.163 --> 00:50.400
and that’s when I threatened to leave. 


00:50.400 --> 00:55.072
Sometimes I felt 
like completely giving up on the marriage. 


00:55.072 --> 00:57.074
There would be arguments 
where you’d be packing the bags 


00:57.073 --> 00:59.308
and saying you’d wished you’d never done it. 


00:59.308 --> 01:01.710
And ultimately it would end in insults. 


01:01.710 --> 01:04.480
Jehovah was missing in our marriage, 


01:04.480 --> 01:08.985
and that was the essential part 
of making our marriage work. 


01:08.985 --> 01:12.988
A brother and sister 
that we’d known for a long time 


01:12.988 --> 01:15.591
initially offered us a Bible study. 


01:15.592 --> 01:18.529
They invited us 
to their Family Worship evening 


01:18.528 --> 01:20.896
to have dinner 
and to do The Watchtower with them, 


01:20.897 --> 01:22.899
which we accepted. 


01:22.898 --> 01:25.201
The Family Worship arrangement helped 


01:25.202 --> 01:28.472
because it wasn’t just Bible principles 
that you read about, 


01:28.472 --> 01:32.175
but we saw them being applied 
in this couple’s life. 


01:32.175 --> 01:34.177
And so all of a sudden, 


01:34.177 --> 01:38.649
I could see the cause and effect 
of a Bible principle. 


01:38.648 --> 01:42.485
But the impact 
that it was having was tremendous 


01:42.485 --> 01:46.488
because we could see how to apply 
a Bible principle and make it work. 


01:46.488 --> 01:50.726
I think it took a long time 
before things got better, honestly, 


01:50.727 --> 01:54.864
but the turning point 
was coming back to Jehovah. 


01:54.863 --> 01:56.866
There were many principles 
that all of a sudden 


01:56.867 --> 01:59.502
were like little light bulbs going off, 


01:59.502 --> 02:01.872
such as Jesus at John 13:34 


02:01.872 --> 02:04.507
when he recommended his example. 


02:04.507 --> 02:07.410
Ephesians 5:33 


02:07.410 --> 02:09.445
eventually had an impact on me, 


02:09.445 --> 02:11.747
because there were articles that pointed out 


02:11.747 --> 02:15.652
how important it is for a husband 
to feel respected by his wife, 


02:15.652 --> 02:18.454
and I don’t think 
I’d ever really appreciated that before. 


02:18.453 --> 02:20.623
I just viewed it as a mechanical process: 


02:20.623 --> 02:24.126
He’s the head; 
he needs to have respect from his wife. 


02:24.127 --> 02:28.499
I didn’t recognize that it’s important 
for a husband to feel respected 


02:28.498 --> 02:33.035
to be able to take on his role as head. 


02:33.035 --> 02:37.540
We’re so thankful 
to Jehovah for his patience. 


02:37.540 --> 02:39.742
The Bible principles were always there; 


02:39.742 --> 02:41.744
we just weren’t making application of them. 


02:41.743 --> 02:43.780
As soon as we started to make application, 


02:43.780 --> 02:47.150
our marriage did a complete turnaround. 


02:47.150 --> 02:49.785
Where we are now is totally different. 


02:49.785 --> 02:53.255
The relationship that we have 
is what we wanted at the start 


02:53.255 --> 02:55.258
but didn’t know how to get. 


02:55.258 --> 02:57.260
It’s just that application 
of Bible principles 


02:57.260 --> 03:01.000
that has made it possible. 


03:05.468 --> 03:09.138
We were 17, actually, when we met 
and 20 when we got married. 


03:09.138 --> 03:13.041
Life was good for Tony and me; 
we were happy. 


03:13.042 --> 03:16.379
But then I got into another business 


03:16.378 --> 03:19.415
that became the main focus in my life. 


03:19.415 --> 03:22.852
It had quite a dramatic effect 
on our spirituality. 


03:22.852 --> 03:26.855
We went through a time 
when we hardly saw each other, 


03:26.855 --> 03:29.792
so there was a great deal 
of time that we spent apart. 


03:29.792 --> 03:34.797
Bible principles were ones 
that weren’t brought into our life. 


03:34.797 --> 03:39.235
At that time, 
Bible reading was out of the picture. 


03:39.235 --> 03:42.305
I started delving into viewing things 


03:42.305 --> 03:45.475
that were really, really inappropriate. 


03:45.475 --> 03:49.078
And then it eventually happened 


03:49.078 --> 03:51.780
where I didn’t really care what I viewed, 


03:51.780 --> 03:55.452
and I didn’t think about the consequences 


03:55.452 --> 03:59.155
and of the unhappiness that it would cause. 


03:59.155 --> 04:04.093
It made me feel very, extremely, unloved. 


04:04.093 --> 04:08.731
I felt very angry about his behavior. 


04:08.732 --> 04:11.800
I felt a lot of resentment 
towards him, a lot of bitterness. 


04:11.800 --> 04:15.372
We ended up in separation, to begin with. 


04:15.372 --> 04:17.840
I left Tony; I walked away from him. 


04:17.840 --> 04:20.977
I walked away from the marriage, 
walked away from the business 


04:20.977 --> 04:25.080
and, eventually, 
ended up unscripturally divorcing Tony. 


04:25.080 --> 04:30.052
The elders who were assisting me 


04:30.052 --> 04:33.690
helped me to see exactly how Jehovah felt 


04:33.690 --> 04:35.692
about what I’d been doing 


04:35.692 --> 04:40.330
and where my relationship was with him, 
and it was quite poor. 


04:40.330 --> 04:43.800
I felt that because of the betrayal 
that I had experienced, 


04:43.800 --> 04:47.237
I did not have a problem with my conscience 
at all in going through the divorce. 


04:47.237 --> 04:50.005
It seemed the logical 
and best way for me to go.


04:50.005 --> 04:52.375
With my Bible reading, 


04:52.375 --> 04:55.110
I got to see Amos 5:15. 


04:55.110 --> 04:57.113
It really had an effect on me 


04:57.113 --> 05:00.350
because I needed to “hate what is bad, 
and love what is good.” 


05:00.350 --> 05:02.352
One scripture that affected me 


05:02.352 --> 05:06.155
was from Malachi 
about how Jehovah felt about divorce. 


05:06.155 --> 05:10.460
Altogether, it took us 15 years 
before we got together again. 


05:10.460 --> 05:14.563
I was just enjoying 
a day out in the field midweek, 


05:14.563 --> 05:18.600
and I got home in mid-afternoon. 


05:18.600 --> 05:21.370
And all of a sudden, my mobile phone rang, 


05:21.370 --> 05:25.173
and I heard Rhonda’s voice. 


05:25.173 --> 05:27.910
What a delight it was 
that she was inviting me 


05:27.910 --> 05:31.947
to accompany her 
for a cup of coffee somewhere 


05:31.947 --> 05:34.000
to talk about things! 


05:36.252 --> 05:39.322
If I hadn’t started 
having a Scriptural intake 


05:39.322 --> 05:42.125
and learning to love God’s Word, 


05:42.125 --> 05:45.193
my life wouldn’t have changed. 


05:45.193 --> 05:48.596
Without the Bible, 
Tony and I would not be together. 


05:48.597 --> 05:51.334
The marriage 
would never ever have reconciled. 


05:51.333 --> 05:54.936
We have become best friends, 
so we really enjoy 


05:54.937 --> 05:58.775
being in each other’s company 
and serving Jehovah together. 


05:58.775 --> 06:01.677
Our married life now has certainly benefited 


06:01.677 --> 06:06.382
by both of us seeing 
how beneficial the Scriptures are. 


06:06.382 --> 06:08.550
Tony and I are now very much a couple, 


06:08.550 --> 06:12.855
and so no matter what we deal with, 
it’s us together. 


06:12.855 --> 06:15.425
When situations like these arise, 


06:15.425 --> 06:18.027
it’s not just our marriage that’s affected. 


06:18.027 --> 06:22.465
Our relationship with Jehovah is on the line! 


06:22.465 --> 06:24.500
Our dear sister, for example, 


06:24.500 --> 06:27.603
reached an emotional point 
where she felt the only solution 


06:27.603 --> 06:30.205
was an unscriptural divorce. 


06:30.205 --> 06:32.942
As we make our decisions in marriage, 


06:32.942 --> 06:37.480
Jehovah’s feelings on the subject, 
found at Malachi 2:16, 


06:37.480 --> 06:40.282
should be carefully considered: 


06:40.282 --> 06:43.419
“‘For I hate divorce,’ 


06:43.418 --> 06:46.655
says Jehovah the God of Israel.” 


06:46.655 --> 06:49.492
If you find your marital peace is threatened, 


06:49.492 --> 06:51.494
review articles like the one 


06:51.493 --> 06:56.531
in the May 15, 2012, study edition 
of The Watchtower entitled 


06:56.532 --> 07:00.269
“Take a Positive View 
of a Strained Marriage.” 


07:00.268 --> 07:03.038
It provides powerful counsel that can help 


07:03.038 --> 07:12.398
to save and strengthen your marriage bond.

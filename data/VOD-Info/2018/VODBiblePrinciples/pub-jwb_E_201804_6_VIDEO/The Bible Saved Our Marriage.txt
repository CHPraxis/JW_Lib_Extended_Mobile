00:01 Can the Bible save  a marriage that’s in danger?
00:05 The following interviews,  while very frank,
00:08 will show the exceeding value  of God’s own Word, the Bible,
00:13 to preserve that divine union.
00:15 Almost from the start of the marriage,
00:17 it was not running smoothly,  to say the least.
00:22 We were fighting constantly.
00:25 Even the smallest things  we would argue over,
00:30 and it would just get blown  out of proportion.
00:33 We couldn’t communicate  without it being an argument.
00:37 Steadily the arguments increased
00:40 in frequency and intensity.
00:43 And you think, ‘Well, I’m not happy here,’
00:47 and that’s when I threatened to leave.
00:50 Sometimes I felt  like completely giving up on the marriage.
00:55 There would be arguments  where you’d be packing the bags
00:57 and saying you’d wished you’d never done it.
00:59 And ultimately it would end in insults.
01:01 Jehovah was missing in our marriage,
01:04 and that was the essential part  of making our marriage work.
01:08 A brother and sister  that we’d known for a long time
01:12 initially offered us a Bible study.
01:15 They invited us  to their Family Worship evening
01:18 to have dinner  and to do The Watchtower with them,
01:20 which we accepted.
01:22 The Family Worship arrangement helped
01:25 because it wasn’t just Bible principles  that you read about,
01:28 but we saw them being applied  in this couple’s life.
01:32 And so all of a sudden,
01:34 I could see the cause and effect  of a Bible principle.
01:38 But the impact  that it was having was tremendous
01:42 because we could see how to apply  a Bible principle and make it work.
01:46 I think it took a long time  before things got better, honestly,
01:50 but the turning point  was coming back to Jehovah.
01:54 There were many principles  that all of a sudden
01:56 were like little light bulbs going off,
01:59 such as Jesus at John 13:34
02:01 when he recommended his example.
02:04 Ephesians 5:33
02:07 eventually had an impact on me,
02:09 because there were articles that pointed out
02:11 how important it is for a husband  to feel respected by his wife,
02:15 and I don’t think  I’d ever really appreciated that before.
02:18 I just viewed it as a mechanical process:
02:20 He’s the head;  he needs to have respect from his wife.
02:24 I didn’t recognize that it’s important  for a husband to feel respected
02:28 to be able to take on his role as head.
02:33 We’re so thankful  to Jehovah for his patience.
02:37 The Bible principles were always there;
02:39 we just weren’t making application of them.
02:41 As soon as we started to make application,
02:43 our marriage did a complete turnaround.
02:47 Where we are now is totally different.
02:49 The relationship that we have  is what we wanted at the start
02:53 but didn’t know how to get.
02:55 It’s just that application  of Bible principles
02:57 that has made it possible.
03:05 We were 17, actually, when we met  and 20 when we got married.
03:09 Life was good for Tony and me;  we were happy.
03:13 But then I got into another business
03:16 that became the main focus in my life.
03:19 It had quite a dramatic effect  on our spirituality.
03:22 We went through a time  when we hardly saw each other,
03:26 so there was a great deal  of time that we spent apart.
03:29 Bible principles were ones  that weren’t brought into our life.
03:34 At that time,  Bible reading was out of the picture.
03:39 I started delving into viewing things
03:42 that were really, really inappropriate.
03:45 And then it eventually happened
03:49 where I didn’t really care what I viewed,
03:51 and I didn’t think about the consequences
03:55 and of the unhappiness that it would cause.
03:59 It made me feel very, extremely, unloved.
04:04 I felt very angry about his behavior.
04:08 I felt a lot of resentment  towards him, a lot of bitterness.
04:11 We ended up in separation, to begin with.
04:15 I left Tony; I walked away from him.
04:17 I walked away from the marriage,  walked away from the business
04:20 and, eventually,  ended up unscripturally divorcing Tony.
04:25 The elders who were assisting me
04:30 helped me to see exactly how Jehovah felt
04:33 about what I’d been doing
04:35 and where my relationship was with him,  and it was quite poor.
04:40 I felt that because of the betrayal  that I had experienced,
04:43 I did not have a problem with my conscience  at all in going through the divorce.
04:47 It seemed the logical  and best way for me to go.
04:50 With my Bible reading,
04:52 I got to see Amos 5:15.
04:55 It really had an effect on me
04:57 because I needed to “hate what is bad,  and love what is good.”
05:00 One scripture that affected me
05:02 was from Malachi  about how Jehovah felt about divorce.
05:06 Altogether, it took us 15 years  before we got together again.
05:10 I was just enjoying  a day out in the field midweek,
05:14 and I got home in mid-afternoon.
05:18 And all of a sudden, my mobile phone rang,
05:21 and I heard Rhonda’s voice.
05:25 What a delight it was  that she was inviting me
05:27 to accompany her  for a cup of coffee somewhere
05:31 to talk about things!
05:36 If I hadn’t started  having a Scriptural intake
05:39 and learning to love God’s Word,
05:42 my life wouldn’t have changed.
05:45 Without the Bible,  Tony and I would not be together.
05:48 The marriage  would never ever have reconciled.
05:51 We have become best friends,  so we really enjoy
05:54 being in each other’s company  and serving Jehovah together.
05:58 Our married life now has certainly benefited
06:01 by both of us seeing  how beneficial the Scriptures are.
06:06 Tony and I are now very much a couple,
06:08 and so no matter what we deal with,  it’s us together.
06:12 When situations like these arise,
06:15 it’s not just our marriage that’s affected.
06:18 Our relationship with Jehovah is on the line!
06:22 Our dear sister, for example,
06:24 reached an emotional point  where she felt the only solution
06:27 was an unscriptural divorce.
06:30 As we make our decisions in marriage,
06:32 Jehovah’s feelings on the subject,  found at Malachi 2:16,
06:37 should be carefully considered:
06:40 “‘For I hate divorce,’
06:43 says Jehovah the God of Israel.”
06:46 If you find your marital peace is threatened,
06:49 review articles like the one
06:51 in the May 15, 2012, study edition  of The Watchtower entitled
06:56 “Take a Positive View  of a Strained Marriage.”
07:00 It provides powerful counsel that can help
07:03 to save and strengthen your marriage bond.

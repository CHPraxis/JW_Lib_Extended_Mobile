00:01.480 --> 00:01.980
All right.


00:01.980 --> 00:02.773
OK.


00:02.773 --> 00:04.400
One 
—one more step.


00:04.400 --> 00:05.192
All right. 


00:05.192 --> 00:05.775
We’re almost there.


00:05.775 --> 00:07.068
OK.


00:07.068 --> 00:08.695
We’re getting close. 


00:08.695 --> 00:11.240
And here it is.


00:11.240 --> 00:13.242
Oh! 
It’s a lemon tree! 


00:13.242 --> 00:15.285
I’ve always wanted one. 


00:15.285 --> 00:16.703
Thank you so much. 
I love it! 


00:16.703 --> 00:17.705
Happy first anniversary.


00:17.705 --> 00:19.748
Ah, thank you. 
Can we take a picture?


00:19.748 --> 00:20.415
Yeah. 


00:20.415 --> 00:21.000
OK. 


00:25.337 --> 00:28.132
First lemon pie! 


00:28.132 --> 00:32.000
SKE! 


00:36.348 --> 00:40.351
Are you comfortable? 


00:40.352 --> 00:45.000
Happy anniversary. 


00:49.068 --> 00:53.000
Are you all right?


01:11.925 --> 01:15.012
In our field ministry this weekend, 
to offer the current magazine, 


01:15.012 --> 01:19.000
which one of those 
do you think that you’d like to use?


01:23.353 --> 01:28.000
So before we go in the territory, 
do you mind if we make a stop first? 


01:32.112 --> 01:34.282
Today is our wedding anniversary.


01:34.282 --> 01:36.367
Ah, I—
I didn’t know. 


01:36.367 --> 01:38.577
I’m so sorry. 


01:38.577 --> 01:40.662
When Sharon died, 


01:40.662 --> 01:45.000
I was going through some 
especially raw days myself. 


01:45.000 --> 01:47.460
I keep getting flooded with memories.


01:47.460 --> 01:49.463
That’s normal. 


01:49.463 --> 01:52.090
Do you know what my number one help was? 


01:52.090 --> 01:54.635
It was prayer. 


01:54.635 --> 01:56.637
I do pray, 


01:56.637 --> 02:00.640
but it stirs up emotions 
that I’m trying to keep down.


02:00.640 --> 02:03.185
Don’t keep the emotions down. 


02:03.185 --> 02:06.188
Let them out with Jehovah. 


02:06.188 --> 02:09.525
Tell him how you really feel, Matt. 


02:09.525 --> 02:12.027
Your thoughts are safe with him. 


02:12.027 --> 02:16.490
You know, 1 John 3:20 tells us 
that “God is greater than our hearts 


02:16.490 --> 02:18.992
and knows all things.” 


02:18.992 --> 02:23.497
He understands us better 
than we understand ourselves. 


02:23.497 --> 02:27.752
And he’s giving us help now 
that’s specific for our needs. 


02:27.752 --> 02:30.712
It’s going to get better.


02:30.712 --> 02:35.134
Is there anything else you do 
on those especially raw days?


02:35.133 --> 02:37.135
There is. 


02:37.135 --> 02:39.805
But it may be the opposite 
of what you want to do.


02:39.805 --> 02:41.432
What’s that? 


02:41.432 --> 02:43.600
Find someone that you can help. 


02:43.600 --> 02:48.000
Jesus said that’s 
a guaranteed formula for happiness.


02:56.947 --> 03:01.000
Remind me next year 
that this is Matt’s wedding anniversary day.


03:12.797 --> 03:13.380
Hey, Darren. 


03:13.380 --> 03:14.338
Have you seen Javier? 


03:14.338 --> 03:15.131
He’s got a part tonight.


03:15.132 --> 03:16.384
No, I haven’t seen him. 


03:16.383 --> 03:18.510
They received some bad news today, 
so really— 


03:18.510 --> 03:21.000
Uh, there they are.


03:24.767 --> 03:27.000
Our part tonight will be handled 
by Brother Javier Vallez.


03:30.647 --> 03:33.775
It’s, ah—
It’s the—


03:33.775 --> 03:36.945
Uh, well, maybe it’s better 
if I just read it from the reference, 


03:36.945 --> 03:40.407
um, yeah, 
it’s the 2011 Watchtower. 


03:40.407 --> 03:42.409
So we had a great meeting. 


03:42.408 --> 03:45.000
Let’s conclude with song and prayer. 


03:47.163 --> 03:49.206
Amen. 


03:49.207 --> 03:50.459
I really enjoyed your talk.


03:50.458 --> 03:51.126
Thanks. 


03:51.127 --> 03:51.794
Thanks. 


03:51.793 --> 03:53.000
Nice job, nice job. 


03:59.552 --> 04:01.179
Thanks for your text last night. 


04:01.178 --> 04:03.638
I know my talk was not 
what it should have been.


04:03.638 --> 04:06.891
You did fine, 
especially after your day yesterday.


04:06.892 --> 04:09.854
We always paid our rent on time. 


04:09.853 --> 04:12.000
And now we’re being evicted 
and for no reason. 


04:14.273 --> 04:17.820
How are we going to find 
a new place to live in just two weeks?


04:17.820 --> 04:21.157
After SKE, 
we sold everything to make this move, 


04:21.157 --> 04:24.910
but it’s been one thing after another. 


04:24.910 --> 04:28.455
We can’t seem to catch a break.


04:28.455 --> 04:31.167
I’m so sorry. 


04:31.167 --> 04:34.670
Lauren and I experienced a rough patch 
like this soon after we were married. 


04:34.670 --> 04:37.923
We prayed a lot, 
we kept our expenses to a minimum, 


04:37.923 --> 04:40.341
but we did something else too. 


04:40.342 --> 04:42.427
We made it a goal to stick 
to a good spiritual routine 


04:42.427 --> 04:44.429
and not isolate ourselves. 


04:44.428 --> 04:47.808
And that’s why I really want to commend 
both of you for coming last night. 


04:47.808 --> 04:50.560
I know it made Jehovah’s heart glad.


04:50.560 --> 04:53.563
Thanks, Matt. 


04:53.563 --> 04:56.358
We’re trying.


04:56.358 --> 04:59.401
We want to show Jehovah we trust in him.


04:59.402 --> 05:02.824
Remember, it goes both ways: 


05:02.823 --> 05:06.618
‘With someone loyal 
Jehovah will act in loyalty.’ 


05:06.618 --> 05:08.661
He won’t let you down. 


05:08.662 --> 05:10.997
You’ll see. 


05:10.997 --> 05:11.665
Yeah.


05:11.665 --> 05:12.833
Yeah. We’d love to. Of course.


05:12.833 --> 05:14.000
Yeah. We’d love that. 
They are an awesome couple.


05:46.157 --> 05:47.659
Just come with me this one time then.


05:47.658 --> 05:49.076
Honey, you know we can’t do that. 


05:49.077 --> 05:50.412
We’ve already decided.


05:50.412 --> 05:51.414
Explain to me why.


05:51.413 --> 05:52.788
I’ll show you why.


05:52.788 --> 05:53.581
From this?


05:53.582 --> 05:53.915
Yes.


05:53.915 --> 05:55.083
No! Stop! 


05:55.083 --> 05:56.460
I’m done! 
I’m done with your religion! 


05:56.460 --> 05:58.587
I’m done with this!


05:58.587 --> 06:00.000
Ian.


06:14.435 --> 06:16.855
Paragraph 11 asks: “How did Hezekiah 
reveal what was in his heart?”


06:16.855 --> 06:18.398
Marley, this is your paragraph. 


06:18.398 --> 06:19.398
Are you ready?


06:19.398 --> 06:20.775
Let’s hear from Marley, please.


06:20.775 --> 06:23.278
Hezekiah did something foolish, 


06:23.278 --> 06:26.071
and Jehovah didn’t like it.


06:26.072 --> 06:27.324
Thank you. 
Good comment. 


06:27.323 --> 06:29.325
Ah, any further comments?


06:29.325 --> 06:32.000
Sister Rapp, please.


06:35.998 --> 06:37.666
Did you get to talk to Levi?


06:37.667 --> 06:39.670
No. 


06:39.670 --> 06:42.380
But, you know, I did talk to his mom. 


06:42.380 --> 06:46.000
You know, she said that the divorce 
has been really difficult.


06:47.760 --> 06:49.680
We should do something.


06:49.680 --> 06:52.098
You know, we can do something.


06:52.098 --> 06:54.433
Hey, you know, 
I met a young man the other day, 


06:54.433 --> 06:56.686
and he’s about your age.


06:56.687 --> 06:57.980
Hey, Robert.


06:57.980 --> 06:59.397
How are you?


06:59.397 --> 07:01.000
Good.


07:07.155 --> 07:09.658
I’m really glad you like Chinese food, Levi.


07:09.658 --> 07:11.033
Are you kidding me? 


07:11.033 --> 07:14.000
We used to eat Chinese food 
all the time with— 


07:19.417 --> 07:24.000
I-I can’t believe he left.


07:26.257 --> 07:32.000
Levi, read this scripture here in Psalms.


07:34.057 --> 07:37.727
“Even if my own father
and mother abandon me,


07:37.727 --> 07:41.732
Jehovah himself will take me in.”


07:41.732 --> 07:44.000
Jehovah will take you in too, Levi. 


07:45.860 --> 07:48.197
You know, loved ones may leave us 


07:48.197 --> 07:51.199
but Jehovah never will. 


07:51.198 --> 07:54.160
You and your mom are never alone. 


07:54.160 --> 07:57.122
We’re all part of Jehovah’s family.


07:57.122 --> 07:59.124
That’s right, Levi. 


07:59.123 --> 08:02.000
We all have each other. 


08:13.763 --> 08:16.000
Let’s go.


08:20.687 --> 08:22.855
Jehovah is a God who hates injustice. 


08:22.855 --> 08:25.567
In fact, he’s promised to eliminate it. 


08:25.567 --> 08:29.154
We can read that promise together 
in the book of Psalm 37, 


08:29.153 --> 08:31.490
and we’ll begin reading in verse 10. 


08:31.490 --> 08:34.450
Here we read God’s promise: 


08:34.450 --> 08:37.703
“Just a little while longer, 
and the wicked will be no more; 


08:37.703 --> 08:40.000
you will look at where they were,—”


08:43.293 --> 08:45.795
Are you OK?


08:45.795 --> 08:49.967
Yeah, I feel bad for Brother Tobias. 


08:49.967 --> 08:53.095
He always seems to be in pain.


08:53.095 --> 08:55.097
Yeah, it’s his hip. 


08:55.097 --> 08:58.600
But he’s always faithful; 
he never misses a meeting.


08:58.600 --> 09:00.852
Does he live by himself?


09:00.852 --> 09:03.105
I think his wife died a while back. 


09:03.105 --> 09:06.000
It’s just him now.


09:08.193 --> 09:12.000
Thank you for joining us, 
and welcome to the program!


09:16.493 --> 09:18.203
Good morning, Brother Tobias.


09:18.203 --> 09:19.661
Levi.


09:19.662 --> 09:22.207
We’ve had a ton of leaves falling 
in our yard that needed cleaning up, 


09:22.207 --> 09:25.085
and I thought I’d see 
if you needed some help around here.


09:25.085 --> 09:30.000
Far be it for me to refuse free help.


09:32.842 --> 09:35.000
Levi, come.


09:45.605 --> 09:47.607
So you went to Bethel? 


09:47.607 --> 09:49.609
then Gilead?


09:49.608 --> 09:51.318
I did.


09:51.318 --> 09:53.530
I want to go Bethel someday. 


09:53.530 --> 09:56.157
Javier and Michelle, 
they took me not that long ago, 


09:56.157 --> 09:59.160
and I really liked what I saw.


09:59.160 --> 10:01.328
That is an excellent goal. 


10:01.328 --> 10:06.000
You’ll never go wrong 
putting spiritual things first in your life.


10:09.170 --> 10:11.380
Where did you work when you were in Bethel?


10:11.380 --> 10:14.050
I worked on the Linotype machine.


10:14.050 --> 10:15.593
Linotype? 


10:15.593 --> 10:16.426
What’s that?


10:16.427 --> 10:18.847
Come, let me show you 
how we did it in our day. 


10:18.847 --> 10:21.000
Sit down. 


10:22.892 --> 10:24.227
There’s a picture.


10:24.227 --> 10:27.647
I was one of the brothers 
holding up that Bible.


10:27.647 --> 10:29.274
Wow! 
Mom, did you hear that?


10:29.273 --> 10:30.275
What?


10:30.275 --> 10:32.402
He was at that convention 
where they released the first Bible.


10:32.402 --> 10:33.404
Wow! 


10:33.403 --> 10:34.403
We’re all set.


10:34.403 --> 10:37.000
Ready to see some film?


10:57.302 --> 10:58.929
Good night, everyone.


10:58.928 --> 11:00.805
I’ll be back tomorrow 
to finish up the leaves.


11:00.805 --> 11:01.598
Sounds good. 


11:01.598 --> 11:04.000
I’ll have the hot chocolate ready.


11:15.320 --> 11:18.000
You and your mom are never alone. 


11:24.997 --> 11:35.904
We’re all part of Jehovah’s family.

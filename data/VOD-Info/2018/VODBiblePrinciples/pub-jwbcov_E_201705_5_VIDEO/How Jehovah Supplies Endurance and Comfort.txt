00:01 All right.
00:01 OK.
00:02 One  —one more step.
00:04 All right.
00:05 We’re almost there.
00:05 OK.
00:07 We’re getting close.
00:08 And here it is.
00:11 Oh!  It’s a lemon tree!
00:13 I’ve always wanted one.
00:15 Thank you so much.  I love it!
00:16 Happy first anniversary.
00:17 Ah, thank you.  Can we take a picture?
00:19 Yeah.
00:20 OK.
00:25 First lemon pie!
00:28 SKE!
00:36 Are you comfortable?
00:40 Happy anniversary.
00:49 Are you all right?
01:11 In our field ministry this weekend,  to offer the current magazine,
01:15 which one of those  do you think that you’d like to use?
01:23 So before we go in the territory,  do you mind if we make a stop first?
01:32 Today is our wedding anniversary.
01:34 Ah, I— I didn’t know.
01:36 I’m so sorry.
01:38 When Sharon died,
01:40 I was going through some  especially raw days myself.
01:45 I keep getting flooded with memories.
01:47 That’s normal.
01:49 Do you know what my number one help was?
01:52 It was prayer.
01:54 I do pray,
01:56 but it stirs up emotions  that I’m trying to keep down.
02:00 Don’t keep the emotions down.
02:03 Let them out with Jehovah.
02:06 Tell him how you really feel, Matt.
02:09 Your thoughts are safe with him.
02:12 You know, 1 John 3:20 tells us  that “God is greater than our hearts
02:16 and knows all things.”
02:18 He understands us better  than we understand ourselves.
02:23 And he’s giving us help now  that’s specific for our needs.
02:27 It’s going to get better.
02:30 Is there anything else you do  on those especially raw days?
02:35 There is.
02:37 But it may be the opposite  of what you want to do.
02:39 What’s that?
02:41 Find someone that you can help.
02:43 Jesus said that’s  a guaranteed formula for happiness.
02:56 Remind me next year  that this is Matt’s wedding anniversary day.
03:12 Hey, Darren.
03:13 Have you seen Javier?
03:14 He’s got a part tonight.
03:15 No, I haven’t seen him.
03:16 They received some bad news today,  so really—
03:18 Uh, there they are.
03:24 Our part tonight will be handled  by Brother Javier Vallez.
03:30 It’s, ah— It’s the—
03:33 Uh, well, maybe it’s better  if I just read it from the reference,
03:36 um, yeah,  it’s the 2011 Watchtower.
03:40 So we had a great meeting.
03:42 Let’s conclude with song and prayer.
03:47 Amen.
03:49 I really enjoyed your talk.
03:50 Thanks.
03:51 Thanks.
03:51 Nice job, nice job.
03:59 Thanks for your text last night.
04:01 I know my talk was not  what it should have been.
04:03 You did fine,  especially after your day yesterday.
04:06 We always paid our rent on time.
04:09 And now we’re being evicted  and for no reason.
04:14 How are we going to find  a new place to live in just two weeks?
04:17 After SKE,  we sold everything to make this move,
04:21 but it’s been one thing after another.
04:24 We can’t seem to catch a break.
04:28 I’m so sorry.
04:31 Lauren and I experienced a rough patch  like this soon after we were married.
04:34 We prayed a lot,  we kept our expenses to a minimum,
04:37 but we did something else too.
04:40 We made it a goal to stick  to a good spiritual routine
04:42 and not isolate ourselves.
04:44 And that’s why I really want to commend  both of you for coming last night.
04:47 I know it made Jehovah’s heart glad.
04:50 Thanks, Matt.
04:53 We’re trying.
04:56 We want to show Jehovah we trust in him.
04:59 Remember, it goes both ways:
05:02 ‘With someone loyal  Jehovah will act in loyalty.’
05:06 He won’t let you down.
05:08 You’ll see.
05:10 Yeah.
05:11 Yeah. We’d love to. Of course.
05:12 Yeah. We’d love that.  They are an awesome couple.
05:46 Just come with me this one time then.
05:47 Honey, you know we can’t do that.
05:49 We’ve already decided.
05:50 Explain to me why.
05:51 I’ll show you why.
05:52 From this?
05:53 Yes.
05:53 No! Stop!
05:55 I’m done!  I’m done with your religion!
05:56 I’m done with this!
05:58 Ian.
06:14 Paragraph 11 asks: “How did Hezekiah  reveal what was in his heart?”
06:16 Marley, this is your paragraph.
06:18 Are you ready?
06:19 Let’s hear from Marley, please.
06:20 Hezekiah did something foolish,
06:23 and Jehovah didn’t like it.
06:26 Thank you.  Good comment.
06:27 Ah, any further comments?
06:29 Sister Rapp, please.
06:35 Did you get to talk to Levi?
06:37 No.
06:39 But, you know, I did talk to his mom.
06:42 You know, she said that the divorce  has been really difficult.
06:47 We should do something.
06:49 You know, we can do something.
06:52 Hey, you know,  I met a young man the other day,
06:54 and he’s about your age.
06:56 Hey, Robert.
06:57 How are you?
06:59 Good.
07:07 I’m really glad you like Chinese food, Levi.
07:09 Are you kidding me?
07:11 We used to eat Chinese food  all the time with—
07:19 I-I can’t believe he left.
07:26 Levi, read this scripture here in Psalms.
07:34 “Even if my own father and mother abandon me,
07:37 Jehovah himself will take me in.”
07:41 Jehovah will take you in too, Levi.
07:45 You know, loved ones may leave us
07:48 but Jehovah never will.
07:51 You and your mom are never alone.
07:54 We’re all part of Jehovah’s family.
07:57 That’s right, Levi.
07:59 We all have each other.
08:13 Let’s go.
08:20 Jehovah is a God who hates injustice.
08:22 In fact, he’s promised to eliminate it.
08:25 We can read that promise together  in the book of Psalm 37,
08:29 and we’ll begin reading in verse 10.
08:31 Here we read God’s promise:
08:34 “Just a little while longer,  and the wicked will be no more;
08:37 you will look at where they were,—”
08:43 Are you OK?
08:45 Yeah, I feel bad for Brother Tobias.
08:49 He always seems to be in pain.
08:53 Yeah, it’s his hip.
08:55 But he’s always faithful;  he never misses a meeting.
08:58 Does he live by himself?
09:00 I think his wife died a while back.
09:03 It’s just him now.
09:08 Thank you for joining us,  and welcome to the program!
09:16 Good morning, Brother Tobias.
09:18 Levi.
09:19 We’ve had a ton of leaves falling  in our yard that needed cleaning up,
09:22 and I thought I’d see  if you needed some help around here.
09:25 Far be it for me to refuse free help.
09:32 Levi, come.
09:45 So you went to Bethel?
09:47 then Gilead?
09:49 I did.
09:51 I want to go Bethel someday.
09:53 Javier and Michelle,  they took me not that long ago,
09:56 and I really liked what I saw.
09:59 That is an excellent goal.
10:01 You’ll never go wrong  putting spiritual things first in your life.
10:09 Where did you work when you were in Bethel?
10:11 I worked on the Linotype machine.
10:14 Linotype?
10:15 What’s that?
10:16 Come, let me show you  how we did it in our day.
10:18 Sit down.
10:22 There’s a picture.
10:24 I was one of the brothers  holding up that Bible.
10:27 Wow!  Mom, did you hear that?
10:29 What?
10:30 He was at that convention  where they released the first Bible.
10:32 Wow!
10:33 We’re all set.
10:34 Ready to see some film?
10:57 Good night, everyone.
10:58 I’ll be back tomorrow  to finish up the leaves.
11:00 Sounds good.
11:01 I’ll have the hot chocolate ready.
11:15 You and your mom are never alone.
11:24 We’re all part of Jehovah’s family.

00:12 Hi there.
00:13 Hi.
00:14 Can I interest you in one of our suits?
00:16 OK, that sounds good.
00:18 I think it would go great with this tie.
01:06 I wish I had listened to the elders.
01:09 I-I can’t believe the interest  on these credit cards.
01:12 There’s just no way I can afford this.
01:15 It didn’t seem like it was that much money  at the time when I was spending it.
01:19 Hm, maybe if I pick up a second job
01:24 or, ah, work nights, weekends, I could . . .
01:27 Hold on a second.
01:29 Wait! No.
01:31 What did the text say this morning?
01:35 “Keep your eyes open  and guard against every sort of greed,
01:40 “because even when a person  has an abundance,
01:43 his life does not result  from the things he possesses.”
01:47 Guard against greed.
01:50 It didn’t feel like greed at the time.
01:53 It seemed like these were  all things I needed.
01:55 But if it’s starting  to crowd out time for Jehovah . . .
02:37 Hey.
02:38 Hey.
02:39 You’re back for more suits?
02:40 Just this today.
02:41 All right.  Well, you have a good day.
02:42 Thank you.

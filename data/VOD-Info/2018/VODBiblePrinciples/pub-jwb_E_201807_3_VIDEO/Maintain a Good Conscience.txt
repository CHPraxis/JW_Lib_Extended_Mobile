00:03 Every day we make choices
00:05 that can affect  our relationship with Jehovah.
00:08 When there’s a clear Scriptural command,
00:10 the right choice may seem easy.
00:14 But what if there’s not?
00:18 How can we be sure  we’re making a wise decision?
00:23 An invitation to our niece’s wedding arrived.
00:28 Thomas was excited about it.
00:34 I was excited too.
00:38 But the ceremony
00:40 was being held at a local church.
00:44 I wondered if it would still be OK  for me to attend.
00:49 Even though Thomas wasn’t yet willing
00:51 to accept a Bible study,  he gradually softened over the years
00:54 since I came into the truth.
00:57 I knew he understood why  I would never enter a church for worship,
01:01 but what about attending a wedding?
01:03 Jehovah approves of weddings.
01:09 That afternoon,
01:10 I went to help Amy plan a menu
01:12 for the pioneer school lunch coming up.
01:18 She noticed I was a bit distracted,
01:22 so I told her my concerns about the wedding.
01:25 But you’re not thinking of going, are you?
01:28 Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter,
01:31 but I didn’t feel  she really understood my situation.
01:37 Although I appreciated her concern,
01:40 I felt like she was judging me.
01:45 The next day, I decided  to visit Charlotte and Allan
01:48 and ask their advice.
01:52 Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth
01:55 many years before Allan,  so they really understood my situation.
02:00 Is Amy right?
02:02 Would it be wrong to attend the wedding?
02:04 What would you do if you were me?
02:07 Charlotte explained that in situations
02:10 where there’s no specific Bible command,
02:12 it becomes a matter of conscience.
02:16 And what one person’s conscience allows
02:19 may be different from another.
02:23 The important thing
02:25 is that we make decisions  that leave us with a good conscience.
02:41 But how do I do that?
02:44 Dear Emma, it’s really a matter of training.
02:49 Allan showed me the scripture  at Hebrews 5:14,
02:52 where the apostle Paul wrote:
02:54 “Solid food belongs to mature people,
02:56 “to those who through use
02:58 “have their powers of discernment trained
03:01 to distinguish both right and wrong.”
03:06 But Paul didn’t just write those words;
03:11 he lived them.
03:15 He carefully studied  the principles in God’s Word.
03:20 And as a result,  he was able to make decisions
03:24 that left him with a good conscience.
03:30 So even when there’s no stated law  on a matter,
03:33 we can always find a Bible principle
03:36 that can give us insight into God’s thinking.
03:42 So I made it a matter of prayer,  and then I got to work.
03:51 I researched articles
03:54 in the Watch Tower Publications Index  and the Research Guide.
03:59 I found a really good thought  in chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book.
04:08 I also read about others  who faced similar situations
04:11 and what Bible principles they found helpful.
04:15 Then I meditated on all these.
04:26 As I kept studying,  I was able to bring my conscience
04:29 in harmony with Jehovah’s spirit,
04:32 not just with my heart.
04:45 I realized that having  a Bible-trained conscience
04:48 doesn’t mean everyone  will always think exactly alike
04:52 —and that’s OK.
04:55 But if we train our conscience  by applying Bible principles,
04:59 it will guide us along in life,  so that each of us
05:02 can remain in God’s love.

WEBVTT

00:01.183 --> 00:04.553
Well, today we invited 
two young people to join us in our studio. 


00:04.553 --> 00:06.756
This is Logan, and this is Aiden. 


00:06.757 --> 00:07.924
Thank you for coming.


00:07.923 --> 00:09.191
Thanks for inviting us.


00:09.192 --> 00:10.560
What did you think of that video?


00:10.560 --> 00:14.897
I liked it 
and that it showed a lot of families 


00:14.897 --> 00:18.702
doing stuff that involves Jehovah.


00:18.702 --> 00:19.935
Good.


00:19.935 --> 00:23.238
The one thing I noticed was 
that they were all in a relaxed setting. 


00:23.238 --> 00:25.241
It was not like in a busy city. 


00:25.242 --> 00:27.977
They were at, like, the shore 


00:27.977 --> 00:30.714
where they were talking about the Bible, 


00:30.713 --> 00:33.416
and it was nice family time 
that they were having.


00:33.417 --> 00:35.652
Good observations, Fellas. 


00:35.652 --> 00:38.789
Now, three times in the chorus it said: 


00:38.788 --> 00:43.325
‘We need to set time aside 
for the most important things.’ 


00:43.325 --> 00:45.862
Then it mentioned three important things. 


00:45.862 --> 00:46.797
What were they? 


00:46.797 --> 00:47.630
Prayer. 


00:47.630 --> 00:48.432
Study. 


00:48.432 --> 00:49.232
Godly— 


00:49.232 --> 00:50.067
—devotion. 


00:50.067 --> 00:51.400
That’s it, very good. 


00:51.400 --> 00:54.370
Good things for all of us to remember, 
wouldn’t you say?


00:54.370 --> 00:57.207
Well now, my wife and I 
are in the same congregation 


00:57.207 --> 00:59.375
with Logan and Aiden 
and their families. 


00:59.375 --> 01:02.078
So I know 
what excellent meeting attenders they are. 


01:02.078 --> 01:05.615
And what I really appreciate 
is that you participate in the meetings 


01:05.615 --> 01:07.217
and you comment in your own words. 


01:07.217 --> 01:09.285
That’s very good and sets a nice example. 


01:09.285 --> 01:10.720
Keep it up. 


01:10.720 --> 01:13.590
Speaking of the meetings, 
how do you like the midweek meetings 


01:13.590 --> 01:15.225
with all the videos that we see?


01:15.225 --> 01:18.127
It gives a diversity. 


01:18.127 --> 01:19.295
It’s not always talks. 


01:19.295 --> 01:20.563
It gives, like, a break in the meeting.


01:20.563 --> 01:21.396
Yes.


01:21.397 --> 01:26.402
The videos are always great, 


01:26.402 --> 01:30.940
and they go with every talk 
that the videos are for. 


01:30.940 --> 01:34.943
And you know, sometimes 
we even show Caleb and Sophia videos 


01:34.943 --> 01:37.646
from the Become Jehovah’s Friend series. 


01:37.647 --> 01:39.515
Now, I’ve got to ask you, 


01:39.515 --> 01:42.552
Do you have an idea for a new Caleb video?


01:42.552 --> 01:44.354
I think I have one. 


01:44.353 --> 01:46.990
Caleb is at school; 


01:46.990 --> 01:49.758
he gets asked to go 
to a birthday party at someone’s house. 


01:49.758 --> 01:51.828
He goes home and shows his parents the card, 


01:51.828 --> 01:54.263
and they discuss what he should do about it, 


01:54.263 --> 01:56.365
and then he preaches at school. 


01:56.365 --> 01:58.367
But before he does that, 


01:58.367 --> 02:01.637
Sophia gives him a couple of pointers 
on preaching at school and on boldness.


02:01.637 --> 02:02.305
Good. 


02:02.305 --> 02:04.340
How about you Aiden, 
do you have an idea?


02:04.340 --> 02:07.610
Yes, I think a good idea would be: 


02:07.610 --> 02:12.582
A new kid comes to Caleb’s class, 
and it is his birthday, 


02:12.582 --> 02:15.050
and he passes out the treats. 


02:15.050 --> 02:17.053
But Caleb says, “No, thank you.” 


02:17.053 --> 02:22.325
And then he bullies him 
that he doesn’t get to have fun; 


02:22.325 --> 02:27.130
he doesn’t get treats at school. 


02:27.130 --> 02:30.367
And I think 
he should discuss it with the family, 


02:30.367 --> 02:32.935
and then maybe he could tell the boy 


02:32.935 --> 02:35.838
why he doesn’t celebrate birthdays.


02:35.838 --> 02:36.940
Very nice. 


02:36.940 --> 02:39.308
Well, I’m sure the Teaching Committee 
of the Governing Body 


02:39.308 --> 02:42.778
will give some thought 
to your recommendations.


02:42.778 --> 02:44.780
We brought you to the studio 


02:44.780 --> 02:47.650
because we want you 
to help me with a little experiment. 


02:47.650 --> 02:51.287
And this is an experiment 
that some of our viewers have seen before. 


02:51.287 --> 02:54.224
And you’ve probably seen it, too, 
because it’s mentioned in Volume 2 


02:54.223 --> 02:58.260
of the book Questions Young People Ask
—Answers That Work. 


02:58.260 --> 03:00.863
And the idea is to help us appreciate 


03:00.863 --> 03:03.431
how we can make time 
for “the more important things.”


03:03.432 --> 03:05.435
Now, let me explain 
what we have on the table. 


03:05.435 --> 03:10.440
The two pails represent 
one week in a Christian’s life. 


03:10.440 --> 03:14.115
The large rocks represent 
the most important things 


03:14.115 --> 03:16.265
that we need 
to accomplish during the week, 


03:16.265 --> 03:18.448
and all these little pebbles 


03:18.448 --> 03:21.698
represent the nonessential things of life


03:21.698 --> 03:26.448
—recreation, playing games, playing sports, 


03:26.448 --> 03:28.783
going on the Internet, 


03:28.783 --> 03:30.915
working with social media, 


03:30.915 --> 03:33.428
our hobbies, taking music lessons. 


03:33.428 --> 03:37.233
They’re all fun things to do, 
but, really, they’re not essential. 


03:37.233 --> 03:39.235
Now, our challenge is 


03:39.235 --> 03:43.940
to try to get all the big rocks 
into the pail with the little pebbles.


03:43.940 --> 03:47.743
So as I hand you each rock, Logan, 
I want you to put it in the pail. 


03:47.743 --> 03:50.513
Now, this first one represents 


03:50.513 --> 03:55.183
the important things 
that your father might have to do. 


03:55.183 --> 03:57.586
He works to support the family. 


03:57.587 --> 04:01.624
Maybe your mother 
is a pioneer or has to work secularly. 


04:01.623 --> 04:06.295
Your mothers certainly have a lot of work 
to do around the home caring for the family. 


04:06.295 --> 04:08.582
And you boys go to school 
and have homework to do, 


04:08.582 --> 04:12.000
so that’s a big part 
of your time, isn’t it? 


04:13.348 --> 04:15.350
Now, this rock represents 


04:15.350 --> 04:19.020
all the chores that everyone 
in the family has to do at home: 


04:19.020 --> 04:22.357
cleaning, washing clothes, cooking, 


04:22.357 --> 04:24.932
caring for the yard, 
the automobile, and so on. 


04:24.932 --> 04:27.000
That takes a lot of time. 


04:31.988 --> 04:34.523
This rock represents a third of your life


04:34.523 --> 04:37.000
—sleeping. 


04:41.797 --> 04:45.234
Now, here are the most important things
—our spiritual activities. 


04:45.233 --> 04:50.238
For instance, when we read the Bible 
and meditate on what we read 


04:50.238 --> 04:53.000
and when we do 
personal study and family worship. 


04:55.382 --> 04:58.399
This one represents 
all the time it takes for us 


04:58.398 --> 05:01.901
to prepare for, dress for, travel to, 


05:01.902 --> 05:05.000
and attend our congregation meetings
—midweek and on the weekend. 


05:08.692 --> 05:13.000
And this represents the time we spend 
in the field service on the weekend. 


05:16.298 --> 05:20.536
Now, I didn’t tell you 
that we can’t go above the top of the pail. 


05:20.537 --> 05:21.970
They don’t fit, do they? 


05:21.970 --> 05:22.905
No. 


05:22.905 --> 05:23.840
OK. 


05:23.840 --> 05:26.265
And when that happens in a person’s life, 


05:26.265 --> 05:30.163
some brothers and sisters 
are tempted to decide: 


05:30.163 --> 05:33.881
‘Well, maybe I’ll skip 
field service this week,’ 


05:33.882 --> 05:37.399
or ‘Maybe I’ll stay home 
from the meetings,’ 


05:37.398 --> 05:40.166
or ‘Maybe I just won’t get 
my Bible reading 


05:40.167 --> 05:42.792
and studying and family worship 
done this week.’ 


05:42.792 --> 05:44.794
But that’s a big mistake, isn’t it? 


05:44.793 --> 05:49.065
These are the most important things of life
—our spiritual activities.


05:49.065 --> 05:53.837
So is there some way that we can get 
all of this into our week’s schedule? 


05:53.837 --> 05:56.039
Here’s what we’re going to do now. 


05:56.038 --> 05:58.808
We’re going to put 
the rocks in the empty pail. 


05:58.808 --> 06:01.000
So, Logan, 
see if you can get them all in there.


06:23.332 --> 06:25.334
Very good! They all fit. 


06:25.333 --> 06:26.335
Isn’t that nice? 


06:26.335 --> 06:28.370
We can get the more important things done. 


06:28.370 --> 06:31.807
But you know, we also want 
a little time for recreation, don’t we? 


06:31.807 --> 06:33.810
So, Aiden, 


06:33.810 --> 06:37.368
let’s have you pour 
the little pebbles into that bucket 


06:37.368 --> 06:40.000
and see how much 
of that you can get in there.


06:53.665 --> 06:56.000
You can put a lot more in.


07:06.413 --> 07:07.443
Very good! 


07:07.443 --> 07:09.445
Look how much you got in there! 


07:09.445 --> 07:11.713
Now, you didn’t get them all in, 
did you? 


07:11.713 --> 07:14.383
But that’s OK because the Bible tells us 


07:14.383 --> 07:17.051
we have to ‘buy out the time’ 
for the more important things. 


07:17.052 --> 07:21.257
So, no, we can’t spend all the time 
that we may want to on recreation. 


07:21.257 --> 07:24.594
We want to get 
the more important things done.


07:24.593 --> 07:27.496
So, what have we learned 
from this little demonstration? 


07:27.497 --> 07:31.634
Why weren’t we able to get 
the big rocks in the pail the first time? 


07:31.633 --> 07:32.635
Aiden?


07:32.635 --> 07:35.403
Because there was too much recreation.


07:35.403 --> 07:37.406
That’s right. 


07:37.407 --> 07:41.544
Now, Logan, why were we able to get 
all the rocks in the second time?


07:41.543 --> 07:44.746
Because we put in the nonessential things


07:44.747 --> 07:48.517
—like watching TV, playing video games—
in second.


07:48.517 --> 07:50.520
We put that in last, didn’t we? 


07:50.520 --> 07:51.287
Good. 


07:51.287 --> 07:55.592
So that teaches us: 
Put the more important things first. 


07:55.592 --> 07:59.362
And it all depends 
on what we fill our pail up with, 


07:59.362 --> 08:02.064
or our life with, first. 


08:02.063 --> 08:04.066
Thank you very much for your help. 


08:04.067 --> 08:05.635
I appreciate that. 


08:05.635 --> 08:09.472
And keep up your good work 
as Kingdom publishers, 


08:09.472 --> 08:17.330
and I’ll see you at the Kingdom Hall 
at the next meeting.

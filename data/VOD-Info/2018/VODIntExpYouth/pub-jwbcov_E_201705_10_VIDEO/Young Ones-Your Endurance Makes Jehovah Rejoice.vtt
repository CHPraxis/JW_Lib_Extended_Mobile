00:01.517 --> 00:03.820
Jehovah loves children, 


00:03.820 --> 00:06.322
and he has shown this by providing help 


00:06.322 --> 00:10.394
and guidance for them down to our day.


00:10.393 --> 00:14.863
For example, at the 1978 
“Victorious Faith” International Convention, 


00:14.863 --> 00:18.435
this release entitled 
My Book of Bible Stories 


00:18.435 --> 00:22.000
was soon treasured 
by young ones around the world. 


00:23.873 --> 00:26.910
Over the years, 
it’s helped millions to come to love Jehovah 


00:26.910 --> 00:31.180
and become his faithful worshippers. 


00:31.180 --> 00:33.683
The story that always meant 
a lot to me was that of Samson, 


00:33.683 --> 00:36.518
especially the images 
that we had in the My Book of Bible Stories. 


00:36.518 --> 00:38.721
They were so vivid 
—to see the strength that Jehovah gave him 


00:38.722 --> 00:40.724
and the way he supported him. 


00:40.723 --> 00:42.758
But at the same time, 
the story always carried 


00:42.758 --> 00:46.261
that if you weren’t obedient to Jehovah, 
you lost that blessing and that strength. 


00:46.262 --> 00:48.364
So I think that as a young one 
growing up in the truth


00:48.363 --> 00:51.400
—especially when you went to school 
and you had to stand out and be different—


00:51.400 --> 00:53.437
to remember that Jehovah could support you 


00:53.437 --> 00:55.672
and give you that kind 
of extraordinary strength. 


00:55.672 --> 00:59.142
It gave you the power 
that you needed to make that stand. 


00:59.142 --> 01:03.379
Even earlier, 
The Watchtower began a series of articles 


01:03.378 --> 01:07.250
that became the basis for the book 
Listening to the Great Teacher. 


01:07.250 --> 01:10.987
And later, 
that was rewritten and reillustrated 


01:10.987 --> 01:14.324
to become Learn From the Great Teacher. 


01:14.323 --> 01:16.691
It tells us what kind 
of qualities a friend should have. 


01:16.692 --> 01:20.264
I like chapter 35 called 
“We Can Wake Up From Death!” 


01:20.263 --> 01:22.565
because I used to be afraid, 
and now I know 


01:22.565 --> 01:24.867
that Jesus will resurrect us 
no matter what, 


01:24.867 --> 01:27.037
and so I’m not afraid anymore. 


01:27.037 --> 01:30.974
In 2006, 
the Awake! magazine started including 


01:30.973 --> 01:33.041
numerous activities and puzzles 


01:33.042 --> 01:35.379
for children of various ages; 


01:35.378 --> 01:38.815
jw.org expanded on this content 


01:38.815 --> 01:42.018
to include over 40 Bible-character cards, 


01:42.018 --> 01:45.621
illustrated Bible stories, 
games, coloring activities, 


01:45.622 --> 01:47.957
and two series entitled 


01:47.957 --> 01:50.000
“My Bible Lessons” for younger children 


01:51.193 --> 01:54.263
and “Teach Your Children”
for those slightly older.


01:54.263 --> 01:56.431
And who can forget 


01:56.432 --> 01:59.369
the Become Jehovah’s Friend video series 


01:59.368 --> 02:01.436
with Caleb and Sophia?


02:01.437 --> 02:05.809
The videos help me to be bold for Jehovah.


02:05.808 --> 02:09.111
There’s this little booklet/magazine 
called My Bible Lessons 


02:09.112 --> 02:11.114
that I remember when I was younger 


02:11.113 --> 02:13.950
—things to be thankful about, 
like the Paradise 


02:13.950 --> 02:17.053
and what Jehovah gave us and friends.


02:17.053 --> 02:21.790
But what has Jehovah 
provided for tweens and teens?


02:21.790 --> 02:23.058
In the early ‘70’s, 


02:23.058 --> 02:24.593
articles were written 


02:24.593 --> 02:26.661
to help those in this age group 


02:26.662 --> 02:28.230
to cope with the challenges 


02:28.230 --> 02:30.167
of becoming an adult. 


02:30.167 --> 02:32.702
These later became 
the basis for the books 


02:32.702 --> 02:34.837
Your Youth 
—Getting the Best out of It 


02:34.837 --> 02:36.840
and, more recently, 


02:36.840 --> 02:40.910
Questions Young People Ask 
—Answers That Work. 


02:40.910 --> 02:44.947
Add to that 
the ever-expanding online content, 


02:44.947 --> 02:48.384
such as Answers to 10 Questions 
Young People Ask, 


02:48.383 --> 02:51.553
the video series What Your Peers Say, 


02:51.553 --> 02:53.956
as well as whiteboard animations 


02:53.957 --> 02:56.894
and feature-length films 
designed to tackle serious 


02:56.893 --> 03:00.830
and sometimes emotional subjects. 


03:00.830 --> 03:05.568
When I was in middle school, 
I used to be bullied, and it was harsh. 


03:05.568 --> 03:09.105
Once that video came out, 
I mean, I was just amazed! 


03:09.105 --> 03:11.640
It felt like Jehovah 
was literally talking to me.


03:11.640 --> 03:15.143
Yes, Jehovah loves young ones, 


03:15.143 --> 03:17.913
and he continues to express that love 


03:17.913 --> 03:21.000
with an abundance of wonderful gifts.


03:24.153 --> 03:28.356
People of all ages, 
but especially young ones, 


03:28.357 --> 03:31.360
will enjoy this new 240-page book 


03:31.360 --> 03:34.000
containing 103 lessons. 


03:35.665 --> 03:37.667
The artwork is new 


03:37.667 --> 03:39.702
and has been extensively researched, 


03:39.702 --> 03:41.837
bringing the Bible to life 


03:41.837 --> 03:45.000
and capturing the feelings of those depicted. 


03:46.475 --> 03:49.378
Parents will appreciate 
that each section starts 


03:49.378 --> 03:52.915
with a preview of the key lessons 
you can emphasize.


03:52.915 --> 03:56.585
Each lesson includes review questions 


03:56.585 --> 03:59.855
and a caption scripture that summarizes it. 


03:59.855 --> 04:02.225
For example, the caption scripture 


04:02.225 --> 04:04.893
for the lesson “Hannah Prays for a Son” 


04:04.893 --> 04:07.130
is Matthew 7:7: 


04:07.130 --> 04:11.033
“Keep on asking, 
and it will be given you; 


04:11.033 --> 04:14.536
keep on seeking, 
and you will find.” 


04:14.537 --> 04:17.740
This scripture serves 
as the main theme of this account, 


04:17.740 --> 04:20.142
allowing you to help your child 


04:20.142 --> 04:22.712
focus on the key lesson of the story. 


04:22.712 --> 04:26.482
Our hope is that all ages 


04:26.482 --> 04:30.052
will enjoy this gift 
from our loving Father, Jehovah, 


04:30.052 --> 04:32.655
as we all discover new lessons 


04:32.655 --> 04:42.315
we can learn from the Bible.

00:02 Over 2.2 million people  live in the city of Paris.
00:06 And in 2016,
00:09 around 45 million tourists  visited the French capital.
00:13 To reach all these people  with the message contained in the Bible,
00:18 special metropolitan public witnessing  was set up in Paris in 2012.
00:23 Each month,
00:25 1,300 Jehovah’s Witnesses  preach with the help
00:28 of mobile displays  placed in 12 strategic locations.
00:32 These carts may be in place
00:35 for up to 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.
00:39 Because they are highly visible  and are in the right place at the right time,
00:43 almost 3,000 publications
00:46 in 27 languages are placed each month,
00:49 and many Bible studies are started.
00:56 It’s more and more difficult  to meet people at home.
00:59 Sometimes you need a code
01:00 to enter the first door,  then a second one inside.
01:05 In addition to the Parisians,  there are lots of commuters
01:08 coming every day to the capital to work,
01:10 so these people  are not available at their homes.
01:13 Moreover, in Paris,
01:15 they can be completely anonymous.
01:17 They do not have to worry  about their neighbors.
01:20 We are always here.
01:21 We witness.
01:22 And even if the doors are closed,  we find another way to preach.
01:27 One thing that I particularly like  about this form of witnessing
01:31 is the questions that are on the posters.
01:33 Even if people don’t come
01:35 and help themselves from the cart,
01:37 I say to myself,
01:39 ‘They still take the questions  away with them.’
01:42 These questions do have an impact on people.
01:45 We feel that they make them think  by giving them food for thought.
01:52 There’s a really interesting population.
01:54 People who are eager  to learn more about the Bible
01:57 want to have discussions  and are asking questions.
02:00 And through the jw.org website,  we can answer their questions.
02:04 I use videos a lot  because people are very attracted
02:06 by the beautiful images  produced by the organization,
02:10 and they are really very surprised,  and they leave truly satisfied.
02:16 A new challenge for me  was to use
02:18 the new technology and,  for example,
02:21 the Why Study the Bible? video.
02:23 So during this campaign,
02:25 I had the opportunity to use this video
02:28 for the first time to show it to someone  who approached the cart.
02:33 So it’s true that before we use  the new tools, we need to prepare
02:37 —especially for the videos.
02:42 People who stop at the stand  really take the time to talk to us.
02:46 It is not like other forms of service  where we have less time to spend with them.
02:50 I’ve had conversations  that lasted 20 to 30 minutes,
02:54 sharing several Bible scriptures.
02:57 And we feel that these people are looking for  and need to hear the comforting message
03:01 of God’s Word.
03:05 I think it is an activity  that actually honors people,
03:10 particularly in France,
03:12 because they are given the freedom to choose.
03:14 They feel that they have control  over the situation.
03:19 When I go back to my congregation,  often the brothers and sisters ask me
03:22 if we were successful.
03:24 I always say, “Yes.”
03:26 Because we were there;  we were obedient,
03:28 and for sure we were seen  by many people in the streets of Paris.
03:34 We do the cart witnessing until 8:00 p.m.,
03:36 and at 8:00 p.m., people are still outside.
03:39 These people —we do not find them at home.
03:41 And here, they quickly get a glimpse of the Bible’s message,
03:44 and they help themselves.
03:46 So it works.
03:48 Many people tell us,  “We saw the cart in London;
03:51 we saw it in New York;  we saw it in Italy, in Rome.”
03:56 A person stopped recently,
03:59 and I just heard him say in Italian,
04:01 “We have the same thing back home!”
04:06 So this international aspect is —for a Jehovah’s Witness—
04:10 what makes our organization unique.
04:13 We are a true international family.
04:16 Hearing other people say it, it’s amazing.
04:25 I feel like I’m sharing in a unique program
04:28 that has never taken place before.
04:31 In fact, we follow the example  of our brothers and sisters
04:35 who do the same everywhere in the world.
04:37 So I feel like I’m a small part
04:39 of a big family.
04:48 Personally, I have known Jehovah now  for six years,
04:51 and I’m truly grateful to know
04:54 that Jehovah himself thinks of everyone.
04:57 And I feel privileged to be able
04:59 to carry this wonderful message to all those
05:02 who still don’t know him.

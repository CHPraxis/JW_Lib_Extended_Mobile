00:02.690 --> 00:04.878
In the book of Romans, 
the first chapter, verse 20, 


00:04.878 --> 00:08.550
it talks about how you 
can perceive Jehovah’s creative power 


00:08.550 --> 00:11.803
by what we see in creation around us. 


00:11.803 --> 00:15.390
When you’re in a national park 
and you see the beauty of these parks, 


00:15.390 --> 00:19.102
you immediately think of that scripture.


00:19.102 --> 00:21.125
We have individuals driving 


00:21.125 --> 00:22.125
from an hour and a half 


00:22.125 --> 00:23.690
to over three hours one-way 


00:23.690 --> 00:27.568
to share in this form of witnessing.


00:27.568 --> 00:29.591
National parks generally have 


00:29.592 --> 00:31.949
what is called a freeness of speech area. 


00:31.948 --> 00:34.596
So that allows us 
to be able to get permission 


00:34.597 --> 00:37.412
to go into the parks 
to set up our carts there. 


00:37.412 --> 00:40.957
It’s just a nice place to come and relax, 


00:40.957 --> 00:44.710
and when people are relaxed, 
they’re wanting to talk.


00:44.710 --> 00:47.233
They already kind of have 
a sense of closeness with God; 


00:47.233 --> 00:50.403
it kind of gets them thinking 
about their spirituality, 


00:50.403 --> 00:53.886
and then when they see our cart 
displayed so nicely about that, 


00:53.887 --> 00:56.305
it kind of draws them toward that.


00:56.305 --> 01:00.205
You will find visitors 
from all parts of the world. 


01:00.205 --> 01:03.270
Many cultures are represented.


01:03.270 --> 01:07.400
And quite often, 
we will have literature in their language. 


01:07.400 --> 01:11.425
There are many that benefit 
from our work at the carts. 


01:11.425 --> 01:14.573
But especially noteworthy are those 


01:14.573 --> 01:18.620
who do not have access to Bible literature. 


01:18.620 --> 01:20.973
A Chinese couple came up, and they said, 


01:20.973 --> 01:25.210
“Thank you for giving us 
the Bible in our language.” 


01:25.210 --> 01:26.898
That made our day. 


01:26.898 --> 01:28.588
It was fabulous!


01:28.588 --> 01:29.943
They may not stop. 


01:29.943 --> 01:30.945
They may not talk to us. 


01:30.945 --> 01:33.030
But they see it, 
and that registers in their mind


01:33.030 --> 01:35.928
—that they’ve seen this 
at an airport or in their city. 


01:35.928 --> 01:38.826
And now they’re going to look into it 
or go to the website and wonder: 


01:38.827 --> 01:41.475
‘What was that all about? 
What were those people doing there?’


01:41.475 --> 01:44.270
We sit here sometimes 


01:44.270 --> 01:46.272
thinking we need to pinch ourselves 


01:46.272 --> 01:48.817
because it’s so beautiful 
that we’ve been given the privilege 


01:48.817 --> 01:53.195
of doing the cart work 
in a location like this.


01:53.195 --> 01:56.365
Very soon, 
these national parks will not just be 


01:56.365 --> 01:58.763
isolated places that we have to travel to


01:58.763 --> 02:01.000
—the entire world will be that national park. 


02:02.183 --> 02:03.601
And what a joy it will be 


02:03.602 --> 02:05.917
when every single person alive 


02:05.917 --> 02:18.097
can enjoy that beautiful painting 
that our Creator has made for us!

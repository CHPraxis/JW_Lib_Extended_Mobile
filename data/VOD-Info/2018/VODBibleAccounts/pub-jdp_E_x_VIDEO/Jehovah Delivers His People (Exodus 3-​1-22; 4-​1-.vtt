00:01.813 --> 00:03.815
At the age of 40, 


00:03.815 --> 00:05.817
a man of the royal
house of Egypt 


00:05.817 --> 00:07.820
becomes a shepherd. 


00:07.820 --> 00:09.738
Forty years later, 


00:09.738 --> 00:11.531
that shepherd
leaves his flock 


00:11.532 --> 00:13.284
to shepherd people, 


00:13.283 --> 00:14.743
a nation of slaves 


00:14.743 --> 00:17.120
numbering in the millions. 


00:17.120 --> 00:20.332
Moses is that 80-year-old shepherd. 


00:20.332 --> 00:22.459
He leads the people of Israel 


00:22.458 --> 00:25.336
out of the hands 
of their cruel master, Egypt, 


00:25.337 --> 00:27.674
after they have resided in that land 


00:27.673 --> 00:30.000
for more than two centuries.


00:31.427 --> 00:34.054
When Moses was 40 years of age, 


00:34.053 --> 00:36.056
he thought he was qualified 


00:36.057 --> 00:39.685
to break Egypt’s iron grip over his people. 


00:39.685 --> 00:42.563
How did he show this? 


00:42.563 --> 00:47.275
Moses witnessed an incident 
of terrible injustice, 


00:47.275 --> 00:51.697
“an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, 
one of his brothers.” 


00:51.697 --> 00:53.782
He was eager to act, 


00:53.782 --> 00:58.620
so “he killed the Egyptian
and hid him in the sand.”


00:58.620 --> 01:02.958
Commenting on this, 
the Christian disciple Stephen said: 


01:02.958 --> 01:05.335
“He thought 
that his brothers would grasp 


01:05.335 --> 01:08.922
“that God was giving them 
salvation by his hand, 


01:08.922 --> 01:11.592
but they did not grasp it.” 


01:11.592 --> 01:15.887
His own people branded him a killer. 


01:15.887 --> 01:17.890
Fearing for his life, 


01:17.890 --> 01:19.517
Moses fled Egypt 


01:19.517 --> 01:23.312
and journeyed 
across the wilderness to Midian.


01:23.312 --> 01:25.480
During those 40 years, 


01:25.480 --> 01:29.652
Moses would cultivate patience, meekness, 


01:29.652 --> 01:33.822
humility, mildness of temper, self-control, 


01:33.822 --> 01:37.869
and the ability to wait on Jehovah.


01:37.868 --> 01:41.913
Who of us has not experienced 
challenges similar to Moses? 


01:41.913 --> 01:45.291
Have we had to overcome shyness 


01:45.292 --> 01:48.170
or stand up to bullying? 


01:48.170 --> 01:51.340
How do we react when faced with injustice 


01:51.340 --> 01:55.052
or opposition from family or from government? 


01:55.052 --> 01:57.179
Do we tend to get impatient 


01:57.178 --> 02:00.223
as we wait on Jehovah to make things right? 


02:00.223 --> 02:04.436
Or do we put too much confidence in ourselves 


02:04.437 --> 02:07.690
and too little in Jehovah? 


02:07.690 --> 02:11.485
If so, 
then we can learn a lesson in endurance 


02:11.485 --> 02:13.653
from the example of Moses. 


02:13.653 --> 02:18.000
Let us start by reading Exodus 3:1-10.


04:53.772 --> 04:56.484
Moses now had a divine commission. 


04:56.483 --> 05:00.028
The time had come 
for Jehovah to free his people. 


05:00.028 --> 05:02.030
The time had come for Moses 


05:02.030 --> 05:05.867
to be a faithful leader who does not give up. 


05:05.867 --> 05:08.870
Would he accept this assignment, 


05:08.870 --> 05:11.038
one that he had been only too eager 


05:11.038 --> 05:14.291
to take up 40 years earlier in Egypt? 


05:14.292 --> 05:19.000
Let’s pick up the Bible account 
at Exodus 3:11-22.


08:40.082 --> 08:44.252
What a dramatic change 
40 years has brought to Moses! 


08:44.252 --> 08:46.505
Here is a different Moses, 


08:46.505 --> 08:49.257
one who is uncertain, shy. 


08:49.257 --> 08:53.595
Moses has serious doubts 
about his own qualifications.


08:53.595 --> 08:57.723
He believes that his commission 
is too much for him. 


08:57.723 --> 09:00.726
In effect, he says: “Oh, no! 


09:00.727 --> 09:03.730
Please don’t ask me to do this!”


09:03.730 --> 09:07.317
Can you put yourself in Moses’ sandals? 


09:07.317 --> 09:09.945
Have you ever been given an assignment 


09:09.945 --> 09:12.655
that you feel is beyond your ability? 


09:12.655 --> 09:14.657
Yet, you don’t give up. 


09:14.657 --> 09:18.120
Earnest prayer helps restore your confidence. 


09:18.120 --> 09:20.122
You obey.


09:20.122 --> 09:22.374
What about Moses? 


09:22.373 --> 09:25.043
Jehovah reassures him by saying: 


09:25.043 --> 09:28.045
“I will prove to be with you.” 


09:28.045 --> 09:30.840
Yet, Moses is still hesitant. 


09:30.840 --> 09:32.842
Will he give up 


09:32.842 --> 09:35.637
and ask Jehovah to find someone else? 


09:35.637 --> 09:39.000
Note what Exodus 4:1-9 says:


11:42.638 --> 11:45.183
Moses needs reassurance. 


11:45.183 --> 11:48.686
So Jehovah gives Moses, not just one, 


11:48.687 --> 11:51.272
but three signs to show the older men 


11:51.272 --> 11:53.275
proof of divine backing. 


11:53.275 --> 11:56.653
And what powerful credentials these are! 


11:56.653 --> 11:58.655
For the first time, 


11:58.655 --> 12:01.658
a human is empowered to perform miracles.


12:01.658 --> 12:04.618
As the rest of Exodus chapter 4 shows, 


12:04.618 --> 12:08.415
Moses feels inadequate to speak to Pharaoh. 


12:08.415 --> 12:11.542
He pleads that he is “slow of tongue,” 


12:11.542 --> 12:13.295
even asking Jehovah 


12:13.295 --> 12:15.797
to excuse him from the task. 


12:15.797 --> 12:17.799
Jehovah gives him help.


12:17.798 --> 12:20.093
Jehovah assigns Aaron 


12:20.093 --> 12:22.511
as Moses’ mouthpiece. 


12:22.512 --> 12:25.557
Both men proceed to meet Pharaoh. 


12:25.557 --> 12:28.184
Listen to what is said to Pharaoh 


12:28.183 --> 12:31.000
as found at Exodus 5:1-9:


14:31.975 --> 14:35.770
Pharaoh defiantly says no to Jehovah. 


14:35.770 --> 14:38.313
He is angry at the Hebrews. 


14:38.313 --> 14:41.150
In turn, the people are angry at Moses. 


14:41.150 --> 14:43.695
They blame him for their hardship.


14:43.695 --> 14:46.280
Moses feels sorry for the people 


14:46.280 --> 14:48.282
and asks Jehovah: 


14:48.282 --> 14:50.660
“Why have you sent me?” 


14:50.660 --> 14:52.662
Jehovah patiently gives Moses 


14:52.662 --> 14:54.414
a reassuring message, 


14:54.413 --> 14:57.000
beginning at Exodus 6:1.


16:41.437 --> 16:44.107
Jehovah backs up his promise of deliverance 


16:44.107 --> 16:46.650
by means of his unique name. 


16:46.650 --> 16:49.945
Moses, therefore, does not give up. 


16:49.945 --> 16:52.032
He obeys Jehovah, 


16:52.032 --> 16:53.950
and he and Aaron prepare 


16:53.950 --> 16:56.035
to meet Pharaoh again. 


16:56.035 --> 17:00.000
Let’s read Exodus 7:1-7.


18:18.033 --> 18:21.328
Moses now can be confident 
of Jehovah’s backing 


18:21.328 --> 18:24.748
because Moses is doing 
things Jehovah’s way 


18:24.748 --> 18:29.045
and at a time that fits 
Jehovah’s prophetic timetable.


18:29.045 --> 18:31.838
Jehovah is about to use ten plagues 


18:31.838 --> 18:34.341
to bring Pharaoh to his knees. 


18:34.342 --> 18:36.802
These disasters will show 


18:36.802 --> 18:39.389
that Jehovah’s sovereignty is real 


18:39.388 --> 18:42.225
and that he is worthy of worship. 


18:42.225 --> 18:45.060
The Ten Plagues will also expose 


18:45.060 --> 18:48.313
the Egyptian gods as nothing


18:48.313 --> 18:50.816
—as mere unreality.


18:50.817 --> 18:52.819
The first three plagues 


18:52.818 --> 18:56.696
strike both the Egyptians and the Hebrews.


18:56.697 --> 18:59.075
However, the next seven plagues 


18:59.075 --> 19:01.202
do not touch the Hebrews


19:01.202 --> 19:03.537
—proof that Jehovah can set apart 


19:03.537 --> 19:05.665
and protect his worshippers 


19:05.665 --> 19:08.793
if they do not give up their trust in him.


19:08.793 --> 19:10.820
Now let’s summarize the Ten Plagues 


19:10.820 --> 19:15.000
listed at Exodus 7:14–11:10.


19:17.093 --> 19:21.638
Plague 1: 
Water is turned into blood.


19:21.638 --> 19:27.811
Plague 2: 
Frogs invade the land and houses.


19:27.812 --> 19:33.400
Plague 3: 
Gnats pester man and beast.


19:33.400 --> 19:39.615
Plague 4: 
Gadflies swarm and bite only the Egyptians.


19:39.615 --> 19:43.870
Plague 5: 
Livestock die.


19:43.870 --> 19:48.000
Plague 6: 
Boils fester on man and beast.


19:49.333 --> 19:54.000
Plague 7: 
Hail strikes man, beast, and vegetation.


19:55.423 --> 19:59.843
Plague 8: 
Locusts swarm and eat all vegetation 


19:59.843 --> 20:02.721
left after the hailstorm.


20:02.722 --> 20:06.059
Plague 9: 
Thick darkness 


20:06.058 --> 20:09.978
blankets Egypt for three days.


20:09.978 --> 20:14.983
Plague 10: 
The firstborn of man and livestock is killed.


20:14.983 --> 20:18.988
Pharaoh sees his firstborn dead. 


20:18.988 --> 20:22.158
He hears great outcries of bitter grief 


20:22.158 --> 20:25.285
rise from the houses of all the Egyptians 


20:25.285 --> 20:29.832
because they too see their firstborn dead. 


20:29.832 --> 20:32.544
Pharaoh quickly summons Moses and Aaron 


20:32.543 --> 20:35.796
and tells them to go, to hurry away.


20:35.797 --> 20:38.632
Will Pharaoh’s heart soften? 


20:38.632 --> 20:43.000
Let’s have Exodus 14:5-10 answer.


22:04.510 --> 22:07.430
Will Jehovah hear their cry for help?


22:07.430 --> 22:11.000
Let’s read Exodus 14:13-31.


26:43.872 --> 26:46.292
Are the Hebrews happy that they endured 


26:46.292 --> 26:48.377
to see the salvation of Jehovah? 


26:48.377 --> 26:50.379
Yes! 


26:50.378 --> 26:53.631
They break out in a joyful victory song.


26:53.632 --> 26:55.844
Listen to them sing! 


26:55.843 --> 26:58.470
You too can stand and sing along. 


26:58.470 --> 27:02.683
Song number 149 represents what is found 


27:02.683 --> 27:06.103
at Exodus 15:1-21.


27:06.103 --> 27:08.146
If you can, 


27:08.147 --> 27:13.000
let us all stand and sing song 149.


29:34.835 --> 29:37.672
Please be seated. 


29:37.672 --> 29:39.674
The account we just read 


29:39.673 --> 29:42.968
vividly illustrates Jehovah’s use of power 


29:42.968 --> 29:47.055
in a way that serves notice 
on all who defy him.


29:47.055 --> 29:51.143
Thus, what can we take away 
from our Bible reading? 


29:51.143 --> 29:54.396
The fact that the Hebrews suffered in Egypt 


29:54.397 --> 29:58.192
and Jehovah delivered them is concrete proof 


29:58.192 --> 30:01.445
that our hope for deliverance 
from Satan’s world 


30:01.445 --> 30:03.447
is not an empty one.


30:03.447 --> 30:07.827
When you seem trapped 
in a corner by life’s problems, 


30:07.827 --> 30:10.245
do not give up! 


30:10.245 --> 30:12.622
The God who parted the Red Sea 


30:12.622 --> 30:15.459
can provide escape for you too. 


30:15.458 --> 30:18.670
If, during the coming great tribulation, 


30:18.670 --> 30:21.298
you feel trapped by Satan’s hoards, 


30:21.298 --> 30:24.760
remember: Endure to the end! 


30:24.760 --> 30:27.428
Jehovah will provide escape for you 


30:27.428 --> 30:29.473
and for all his worshippers 


30:29.473 --> 30:38.003
who don’t give up!

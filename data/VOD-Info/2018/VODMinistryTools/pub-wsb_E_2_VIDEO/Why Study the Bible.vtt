Today, there is more information 


00:05.317 --> 00:08.820
available than ever before.


00:08.820 --> 00:11.000
But the big questions still remain.


00:12.565 --> 00:15.827
Where do we come from?


00:15.827 --> 00:18.000
Why do bad things happen?


00:19.898 --> 00:22.000
Why do people die?


00:23.865 --> 00:25.910
Most religious people think 


00:25.910 --> 00:27.985
that God controls the world.


00:27.985 --> 00:29.862
How could that be?


00:29.862 --> 00:33.000
This world is out of control!


00:34.930 --> 00:38.000
What the Bible says may surprise you.


00:41.020 --> 00:43.648
The Bible is helping millions of people 


00:43.648 --> 00:45.815
around the world find answers 


00:45.815 --> 00:48.682
to life’s big questions.


00:48.682 --> 00:51.000
Would you like to know those answers?


00:52.823 --> 00:54.825

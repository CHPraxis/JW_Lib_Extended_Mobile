00:06.818 --> 00:11.000
From the moment we can talk, 
we ask questions.


00:13.033 --> 00:16.911
Why is the sky blue?


00:16.912 --> 00:19.000
What are the stars made of?


00:20.832 --> 00:24.000
Why do bad things happen?


00:26.338 --> 00:30.000
Where do we come from?


00:31.218 --> 00:35.000
Why do people die?


00:36.932 --> 00:41.687
People go to great lengths 
to find answers.


00:41.687 --> 00:47.000
Today, there is more information
 available than ever before.


00:48.735 --> 00:52.530
But the big questions
—questions about life, 


00:52.530 --> 00:57.202
suffering, and death—still remain.


00:57.202 --> 01:01.000
Where can we find answers?


01:02.498 --> 01:08.000
What if the answers 
have been there all along in the Bible?


01:11.758 --> 01:13.843
A lot of people say, 


01:13.843 --> 01:17.000
the Bible is full of myths and legends.


01:18.932 --> 01:21.000
That it’s outdated.


01:22.603 --> 01:26.000
Or it’s just too hard to understand.


01:28.108 --> 01:31.195
But is the Bible really the problem, 


01:31.195 --> 01:36.000
or is it what people think they
 know about the Bible?


01:37.033 --> 01:41.496
People think the Bible says 
that God controls the world.


01:41.497 --> 01:44.875
But how could that be?


01:44.875 --> 01:48.000
This world is out of control!


01:50.380 --> 01:55.000
It’s full of pain and suffering,


01:56.012 --> 01:59.000
sickness and death,


02:00.390 --> 02:03.352
poverty and disaster.


02:03.352 --> 02:07.982
How could a loving God 
be responsible for all of this?


02:07.982 --> 02:11.000
What the Bible says may surprise you.


02:12.737 --> 02:17.574
It says: “The Evil One 
controls the whole world.”


02:17.573 --> 02:21.161
In other words, 
there’s an evil power 


02:21.162 --> 02:23.372
behind the world’s problems, 


02:23.372 --> 02:28.335
someone who’s pulling 
the strings behind the scenes.


02:28.335 --> 02:32.297
That’s why,
no matter how hard we try, 


02:32.297 --> 02:37.177
humans just cannot solve 
the world’s problems.


02:37.177 --> 02:39.389
The good news is: 


02:39.388 --> 02:43.975
The Bible says things 
will not always be like this!


02:43.975 --> 02:47.228
It tells us why we’re in this situation, 


02:47.228 --> 02:49.440
how God will fix it, 


02:49.440 --> 02:53.000
and how we can deal with it 
in the meantime.


02:54.528 --> 02:58.615
The Bible is providing answers 
to life’s big questions 


02:58.615 --> 03:02.243
for millions of people around the world.


03:02.243 --> 03:06.000
Would you like to be one of them?


03:09.377 --> 03:14.047

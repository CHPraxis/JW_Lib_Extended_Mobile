00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The release of the revised version

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.197 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures 

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the English language in 2013

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.662 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had a wonderful impact 
on the English-speaking world. 

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As Brother Jackson noted,

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎more than 60 years had passed 
since the release of the first volume 

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation, 
and during that time,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the English language had changed as well.

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During 2017,

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:40.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the revised version

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation
of the Holy Scriptures 

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎has been released

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in some major European languages,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎such as Italian (originally released in 1963),

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Dutch (also originally released in 1963),

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Greek (originally released in 1997),

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Hungarian (originally released in 2000).

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:09.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do the brothers and sisters feel

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the revised New World Translation 
in their particular language?

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.181 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The modern language

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.891 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in this revised version of the Bible

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.435 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎helps me to understand Bible passages

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because now it flows better
and is much simpler. 

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This helps me to meditate more
on what I have just read.

00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:35.866 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At Numbers 14:24,

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah speaks to Moses. 

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.080 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the older version, 
Jehovah says about Caleb

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that “a different spirit 
has proved to be with him.”

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:50.589 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the revised version, the verse reads

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that ‘my servant Caleb thinks differently’

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—very clear 
and doesn’t need further explanation.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.102 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Psalm 7:9 now says

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:05.104 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah “examines the hearts

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.106 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the deepest emotions,”

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎whereas previously it said
he examines the ‘hearts and the kidneys.’ 

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now it’s easier to understand.

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Besides all the aspects of helping to get 

00:02:16.907 --> 00:02:19.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a better understanding of God’s Word,

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why are brothers and sisters 
happy to use this revised version

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:25.499 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in field service?

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.295 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When reading a scripture,

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:31.714 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can tell that people understand

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it more quickly;

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there is less need to explain more. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s great.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:40.764 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I particularly like the glossary;

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:42.766 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it’s a kind of mini Insight book. 

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.601 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It has been very useful

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when I study and also in the ministry.

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.606 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Furthermore, I like

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.650 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that at the beginning of the Bible,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.652 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there are 20 introductions

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:57.573 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that answer questions
that people in the territory often ask,

00:02:57.573 --> 00:03:01.201 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they have Bible verses 
and very nice illustrations. 

00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.747 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they are very clear and practical.

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:09.376 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To achieve such an awesome result
by revising the New World Translation, 

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which important aspects did
the translators have to keep in mind?

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:19.386 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thanks to the modern language

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:21.388 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is used in the revision,

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:25.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎readers can understand
most Bible passages as they read them,

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:29.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎without having to stop 
and read them over again. 

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is possible, in part,

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because the text 
is not cluttered with too many words

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—trying to copy 
the Hebrew syntax and style of expression. 

00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:42.701 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thus, the use of modern language

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎contributes to naturalness and clarity.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:51.710 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The language used

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.921 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the revision also now allows

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the emotions of the characters 
to come through more vividly. 

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:59.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You straightaway notice when someone

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is angry or desperate or sad.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like in Matthew 11,
when Jesus invites us to take his yoke upon us,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:10.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his warmth is immediately obvious.

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:13.398 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the 2003 edition,

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:15.109 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎only one sentence was packed

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.902 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into seven verses,

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and its length was half a column,

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎making it very cumbersome
to follow the line of thought.

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the revised Bible, 
this part was cut into more sentences,

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.705 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so it is easier to grasp the idea.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:32.626 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many parents have told us

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:33.877 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that now when they read the Bible

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:34.878 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with their children,

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they don’t have to stop to explain words

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the reading is much more enjoyable.

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:44.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The revised New World Translation 
will be made available

00:04:44.888 --> 00:04:47.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in more languages in the near future. 

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:52.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We know that Jehovah wants 
all his people to listen

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as he speaks to them in clear,
understandable language.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:00.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This will help us 
to come to know Jehovah even better,

00:05:00.863 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our love for him

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:04.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will keep growing

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎while we read his Word with joy.

00:00:01 ‎Nick, thanks so much for being willing
00:00:03 ‎to come along  and answer some questions for us.
00:00:05 ‎Yes, I’m glad to come.
00:00:06 ‎Well, now that we’ve got you here, the first question I’d like to ask you is,
00:00:10 ‎What really are these so-called J-References?
00:00:14 ‎Well the “J” in the J-References
00:00:16 ‎stands for Jehovah.
00:00:18 ‎And this is mainly a list of Bibles
00:00:20 ‎in Hebrew and other languages
00:00:23 ‎that use the divine name, Jehovah,
00:00:26 ‎in the main text  of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:00:28 ‎—or at least some form  of the name Jehovah.
00:00:31 ‎And this list began to be compiled
00:00:34 ‎by the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:00:36 ‎in the 1940’s.
00:00:39 ‎So where would we find a list like that now?
00:00:41 ‎Well, originally there was  a list of 21 such references
00:00:45 ‎in the 1950 edition  of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:00:49 ‎Then, in 1984,
00:00:51 ‎27 such references were included
00:00:54 ‎in the Reference Bible in English.
00:00:58 ‎And since that time,  many more J-References have been found,
00:01:02 ‎and now the list includes
00:01:04 ‎over 90 such translations and reference works.
00:01:08 ‎And you can find an up-to-date list
00:01:10 ‎in Appendix C4 of the [Study] Bible.
00:01:13 ‎Very good.
00:01:14 ‎So I guess the main question  we’re interested in asking you is,
00:01:18 ‎Do these J-References prove in themselves
00:01:23 ‎that the Tetragrammaton should be  in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:01:26 ‎Actually, no; they don’t.
00:01:28 ‎Ah, now, I’m sure most of us  weren’t expecting you to say that.
00:01:31 ‎So can you explain it a little bit more please?
00:01:34 ‎Well,  the New World Translation Committee
00:01:36 ‎did not rely on the J-References as the basis for their decision
00:01:40 ‎to restore the divine name  in the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:01:44 ‎You already discussed  the basis for the decision
00:01:46 ‎earlier in the broadcast.
00:01:48 ‎Rather,  these J-References provide proof
00:01:51 ‎that other translators  have made similar decisions
00:01:55 ‎when restoring the divine name
00:01:57 ‎to their editions  of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:02:01 ‎or the so-called New Testament.
00:02:03 ‎So, now that you’re talking  about these other Bible translators,
00:02:06 ‎could you give us an example  of who you’re talking about?
00:02:10 ‎Well, a number of them  were well-known Bible scholars.
00:02:13 ‎For example, 19th-century  Lutheran theologian Franz Delitzsch
00:02:18 ‎is still considered to be  a foremost Bible scholar
00:02:21 ‎and a scholar of Biblical Hebrew.
00:02:24 ‎Delitzsch’s translation
00:02:26 ‎of the New Testament in Hebrew  was produced in 1877,
00:02:30 ‎and it’s one of the J-References.
00:02:32 ‎In fact, it’s still one  of the best-known New Testaments
00:02:35 ‎in the Hebrew language.
00:02:38 ‎In that translation,  he discerned when to use Jehovah’s name
00:02:42 ‎in places where the Greek text
00:02:44 ‎contains the term Kyʹri·os, or Lord.
00:02:47 ‎The New World Bible Translation Committee
00:02:50 ‎studied all those occurrences  from his translation
00:02:53 ‎as well as the occurrences  in others of the J-References.
00:02:58 ‎So how would you summarize  what the value is of these J-References?
00:03:03 ‎Well, all the J-References,
00:03:05 ‎including the new ones in the Study Bible,
00:03:08 ‎represent the view  of translators and scholars
00:03:11 ‎who arrived at the same conclusion
00:03:13 ‎that the New World  Bible Translation Committee did,
00:03:16 ‎namely, that Jesus Christ and the apostles
00:03:20 ‎used the name Jehovah  in their teaching and in their writings.
00:03:25 ‎And this conclusion is reflected
00:03:27 ‎in their translation and reference works.
00:03:30 ‎Very interesting.  That’s fascinating.
00:03:32 ‎So if I’ve got it right then,
00:03:34 ‎what you’re saying is that if we go to Appendix C, in C3,
00:03:39 ‎there we’ve got a list of the reasons
00:03:41 ‎why the brothers on the New World Translation Committee
00:03:44 ‎decided to put Jehovah’s name in certain verses.
00:03:47 ‎And then C4 is virtually
00:03:50 ‎a list of other Bible translations
00:03:52 ‎where the translators made exactly the same decision.
00:03:56 ‎Is that right?
00:03:57 ‎That’s exactly right.
00:03:58 ‎Ah, that’s good.
00:03:58 ‎Well, thank you very much, Nick, for coming along.
00:04:00 ‎We really appreciated hearing  those expressions from you.
00:04:03 ‎Before you go, though,  can we ask you, please,
00:04:06 ‎Can you take back the love and greetings and an expression of appreciation
00:04:10 ‎to all those hardworking brothers and sisters there in Translation Services?
00:04:14 ‎Yes, I’d be happy to.
00:04:16 ‎Thank you very much.

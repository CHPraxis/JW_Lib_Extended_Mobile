00:00:02 ‎In 1950,
00:00:05 ‎the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.
00:00:08 ‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing
00:00:12 ‎“the New World Translation
00:00:14 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!”
00:00:19 ‎This translation was unique
00:00:22 ‎in that it restored  the divine name, Jehovah,
00:00:25 ‎237 times in the main text
00:00:28 ‎of the so-called New Testament.
00:00:31 ‎But how could they do that,  considering that for centuries
00:00:34 ‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name?
00:00:38 ‎And why did the divine name  need to be restored?
00:00:43 ‎The oldest copies we have available
00:00:45 ‎do not use the divine name
00:00:47 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;
00:00:49 ‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.
00:00:53 ‎Very early on,
00:00:54 ‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,
00:00:57 ‎they simply replaced
00:00:59 ‎—they got into the practice of replacing— God’s name.
00:01:04 ‎We know that this is not a translation
00:01:07 ‎because one is a name  and the other one is a title.
00:01:09 ‎And it’s not even   a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.
00:01:14 ‎Since the Greek Scriptures
00:01:15 ‎were an inspired addition
00:01:17 ‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and,
00:01:18 ‎in fact,
00:01:19 ‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,
00:01:21 ‎was used some 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures,
00:01:25 ‎the sudden disappearance in the Greek text is inconsistent.
00:01:29 ‎Even though  the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:01:33 ‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear
00:01:35 ‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:01:37 ‎they also knew that at that time
00:01:40 ‎virtually all Bible scholars  disagreed with that belief.
00:01:44 ‎Those scholars argued  that by the time of Jesus,
00:01:47 ‎even the Greek translation  of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint,
00:01:51 ‎no longer contained the divine name.
00:01:54 ‎So why would the writers  of the New Testament
00:01:56 ‎use the divine name when their copies  of the Holy Scriptures in Greek
00:02:00 ‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton?
00:02:03 ‎This view was based on faulty information.
00:02:06 ‎How so?
00:02:07 ‎Did the Septuagint still use
00:02:09 ‎the divine name in Jesus’ time?
00:02:12 ‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence
00:02:14 ‎that answers this question.
00:02:16 ‎Something amazing happened in 1944.
00:02:19 ‎A theological journal published a picture
00:02:21 ‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment
00:02:24 ‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection.
00:02:27 ‎Now, inside that fragment  there was the divine name.
00:02:31 ‎In the Greek text,  you had the Tetragrammaton,
00:02:34 ‎not just once but throughout.
00:02:36 ‎Now, this fragment was very old,  dating back to the first century B.C.E.,
00:02:40 ‎but the important point is  that this was proof, clear proof,
00:02:44 ‎that the divine name was originally there.
00:02:48 ‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked
00:02:51 ‎to obtain photographs of these fragments,
00:02:53 ‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.
00:02:57 ‎The New World Translation Committee  was very interested in this
00:03:00 ‎because they started translating
00:03:03 ‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.
00:03:07 ‎After obtaining permission,  pictures of 12 of the fragments
00:03:11 ‎were published in the foreword  of the New World Translation
00:03:13 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:03:19 ‎What amazes me about this is the timing.
00:03:23 ‎When our brothers —this New World Translation Committee—
00:03:27 ‎did their research, before even translating,
00:03:30 ‎suddenly something that was unknown
00:03:32 ‎until essentially 1944
00:03:36 ‎came to light that confirmed
00:03:38 ‎that the eternal name of God
00:03:42 ‎had to be revealed; it could no longer be hidden.
00:03:46 ‎It should be shown to everyone  who wants to worship Jehovah.
00:03:49 ‎This careful preservation  supports what Jesus said in prayer
00:03:54 ‎at John 17:26,  when he said to his Father:
00:03:57 ‎“I have made your name known . . .  and will make it known.”
00:04:01 ‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses,  we are proud to be “a people for his name.”
00:04:06 ‎Knowing his name  is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,
00:04:11 ‎and the fact that Jehovah  has provided this arrangement
00:04:14 ‎through his people
00:04:16 ‎makes it very clear
00:04:19 ‎that he was gathering  “a people for his name.”
00:04:22 ‎This is why  this Bible translation is so beautiful,
00:04:26 ‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah.
00:04:28 ‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere,  which could apply to anyone,
00:04:32 ‎but he is Jehovah, our God.
00:04:36 ‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,
00:04:38 ‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’

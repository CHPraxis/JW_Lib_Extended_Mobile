‎In 1950,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“the New World Translation

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!” 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.835 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This translation was unique

00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in that it restored 
the divine name, Jehovah,

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎237 times in the main text

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the so-called New Testament.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how could they do that, 
considering that for centuries 

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name? 

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And why did the divine name 
need to be restored?

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:45.024 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The oldest copies we have available

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.026 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎do not use the divine name

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.737 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;

00:00:49.737 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:54.700 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very early on,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.953 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,

00:00:57.953 --> 00:00:59.705 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they simply replaced

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—they got into the practice of replacing—
God’s name. 

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We know that this is not a translation

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because one is a name 
and the other one is a title. 

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s not even  
a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:15.512 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Since the Greek Scriptures

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.014 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were an inspired addition

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:18.766 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and, 

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.892 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fact,

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:25.356 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was used some 7,000 times
in the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:29.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the sudden disappearance
in the Greek text is inconsistent.

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:33.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even though 
the New World Bible Translation Committee 

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.868 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they also knew that at that time

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:44.041 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎virtually all Bible scholars 
disagreed with that belief. 

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those scholars argued 
that by the time of Jesus,

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even the Greek translation 
of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint, 

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no longer contained the divine name. 

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:56.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So why would the writers 
of the New Testament

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎use the divine name when their copies 
of the Holy Scriptures in Greek

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:03.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton? 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This view was based on faulty information.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How so? 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.858 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Did the Septuagint still use

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:12.152 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the divine name in Jesus’ time? 

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that answers this question.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Something amazing happened in 1944. 

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A theological journal published a picture

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:27.459 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, inside that fragment 
there was the divine name.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the Greek text, 
you had the Tetragrammaton,

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:36.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not just once but throughout. 

00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:40.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, this fragment was very old, 
dating back to the first century B.C.E.,

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the important point is 
that this was proof, clear proof,

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name was originally there.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to obtain photographs
of these fragments,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.

00:02:57.698 --> 00:03:00.951 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Translation Committee 
was very interested in this

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:03.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they started translating

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After obtaining permission, 
pictures of 12 of the fragments 

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were published in the foreword 
of the New World Translation

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.848 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What amazes me about this is the timing. 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When our brothers
—this New World Translation Committee—

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did their research, before even translating,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.566 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎suddenly something that was unknown

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until essentially 1944

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.489 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎came to light that confirmed

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the eternal name of God

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had to be revealed;
it could no longer be hidden. 

00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It should be shown to everyone 
who wants to worship Jehovah.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This careful preservation 
supports what Jesus said in prayer

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at John 17:26, 
when he said to his Father:

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:01.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have made your name known . . . 
and will make it known.”

00:04:01.887 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we are proud to be “a people for his name.”

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Knowing his name 
is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the fact that Jehovah 
has provided this arrangement

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎through his people

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎makes it very clear

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.950 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he was gathering 
“a people for his name.”

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is why 
this Bible translation is so beautiful,

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah. 

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere, 
which could apply to anyone,

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he is Jehovah, our God. 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:43.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’

Welcome to this special news update

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:07.957 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
regarding our brothers in Venezuela.

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:10.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As reported in the JW News section

00:00:10.593 --> 00:00:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of jw.org in August 2017,

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers in Venezuela
are enduring difficult economic conditions.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, the overall situation continues to worsen.

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basic needs, like food and medicine,

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are hard to obtain.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and crime is on the increase.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things are chaotic.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we love our worldwide brotherhood,

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this difficult situation affects all of us.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul said at 1 Corinthians 12:26:

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If one member suffers,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all the other members suffer with it;

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:55.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or if a member is glorified,

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the other members rejoice with it.”

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you pray regularly
for our brothers in Venezuela.

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:07.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite these difficult times,

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are our brothers doing spiritually?

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re sure you’ll find the following report

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be sobering and encouraging.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how,
despite these difficult times,

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers in Venezuela
are showing love and faith.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this report 
motivate all of us to continue having

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:33.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“unity of mind, fellow feeling,

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brotherly affection, [and] tender compassion,”

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as 1 Peter 3:8 says.

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:59.736 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing to see
how far the situation has gone,

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we are still at it.

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:05.041 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So people in general have a lot of endurance,

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they endure.

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re still cheerful.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have to trust one another;

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have to rely on one another.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We gathered some statistics two months ago,

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we found out that in only three years,

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:26.362 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
7,000 publishers

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—among them many elders, many pioneers—

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have left the country because of the dangers.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have felt threatened;
some had been kidnapped,

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:40.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let go, and then they left the country;

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
family members have been killed, and so on.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one of the things we had to do
with the local congregations

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:10.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which most of them 
have quite a few Bethelite elders—

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is move their meeting time on the weekdays

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an earlier hour so that the brothers
can go to the meeting with daylight,

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:26.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes they can go home
after the meeting with some daylight.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go to some congregations
that are well-to-do

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I’ve been to the place),
you don’t see anyone at the meeting

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their cell phones or tablets.

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “Why is that?”

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s not because they are afraid to lose it,

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just don’t want
to attract criminals into the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:48.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so for one tablet, all might suffer.

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:53.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see,
they’re learning to be streetwise even more,

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in Venezuela,
you had to be streetwise

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a long time in the past,

00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now it’s getting worse.

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brotherhood in general don’t complain.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least in my congregation,

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to ask
and you have to show real interest

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the brothers and sisters
can tell you what they’re going through.

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knocked on the door,

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the door opened just a little crack.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the young man, when he saw me,
opened the door wide, and we talked.

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him,
“Have you ever read the Bible?”

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said,
“Oh, when I was in prison, I read it a lot.”

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He probably said that to see my reaction.

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we just kept talking and talking.

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:43.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Behind him was another young man;
he had a pistol in his hand.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that, and I didn’t react.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He put the gun in his pocket,

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we kept talking for about 15-20 minutes.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we went away,
the brother that was with me was quite upset.

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “Do you know who that was?”

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “No.”

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That was one of the gang leaders.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has killed a lot of people.”

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said: “Well, what I noticed
is that he’s a human being just like the rest.

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He needs the message.”

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have noticed, too, in the last few years,

00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:17.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an increase not only in publishers

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:20.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but pioneers.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who are starting to pioneer?

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:26.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as usual, mostly sisters, but many brothers,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many elders.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have had a good job;

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they lost their job because the company
closed down and left the country.

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many brothers have mentioned to me:

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, I lost my job; I have no job.
Now I can pioneer.”

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they start pioneering.

00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:48.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that’s very good,
and it helps them to keep going.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure the brothers
are happy to see that everybody cares

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everybody in the brotherhood worldwide.

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is informed

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is doing all they physically can to help us

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:04.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their prayers.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you feel
part of the worldwide brotherhood

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:12.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—then you are not alone—
that has a calming effect on you.

00:06:13.656 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your confidence, or faith,

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a physical, visible organization, grows.

00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know we’re part
of something bigger than just a country.

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is putting to the test

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:32.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how strong we will have faith in Bible principles.

00:06:32.542 --> 00:06:35.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think they work,

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when they’re put to the test,
then you’re convinced that they work.

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I’m convinced
that I will come out of this stronger.

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what James said

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that endurance
needs to go to work in each one of us.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you view it that way,

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then that gives you hope

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this sad and hard and difficult time

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will make us better.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah 8:10 says:

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not feel sad,

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where is our strength?

00:07:10.213 --> 00:07:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In “the joy of Jehovah.”

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:15.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we should always be positive,

00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not negative
—not concentrate on the negative.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like I quoted before, Nehemiah 8:10,

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:26.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the joy of Jehovah”
—that’s what we see among the brothers.

00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The numbers came down
because of the 7,000 that have left,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the congregations keep reporting.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the circuit overseers, 
in their reports, keep showing us

00:07:37.607 --> 00:07:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that new people
are still coming into the truth

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:41.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many new ones.

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s positive.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not paralyzed because of that.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They keep focused on the Kingdom,

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:53.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus the King,
and they keep going in that direction.

00:07:53.256 --> 00:07:57.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anytime anyone looks
to the side and looks at the storm,

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he stops in his tracks;

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he starts missing meetings;

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he starts thinking about his wallet
—his money, his bank account.

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is not good.

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:12.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep focused on the Kingdom.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:23.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re proud of you brothers in Venezuela

00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:26.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for keeping focused on spiritual things

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:30.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintaining a positive spirit
during these difficult times.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reports show
that of the 140,000 publishers in Venezuela,

00:01.550 --> 00:03.553
Colombia is situated 


00:03.553 --> 00:06.055
in the northwest of South America. 


00:06.055 --> 00:08.057
Its territory encompasses 


00:08.057 --> 00:10.060
the Amazon rain forest, 


00:10.060 --> 00:14.497
tropical grassland, the Andes mountain range, 


00:14.497 --> 00:18.200
and the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. 


00:18.200 --> 00:21.637
It’s known for growing high-quality coffee. 


00:21.637 --> 00:23.940
But what is even more impressive there 


00:23.940 --> 00:27.377
is the spiritual growth 
among Jehovah’s people. 


00:27.377 --> 00:30.780
Colombians are very friendly and hospitable, 


00:30.780 --> 00:35.418
and our brothers show these qualities 
in an outstanding way. 


00:35.418 --> 00:39.021
In March, we had a new all-time peak 


00:39.022 --> 00:41.024
in the number of publishers. 


00:41.023 --> 00:44.560
We had 172,028 


00:44.560 --> 00:46.595
who shared in the preaching work 


00:46.595 --> 00:49.398
in this special month of activity. 


00:49.398 --> 00:52.635
As a result, on April 11, 


00:52.635 --> 00:57.307
we had an all-time peak 
in the number of the Memorial attendees, 


00:57.307 --> 01:02.079
with 515,800 in attendance 


01:02.078 --> 01:05.681
—three times the number of publishers. 


01:05.682 --> 01:08.452
Because of the geography of the country, 


01:08.452 --> 01:10.487
there are some areas of Colombia 


01:10.487 --> 01:13.657
where it is not easy 
to reach with the good news. 


01:13.657 --> 01:15.592
For this reason, 


01:15.592 --> 01:17.594
from time to time
—once a year—


01:17.593 --> 01:19.828
some special campaigns are organized. 


01:19.828 --> 01:22.531
The last campaign was organized 


01:22.532 --> 01:28.370
from November 2016 to January 2017. 


01:28.370 --> 01:32.942
Seven thousand four hundred 
and fifty-six publishers shared 


01:32.942 --> 01:34.577
in this campaign, 


01:34.577 --> 01:38.047
including several members 
of our Bethel family. 


01:38.047 --> 01:41.517
I would like to share with you 
some encouraging experiences 


01:41.517 --> 01:45.422
that the brothers had during this campaign. 


01:45.422 --> 01:48.759
A regular pioneer couple wanted to share 


01:48.758 --> 01:51.260
in the campaign with other friends. 


01:51.260 --> 01:55.865
Unfortunately, 
no one was available to go with them. 


01:55.865 --> 02:00.870
In addition to that, the territory 
where they were assigned was far away, 


02:00.870 --> 02:02.905
the climate was cold, 


02:02.905 --> 02:06.175
and there were 
no known Jehovah’s Witnesses there. 


02:06.175 --> 02:09.812
At first, this made the couple worried, 


02:09.812 --> 02:14.217
but they took courage 
and they went to the assigned territory. 


02:14.217 --> 02:17.187
The very day they started to preach there, 


02:17.187 --> 02:19.255
they met a man who, 


02:19.255 --> 02:23.358
after listening carefully 
to their introduction, said:


02:23.358 --> 02:25.695
“I know what you are talking about. 


02:25.695 --> 02:29.998
In fact, when I was a child, 
I used to preach as you do.” 


02:29.998 --> 02:32.001
Then he added, 


02:32.002 --> 02:35.305
“I tell my neighbors 
that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


02:35.305 --> 02:37.807
The couple was quite surprised, 


02:37.807 --> 02:39.942
especially because from what they knew, 


02:39.942 --> 02:43.079
there were 
no Jehovah’s Witnesses in the area. 


02:43.078 --> 02:46.181
So they asked the man to explain more. 


02:46.182 --> 02:49.285
The man told them that as a child, 


02:49.285 --> 02:52.222
he lived in a different part of the country 


02:52.222 --> 02:55.292
and that his grandmother 
was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


02:55.292 --> 02:58.127
and used to take him in service with her. 


02:58.127 --> 03:01.364
Later, because of unrest and violence, 


03:01.363 --> 03:03.633
he had to leave his hometown, 


03:03.633 --> 03:06.635
and he moved to his current place. 


03:06.635 --> 03:09.572
He’s now very happy to study again, 


03:09.572 --> 03:13.877
along with his wife and five children. 


03:13.877 --> 03:17.047
In the special campaign, 
a special effort is made 


03:17.047 --> 03:20.049
to reach the numerous 
indigenous communities 


03:20.048 --> 03:22.318
that are present in Colombia. 


03:22.318 --> 03:26.088
In one of them, 
two sisters met a man 


03:26.088 --> 03:29.325
while walking toward the territory 
and preached to him. 


03:29.325 --> 03:31.327
He kindly told them 


03:31.327 --> 03:33.630
that he was the chief of the community. 


03:33.630 --> 03:35.865
At the moment, he was very busy, 


03:35.865 --> 03:40.303
but he was giving them permission 
to preach to all in the community. 


03:40.303 --> 03:43.171
After they preached to all in the community, 


03:43.172 --> 03:46.242
the sisters met this man again. 


03:46.242 --> 03:50.514
He exclaimed: 
“The people of God finally arrived! 


03:50.513 --> 03:52.648
“Come on in. 
Please teach us. 


03:52.648 --> 03:54.650
We were waiting for you.” 


03:54.650 --> 03:57.853
A great witness was given. 


03:57.853 --> 04:01.356
A week later, when the Witnesses called back, 


04:01.357 --> 04:05.329
they met 30 people waiting 
for them in the chief’s house, 


04:05.328 --> 04:08.965
with the Listen to God brochure 
in their hands, 


04:08.965 --> 04:11.968
ready to learn about Jehovah. 


04:11.968 --> 04:15.505
Yes, as these experiences illustrate, 


04:15.505 --> 04:19.808
in Colombia 
‘the fields are white for harvesting.’ 


04:19.808 --> 04:23.846
It is a great pleasure for me 
to convey the love and greetings 


04:23.847 --> 04:26.082
of all of our brothers 
and sisters in Colombia, 


04:26.082 --> 04:38.579
including the 255 members 
of our Bethel family.

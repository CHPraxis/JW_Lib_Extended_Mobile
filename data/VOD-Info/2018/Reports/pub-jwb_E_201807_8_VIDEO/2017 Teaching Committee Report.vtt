00:01.063 --> 00:03.691
It’s a pleasure to relate to you two aspects

00:03.691 --> 00:06.068
of the Teaching Committee’s work.

00:06.068 --> 00:08.195
First, what does it take

00:08.195 --> 00:11.907
to put a regional convention 
together these days?

00:11.907 --> 00:16.704
And second, what can we expect 
with regard to our midweek meetings?

00:16.704 --> 00:21.333
The Teaching Committee is very grateful 
to every Bethel department.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.086
Each of you has contributed in some way

00:24.086 --> 00:27.339
to the spiritually festive events

00:27.339 --> 00:31.510
that we enjoy at our conventions 
and our midweek meetings.

00:31.510 --> 00:36.056
Our conventions 
have come a long way since 1889.

00:37.099 --> 00:42.104
But as you’ll see, the improvements 
must be attributed to Jehovah.

00:45.733 --> 00:48.527
This convention is so beautiful.

00:48.527 --> 00:50.529
It moves you to the core.

00:51.947 --> 00:54.700
It’s a very spiritually enriching 
experience for all of us.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.536
We really see 
the Governing Body is caring for us.

00:57.536 --> 00:58.704
It’s amazing!

00:58.704 --> 01:02.791
This sentiment 
has been echoed for over a century.

01:02.791 --> 01:07.046
How is it that year after year people 
who have been in the truth for decades

01:07.046 --> 01:09.423
can say that the most recent convention

01:09.423 --> 01:12.343
has surpassed all preceding ones?

01:12.343 --> 01:15.721
And how do the brothers 
who prepare convention programs feel

01:15.721 --> 01:18.390
when they hear comments like that?

01:18.390 --> 01:20.559
If this were merely the work of humans,

01:20.559 --> 01:25.481
they might feel like Caleb as depicted 
in the 2017 regional conventions.

01:28.609 --> 01:31.695
Thankfully, this is not the work of one man.

01:31.695 --> 01:36.158
All praise goes to Jehovah 
for the timely conventions we enjoy.

01:36.158 --> 01:39.995
His spirit is working through 
many willing volunteers.

01:39.995 --> 01:44.208
Let’s take a brief look 
at how our conventions are made.

01:44.208 --> 01:47.711
It all begins with the theme.

01:47.711 --> 01:52.341
As Brother Morris pointed out 
at the 2017 regional convention,

01:52.341 --> 01:56.637
one-word themes 
are determined years in advance.

01:56.637 --> 02:01.016
That one word will guide 
those preparing the program.

02:01.016 --> 02:04.561
Dramas 
—the most labor-intensive part of a program—

02:04.561 --> 02:07.606
are developed five years in advance.

02:07.606 --> 02:11.652
To prepare scripts, 
the Teaching Committee cooperates closely

02:11.652 --> 02:14.154
with the Writing Department 
in working with a team

02:14.154 --> 02:16.949
known as the Drama Review Group.

02:16.949 --> 02:18.951
These experienced writers

02:18.951 --> 02:22.162
develop Scriptural plots 
that teach lessons in harmony

02:22.162 --> 02:24.915
with the convention theme.

02:24.915 --> 02:27.084
Scripts are extensively researched

02:27.084 --> 02:29.962
and then sent to Audio/Video Services,

02:29.962 --> 02:33.424
or AVS, for production.

02:33.424 --> 02:36.635
All of this work has to begin early.

02:36.635 --> 02:39.263
But how is the rest 
of a convention program developed?

02:41.890 --> 02:44.268
Each year, the Teaching Committee 
carefully considers reports

02:44.268 --> 02:46.562
from around the world 
from Branch Committees

02:46.562 --> 02:48.814
and world headquarters representatives.

02:48.814 --> 02:53.777
Often, such reports indicate topics 
that could be addressed on a convention.

02:53.777 --> 02:57.448
The Teaching Committee 
then selects a more specific theme

02:57.448 --> 02:59.742
that will serve as the basis 
for addressing the needs

02:59.742 --> 03:02.661
of our worldwide brotherhood.

03:02.661 --> 03:06.665
The theme is submitted 
to the entire Governing Body for approval.

03:06.665 --> 03:11.545
Then, work begins on Scripture themes 
for each day of the convention.

03:13.005 --> 03:16.216
The Friday program lays the foundation:

03:16.216 --> 03:18.761
What is the central truth under discussion?

03:18.761 --> 03:21.805
Why should we give attention to it now?

03:21.805 --> 03:25.601
Saturday brings admonition 
on personal conduct,

03:25.601 --> 03:28.854
field ministry, and family life.

03:28.854 --> 03:31.482
Sunday often highlights what the Bible says

03:31.482 --> 03:35.694
about our future 
and encourages us to maintain our hope.

03:35.694 --> 03:38.989
Once this general framework is established,

03:38.989 --> 03:41.700
talks are conceived

03:41.700 --> 03:43.827
and additional lines of reasoning are chosen.

03:43.827 --> 03:46.163
Attention is given to how to present ideas

03:46.163 --> 03:48.582
in a variety of ways:

03:48.582 --> 03:51.502
Could a Scriptural discussion 
reach the heart more effectively

03:51.502 --> 03:55.380
by means of an interview or a video?

03:55.380 --> 03:58.008
This detailed sketch is all worked out

03:58.008 --> 04:00.469
before the Teaching Committee 
assigns teams of writers.

04:02.805 --> 04:06.642
AVS collaborates with the writers 
in the development of brief videos.

04:06.642 --> 04:09.686
The Art Department brainstorms ideas

04:09.686 --> 04:12.606
for convention branding.

04:12.606 --> 04:16.819
The compiler follows 
the written content through 70 steps

04:16.819 --> 04:20.739
of research, fact-checking, and proofreading.

04:20.739 --> 04:24.785
Then, all of these outlines and scripts 
have to be translated

04:24.785 --> 04:29.540
into the 343 languages 
in which we hold regional conventions.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.918
Translation Services 
helps teams around the world

04:32.918 --> 04:36.463
to overcome challenges with the text.

04:36.463 --> 04:38.465
Composers and arrangers

04:38.465 --> 04:40.634
make music tracks for the 18 songs

04:40.634 --> 04:44.638
that have been selected 
and the 6 music-video preludes.

04:44.638 --> 04:47.724
Music services also produces and records

04:47.724 --> 04:51.687
musical scores 
for the feature film, the audio drama,

04:51.687 --> 04:56.608
and some 40 other brief videos 
that are used on the program.

04:56.608 --> 04:58.735
But the Teaching Committee’s involvement

04:58.735 --> 05:00.737
doesn’t end here.

05:00.737 --> 05:04.658
It provides direction 
regarding the assigning of speakers,

05:04.658 --> 05:07.119
the design of sound systems,

05:07.703 --> 05:09.872
the securing of contracts 
for hotels and venues,

05:09.872 --> 05:13.876
the operation of convention departments,

05:13.876 --> 05:16.211
and the training of volunteers.

05:16.211 --> 05:19.131
Thousands of willing workers are involved,

05:19.131 --> 05:21.383
each submitting to the inspired direction

05:21.383 --> 05:23.969
in God’s Word and the influence

05:23.969 --> 05:26.430
of his holy spirit.

05:26.430 --> 05:29.516
The benefits of such collaboration are felt

05:29.516 --> 05:32.186
not only at our annual conventions

05:32.186 --> 05:35.189
but also at our weekly meetings.

05:35.189 --> 05:38.192
It’s been two years since the inception

05:38.192 --> 05:41.778
of the Our Christian Life and Ministry 
midweek meeting.

05:41.778 --> 05:44.198
How have things been going on that front?

05:44.198 --> 05:47.451
Everything got better: 
how the brothers and sisters feel

05:47.451 --> 05:49.703
about the meeting and how they participate.

05:49.703 --> 05:53.790
There are more videos at the meetings,

05:53.790 --> 05:56.501
so I feel closer 
to the worldwide brotherhood.

05:56.501 --> 05:59.671
I really enjoy what it does for young ones,

05:59.671 --> 06:02.466
especially the two-minute parts.

06:02.466 --> 06:06.845
You see young ones, even very young children, 
do a demonstration.

06:06.845 --> 06:10.098
Instead of just underlining to prepare,

06:10.098 --> 06:12.434
now I get excited looking for gems.

06:12.434 --> 06:16.355
We really dig into a Bible account.

06:16.355 --> 06:18.649
I learn a whole lot more.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.818
After the meeting,

06:21.818 --> 06:24.696
we enjoy discussing the gems we discovered.

06:24.696 --> 06:27.199
Every meeting gives 
you something practical

06:27.199 --> 06:30.202
that you can apply 
the next weekend right away.

06:30.202 --> 06:34.081
Now we don’t just read 
the Bible as a family,

06:34.081 --> 06:37.084
but we pay more attention 
to Jehovah’s qualities.

06:37.084 --> 06:41.505
Young ones and new publishers 
are now less hesitant

06:41.505 --> 06:43.507
about sharing their beliefs at the door

06:43.507 --> 06:46.385
because they simply do 
what they learned at the meetings.

06:46.385 --> 06:48.929
Regarding production of the meeting,

06:48.929 --> 06:51.640
methods of the Gilead School are employed

06:51.640 --> 06:53.976
in the approach to study.

06:53.976 --> 06:56.353
The Gilead approach to study

06:56.353 --> 06:59.106
considers context, explanation,

06:59.106 --> 07:01.108
and application.

07:01.108 --> 07:04.611
Analyzing the context 
considers the time period,

07:04.611 --> 07:07.781
the historical setting, 
and the writer’s intent.

07:07.781 --> 07:11.201
These are built 
into the Treasures From God’s Word

07:11.201 --> 07:14.246
and the Bible Book Introduction Videos

07:14.246 --> 07:16.999
we see at the midweek meetings.

07:16.999 --> 07:21.169
The explanations for the verses 
are all based on the publications

07:21.169 --> 07:23.171
of “the faithful and discreet slave”

07:23.171 --> 07:26.591
to ensure accuracy and correct understanding.

07:26.591 --> 07:31.596
After all, at Gilead School, 
students aren’t allowed to guess.

07:31.596 --> 07:34.808
Once a scripture is explained accurately,

07:34.808 --> 07:37.686
then it can be applied properly.

07:37.686 --> 07:41.732
This method of context and explanation

07:41.732 --> 07:46.737
followed by application 
leads to meaningful Bible study.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.864
The Service Committee Office

07:48.864 --> 07:53.535
provides input on field service presentations 
and Living as Christians.

07:54.244 --> 07:58.540
The Writing Department gives insight 
on how to feature our publications.

07:58.540 --> 08:01.960
What will change after January?

08:01.960 --> 08:05.714
As announced at the 2017 annual meeting,

08:05.714 --> 08:09.301
the public edition 
of The Watchtower will be published

08:09.301 --> 08:11.928
three times a year instead of six.

08:11.928 --> 08:14.556
The same will be true for Awake!

08:15.349 --> 08:20.228
Also, specific monthly literature offers 
have been discontinued.

08:20.228 --> 08:25.233
Thus, we will enjoy some adjustments 
in our field service presentations.

08:25.734 --> 08:28.236
As you will see, the new focus will be

08:28.236 --> 08:30.572
not so much on publications

08:30.572 --> 08:33.200
but on conversations.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.244
Clearly, the production 
of our midweek meetings

08:36.244 --> 08:39.289
and regional conventions 
takes a lot of planning

08:39.289 --> 08:42.334
and the cooperation of many willing workers

08:42.334 --> 08:45.212
in a variety of Bethel departments.

08:45.212 --> 08:49.216
But the positive effects 
are felt around the world.

08:49.216 --> 08:53.053
All I can say to Jehovah is, 
“Thank you, Jehovah, for letting me be here.”

08:53.053 --> 08:57.933
I feel very grateful 
to Jehovah for the meetings.

08:57.933 --> 09:00.018
Thank you, Jehovah.

09:00.769 --> 09:04.898
Sometimes Bethel receives letters 
that go something like this:

09:04.898 --> 09:08.318
“Thank you for your tireless efforts.”

09:08.318 --> 09:12.823
Actually, the brothers and sisters 
working on all these projects are tired.

09:12.823 --> 09:14.825
But they never tire

09:14.825 --> 09:18.703
of trusting in and cooperating with the One 
who truly is tireless:

09:18.703 --> 09:22.707
the Source of all divine instruction, 
Jehovah.

09:22.707 --> 09:26.044
He alone can replace copper with gold,

09:26.044 --> 09:28.922
so that each segment of divine education

09:28.922 --> 09:39.497
truly is the best ever.

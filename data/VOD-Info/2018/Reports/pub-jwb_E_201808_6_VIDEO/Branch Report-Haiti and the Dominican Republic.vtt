WEBVTT

00:03.399 --> 00:05.901
On Sunday, February the 26th,

00:05.901 --> 00:09.071
I traveled 
to Port-au-Prince for the branch visit

00:09.071 --> 00:13.075
and was warmly welcomed 
by many of the Bethel family of 54 members.

00:14.535 --> 00:17.413
The branch office 
supervises the preaching work

00:17.413 --> 00:20.958
for more than 20,000 publishers.

00:20.958 --> 00:23.127
Although Haiti has faced economic challenges

00:23.127 --> 00:25.713
and suffered recent natural disasters,

00:25.713 --> 00:28.132
our brothers are positive

00:28.132 --> 00:33.095
and focus their attention on helping 
others to identify our Scriptural hope.

00:33.095 --> 00:37.099
The Haitian people show 
a keen interest in the Word of God.

00:37.099 --> 00:42.104
Our brothers average 
more than 42,000 Bible studies each month,

00:42.104 --> 00:44.106
and Haiti enjoyed a Memorial attendance

00:44.106 --> 00:47.568
of more than 86,000 in 2016.

00:47.568 --> 00:52.531
This was four times more than the number 
of publishers in the branch territory.

00:52.531 --> 00:56.911
The brothers love to use 
the videos in the ministry.

00:56.911 --> 00:59.830
This is made possible 
by the Haiti audio/video team

00:59.830 --> 01:02.750
translating the videos 
into their native language.

01:02.750 --> 01:05.502
While many in Haiti speak French,

01:05.502 --> 01:09.131
the common language 
of the people in general is Haitian Creole.

01:09.757 --> 01:11.759
Creole is said to be

01:11.759 --> 01:14.470
an expressive language 
that combines French words

01:14.470 --> 01:17.431
with the grammar 
of West African languages.

01:17.431 --> 01:21.727
The number of publishers in Haiti 
has quadrupled since the start

01:21.727 --> 01:25.272
of Creole translation back in 1987.

01:25.272 --> 01:27.858
The complete New World Translation Bible

01:27.858 --> 01:31.111
was released in Creole in 2015.

01:31.111 --> 01:35.532
We met with the translation team 
to commend them for the good work they do.

01:35.532 --> 01:38.243
We reminded them of the many positive results

01:38.243 --> 01:40.371
in the field ministry that have taken place

01:40.371 --> 01:44.541
since translating the Bible 
and our literature into Creole.

01:44.541 --> 01:49.380
As an example, Mirlène is a vendor 
of fruits and vegetables who was asked

01:49.380 --> 01:52.007
if she would supply 
some of her produce to Bethel.

01:52.007 --> 01:54.009
Although she was very impressed

01:54.009 --> 01:56.887
the first time 
she arrived at the Bethel property,

01:56.887 --> 02:00.516
she said she found 
the large steel gate to be intimidating.

02:01.976 --> 02:03.978
So she prayed to God to protect her

02:03.978 --> 02:05.980
while in the yard at Bethel.

02:05.980 --> 02:08.107
The brothers dealt kindly 
with her when she made

02:08.107 --> 02:10.109
her deliveries on Monday each week.

02:10.109 --> 02:13.404
One of the brothers from the kitchen 
told her that maybe someday

02:13.404 --> 02:16.115
she too would become 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

02:16.115 --> 02:18.867
She accepted an invitation to the Memorial,

02:18.867 --> 02:22.663
and despite some personal challenges, 
such as not being able to read well,

02:22.663 --> 02:25.541
she began to attend 
some congregation meetings.

02:25.541 --> 02:28.043
Mirlène could see the difference

02:28.043 --> 02:30.921
between Jehovah’s loving people 
and those in her church.

02:30.921 --> 02:32.923
A study was started with her,

02:32.923 --> 02:36.176
and she progressed 
to the point of baptism in 2009.

02:36.176 --> 02:39.013
Since then, she has worked diligently

02:39.013 --> 02:42.099
to teach the truth 
to her children with good results.

02:42.099 --> 02:46.937
Her oldest son graduated 
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

02:46.937 --> 02:50.524
and serves as an elder 
and temporary special pioneer.

02:50.524 --> 02:55.446
Recently, another of her sons 
was appointed a ministerial servant,

02:55.446 --> 02:59.825
and the four other children 
are unbaptized publishers.

02:59.825 --> 03:01.910
Having our literature in Creole

03:01.910 --> 03:05.622
and with the help of her children, 
she has improved her reading.

03:05.622 --> 03:09.168
She now benefits 
from reading the Bible in Creole,

03:09.168 --> 03:11.712
the language of her heart.

03:12.796 --> 03:14.882
Good results are beginning to be seen

03:14.882 --> 03:18.552
in the field of American Sign Language, 
which is now used in Haiti.

03:18.552 --> 03:21.847
There are now 87 deaf publishers

03:21.847 --> 03:25.476
in 4 ASL congregations and 8 groups.

03:25.476 --> 03:30.439
The congregation here 
is singing praises to Jehovah.

03:30.439 --> 03:33.650
Even our little sister 
is learning to do this.

03:36.278 --> 03:39.114
This brother showed us 
the effort he puts forth

03:39.114 --> 03:42.242
to prepare for a Bible reading.

03:42.242 --> 03:44.953
A special program for Haiti was held

03:44.953 --> 03:47.122
on Saturday morning 
at the open-air Assembly Hall

03:47.122 --> 03:49.458
on the branch property.

03:49.458 --> 03:53.087
A total of 1,405 were in attendance.

03:53.087 --> 03:55.214
We were very encouraged to see

03:55.214 --> 03:57.674
the group of our brothers 
who benefited from the program

03:57.674 --> 04:00.302
in American Sign Language.

04:00.302 --> 04:04.515
The program was recorded and presented 
at Kingdom Halls throughout the country

04:04.515 --> 04:07.476
later that same day and also on Sunday

04:07.476 --> 04:11.438
to a combined audience of 34,812.

04:12.272 --> 04:15.192
We felt a little sad to leave 
the brothers on Sunday morning

04:15.192 --> 04:17.402
for a drive of about six hours or so

04:17.402 --> 04:19.488
to the Dominican Republic

04:19.488 --> 04:22.991
for the second branch visit.

04:22.991 --> 04:26.578
En route, we traveled 
through some semiarid areas

04:26.578 --> 04:29.123
to the border between the two countries.

04:29.123 --> 04:32.543
The terrain varied greatly 
as we drove through small mountains,

04:32.543 --> 04:37.339
rich agricultural regions, 
and along the Caribbean Sea.

04:37.339 --> 04:41.552
We took the opportunity 
to witness to some individuals at the border

04:41.552 --> 04:45.305
and at various checkpoints, 
leaving literature along the way.

04:47.474 --> 04:49.726
Upon entering the city of Santo Domingo,

04:49.726 --> 04:54.731
we quickly identified 
the large JW.ORG sign at the branch office.

04:54.731 --> 04:56.900
We were enthusiastically greeted

04:56.900 --> 05:00.946
by many of the 73 Bethel family members.

05:00.946 --> 05:04.241
Although the preaching work 
is done primarily in Spanish,

05:04.992 --> 05:07.202
our brothers are expanding their ministry

05:07.202 --> 05:10.914
to reach the language of the hearts 
of many peoples and cultures.

05:10.914 --> 05:14.585
There are now 5 Haitian Creole 
circuits in the branch territory,

05:14.585 --> 05:17.337
26 American Sign Language congregations,

05:17.337 --> 05:19.339
and other congregations or groups

05:19.339 --> 05:23.093
in Russian, Chinese, Italian and French.

05:23.093 --> 05:26.638
We joined a group of brothers 
and sisters in the field ministry

05:26.638 --> 05:28.974
in the Chinatown district of Santo Domingo.

05:30.058 --> 05:32.269
Our group gave a witness to both Spanish-

05:32.269 --> 05:34.730
and Chinese-speaking people on the streets

05:34.730 --> 05:38.734
—most of whom 
respectfully listened to our message.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.238
A Bethel brother, Evan, 
told us of the challenge

05:43.238 --> 05:45.741
he faced when learning the truth.

05:46.950 --> 05:48.952
I was finishing medical school

05:48.952 --> 05:51.205
while serving in the Dominican army.

05:51.205 --> 05:54.166
By then I had been serving for six years.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.961
At my aunt’s home, 
I found the Revelation book.

05:59.796 --> 06:02.132
It made such an impact on me,

06:02.132 --> 06:06.136
that I stole it and read it all on my own.

06:06.136 --> 06:09.681
There’s a vision in chapter 6 of Revelation,

06:09.681 --> 06:11.725
where the sixth seal is opened

06:11.725 --> 06:15.812
and the skies darken 
and the army commanders hide in caves.

06:15.812 --> 06:18.732
That vision impressed me so much

06:18.732 --> 06:21.568
that I decided to serve Jehovah.

06:21.568 --> 06:24.571
That meant that I 
would have to leave the army

06:24.571 --> 06:28.242
because Witnesses are neutral.

06:28.242 --> 06:30.786
I quickly decided to talk 
to my immediate commander

06:30.786 --> 06:34.206
to ask him 
to please discharge me from the army.

06:34.206 --> 06:37.501
However, he rejected my request and said:

06:37.501 --> 06:41.129
“No, you have served 
in the army for six years.

06:41.129 --> 06:43.548
You have to stay in the army.”

06:43.548 --> 06:46.301
I was not concerned 
because I could still appeal

06:46.301 --> 06:48.303
to the colonel in charge of personnel.

06:48.303 --> 06:51.723
However, my request 
for resignation was rejected again.

06:51.723 --> 06:53.558
I left and went into the hallway.

06:53.558 --> 06:55.018
I prayed to Jehovah:

06:55.018 --> 06:56.395
“I want to serve you.

06:56.395 --> 06:57.688
“What should I do?

06:57.688 --> 06:59.815
Help me find a way out of this!”

06:59.815 --> 07:03.068
When I opened my eyes, 
another army officer approached

07:03.068 --> 07:05.821
and greeted me using my name.

07:05.821 --> 07:07.322
I still don’t know who he was.

07:07.322 --> 07:09.825
He asked me, 
“What do you need?”

07:09.825 --> 07:14.204
I explained that I wanted to resign 
in order to become a Jehovah’s Witness.

07:14.204 --> 07:17.082
He said: “Don’t worry, 
give me your papers.

07:17.082 --> 07:19.376
I’m the colonel’s assistant.”

07:19.376 --> 07:23.005
Within 20 minutes, my discharge papers 
were ready and approved.

07:23.964 --> 07:25.966
In a short period of time, 
I became a publisher

07:25.966 --> 07:28.844
and I got baptized 
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

07:28.844 --> 07:31.263
At this time, 
I have been serving happily in Bethel

07:31.263 --> 07:34.266
for over 11 years with my wife, Jael.

07:37.769 --> 07:41.898
Without a doubt, Jehovah helps 
those who put their complete trust in him.

07:41.898 --> 07:45.193
The branch is blessed 
to have as part of their Bethel family

07:45.193 --> 07:48.196
some who had been longtime missionaries.

07:48.196 --> 07:50.407
I enjoyed a very pleasant visit

07:50.407 --> 07:53.535
with five of the senior members of this group

07:53.535 --> 07:56.788
—three of whom are 98 years of age.

07:56.788 --> 08:00.792
Brother William Dingman 
is of the first class of Gilead.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.253
His wife, Estelle, attended the 12th class.

08:03.253 --> 08:06.673
Thelma Critz is also of the 12th class.

08:06.673 --> 08:09.885
Barbara Parker is of the 42nd class,

08:09.885 --> 08:13.430
and Helen Ferrari 
attended the 2nd class of Gilead.

08:13.430 --> 08:15.849
To illustrate the length 
of their full-time service

08:15.849 --> 08:18.685
is the fact that Sister Ferrari

08:18.685 --> 08:21.563
is among those 
who stood up to identify themselves

08:21.563 --> 08:23.899
as part of the great multitude

08:23.899 --> 08:27.944
at the 1935 convention in Washington, D.C.

08:27.944 --> 08:31.948
The average age of this group is 94.

08:31.948 --> 08:33.867
Even more impressive

08:33.867 --> 08:36.620
is that their average years 
of full-time service is 73.

08:37.621 --> 08:40.123
These faithful ones set a fine example

08:40.123 --> 08:42.834
continuing to be active in the ministry

08:42.834 --> 08:46.088
—taking into account 
their ages and health limitations.

08:46.088 --> 08:48.673
Such loyal servants of Jehovah are considered

08:48.673 --> 08:51.468
spiritual treasures wherever they may serve.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.970
I still have one study so far,

08:53.970 --> 08:56.264
although my eyesight doesn’t allow

08:56.264 --> 08:57.599
me to do too much.

08:57.599 --> 08:59.726
But I try.

08:59.726 --> 09:02.521
My legs aren’t so good for walking,

09:02.521 --> 09:05.899
so they wheel me around.

09:06.358 --> 09:09.111
In all of my life, I would consider

09:09.111 --> 09:12.989
the life that I have spent as a missionary

09:12.989 --> 09:16.618
and in Dominican Republic as well

09:16.618 --> 09:20.539
—it’s a wonderful life.

09:20.539 --> 09:23.750
I couldn’t have chosen

09:23.750 --> 09:26.378
a better companion

09:26.378 --> 09:29.506
and also a better life

09:29.506 --> 09:31.675
than to be preaching

09:31.675 --> 09:34.136
the message of the good news of the Kingdom.

09:34.136 --> 09:36.388
The Dominican Republic Bethel family

09:36.388 --> 09:39.683
considers it a privilege 
to have a share in providing

09:39.683 --> 09:42.185
care for such faithful ones.

09:42.185 --> 09:46.148
On Sunday, March the 12th, 
a special program was held

09:46.148 --> 09:50.110
at the open-air Assembly Hall 
adjacent to the branch office.

09:50.110 --> 09:53.196
A total of 3,050 benefited

09:53.196 --> 09:56.450
from the spiritual program 
and Christian association.

09:56.450 --> 09:59.870
The visits to the Dominican Republic 
and Haiti branches

09:59.870 --> 10:02.664
proved to be 
an encouragement and a spiritual blessing

10:02.664 --> 10:12.655
to all who participated in them.

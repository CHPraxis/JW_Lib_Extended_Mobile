‎Many people live their entire lives

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎without ever being affected 
by a natural disaster. 

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It can be easy to forget

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that your life 
can literally change overnight.

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.024 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Recently, here in California, 
our brothers and sisters in numerous areas

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.985 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have had to flee for their lives

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:49.653 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because of firestorms

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:51.113 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎coming in right behind them.

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Literally, for some, it was within minutes

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—racing for their lives

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.995 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎either in their car, some on foot—

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.414 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with flames, towering flames

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and intense heat right behind them.

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’ve never seen anything like it. 

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.256 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I left the house,

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:14.470 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the roar of the fire coming over the hill

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was unbelievable.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.351 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of our close friends 
stepped out onto his balcony

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and noticed a glow on the hillside,

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:24.605 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he gave my wife a call and said,

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:25.898 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Did you know that there’s a fire?”

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After the fire, a dear friend said:

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:59.223 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Don’t worry about anything.

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’re going to give you all that you need.” 

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I broke down in tears,

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just knowing what was about to happen.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because we have Jehovah as our Shepherd,

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.403 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he will give us everything we need. 

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And we have seen that. 

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those words have come true
because our brothers and sisters

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have cared for us so beautifully,

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beyond anything we ever expected.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.163 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’m a builder myself,

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I feel like I just want to get 
in there and do something. 

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the friends need spirituality,

00:02:29.378 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and so if we help them with that,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.550 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they’ll get through the rest of it.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.593 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the United States branch office

00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:37.886 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is very concerned

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:40.514 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for our brothers and sisters spiritually

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:43.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and making sure that they can get back 
to their worship to Jehovah God. 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So today we’re here to encourage them,

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to really acknowledge 
what they’ve gone through,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.858 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to make sure that they’re getting 
the spiritual attention they need

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:52.901 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the encouragement that, really,

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the organization 
and their brothers want to give them.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:59.700 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just like a literal shepherd

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.703 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would want to care 
for the needs of their sheep

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:04.830 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—especially an injured one—

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.000 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we want to do the same thing 
for the members of our congregation,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but we take it a step further. 

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We want to care for them emotionally,

00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎spiritually, and physically.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:19.720 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah has made us a people

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who care for one another. 

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And generally speaking, 
the comfort he provides

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:29.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the things we need 
are almost always delivered by people. 

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:31.899 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s at the congregation that we can have

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.026 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that kind of comfort and support

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:36.528 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎given to us that’s going to help us recover.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Working in disaster relief efforts,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you really begin to see

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just how much Jehovah cares 
for the human race

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—how much he cares for people. 

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll see people who will drop anything

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:05.265 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to come and rally to the aid

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of brothers and sisters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But they’ll rally to the aid 
of someone next door too,

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that’s a manifestation

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the way Jehovah feels about people. 

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:22.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Being prepared for a natural disaster,

00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ourselves and our families,

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.996 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is not just a matter of personal safety. 

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:31.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This gets to the core of our spirituality. 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How much do we truly value life? 

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:38.757 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How much do we truly value 
what Jehovah has given us?

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:44.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In a disaster, you hear people say, 
“I’ve lost everything”

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—not among Jehovah’s people. 

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We never lose everything. 

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We may lose material possessions; 
we may even lose loved ones;

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:56.775 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but when we have Jehovah, 
we never lose everything.

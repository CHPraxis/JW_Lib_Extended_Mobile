00:00:01 Welcome to this special news update.
00:00:04 As reported
00:00:06 in the “Newsroom” section of jw.org,
00:00:09 on November 30, 2018,
00:00:12 the South Korean government released 57 of our brothers
00:00:16 who had been imprisoned for conscientious objection.
00:00:20 The Governing Body, together with our worldwide brotherhood,
00:00:24 rejoices with these brothers and their families.
00:00:28 The Ministry of Justice granted an early release for our brothers
00:00:32 who had already served at least 6 months
00:00:35 of their 18-month sentence.
00:00:37 We expect that the remaining eight brothers
00:00:40 will also be released sometime after they’ve served
00:00:43 six months of their sentence.
00:00:46 They will be the last
00:00:48 of the more than 19,000 Witnesses
00:00:51 who have been sent to prison in Korea since 1953.
00:00:56 But what led to this momentous event?
00:01:00 During 2018,
00:01:02 a series of historic court rulings in Korea
00:01:06 finally recognized conscientious objection
00:01:09 as a fundamental right.
00:01:11 This development now puts South Korea in line
00:01:16 with many other countries in the world
00:01:18 who say that refraining from military service
00:01:21 for religious reasons is not a crime.
00:01:24 As a result of these rulings,
00:01:27 the prison doors were opened for 57 brothers.
00:01:45 Recently, our branch received a report
00:01:48 from the elders appointed to assist
00:01:50 our imprisoned brothers.
00:01:52 They said that brothers who have served at least six months
00:01:54 of their sentence could be released early on parole.
00:01:59 It was such great news that I almost couldn’t believe it.
00:02:04 My son will be released two months earlier than expected.
00:02:08 I’ve heard that two months in prison feels very long.
00:02:11 Well, even a single day feels long.
00:02:14 Since our brothers in the past had been allowed parole
00:02:16 after serving at least 14 months,
00:02:19 this was a great surprise to our brothers,
00:02:21 and many were beside themselves with joy.
00:02:26 It’s been over a year since I’ve been able to hug my son.
00:02:30 When I meet him tomorrow, the first thing I want to do
00:02:34 is give him a warm hug
00:02:37 and tell him he did a good job staying strong in prison.
00:02:42 My son was a caregiver for ill inmates, which can be dangerous
00:02:46 because of bloodborne diseases.
00:02:48 So he’d always show me he had no open wounds
00:02:52 on his hands and feet.
00:02:54 Tomorrow, I’ll be able to hold those hands,
00:02:56 and I don’t plan on letting go.
00:03:16 Finally, 57 brothers
00:03:18 were released at the same time
00:03:21 from 16 different prisons throughout South Korea.
00:03:23 It’s an amazing development!
00:03:31 The Supreme Court’s not-guilty decision last month
00:03:35 was pivotal in our brothers’ early release.
00:03:39 It stated that those ‘who object to military service
00:03:41 ‘based on a conviction that is deep, firm,
00:03:44 and genuine should be protected.’
00:03:47 Many developments in the past few years led up to this wonderful outcome.
00:03:53 For example, since 2007, the Governing Body provided assistance
00:03:57 and encouragement to our brothers  to make a fine defense in court.
00:04:03 As a result, more than 120 not-guilty decisions
00:04:05 were rendered in the lower courts.
00:04:09 The Constitutional Court, which had deliberated
00:04:11 on this issue for many years, rendered a historic decision,
00:04:15 declaring that the absence of alternative service is unconstitutional.
00:04:22 Furthermore, international human rights organizations
00:04:25 recommended the releasing of conscientious objectors.
00:04:31 Also, our brothers worldwide
00:04:33 have prayed incessantly for our imprisoned brothers.
00:04:36 We believe these prayers
00:04:39 were an important factor that brought about this great change.
00:04:44 They also sent many letters of encouragement
00:04:46 for our brothers to the branch,
00:04:48 and every one of these were forwarded to them.
00:04:54 There is no doubt these letters helped our brothers to endure.
00:04:59 Now our brothers who were separated from their families
00:05:02 for many months have been reunited.
00:05:06 I’ve been looking forward to this day so much,
00:05:09 and I’m so happy to be with my family again.
00:05:13 Thanks to Jehovah’s protection,
00:05:15 we’re able to have our son back in our arms in good health.
00:05:20 We welcome this decision and are overjoyed
00:05:23 at the early release of our brothers.
00:05:26 We look forward to seeing our brothers using their freedom
00:05:29 to bring praise to Jehovah.
00:05:31 He has brought salvation and shown favor to our brothers
00:05:35 walking the path of integrity for the past 65 years.
00:05:39 We are grateful for Jehovah’s loving care.
00:05:43 First Peter 2:19 states:
00:05:47 “It is agreeable when someone endures hardship
00:05:51 and suffers unjustly because of conscience toward God.”
00:05:56 This strongly applies to you brothers in Korea.
00:05:59 Through your long legacy of faith and endurance,
00:06:03 you have set a sterling example of integrity
00:06:06 and given a powerful witness.
00:06:09 As a result, you have Jehovah’s smile of approval.
00:06:15 Our thanks go to your families and all those around the world
00:06:19 who have kept you in their prayers.
00:06:21 The words of Romans 10:11
00:06:23 echo a fundamental truth about Jehovah:
00:06:27 “No one who rests his faith on him will be disappointed.”
00:06:32 Yes, all praise and honor go to Jehovah!

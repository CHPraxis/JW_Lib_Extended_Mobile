00:02 Welcome to this special update.
00:04 Pure worship is under attack
00:08 in the country of Russia.
00:10 In this program, we will update you
00:12 on our efforts to defend  God’s precious Word, the Bible,
00:16 from those who  would seek to ban it in Russia.
00:19 We will interview a brother  who was present in the courtroom
00:23 for the recent appeal hearing
00:25 regarding the New World Translation  of the Holy Scriptures.
00:29 We will also update  you on the court case
00:32 to seize the property  of our branch office in Russia
00:36 and show you what has recently taken place
00:38 to seize the Assembly Hall complex  in St. Petersburg.
00:44 As you may be aware,  on December 20,
00:47 the Leningrad Regional Court  denied our appeal of a decision
00:52 to ban the Russian-language  New World Translation,
00:56 declaring it an “extremist” publication.
01:01 This is against Russian law.
01:04 Specifically,  according to an amendment to Article 3
01:08 of the Federal Law on Extremism,
01:11 signed by President Putin himself
01:14 in the fall of 2015:
01:16 “The Bible, the Koran,
01:19 “the Tanakh, and the Kangyur,
01:22 “their contents and quotations from them
01:26 cannot be recognized as extremist materials.”
01:32 With such a clear law like that in force,
01:35 any reasonable person would wonder,
01:38 ‘How could a Russian court ban a Bible?’
01:43 We are pleased to have  with us Brother Moses Ajiboye,
01:47 who was present in the courtroom  for the recent appeal hearing.
01:50 Moses, it’s good to see you.  Welcome.
01:54 Thank you, Mark.  It’s a privilege to be with you.
01:58 Now, Moses,  before we discuss the appeal hearing,
02:01 could you help us  understand how the proceedings
02:03 against the New World Translation  have unfolded up until now?
02:08 Yes, Mark.
02:10 This case began back on August 13, 2015,
02:15 after a prosecutor filed a claim
02:18 to declare the New World Translation  in Russian to be “extremist.”
02:22 At the beginning of the trial
02:24 back then in April 2016,
02:27 the prosecutor demanded
02:30 that the court request an “expert” study
02:33 from a panel of “experts”
02:37 who have consistently provided
02:41 biased reports  against Jehovah’s Witnesses in the past.
02:45 Their so-called studies have been refuted
02:49 by other unbiased scientific experts as well.
02:53 Well, the judge  then ruled to adjourn the case
02:57 and allow time  for this “expert” study of the Bible.
03:01 The study was completed  and submitted to the court
03:05 more than a year later  on May 22, 2017.
03:10 As expected,
03:12 the biased study  was full of outrageous statements
03:17 that were not based on the facts.
03:19 The study even concluded
03:21 that the New World Translation  was not a Bible,
03:24 since it did not say “Bible” on the cover.
03:28 So in late July 2017,
03:31 the court resumed its hearings of the case.
03:35 Well, Moses, can you tell us  what it was like in the courtroom
03:40 when the trial resumed in July?
03:44 Over a period of 4 days,  there were 30 hours of court hearings.
03:50 During that time,  our attorneys exposed
03:53 the so-called expert study
03:56 and its key claims as unfounded, biased,
04:01 absurd, inconsistent, and invalid.
04:04 Our attorneys proved  that the New World Translation is consistent
04:08 with other Russian Bible translations  by having many verses read
04:13 in two or more Bible translations  for comparison.
04:18 In fact, some 25 Bible passages
04:22 were read in the courtroom.
04:24 On one occasion, Mark,
04:26 the judge selected a verse  in the New World Translation
04:30 that may have appeared  to him as controversial
04:34 and asked our lawyer to explain it.
04:38 Of course, our lawyer simply asked  that the verse be read
04:42 in all three different translations.
04:46 And after that,  they all had the same idea
04:50 and no further explanation was needed.
04:54 One of our attorneys described the scene
04:57 in the courtroom this way,
04:59 and I will quote him, Mark, if I may.
05:02 He said: “Yesterday,  the judge read a great many scriptures
05:07 “from various translations of the Bible:
05:09 “the New World Translation,  the synodal translation,
05:13 “the modern translation, and others.
05:15 “Many scriptures were read about family life,
05:19 “raising children, and loving our neighbors.
05:22 “We read Psalm 23
05:24 “in three different translations  for comparison.
05:29 “The judge himself read all the scriptures.
05:32 “Just imagine the scene:
05:34 “the courtroom, two prosecutors,
05:38 “three attorneys, and the audience.
05:41 “In the center of the table sits the judge
05:44 “with five to seven  translations of the Bible.
05:48 “The judge opens  the various Bible translations,
05:51 “reads aloud, and asks questions.
05:54 “It was a stunning picture!
05:57 It reminded us  of a well-prepared Bible study.”
06:01 Well, that’s just incredible, Moses!
06:03 Well, what were some of the ways
06:06 that God’s Word  was attacked during this hearing,
06:09 and how did our brothers  put up a defense for the Bible?
06:14 Yes, the so-called experts attacked  the use of God’s holy name, Jehovah,
06:18 in the New World Translation.
06:21 The “expert” study states:
06:25 “In the New World Translation  of the Holy Scriptures,
06:28 “the dominant factor of the text  is the ‘Jehovah’ concept.
06:33 “The ‘Jehovah’ concept  expresses a personified god
06:37 “with such names as ‘Jehovah God,’
06:40 “‘Jehovah of armies,’  ‘the King, Jehovah of armies,’
06:43 “‘the Holy One of Israel,’ et cetera.
06:47 “Thus, in the opinion  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
06:51 “he has the personal name ‘Jehovah.’
06:54 “So the New World Translation  of the Holy Scriptures
06:57 “does not qualify as a Christian Bible
07:00 but is an independent text.”
07:05 So in order to expose this attack,
07:08 the lawyers introduced to the court
07:10 ten other Russian Bibles  that use the name Jehovah.
07:14 They allowed—
07:15 They also showed the court poetry
07:18 by renowned Russian poets
07:20 Tsvetaeva and Pushkin;
07:23 and books by Kuprin,  Goncharov, and Dostoyevsky;
07:28 and excerpts  from other classic Russian literature
07:31 where the name Jehovah is used.
07:34 They also pointed to the 19th-century  Russian-language Makarios Bible,
07:38 produced by Russian Orthodox  Church translators,
07:42 in which the name Jehovah occurs
07:44 more than 3,500 times.
07:49 Oh, Moses, it’s so good  to hear that the brothers
07:52 were able to defend  Jehovah’s holy name in the courtroom.
07:56 Well, were the brothers  able to interview any experts
08:00 who could also defend God’s name?  defend the Bible?
08:04 Yes, Mark,
08:06 the court allowed two experts  to present testimony.
08:10 Regarding the use of God’s name,
08:12 Professor Mikhail Odintsov,
08:15 a religious scholar well respected in Russia
08:18 who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
08:21 confirmed in front of the court  that the name Jehovah
08:24 has been used  by other Russian translations
08:27 and translators as well,
08:29 including the translators  of the official Bible translation
08:33 of the Russian Orthodox Church
08:35 where the divine name,  Jehovah, occurs some ten times.
08:39 Professor Odintsov read  two verses from the church Bible
08:43 that contains God’s personal name, Jehovah.
08:48 He also mentioned  two Orthodox Church translators,
08:52 namely, Pavsky and Makarii,
08:54 who both used God’s name, Jehovah,  extensively in their translations.
08:59 Professor Odintsov  gave a thorough explanation
09:02 regarding the history  and meaning of the name Jehovah
09:06 as well as the long history  of its use in Bible translation
09:11 and in the literature of Christendom.
09:14 Thus, he completely refuted their attack
09:19 on Jehovah’s name  in the New World Translation.
09:22 Excellent!
09:24 Well, what a powerful defense  for God’s name, Jehovah!
09:28 Well, now, didn’t you also say, Moses,
09:30 that these so-called experts  had said that the New World Translation
09:35 was not a Bible because the word  “Bible” did not appear on the cover?
09:39 Yes, Mark, that’s right.
09:42 The study also claimed  that the New World Translation is not a Bible
09:46 because it does not expressly say  that it is a Bible.
09:51 However, Professor Odintsov  explained to the court
09:56 that in line with scientific criteria,
09:59 the words “Scriptures” and “Holy Scriptures”
10:04 are quite appropriate to describe the Bible.
10:07 In addition,  our lawyers explained to the court
10:10 that they were amazed  that the court-appointed so-called experts
10:15 claimed to have worked for 287 days
10:19 on their research
10:21 and yet missed the simple fact
10:23 that in the third paragraph  of the Bible’s Foreword,
10:28 on page 5, it clearly states:
10:31 “This new translation of the Bible.”
10:35 Well, that’s just unbelievable, Moses.
10:38 What other arguments  did these so-called experts
10:42 try to use against God’s Word, the Bible?
10:46 Well, the “expert” study also claimed
10:49 that Jehovah’s Witnesses  do not recognize Jesus Christ
10:53 as the savior of mankind.
10:55 But the first paragraph of the Foreword
10:58 to the New World Translation Russian edition
11:01 says exactly the opposite
11:03 and quotes John 3:16.
11:06 The “experts” also claimed
11:09 that the New World Translation is not a Bible
11:11 because it allegedly has been modified
11:16 to refute the doctrine of the Trinity.
11:20 Yet, our lawyers read
11:22 from the Russian Orthodox  Church Synodal version,
11:25 two verses from that translation,
11:28 1 Corinthians 11:3, where it says:
11:31 “The head of the Christ is God”
11:33 and John 14:28, where Jesus said:
11:37 “For the Father is greater than I am.”
11:41 So these two verses show
11:43 that the official  Russian Orthodox Church Bible
11:45 also refutes the Trinity doctrine.
11:50 We could go on and on, Mark.
11:53 But the fact is that the lower court ruled
11:56 to ban the New World Translation,
11:58 and so we appealed to a higher court.
12:01 And the appeal hearing  was held on December 20, 2017,
12:06 as you rightly said in the beginning.
12:08 Well, Moses,  could you tell us a little bit
12:11 about the appeal hearing  that took place in December?
12:14 I know you were in the courtroom.
12:16 What was it like?
12:18 As during the first trials,
12:20 foreign diplomats from at least four nations
12:23 (Britain, Netherlands,  Switzerland, and the United States)
12:28 attended the December 20, 2017,  appeal hearing.
12:32 Again, there were many brothers  and sisters present in the courtroom
12:36 because they cared so much  about the New World Translation.
12:39 At the appeal hearing,
12:41 when none of the three so-called experts
12:45 could explain the methods  they used to carry out their study,
12:50 the court itself intervened  and ended the questioning of the “experts.”
12:56 In fact, Ms. Kryukova,  one of the three “experts,”
13:03 made a very revealing statement
13:06 when she said that the only book
13:09 that can be called a Bible
13:12 is one approved  by the Russian Orthodox Church
13:16 and that “is marked  ‘by the blessing of the patriarch’
13:20 or that matches word for word  with such a translation.”
13:26 When asked, Ms. Kryukova  refused to state why she believed
13:31 that the New World Translation  is “extremist,”
13:34 calling this a legal question.
13:38 So you see, Mark,  neither the prosecutors
13:41 nor the so-called experts
13:43 who were questioned  could cite even one verse
13:47 as an example of “extremism”  in the New World Translation Bible.
13:52 Thus, again and again  our attorneys exposed
13:56 the outrageous and false claims  of these so-called experts.
14:01 Our attorneys presented a total
14:03 of 35 scholarly documents
14:06 containing overwhelming evidence
14:09 to prove that the New World Translation Bible
14:12 is truly the Word of God.
14:16 But these were all ignored by the court.
14:21 So again and again we had the impression,  sitting there in the courtroom, Mark,
14:25 that the purpose  of the hearing was not to find out
14:29 the facts, evidence, et cetera,
14:31 but, rather,  to go through the legal formalities quickly,
14:35 since the decision had already been made
14:37 and must be announced today.
14:40 In fact,  the judges deliberated
14:45 on the seven hours of testimony
14:48 for only four minutes
14:51 before announcing their decision  to ban the New World Translation.
14:55 Well, Moses, thank you so much  for sharing this powerful defense
15:00 that our brothers made  in behalf of Jehovah’s holy name
15:04 and his precious Word, the Bible.
15:06 We appreciate this report so much.
15:08 Thank you, Mark.
15:10 It was a privilege  to be there with the brothers
15:12 in the courtroom in St. Petersburg.
15:15 The attack on pure worship in Russia
15:18 includes an outright ban  on our activities in that land.
15:22 Now the authorities are moving forward
15:25 in seizing properties  owned by Jehovah’s people.
15:28 For example,
15:29 on December 7, 2017,  a hearing was held
15:34 in the Sestroretsk District Court
15:37 regarding the seizing  of the Russia branch property
15:40 at Solnechnoye.
15:42 Brother Richard Devine,  a member of the board of directors
15:46 of the Watch Tower Bible  and Tract Society of Pennsylvania,
15:49 had the privilege of being  in attendance at the hearing.
15:53 Richard, it’s good to see you.  Welcome.
15:56 Thank you, Mark.  It’s a pleasure to be here.
15:58 Could you tell us a little bit  about the nature of this hearing
16:02 that you went to Russia to attend?
16:04 Sure.
16:06 When the Administrative Center  of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia
16:09 was declared “extremist”  late last year by the courts,
16:12 it gave the government the ability
16:14 to seize  the Administrative Center’s property.
16:17 However, when they tried  to seize the Bethel complex,
16:20 they found out that it legally belonged,  not to the Administrative Center,
16:24 but actually to the Watch Tower Bible  and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
16:28 and that for 17 years,
16:30 the Administrative Center  had been merely a tenant.
16:33 Since the Pennsylvania Corporation  hadn’t been banned,
16:37 this created a legal obstacle  for the government in seizing our property.
16:41 So, what argument  did the government use
16:44 to try to justify the seizure  of the branch property?
16:49 Well, the government was trying to prove  that the transfer of title of the property
16:53 to the Pennsylvania Corporation
17 years ago wasn’t valid
16:57 and that the Bethel property
16:59 still really belonged  to the Administrative Center,
17:02 and therefore it was  fair game for them to seize it.
17:05 Richard,  can you tell us what it was like
17:08 to be there in the courtroom  for this very historic hearing?
17:13 Well, a couple of things  really impressed me very much.
17:16 One was the courage of the local brothers  and sisters who came to the hearing
17:20 despite the ban just to support  the brothers presenting our case.
17:25 It was truly a remarkable demonstration  of strong faith and determination.
17:30 The hearing was held  in a small, drab room
17:33 in Sestroretsk, a town not far  from the former Bethel facility.
17:37 There was barely room  for everyone to fit inside.
17:41 Our attorneys and the prosecutors  were literally two feet apart,
17:44 facing each other over a small table.
17:47 The brothers and sisters  crammed into any space they could find,
17:50 some even sitting inside the barred cell
17:54 reserved for criminal defendants.
17:56 Well now, Richard, what can you  tell us about the hearing itself?
18:00 What actually took place in the courtroom?
18:02 Well, I knew from meeting  with them the night before
18:05 how well our attorneys  prepared for this case
18:08 and how hard they worked on it.
18:10 And to see them both
18:12 —one a relatively young brother— courageously stand up
18:15 and defend the interests of Jehovah’s people,
18:17 it was really an amazing sight.
18:20 They had real conviction and passion.
18:23 They demonstrated unequivocally  that according to Russian law,
18:27 the international business law,
18:30 and the provisions  of the European Convention on Human Rights
18:34 that they were squarely  in our favor
18:36 and that to seize our property  was not only legally wrong
18:40 but it was really morally wrong.
18:43 The prosecutors, on the other hand,  appeared to be not long out of high school
18:48 and limited themselves to reading  a few short prewritten statements
18:52 and asked no questions during the hearing.
18:55 Well now, Richard, what was it like
18:58 when the decision  was finally read in the courtroom?
19:02 Well, I don’t think the decision  was really a surprise to anyone.
19:05 However, it seemed to me that the judge
19:08 was very uncomfortable reading that verdict.
19:11 At the end,  she announced that there would be
19:13 30 days to file an appeal.
19:15 Now, the spirit of the brothers  and sisters leaving the courtroom
19:18 was somber at first.
19:20 But once we were out in the hallway,  the conversations got going;
19:23 the brothers and sisters  began congratulating the attorneys
19:26 for the fine witness they had given.
19:28 Once again, they were all smiling,  laughing, hugging,
19:31 and even giving little gifts to one another.
19:33 They were once again just happy  to be together serving Jehovah.
19:38 Well, then, what happens now?
19:40 Where do we go from here, Richard?
19:42 Well, the brothers are planning  to file an appeal within the given time.
19:47 And if this first appeal goes against us,
19:49 then the property  will be seized by the government
19:52 and used for other purposes.
19:54 However, further appeals, possibly even  to the European Court of Human Rights,
19:59 will be pursued.
20:02 Richard, thank you very, very much  for giving us that report.
20:05 And even more,  we want to thank you
20:07 for the courage that you  demonstrated in going to Russia
20:11 to stand with our brothers  during that hearing.
20:13 It really was my privilege.  Thank you.
20:16 However,  the seizure of our other properties
20:19 has already begun in Russia.
20:22 For example,  on December 14, 2017,
20:26 just after 9:00 a.m.,
20:28 about 40 people,  including police and others,
20:32 appeared outside the Assembly Hall  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
20:35 in St. Petersburg.
20:37 Some of the men were armed  with automatic weapons,
20:40 and others had the tools  needed to forcibly enter
20:43 the locked Assembly Hall compound.
20:46 Thankfully, none of our brothers
20:48 were inside the Assembly Hall  during this raid.
20:52 Russian news agencies have reported
20:54 that based on the Russian Supreme  Court ruling earlier this year,
20:59 the government has seized the property
21:01 and has transferred it  to the neighboring medical center
21:04 for use as a lecture hall.
21:06 They have already posted  a new sign on the gate.
21:11 In addition to these actions,
21:13 you may be wondering  about our Brother Dennis Christensen
21:17 who has been in pretrial detention
21:19 since May 25, 2017.
21:23 The court has extended  his pretrial detention several times.
21:28 Most recently, on December 22, 2017,
21:32 the court extended his detention
21:35 until February 23, 2018.
21:39 The authorities are allowing  Brother Christensen’s wife
21:43 to visit him now twice a month.
21:45 We expect that his trial  will begin sometime
21:49 in the coming weeks.
21:52 What can we say, brothers,
21:54 about this attack on pure worship in Russia?
21:58 Jehovah foretold  that during Christ’s presence,
22:03 ‘the kings of the earth and high officials
22:07 would take their stand  against Jehovah and his anointed one.’
22:12 We find that in Psalm 2:1-3.
22:17 Thus, we are not surprised  to see this direct attack
22:21 on Jehovah’s name;
22:23 his precious Word, the Bible;
22:26 and his faithful worshippers on this earth.
22:30 We must keep in our minds  the warning from our Lord Jesus
22:35 when he said at Matthew 10:17-22:
22:40 “Be on your guard against men,
22:44 “for they will hand you over to local courts
22:47 “and they will scourge  you in their synagogues.
22:50 “And you will be brought  before governors and kings for my sake,
22:55 “for a witness to them and the nations.
22:59 “However, when they hand you over,
23:03 “do not become anxious  about how or what you are to speak,
23:08 “for what you are to speak  will be given you in that hour;
23:12 “for the ones speaking are not just you,
23:17 “but it is the spirit of your Father  that speaks by you.
23:22 “Further, brother will hand  brother over to death,
23:26 “and a father his child,
23:28 “and children will rise up against parents
23:31 “and will have them put to death.
23:34 “And you will be hated by all people
23:37 “on account of my name,
23:40 “but the one who has endured to the end
23:44 will be saved.”
23:47 Yes, as Jesus said,
23:50 all who endure faithfully  will ultimately be saved.
23:55 Jehovah stated through his prophet
23:57 at Ezekiel 39:7:
24:01 “The nations will have to know
24:04 that I am Jehovah.”
24:07 Soon, Jehovah will act  in behalf of all his servants who,
24:12 despite opposition  and adverse circumstances,
24:16 prove that they are truly  “a people for his name.”

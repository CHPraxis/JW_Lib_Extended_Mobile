00:05.860 --> 00:07.277
My name is Laura. 


00:07.277 --> 00:09.822
I’ve served at Bethel for eight years. 


00:09.822 --> 00:11.845
I’m from a village called Dinnington, 


00:11.845 --> 00:14.202
and I have a twin sister. 


00:14.202 --> 00:15.954
And we were very shy. 


00:15.953 --> 00:19.476
I mean, really; 
I can’t stress how shy we were. 


00:19.477 --> 00:21.814
Neither of us dared speak to anyone. 


00:21.813 --> 00:25.983
My nana was 
a really big spiritual influence in my life. 


00:25.983 --> 00:28.945
She got really ill, 
and she knew she was going to die, 


00:28.945 --> 00:32.553
and she said: 
“‘Taste and see that Jehovah is good.’ 


00:32.553 --> 00:35.138
“Please promise me you will try 


00:35.138 --> 00:38.538
to put everything into serving Jehovah.”


00:38.538 --> 00:40.540
That affected me a lot. 


00:40.540 --> 00:42.062
I thought: 
‘This is it. This is my chance.’ 


00:42.062 --> 00:44.515
So I went out every Saturday 
from that moment on, 


00:44.515 --> 00:47.233
and I got baptized as soon as I could. 


00:47.233 --> 00:49.653
I still couldn’t answer at the meetings 
because I was too shy. 


00:49.653 --> 00:52.885
I still struggled to speak 
to people in the congregation. 


00:52.885 --> 00:56.013
But in the ministry, I was fine.


00:56.013 --> 00:58.120
After pioneering five years, I got married. 


00:58.120 --> 01:00.102
We were going to try our best 


01:00.102 --> 01:03.772
to do full-time ministry 
for the rest of our lives. 


01:03.772 --> 01:06.274
I really do love Bethel. 


01:06.273 --> 01:08.901
I think there’s a real link 
between a good ministry 


01:08.902 --> 01:10.632
and happiness at Bethel. 


01:10.632 --> 01:15.659
So if you love the ministry, 
then Bethel is an excellent place. 


01:15.658 --> 01:18.661
For the full eight years, 
I’ve been in the laundry. 


01:18.662 --> 01:20.392
It’s a small team 
—there are only 40. 


01:20.392 --> 01:22.477
I got to know everyone so well. 


01:22.477 --> 01:24.939
I felt so integrated very quickly. 


01:24.938 --> 01:28.000
They helped me to feel 
like I was part of a family. 


01:29.088 --> 01:30.715
Knowing every day 


01:30.715 --> 01:34.298
that here at Bethel 
all our time and energy 


01:34.298 --> 01:37.221
goes to serving Jehovah is so satisfying.


01:37.222 --> 01:39.515
You feel happy at the end of every day, 


01:39.515 --> 01:41.600
even if you’re tired mentally or physically. 


01:41.600 --> 01:43.857
You’ve done everything you can for Jehovah, 


01:43.857 --> 01:54.782
and you can’t beat it, really.

00:04.233 --> 00:07.361
I was born in a little town

00:07.361 --> 00:09.363
called Adair, Iowa

00:09.363 --> 00:11.448
—actually out on the farm​—

00:11.448 --> 00:15.327
and that was in 1930.

00:15.327 --> 00:17.705
I was born in 1931,

00:17.705 --> 00:20.833
also in a small town in Iowa.

00:20.833 --> 00:23.335
My father wanted to be a farmer.

00:23.335 --> 00:26.547
So we moved to a farm,
and I grew up on a farm.

00:26.547 --> 00:29.300
And then the Watchtower Study
of a little group,

00:29.300 --> 00:32.428
and then a little congregation
was in our home.

00:32.428 --> 00:37.391
And happily, when Peggy’s father
came into the truth,

00:37.391 --> 00:42.146
the family came to our place
to the Watchtower Study.

00:42.146 --> 00:46.275
I was—I guess at that time—
eight or nine,

00:46.275 --> 00:49.570
and Peggy was one year younger.

00:49.570 --> 00:53.407
But the thing was,
they moved away just after about one year.

00:55.951 --> 01:00.664
Well, I started pioneering
in September 1948.

01:00.664 --> 01:03.042
Gilead was what I wanted.

01:03.042 --> 01:05.210
I didn’t apply for Bethel

01:05.210 --> 01:07.296
because I liked the field service,

01:07.296 --> 01:09.965
and I thought South America, Africa,

01:09.965 --> 01:12.676
countries where there is still so much to do

01:12.676 --> 01:14.678
—that’s what I wanted.

01:15.763 --> 01:18.557
I was called to Gilead

01:18.557 --> 01:23.354
in 1951, in February.

01:23.354 --> 01:28.025
The assignment after attending Gilead

01:28.025 --> 01:30.027
was a great surprise.

01:30.027 --> 01:33.197
Brother Schroeder, one of the instructors,

01:33.197 --> 01:35.616
he said: “You will have

01:35.616 --> 01:38.869
“a very wonderful opportunity,

01:38.869 --> 01:41.288
“being assigned to the German Bethel.

01:41.288 --> 01:43.082
“There are brothers there

01:43.082 --> 01:47.419
“who have been in concentration camps
for up to nine years,

01:47.419 --> 01:51.340
and you can learn very much
from these brothers.”

01:51.340 --> 01:54.969
And that was very true.

01:56.178 --> 02:00.015
In 1953,
at the convention in New York,

02:00.015 --> 02:03.227
I saw a beautiful young sister

02:03.227 --> 02:07.856
standing in the cafeteria line
next to my cafeteria line.

02:07.856 --> 02:09.233
And I looked twice,

02:09.233 --> 02:11.193
and it was Peggy.

02:11.193 --> 02:14.947
So we were together
for the rest of the convention

02:14.947 --> 02:19.118
and decided that we would correspond
and think about serving together.

02:19.118 --> 02:23.205
In 1955 we married.

02:24.957 --> 02:28.335
I had received 
the assignment to circuit work.

02:28.335 --> 02:31.338
We were assigned to northern Germany.

02:31.338 --> 02:35.050
When we began circuit work, I was 24.

02:35.050 --> 02:37.720
I felt completely inadequate

02:37.720 --> 02:40.556
because I’d been serving in Bethel

02:40.556 --> 02:43.809
and had no training

02:43.809 --> 02:48.731
that would qualify me
to serve as a circuit overseer

02:48.731 --> 02:51.108
—that was my feeling.

02:51.108 --> 02:54.903
In the first place,
the sisters with me always got nervous

02:54.903 --> 02:57.865
with me not being able to speak correctly.

02:57.865 --> 03:00.659
So they would take over the conversation,

03:00.659 --> 03:03.662
and I stood there
and didn’t understand anything.

03:03.662 --> 03:06.331
But with time, you pick it up.

03:06.331 --> 03:09.334
After two years,
I could understand everything

03:09.334 --> 03:11.253
in the theocratic language,

03:11.253 --> 03:15.049
but in the kitchen I was still lost.

03:15.049 --> 03:20.054
It was nine years for circuit work
and, at the conclusion, district work.

03:20.054 --> 03:25.059
And then we were called back into Bethel.

03:25.768 --> 03:28.479
The biggest shock for me

03:28.479 --> 03:31.023
was when Brother Knorr asked me

03:31.023 --> 03:35.986
if I would be branch overseer.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.697
And that was at the convention

03:38.697 --> 03:41.450
of 1969 in Nuremberg.

03:41.450 --> 03:45.621
And despite different arguments 
that I presented,

03:45.621 --> 03:49.833
I got a letter later saying
that I’d have that assignment.

03:50.751 --> 03:52.836
For about 40 years,

03:52.836 --> 03:56.590
we had the wonderful privilege
of doing zone work or,

03:56.590 --> 04:01.386
as it’s now stated,
being representative of headquarters.

04:01.386 --> 04:04.306
So it was wonderful to visit

04:04.306 --> 04:07.643
somewhat over 90 different countries.

04:07.643 --> 04:12.272
We became acquainted
with Jehovah’s lovely family

04:12.272 --> 04:14.650
—the worldwide brotherhood, the unity,

04:14.650 --> 04:17.736
and seeing how the brothers everywhere

04:17.736 --> 04:20.114
are devoted to Jehovah

04:20.114 --> 04:22.199
and want to serve him faithfully

04:22.199 --> 04:25.911
under sometimes very difficult conditions.

04:25.911 --> 04:29.957
I would say,
sometimes we benefited more

04:29.957 --> 04:34.002
from the visit 
than the brothers we were visiting

04:34.002 --> 04:37.840
because it was so faith-strengthening.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.509
When we got this privilege

04:40.509 --> 04:44.680
of traveling 
to many branches in the zone work,

04:44.680 --> 04:48.684
we were able to engage in the field ministry

04:48.684 --> 04:51.979
in numerous countries,

04:51.979 --> 04:54.481
which I never would have had, of course,

04:54.481 --> 04:57.151
if I would have just gone 
into missionary service.

04:57.151 --> 04:59.570
So I said to myself,

04:59.570 --> 05:03.282
‘Accept every assignment 
Jehovah gives you

05:03.282 --> 05:07.870
and you’ll find that you have
the greatest blessings possible.’

05:07.870 --> 05:11.331
Since the 1st of January 1952,

05:11.331 --> 05:15.711
I’ve been able to keep
full-time service as my career.

05:15.711 --> 05:18.005
And it’s something 
I certainly wouldn’t have changed

05:18.005 --> 05:20.007
for anything else.

05:20.007 --> 05:22.009
We have often said,

05:22.009 --> 05:26.638
“Where would we be today
if we hadn’t taken up full-time service?”

05:26.638 --> 05:29.099
Certainly, we would not have enjoyed

05:29.099 --> 05:32.019
so many things as we have in our lifetime.

05:33.604 --> 05:38.609
There are so many young, 
talented brothers and sisters

05:38.609 --> 05:40.819
who are working and helping.

05:40.819 --> 05:44.615
We encourage them to make full-time service

05:44.615 --> 06:06.201
in Jehovah’s organization their goal in life.

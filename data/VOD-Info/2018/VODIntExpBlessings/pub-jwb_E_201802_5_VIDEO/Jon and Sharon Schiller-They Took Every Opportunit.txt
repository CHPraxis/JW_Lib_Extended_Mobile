00:00 Let’s turn our attention  to the Schiller family.
00:03 Is it possible to balance raising a family  with a busy spiritual routine?
00:08 And if circumstances allow,  can parents reach out for spiritual goals
00:12 —even full-time service?
00:14 Let’s listen to their answers  to those questions.
00:19 Sometimes people say:  “Well, you know, what was your secret?
00:23 How did you raise six kids?”
00:26 We got married September 16, 1972.
00:30 Two things started coming quickly
00:32 —spiritual privileges came along  and the children came along—
00:35 together.
00:36 I was made an elder
00:39 shortly after the elder arrangement  came into effect.
00:44 The kids were just part of all that,
00:47 and you might think  that sometimes they didn’t know it.
00:50 We were doing  substitute work with five children,
00:54 and I don’t think they  even knew what we were doing.
00:58 In 1989, we were pioneering,
01:01 and then we had the opportunity  to help out at Bethel,
01:05 maybe a week or two at a time.
01:08 About that time,  Patterson was starting up.
01:12 And we kind of recognized
01:16 that maybe we were getting too comfortable.
01:20 We went one time to Bethel and said:
01:23 “Hey, if you need a doctor out at Patterson,  why, we’d be available.
01:27 Or we could make ourselves available,  maybe.”
01:30 And wouldn’t you know it,  shortly after, we got a call,
01:34 “How quickly could you  sell your place and be up here?”
01:37 So we went to Bethel with six kids,
01:41 sold our house at a loss so we could do that,
01:44 and started a new life there.
01:50 So we learned pretty quickly:  Don’t turn down any privileges
01:53 —and especially not because we had kids.
01:58 When we went to Bethel,  the oldest one was 17.
02:03 Having children
02:05 kept my husband and me very humble
02:09 because as soon as you thought  you had something figured out,
02:12 each child needed  to be disciplined in a different way.
02:15 And as soon as you thought,  ‘Boy, you know, I’ve got this figured out,’
02:17 you’re thrown a curve.
02:20 A challenge was  to keep doing the basic things.
02:25 You’d come home tired.
02:28 It would be so easy  not to have the family study
02:32 maybe one Monday.
02:34 It’s those basic, simple things
02:37 that I think kept us on an even keel.
02:42 I often think  of the illustration that Jesus gave
02:46 at the end of the Sermon on the Mount,
02:48 what he said about this foundation  that was washed away.
02:52 And Jesus never blamed the storm;  he blamed the foundation.
02:57 And so we recognize that any child anywhere
03:01 —in fact, even adults—  can get their faith tested.
03:04 So we tried to really make sure
03:06 they had a good foundation  that didn’t get washed away.
03:09 Prepare them,  let them learn how to deal with people
03:13 while they’re under your care,
03:16 and get them ready for life.
03:19 We got to thinking, ‘Other parents  require their kids to go to college,’
03:23 so we just required them
03:25 to pioneer for a year.
03:28 Any kind of education—
03:29 Any kind of secular education can teach you
03:33 how to have a skill so that you have a job.
03:37 But the Bible teaches you how to live,
03:40 and it teaches you principles  that you can live your life by.
03:45 And all of them kept pioneering.
03:48 You know, they did various jobs  to support themselves.
03:51 They cleaned; they worked at lumberyards;  they worked on roofing.
03:54 And none of them have
03:57 a complicated life that holds them down.
04:00 I wanted everlasting life  for my children,
04:03 and I knew I would have to give  them back to Jehovah.
04:06 We have to realize we don’t own our children —Jehovah does.
04:09 And we have to respect that.
04:11 We’re not telling them what to do anymore.
04:16 We appreciate  and we’re very, very thankful
04:18 when our children,  as far away as they are
04:21 and as busy as they are,
04:23 take the time to communicate with us.
04:27 And I know you won’t remember this,
04:31 but I remember one time,  before you fell asleep at night,
04:35 I said,  “With all that you have done for Jehovah,
04:40 what would you like in return?”
04:44 Do you remember what you said?
04:47 You said three words, “All my children.”
04:53 In Deuteronomy it says:  “I have put life and death before you,
04:56 . . . and you must choose.”
04:58 So we can do what we can as parents
05:01 —some things good,  some things not so good.
05:03 In the end, each one had to make
05:07 his or her own decision.
05:10 And that’s why, again,  it was not any secret we had.
05:14 We’re so proud of what the kids decided
05:17 and how they turned out  because it was their decision.
05:20 I think that’s the thing that we’ve learned:
05:24 Don’t turn down opportunities.
05:32 Isn’t it wonderful to hear of ones  like Brother and Sister Schiller
05:36 who have offered their gifts to Jehovah?
05:38 Brother Schiller said  that it was doing the basic things
05:41 that kept his family focused spiritually.
05:44 So when opportunities came along,  he was able to do more,
05:48 which included pioneering,  substitute circuit work,
05:52 and using the medical training  he had already acquired
05:55 to volunteer  at the Patterson Educational Center.
05:59 Proverbs 10:22 says:
06:02 “It is the blessing of Jehovah  that makes one rich,
06:06 and He adds no hardship with it.”(Ftn.)
06:08 That certainly has proved true  for Brother Schiller and his family.

00:00.717 --> 00:03.387
Let’s turn our attention 
to the Schiller family. 


00:03.387 --> 00:08.324
Is it possible to balance raising a family 
with a busy spiritual routine? 


00:08.323 --> 00:12.795
And if circumstances allow, 
can parents reach out for spiritual goals 


00:12.795 --> 00:14.930
—even full-time service? 


00:14.930 --> 00:18.000
Let’s listen to their answers 
to those questions.


00:19.235 --> 00:23.940
Sometimes people say: 
“Well, you know, what was your secret? 


00:23.940 --> 00:26.175
How did you raise six kids?”


00:26.175 --> 00:30.080
We got married September 16, 1972. 


00:30.080 --> 00:32.315
Two things started coming quickly 


00:32.315 --> 00:35.485
—spiritual privileges came along 
and the children came along— 


00:35.485 --> 00:36.920
together. 


00:36.920 --> 00:39.488
I was made an elder 


00:39.488 --> 00:44.193
shortly after the elder arrangement 
came into effect.


00:44.193 --> 00:47.363
The kids were just part of all that, 


00:47.363 --> 00:50.966
and you might think 
that sometimes they didn’t know it. 


00:50.967 --> 00:54.137
We were doing 
substitute work with five children, 


00:54.137 --> 00:57.000
and I don’t think they 
even knew what we were doing. 


00:58.408 --> 01:01.276
In 1989, we were pioneering, 


01:01.277 --> 01:05.115
and then we had the opportunity 
to help out at Bethel, 


01:05.115 --> 01:08.718
maybe a week or two at a time. 


01:08.718 --> 01:12.921
About that time, 
Patterson was starting up. 


01:12.922 --> 01:16.292
And we kind of recognized 


01:16.292 --> 01:19.000
that maybe we were getting too comfortable.


01:20.797 --> 01:23.399
We went one time to Bethel and said: 


01:23.398 --> 01:27.436
“Hey, if you need a doctor out at Patterson, 
why, we’d be available. 


01:27.437 --> 01:30.874
Or we could make ourselves available, 
maybe.” 


01:30.873 --> 01:34.443
And wouldn’t you know it, 
shortly after, we got a call, 


01:34.443 --> 01:37.946
“How quickly could you 
sell your place and be up here?” 


01:37.947 --> 01:41.517
So we went to Bethel with six kids, 


01:41.517 --> 01:44.954
sold our house at a loss so we could do that, 


01:44.953 --> 01:49.000
and started a new life there.


01:50.493 --> 01:53.730
So we learned pretty quickly: 
Don’t turn down any privileges 


01:53.730 --> 01:58.635
—and especially not because we had kids. 


01:58.635 --> 02:01.000
When we went to Bethel, 
the oldest one was 17. 


02:03.105 --> 02:05.107
Having children 


02:05.107 --> 02:09.779
kept my husband and me very humble 


02:09.778 --> 02:12.081
because as soon as you thought 
you had something figured out, 


02:12.082 --> 02:15.385
each child needed 
to be disciplined in a different way. 


02:15.385 --> 02:17.887
And as soon as you thought, 
‘Boy, you know, I’ve got this figured out,’ 


02:17.887 --> 02:20.157
you’re thrown a curve. 


02:20.157 --> 02:24.000
A challenge was 
to keep doing the basic things. 


02:25.295 --> 02:28.230
You’d come home tired. 


02:28.230 --> 02:32.368
It would be so easy 
not to have the family study 


02:32.368 --> 02:34.570
maybe one Monday. 


02:34.570 --> 02:37.207
It’s those basic, simple things 


02:37.207 --> 02:41.000
that I think kept us on an even keel.


02:42.512 --> 02:46.315
I often think 
of the illustration that Jesus gave 


02:46.315 --> 02:48.317
at the end of the Sermon on the Mount, 


02:48.317 --> 02:52.955
what he said about this foundation 
that was washed away. 


02:52.955 --> 02:57.293
And Jesus never blamed the storm; 
he blamed the foundation. 


02:57.293 --> 03:01.998
And so we recognize that any child anywhere 


03:01.998 --> 03:04.700
—in fact, even adults— 
can get their faith tested. 


03:04.700 --> 03:06.702
So we tried to really make sure 


03:06.702 --> 03:09.739
they had a good foundation 
that didn’t get washed away.


03:09.738 --> 03:13.441
Prepare them, 
let them learn how to deal with people 


03:13.442 --> 03:16.712
while they’re under your care, 


03:16.712 --> 03:19.615
and get them ready for life. 


03:19.615 --> 03:23.085
We got to thinking, ‘Other parents 
require their kids to go to college,’ 


03:23.085 --> 03:25.988
so we just required them 


03:25.988 --> 03:28.323
to pioneer for a year. 


03:28.323 --> 03:29.658
Any kind of education— 


03:29.658 --> 03:33.930
Any kind of secular education can teach you 


03:33.930 --> 03:37.400
how to have a skill so that you have a job. 


03:37.400 --> 03:40.403
But the Bible teaches you how to live, 


03:40.403 --> 03:45.608
and it teaches you principles 
that you can live your life by. 


03:45.608 --> 03:48.110
And all of them kept pioneering. 


03:48.110 --> 03:51.413
You know, they did various jobs 
to support themselves. 


03:51.413 --> 03:54.783
They cleaned; they worked at lumberyards; 
they worked on roofing. 


03:54.783 --> 03:57.953
And none of them have 


03:57.953 --> 04:00.456
a complicated life that holds them down.


04:00.457 --> 04:03.025
I wanted everlasting life 
for my children, 


04:03.025 --> 04:06.428
and I knew I would have to give 
them back to Jehovah. 


04:06.428 --> 04:09.898
We have to realize we don’t own our children
—Jehovah does. 


04:09.898 --> 04:11.900
And we have to respect that. 


04:11.900 --> 04:16.072
We’re not telling them what to do anymore. 


04:16.072 --> 04:18.407
We appreciate 
and we’re very, very thankful 


04:18.407 --> 04:21.044
when our children, 
as far away as they are 


04:21.043 --> 04:23.045
and as busy as they are, 


04:23.045 --> 04:26.000
take the time to communicate with us. 


04:27.917 --> 04:31.620
And I know you won’t remember this, 


04:31.620 --> 04:35.658
but I remember one time, 
before you fell asleep at night, 


04:35.658 --> 04:40.463
I said, 
“With all that you have done for Jehovah, 


04:40.463 --> 04:44.200
what would you like in return?” 


04:44.200 --> 04:47.170
Do you remember what you said? 


04:47.170 --> 04:52.000
You said three words, “All my children.”


04:53.575 --> 04:56.912
In Deuteronomy it says: 
“I have put life and death before you, 


04:56.912 --> 04:58.949
. . . and you must choose.” 


04:58.948 --> 05:01.083
So we can do what we can as parents 


05:01.083 --> 05:03.953
—some things good, 
some things not so good. 


05:03.953 --> 05:07.056
In the end, each one had to make 


05:07.057 --> 05:10.660
his or her own decision. 


05:10.660 --> 05:14.330
And that’s why, again, 
it was not any secret we had. 


05:14.330 --> 05:17.233
We’re so proud of what the kids decided 


05:17.233 --> 05:20.636
and how they turned out 
because it was their decision. 


05:20.637 --> 05:24.574
I think that’s the thing that we’ve learned: 


05:24.573 --> 05:29.000
Don’t turn down opportunities.


05:32.348 --> 05:36.051
Isn’t it wonderful to hear of ones 
like Brother and Sister Schiller 


05:36.052 --> 05:38.889
who have offered their gifts to Jehovah? 


05:38.888 --> 05:41.990
Brother Schiller said 
that it was doing the basic things 


05:41.990 --> 05:44.727
that kept his family focused spiritually. 


05:44.727 --> 05:48.597
So when opportunities came along, 
he was able to do more, 


05:48.597 --> 05:52.169
which included pioneering, 
substitute circuit work, 


05:52.168 --> 05:55.270
and using the medical training 
he had already acquired 


05:55.270 --> 05:59.008
to volunteer 
at the Patterson Educational Center. 


05:59.008 --> 06:02.345
Proverbs 10:22 says: 


06:02.345 --> 06:06.148
“It is the blessing of Jehovah 
that makes one rich, 


06:06.148 --> 06:08.951
and He adds no hardship with it.”(Ftn.) 


06:08.952 --> 06:19.714
That certainly has proved true 
for Brother Schiller and his family.

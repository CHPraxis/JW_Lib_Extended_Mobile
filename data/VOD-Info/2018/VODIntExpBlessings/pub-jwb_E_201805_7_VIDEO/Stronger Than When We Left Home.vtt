WEBVTT

00:04.942 --> 00:08.737
We live in a beautiful, 
quiet town in central Italy,

00:08.737 --> 00:11.282
between the sea and the mountains.

00:11.282 --> 00:14.493
We have many friends, 
some of whom are good cooks.

00:18.038 --> 00:22.167
We have been serving for some years 
in a Romanian-language congregation,

00:22.167 --> 00:25.671
and we preach to people who have moved 
to Italy to seek a better life.

00:27.923 --> 00:29.967
When we heard the announcement 
about the special campaign,

00:29.967 --> 00:33.596
we looked at each other 
and said, “Let’s go!”

00:36.056 --> 00:38.976
‘A large door of activity’ 
was opening up to us.

00:43.689 --> 00:45.983
But there was a problem—my job.

00:45.983 --> 00:49.028
I would need a month’s leave of absence,

00:49.028 --> 00:51.113
and that would be difficult.

00:51.113 --> 00:53.324
We prayed, and we did research.

00:53.324 --> 00:56.660
And during family worship, 
we decided that in order to participate,

00:56.660 --> 00:59.788
I would ask for a one-month leave from work.

00:59.788 --> 01:03.083
But Jehovah had something else in mind

01:03.083 --> 01:05.419
that would create 
the right circumstances for us.

01:08.881 --> 01:11.425
When I arrived at work the next day, 
I found an unexpected situation.

01:12.217 --> 01:14.219
Because of the failing economy,

01:14.219 --> 01:16.263
my boss gave me and some other employees

01:16.263 --> 01:18.682
a letter of dismissal.

01:18.682 --> 01:20.684
I was not at all worried.

01:20.684 --> 01:22.645
I trusted in Jehovah,

01:22.645 --> 01:25.105
and I knew that this new situation

01:25.105 --> 01:28.734
would allow me 
to participate in the campaign.

01:31.028 --> 01:35.407
Participating in this campaign 
is a dream come true.

01:35.407 --> 01:38.869
We wanted to participate in 2013,

01:38.869 --> 01:43.207
but unfortunately things in life 
do not always go as we would like.

01:49.213 --> 01:53.133
We received some truly shocking news.

01:53.133 --> 01:56.428
My father had been diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer.

01:57.471 --> 02:00.891
Emotionally, it was not easy.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.978
The tranquillity 
we had dreamed and hoped for

02:03.978 --> 02:07.773
was almost gone.

02:07.773 --> 02:11.068
The only thing that could help me 
at that moment was

02:11.068 --> 02:14.530
the hope for what Jehovah promises us.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.032
In addition to my father’s death,

02:17.032 --> 02:19.743
I began to experience panic attacks.

02:19.743 --> 02:24.581
I was afraid of something that didn’t exist

02:26.291 --> 02:31.255
—afraid of not being able to move on.

02:31.255 --> 02:33.507
It’s the kind of emotion 
that leaves a lump in your throat,

02:33.507 --> 02:35.509
and you can’t even breathe.

02:36.218 --> 02:38.429
I realized that only Jehovah

02:38.429 --> 02:43.183
could help me fill the void that I felt.

02:43.183 --> 02:45.144
After a family worship,

02:45.853 --> 02:49.106
Fabio and I decided to turn in 
our regular pioneer applications.

02:50.566 --> 02:53.027
I felt Jehovah at my side,

02:53.027 --> 02:55.988
embracing and supporting me.

02:55.988 --> 03:00.200
In the end, they turned out to be 
the three most beautiful years of our lives,

03:00.200 --> 03:04.747
which also allowed us 
to participate in this beautiful campaign.

03:06.665 --> 03:09.293
In Romania, there are 
many isolated territories

03:09.293 --> 03:12.629
that local brothers cannot work 
because of the great distances to be covered.

03:18.802 --> 03:21.263
It is really exciting to reach many people

03:21.263 --> 03:24.183
by traveling on dirt roads 
that are often muddy.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.905
The people are generous, 
hospitable, and genuine.

03:46.413 --> 03:48.874
They almost always invite us into their homes

03:48.874 --> 03:51.877
and are willing to talk to us.

03:56.965 --> 03:59.635
Talking to people who do not know Jehovah

03:59.635 --> 04:03.889
and who are still very much interested 
in doctrinal topics is really exciting.

04:10.145 --> 04:13.982
Experiencing firsthand 
a culture different from ours,

04:13.982 --> 04:16.777
seeing people who live a more simple life,

04:16.777 --> 04:19.154
and trying to understand their needs

04:19.154 --> 04:21.532
is an experience that we will take with us.

04:21.532 --> 04:24.785
And it will help us 
to preach more effectively

04:24.785 --> 04:28.664
in our assigned 
congregation’s territory in Italy.

04:35.963 --> 04:38.715
Now we are stronger than when we left home.

04:38.715 --> 04:42.761
This experience has made us 
love the ministry even more.

04:45.848 --> 04:50.185
We look forward to returning 
to our home territory with renewed zeal.

04:55.023 --> 04:58.735
We are certain that Jehovah will guide us 
to further service opportunities

04:58.735 --> 05:21.656
in order to help others know 
his wonderful purposes.

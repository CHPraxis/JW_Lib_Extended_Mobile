00:03.815 --> 00:06.652
I have an illness 
that affects my level of energy, 


00:06.652 --> 00:10.957
so I didn’t feel that I could accept 
just any kind of assignment. 


00:10.957 --> 00:14.410
Since the end of this system is near, 


00:14.410 --> 00:16.412
I want to do whatever I can 


00:16.412 --> 00:19.415
that Jehovah wants down to the very end. 


00:19.415 --> 00:21.625
So I applied. 


00:21.625 --> 00:24.420
Before attending SKE, 
when I received my invitation, 


00:24.420 --> 00:28.423
all of a sudden I had challenges 
or worries about myself. 


00:28.423 --> 00:32.678
I felt unworthy, even unqualified.


00:32.678 --> 00:37.683
Being a single sister, 
going into the class with so many couples, 


00:37.683 --> 00:41.000
I thought I would be out of place. 


00:43.772 --> 00:47.777
I used all my abilities. 


00:47.777 --> 00:51.947
I felt like my head was swelling up. 


00:51.947 --> 00:55.534
Even so, I felt that I was really being refined 


00:55.533 --> 00:59.000
and ended each day feeling fulfilled.


01:01.492 --> 01:03.007
Something that I 


01:03.007 --> 01:04.599
really enjoyed about SKE 


01:04.598 --> 01:06.253
was Friday afternoons. 


01:06.253 --> 01:08.255
That’s when we had a talk 


01:08.255 --> 01:10.007
from one of the Governing Body members. 


01:10.007 --> 01:12.384
That was special.


01:12.383 --> 01:14.386
During the eight weeks of school, 


01:14.387 --> 01:15.845
such an emphasis was placed 


01:15.845 --> 01:17.848
on serving where the need is greater. 


01:17.848 --> 01:20.850
So this way of thinking 
became more important to us.


01:20.850 --> 01:22.853
After eight weeks of attending the school, 


01:22.853 --> 01:25.480
you are even ready to be sent to the moon.


01:25.480 --> 01:26.815
When I was told 


01:26.815 --> 01:28.275
that my next assignment 


01:28.275 --> 01:30.527
would be in Mesa, Arizona, 


01:30.527 --> 01:32.529
I thought, ‘Where is that?’ 


01:32.528 --> 01:35.156
And then I thought, 
‘Oh, no, scorpions!’ 


01:35.157 --> 01:37.492
And then I thought, ‘OK, 


01:37.492 --> 01:41.330
this is where Jehovah thinks 
I should be, so I’m ready to go.’


01:41.330 --> 01:43.332
One of the challenges in my new assignment 


01:43.332 --> 01:46.002
was finding suitable accommodations. 


01:46.002 --> 01:48.087
There was a couple in the congregation 


01:48.087 --> 01:51.840
who had two rooms that they rented 
in the back of their property,


01:51.840 --> 01:53.842
but it needed some renovations. 


01:53.842 --> 01:56.929
So the brothers very quickly came together, 
helped sort it out, 


01:56.928 --> 02:00.931
and even built an extra 
little kitchenette lounge. 


02:00.932 --> 02:02.935
So now we have a beautiful little home 


02:02.935 --> 02:06.813
to go back to after a long, 
hot day in the ministry. 


02:06.813 --> 02:10.816
I always thought that I’d do much better 
in the cold than I would in the heat. 


02:10.817 --> 02:13.695
So the brothers and sisters 
were very helpful 


02:13.695 --> 02:15.905
in making sure that I stayed hydrated, 


02:15.905 --> 02:19.242
making sure I knew 
how to handle myself in the heat, 


02:19.242 --> 02:22.079
giving me pointers on things to carry, 


02:22.078 --> 02:24.246
and they made sure that I had 


02:24.247 --> 02:27.125
an extra-large water bottle with me. 


02:27.125 --> 02:31.088
We really felt supported by the congregation 


02:31.088 --> 02:33.423
because they found us an apartment. 


02:33.423 --> 02:38.000
This meant that we could concentrate 
on our ministry.


02:39.262 --> 02:43.017
One of the things that really helped me 
was an experienced brother 


02:43.017 --> 02:46.479
who gave an encouraging comment 
about whether my health 


02:46.478 --> 02:48.521
would permit me to attend the school. 


02:48.522 --> 02:51.025
He said, “If she can pioneer, 


02:51.025 --> 02:54.000
then it’s also possible for her 
to attend the school.”


02:55.820 --> 02:58.407
The education that we received at SKE 


02:58.407 --> 03:01.827
especially helped us with our qualities, 


03:01.827 --> 03:04.580
our personality 
—putting on the new personality. 


03:04.580 --> 03:07.917
That really will help us 
not only now in our assignment 


03:07.917 --> 03:10.000
but right through into the new world. 


03:12.923 --> 03:15.465
I think there are many 
who could meet the qualifications 


03:15.465 --> 03:17.927
with just a little more effort. 


03:17.927 --> 03:22.389
Please know that there is 
a wonderful education program, 


03:22.388 --> 03:25.891
and we were able 
to experience it in our 60’s. 


03:25.892 --> 03:28.000
We could get through it. 


03:29.353 --> 03:32.231
So if others are thinking of applying, 


03:32.232 --> 03:35.735
I want to tell them that we were able to do it, 


03:35.735 --> 03:37.822
and by all means, 


03:37.822 --> 03:41.000
I want them to taste 
the same joy that we experienced. 


03:43.743 --> 03:45.245
You could be nervous 


03:45.245 --> 03:48.540
and have performance anxiety 
and worry about, 


03:48.540 --> 03:50.625
‘How will I handle answering, 


03:50.625 --> 03:52.962
‘and how about all 
of the student assignments 


03:52.962 --> 03:55.339
and the tests?’
—worries like that. 


03:55.338 --> 03:57.340
But for my own part, 


03:57.340 --> 04:01.345
it was two months 
with an incredible amount of joy. 


04:01.345 --> 04:03.888
And you have to focus on that. 


04:03.888 --> 04:08.185
It is a gift 
—it is a wonderful gift from Jehovah. 


04:08.185 --> 04:11.230
I wasn’t sure if I was going 
to put in the application 


04:11.230 --> 04:13.982
because I thought maybe 
I wanted to do it as a couple 


04:13.982 --> 04:16.360
rather than as a single person. 


04:16.360 --> 04:19.000
But I prayed to Jehovah about it, 
and I put my application in. 


04:20.197 --> 04:22.532
I wouldn’t be experiencing the happiness 


04:22.532 --> 04:24.660
that I have now if I had waited. 


04:24.660 --> 04:27.245
So I’m happy 
that I just put my application in 


04:27.245 --> 04:29.247
and let Jehovah do the rest. 


04:29.247 --> 04:31.542
And now, sometimes I’m driving 
down the freeway, and I think: 


04:31.542 --> 04:43.325
‘Wow, Jehovah, I am so happy! 
Thank you!’

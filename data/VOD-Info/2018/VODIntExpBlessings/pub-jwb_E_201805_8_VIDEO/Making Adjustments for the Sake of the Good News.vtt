00:00.917 --> 00:05.755
Out of the over 100,000 publishers 
in South Korea,

00:05.755 --> 00:10.560
there are more than 
40,000 zealous regular pioneers.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.562
What efforts have they made

00:12.562 --> 00:16.066
to reach more people 
in frequently worked territory?

00:16.066 --> 00:18.068
Let’s find out.

00:19.669 --> 00:23.306
I started pioneering 
less than a year after I got baptized,

00:23.306 --> 00:24.874
so I was eager to sharpen

00:24.874 --> 00:26.342
my preaching skills.

00:26.342 --> 00:29.112
I really wanted to share my hope with others.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.947
But it’s so hard to meet people

00:30.947 --> 00:32.615
at their homes during the day.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.451
And even if we do meet them,

00:34.451 --> 00:37.854
it’s not easy to start a conversation.

00:37.854 --> 00:40.557
Our congregation organized 
convenience store witnessing

00:40.557 --> 00:43.059
from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.,

00:43.059 --> 00:45.962
so I thought this might be 
a good way to reach people

00:45.962 --> 00:47.630
and have meaningful conversations.

00:49.532 --> 00:51.634
But the thing is that I’m not 
a morning person,

00:51.634 --> 00:54.270
so getting up early was not easy.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.707
So I had to make some adjustments.

00:57.707 --> 00:59.375
I tried not to make plans

00:59.375 --> 01:03.980
or to stay up late the night before.

01:03.980 --> 01:08.351
The sample presentations 
from our meetings were also very helpful.

01:09.719 --> 01:13.990
In the past, I hardly got the chance 
to open the Bible while I was preaching,

01:13.990 --> 01:17.260
but now I have a few Bible studies.

01:18.995 --> 01:22.465
Even the time we spend traveling 
from one convenience store to the next

01:22.465 --> 01:26.269
is very uplifting spiritually 
because we use that time

01:26.269 --> 01:29.305
to share our preaching skills 
and build each other up.

01:29.305 --> 01:32.275
Having a regular share 
in convenience store witnessing

01:32.275 --> 01:35.812
has allowed me to be 
more productive in the ministry.

01:35.812 --> 01:38.348
I feel like I’m progressing spiritually

01:38.348 --> 01:42.519
and becoming a better minister 
of the good news.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.356
On weekdays, I work to support my family.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.825
So I would usually go out in field service

01:48.825 --> 01:50.994
on the weekends.

01:50.994 --> 01:53.897
But it wasn’t easy 
to find people at their homes

01:53.897 --> 01:57.100
because they usually make plans and go out.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.802
And you know,

01:58.802 --> 02:01.337
it’s hard to get excited 
about the preaching work

02:01.337 --> 02:03.773
when you’re not meeting many people.

02:03.773 --> 02:07.076
I wanted to set 
a good example for my family,

02:07.076 --> 02:11.581
but I found it a real challenge 
to maintain my zeal for the ministry.

02:12.849 --> 02:16.553
So I began to regularly participate 
in evening witnessing

02:16.553 --> 02:20.957
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.

02:20.957 --> 02:24.194
I usually get off work around 5:00 p.m.

02:24.194 --> 02:26.563
After a long day at work,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.498
it’s not always easy to get dressed

02:28.498 --> 02:31.501
to go out in the field ministry.

02:31.501 --> 02:34.270
But I kept up with my return visits

02:34.270 --> 02:37.006
and had some really encouraging experiences.

02:37.006 --> 02:39.976
A young man I had been visiting

02:39.976 --> 02:43.479
accepted a Bible study, 
and he’s making fine progress.

02:43.479 --> 02:47.717
My children are able to see 
how much joy I get from the ministry,

02:47.717 --> 02:51.187
and so now they too 
are able to give a bold witness

02:51.187 --> 02:53.857
in their own words, 
even in the face of opposition.

02:55.225 --> 02:57.894
I am very proud of my children.

02:57.894 --> 03:00.263
Training and teaching them how to make

03:00.263 --> 03:02.732
effective return visits and Bible studies

03:02.732 --> 03:05.435
brings me great joy.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.837
We serve in a small rural town

03:07.837 --> 03:10.673
where many leave home 
early in the morning to work in the field,

03:10.673 --> 03:12.675
and they return late at night.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.077
So it’s not easy

03:14.077 --> 03:16.446
to find people at home during the daytime.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.848
And even if we do find them at their doors,

03:18.848 --> 03:21.684
it’s not easy to develop 
a meaningful Bible-based conversation,

03:21.684 --> 03:26.322
let alone make return visits 
and conduct Bible studies with them.

03:26.322 --> 03:28.958
After returning home 
from preaching at night,

03:28.958 --> 03:30.894
I would ask myself,

03:30.894 --> 03:32.595
‘Did I have a meaningful share 
in the ministry today?’

03:34.364 --> 03:36.366
It’s a small rural town.

03:36.366 --> 03:38.701
So many people are concerned 
about what their neighbors

03:38.701 --> 03:40.737
would think if they talked with us.

03:41.604 --> 03:45.708
So even those who were interested 
in learning more about the Bible

03:45.708 --> 03:49.545
were reluctant to have 
Bible discussions with us.

03:49.545 --> 03:52.982
It was really unfortunate.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.853
We tried to figure out 
the right time to call on people,

03:56.853 --> 04:01.090
and we found out 
that many householders are more relaxed

04:01.090 --> 04:03.526
and willing to talk about the Bible

04:03.526 --> 04:08.031
if we visit them 
around nine or ten o’clock in the evening.

04:08.932 --> 04:12.435
I gave much thought 
on how I could help my Bible students

04:12.435 --> 04:15.338
have a regular intake of spiritual food.

04:15.338 --> 04:19.142
One of my students 
worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.,

04:19.142 --> 04:21.744
so I asked her if we could arrange

04:21.744 --> 04:23.746
to study early in the morning.

04:23.746 --> 04:25.748
She agreed.

04:25.748 --> 04:27.884
I often tell my Bible students,

04:27.884 --> 04:31.454
‘Just call me whenever you have 
a little time to talk.’

04:32.588 --> 04:36.259
When I get those calls, 
no matter what time it is,

04:36.259 --> 04:38.995
it’s time to rush out that door.

04:40.897 --> 04:44.367
There was one elderly lady 
who was in her early 80’s

04:44.367 --> 04:47.870
who had attended church all her life.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.906
To accommodate her needs,

04:49.906 --> 04:54.043
I visited her 
around nine or ten o’clock in the evening

04:54.043 --> 04:56.546
for our Bible studies.

04:58.314 --> 05:01.017
I would come home 
feeling tired and hungry,

05:01.017 --> 05:03.186
but the satisfaction of knowing

05:03.186 --> 05:05.621
that I’ve helped her learn 
more about the truth

05:05.621 --> 05:09.125
enables me to maintain my joy.

05:10.827 --> 05:14.364
Now I am able to conduct 
about 12 Bible studies.

05:14.364 --> 05:18.935
I try to “become all things 
to people of all sorts”

05:18.935 --> 05:21.637
in order to look after their needs.

05:21.637 --> 05:24.040
And it brings me great satisfaction and joy

05:24.040 --> 05:26.042
to see my studies make progress

05:26.042 --> 05:28.044
because that’s really how Jehovah wants us

05:28.044 --> 05:31.047
to be carrying out our ministry.

05:34.550 --> 05:38.788
You might feel that you’ve worked 
every corner of your home territory.

05:38.788 --> 05:43.693
But just like a literal fisherman 
adapts to the time when the fish are biting,

05:43.693 --> 05:47.030
we need to work when people can be found.

05:47.030 --> 05:50.933
Cast your nets into productive waters!

05:50.933 --> 05:55.271
Our sister arranged her schedule 
to call on her Bible student

05:55.271 --> 05:57.907
at nine or ten in the evening.

05:57.907 --> 06:00.143
Of course, we want to use good judgment

06:00.143 --> 06:04.914
to call at times that are both practical 
and safe for our territory.

06:04.914 --> 06:09.018
But by being adaptable in when, where,

06:09.018 --> 06:11.454
or how we preach the good news,

06:11.454 --> 06:16.125
we may yield good results like those 
of our fellow Witnesses in South Korea.

06:16.859 --> 06:21.397
This will help us to have 
a meaningful share in the all-important work

06:21.397 --> 06:32.836
of finding those who 
are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:01 My name is Cecil Joseph Goff.
00:05 I began to lose eyesight in the ’70’s.
00:08 I can’t see to read or anything.
00:10 I see only peripheral vision.
00:14 I was playing in a country band  at a very young age.
00:20 Well, I played the tenor banjo,  tenor guitar, and I played the mandolin.
00:25 It was my life.
00:27 And yet, when I began reading and studying,
00:30 really, I wanted to stick with that,
00:32 and I left the band.
00:34 I started pioneering,
00:36 and then they assigned me  to Texarkana, Texas.
00:41 Another brother and I were stopped
00:45 as we were holding the phonograph up,
00:47 and I was playing it for a lady at the door.
00:50 Why, here about 15 or 20 men surrounded me.
00:54 I asked him, “How did you enjoy it?”
00:56 And he said: “That’s not the question.
00:58 My question is, Do you salute the flag?”
00:59 And I said, “Let me explain it.”
01:01 He said: “I don’t want an explanation.
01:03 I just want to know yes or no;  do you or do you not?”
01:06 I said, “I do not.”
01:09 He threw me up in the air.
01:11 I fell on my back in the street there,
01:13 and then about three of them  got on top of me.
01:16 He said: “You’re going  to salute the flag or eat it.
01:18 Bring me that flag over there.”
01:20 I was praying to Jehovah  to remember me in the resurrection.
01:23 About that time, several women  ran out of the houses on both sides of us:
01:28 “Leave those men alone.  They didn’t bother you.
01:30 Leave them alone.  Let them go.”
01:33 So they got off of me, and they left us  like a bunch of beaten kittens.
01:37 I was asked to go to Brooklyn Bethel  and become a member of the Bethel home.
01:42 Brother Knorr asked me,  “Do you know how to use the typewriter?”
01:45 I said, “Yes, I can type.”
01:47 He said: “Well, I’m going  to put you on a machine.
01:50 “It’s called a Linotype.
01:51 It has three keyboards.”
01:53 And he said: “And it will take you  about two years to learn it.
01:56 Are you willing to accept it?”
01:58 And I said, “Yes, I will.”
02:00 So I was put on the Linotype.
02:03 I got married  in the fall of 1945 and left Bethel.
02:07 Well, we were invited in 1949
02:11 to go into the circuit work.
02:13 We were in the 21st class of Gilead.
02:15 We enjoyed that course very much.
02:17 We received an assignment for Cuba,
02:19 and I was assigned as branch overseer.
02:22 And in ’63,
02:26 the police car came
02:29 up to the branch  at about ten o’clock at night.
02:31 I was told to take my papers,
02:33 and we went  over to the police station, and so forth.
02:36 And sure enough,  soon thereafter, here comes an official.
02:40 He said, “You have to leave Cuba
02:42 because you’re not in favor  of the Cuban government.”
02:46 A person asked  a policeman standing close by, he said,
02:50 “Who are these people  that are being sent out of the country?”
02:54 And they said: “Over there,”
02:56 talking about me,
02:58 “see that gangster man over there?
03:00 He’s the head of it.”
03:02 So then we got on the plane  and headed back.
03:05 I got in contact with Brooklyn Bethel,
03:07 talked to Brother Knorr, and he said,
03:09 “As soon as you can,  in the next day or two, come back to Bethel.”
03:13 And Brother Knorr said,  “You got back just in time
03:15 “to get back on the Linotype machine
03:18 to set up a new book we have in Spanish.”
03:21 So I did that and got on the Linotype.
03:25 And then Brother Knorr told me, he said,
03:28 “In 1964, we’re going to have  a ten-month course in Gilead
03:31 for all branch people  who have branch experience.”
03:35 Oh, it was very, very good.
03:38 We studied a lot, not only the Bible
03:40 (we studied a lot on the Bible,  discourse and everything)
03:43 but we studied a lot of branch material too.
03:48 Above everything else,  our love for Jehovah should continue to grow.
03:53 He knows our thoughts, our mind, our heart.
03:55 He goes far beyond what man can do.
03:58 And whatever his decision is,
04:00 I’ve learned to understand  that it’s the best decision.
04:04 I have learned that if we obey  what the organization says
04:08 and what the Bible says,  then we’re doing Jehovah’s will;
04:11 and that’s my concern
04:13 —no regrets whatsoever, none.
04:18 Maybe I could’ve done more at times,
04:20 but I’m certainly glad  that I have taken advantage of it
04:23 as much as I have up until now.
04:25 And it’s been a happy life.
04:27 And I have seen Jehovah’s hand
04:29 time and again.

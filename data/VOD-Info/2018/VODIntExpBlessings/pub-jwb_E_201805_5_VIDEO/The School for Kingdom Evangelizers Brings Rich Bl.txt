00:09 We had our own house,
00:11 a certain amount of comfort.
00:13 My husband had a stable job,
00:15 and I was doing a lot where we were.
00:17 I had Bible studies.
00:19 I was already a regular pioneer, so I thought I was doing enough.
00:23 It was fine to stay there.
00:28 We’d often see the younger ones
00:30 going to Bethel, going to serve as special pioneers.
00:34 And once we reached our 40’s, I thought that since we’re getting older,
00:37 we won’t be able to reach out and do more for Jehovah.
00:40 But after a letter was read to the congregations,
00:43 well, that was really  the starting point for us to see
00:45 that we could do more for Jehovah.
00:48 When I heard that there was a school for couples up to 65 years old,
00:52 I said, “Cristiano, it’s now or never.”
00:55 So immediately at the first convention that held a meeting for interested couples,
00:59 we attended the meeting and realized that out of the requirements
01:03 there was one that my husband didn’t meet yet,
01:06 which was two years as a regular pioneer.
01:09 So I thought, ‘Why not?’
01:12 After the convention, I applied to be a regular pioneer.
01:15 So we made plans to attend the school.
01:19 But we didn’t want to stay there waiting to be accepted,
01:22 as there were no guarantees of being accepted
01:24 in the same year in which we applied.
01:26 We sold our house.
01:28 And two weeks later, we had sold all the furniture.
01:30 So we made arrangements to serve where the need was greater.
01:37 We took only what was necessary in our car.
01:39 But “what is necessary” is always too much.
01:42 When you get to the territory, you realize you didn’t even need everything you took.
01:46 We were really excited because we knew  the brothers were expecting us.
01:50 There was a gas station that belonged to a brother,
01:52 and when we arrived, the whole congregation
01:55 was waiting for us there  to welcome us.
01:57 Nine people!
01:58 And that had a great impact on us,
02:00 because you could see  the expression on their faces;
02:02 it was as if they were asking for help.
02:07 They helped us a lot.
02:10 I can honestly say  that they helped us more
02:14 than we helped them.
02:19 Now they would be able to have regular meetings
02:21 —a public talk every week.
02:23 You know, we were in São Paulo and we had all the meetings.
02:27 But in these remote areas, they need spiritual food from Jehovah so much.
02:32 But there needs to be people  willing to go and help.
02:39 Then one day, we had a wonderful surprise.
02:41 A brother called me and said, “Cristiano, have you checked your e-mails?”
02:46 We’d received a letter inviting us to the school.
02:50 The school really is a gift from Jehovah.
02:53 I’ve encouraged others that I know to attend the school
02:55 because you really feel how Jehovah cares for his organization.
03:01 And a small thing we can do is simply give our best,
03:06 and the school helps us do just that
03:08 —find out what is our best.
03:11 We were assigned to a congregation called Itiruçu.
03:15 The brothers are very loving, and we’re really happy in our assignment.
03:23 I do miss my house.
03:26 It’s nice to have your own house
03:28 and not to have to worry about paying rent.
03:30 I miss my hairdresser.
03:33 But nothing compares to the blessings and the joy
03:36 that comes from serving  where there’s a need.
03:40 This joy helps us to combat  any homesickness we feel
03:44 and stops us from developing any desire to go back home.
03:48 In the big city, everything’s very rushed.
03:51 I would only see my wife when I got home from work.
03:53 I’d be tired, and then also have to care for congregational matters.
03:56 So there wasn’t much time for us to be together.
03:59 Now it’s completely different.
04:01 We have much more time —during the ministry,
04:04 in the congregation,  being together at home.
04:06 So for us as a family, it has been very positive, very good.
04:12 We’re not tired. We’re not old in the sense—
04:14 No we’re not.
04:15 —of saying that we’ve got no more to give.
04:17 We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.
04:20 And we want to do more for Jehovah.
04:23 The school is proof that he wants us to do more.
04:27 We want to use our life to the full to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.
04:31 We are willing to go.
04:33 We feel it’s the only way to say a big “thank you”
04:35 to Jehovah for everything he’s done for us
04:39 —the territory, school,  the brothers, and Bible students.
04:44 What better way to thank Jehovah.

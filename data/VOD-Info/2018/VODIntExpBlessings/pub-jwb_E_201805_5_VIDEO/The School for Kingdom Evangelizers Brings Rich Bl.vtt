WEBVTT

00:09.125 --> 00:11.127
We had our own house,

00:11.127 --> 00:13.396
a certain amount of comfort.

00:13.396 --> 00:15.465
My husband had a stable job,

00:15.465 --> 00:17.567
and I was doing a lot where we were.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.335
I had Bible studies.

00:19.335 --> 00:23.239
I was already a regular pioneer,
so I thought I was doing enough.

00:23.239 --> 00:26.009
It was fine to stay there.

00:28.011 --> 00:30.013
We’d often see the younger ones

00:30.013 --> 00:34.451
going to Bethel,
going to serve as special pioneers.

00:34.451 --> 00:37.587
And once we reached our 40’s,
I thought that since we’re getting older,

00:37.587 --> 00:40.557
we won’t be able to reach out
and do more for Jehovah.

00:40.557 --> 00:43.259
But after a letter
was read to the congregations,

00:43.259 --> 00:45.395
well, that was really 
the starting point for us to see

00:45.395 --> 00:48.598
that we could do more for Jehovah.

00:48.598 --> 00:52.902
When I heard that there was
a school for couples up to 65 years old,

00:52.902 --> 00:55.271
I said, “Cristiano, it’s now or never.”

00:55.271 --> 00:59.743
So immediately at the first convention
that held a meeting for interested couples,

00:59.743 --> 01:03.513
we attended the meeting
and realized that out of the requirements

01:03.513 --> 01:06.249
there was one
that my husband didn’t meet yet,

01:06.249 --> 01:09.619
which was two years as a regular pioneer.

01:09.619 --> 01:12.355
So I thought, ‘Why not?’

01:12.355 --> 01:15.658
After the convention,
I applied to be a regular pioneer.

01:15.658 --> 01:19.162
So we made plans to attend the school.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.265
But we didn’t want to stay there
waiting to be accepted,

01:22.265 --> 01:24.267
as there were no guarantees of being accepted

01:24.267 --> 01:26.269
in the same year in which we applied.

01:26.269 --> 01:28.271
We sold our house.

01:28.271 --> 01:30.807
And two weeks later,
we had sold all the furniture.

01:30.807 --> 01:33.810
So we made arrangements
to serve where the need was greater.

01:37.781 --> 01:39.816
We took only what was necessary in our car.

01:39.816 --> 01:42.552
But “what is necessary” is always too much.

01:42.552 --> 01:46.322
When you get to the territory, you realize
you didn’t even need everything you took.

01:46.322 --> 01:50.326
We were really excited because we knew 
the brothers were expecting us.

01:50.326 --> 01:52.796
There was a gas station
that belonged to a brother,

01:52.796 --> 01:55.198
and when we arrived,
the whole congregation

01:55.198 --> 01:57.300
was waiting for us there 
to welcome us.

01:57.300 --> 01:58.501
Nine people!

01:58.501 --> 02:00.203
And that had a great impact on us,

02:00.203 --> 02:02.639
because you could see 
the expression on their faces;

02:02.639 --> 02:05.809
it was as if they were asking for help.

02:07.310 --> 02:10.513
They helped us a lot.

02:10.513 --> 02:14.517
I can honestly say 
that they helped us more

02:14.517 --> 02:17.520
than we helped them.

02:19.355 --> 02:21.758
Now they would be able
to have regular meetings

02:21.758 --> 02:23.760
—a public talk every week.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.597
You know, we were in São Paulo
and we had all the meetings.

02:27.597 --> 02:32.068
But in these remote areas, they need
spiritual food from Jehovah so much.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.504
But there needs to be people 
willing to go and help.

02:39.209 --> 02:41.578
Then one day,
we had a wonderful surprise.

02:41.578 --> 02:46.082
A brother called me and said,
“Cristiano, have you checked your e-mails?”

02:46.082 --> 02:50.787
We’d received a letter
inviting us to the school.

02:50.787 --> 02:53.456
The school really is a gift from Jehovah.

02:53.456 --> 02:55.925
I’ve encouraged others that I know
to attend the school

02:55.925 --> 03:00.096
because you really feel
how Jehovah cares for his organization.

03:01.831 --> 03:06.035
And a small thing we can do
is simply give our best,

03:06.035 --> 03:08.571
and the school helps us do just that

03:08.571 --> 03:11.441
—find out what is our best.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.912
We were assigned
to a congregation called Itiruçu.

03:15.912 --> 03:20.083
The brothers are very loving,
and we’re really happy in our assignment.

03:23.753 --> 03:26.623
I do miss my house.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.625
It’s nice to have your own house

03:28.625 --> 03:30.894
and not to have to worry about paying rent.

03:30.894 --> 03:33.863
I miss my hairdresser.

03:33.863 --> 03:36.532
But nothing compares
to the blessings and the joy

03:36.532 --> 03:39.235
that comes from serving 
where there’s a need.

03:40.169 --> 03:44.040
This joy helps us to combat 
any homesickness we feel

03:44.040 --> 03:47.744
and stops us from developing
any desire to go back home.

03:48.945 --> 03:51.481
In the big city,
everything’s very rushed.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.650
I would only see my wife
when I got home from work.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.819
I’d be tired, and then also
have to care for congregational matters.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.589
So there wasn’t much time
for us to be together.

03:59.589 --> 04:01.591
Now it’s completely different.

04:01.591 --> 04:04.260
We have much more time
—during the ministry,

04:04.260 --> 04:06.596
in the congregation, 
being together at home.

04:06.596 --> 04:10.099
So for us as a family,
it has been very positive, very good.

04:12.468 --> 04:14.504
We’re not tired.
We’re not old in the sense—

04:14.504 --> 04:15.505
No we’re not.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.540
—of saying that we’ve got no more to give.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.143
We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.

04:20.143 --> 04:23.179
And we want to do more for Jehovah.

04:23.179 --> 04:27.016
The school is proof
that he wants us to do more.

04:27.016 --> 04:31.120
We want to use our life to the full
to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.122
We are willing to go.

04:33.122 --> 04:35.825
We feel it’s the only way
to say a big “thank you”

04:35.825 --> 04:38.628
to Jehovah
for everything he’s done for us

04:39.195 --> 04:44.200
—the territory, school, 
the brothers, and Bible students.

04:44.200 --> 05:10.954
What better way to thank Jehovah.

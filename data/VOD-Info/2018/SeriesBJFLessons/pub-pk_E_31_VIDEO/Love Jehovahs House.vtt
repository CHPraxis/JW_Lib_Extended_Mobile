00:08.229 --> 00:12.479
Oh, Caleb, do you remember 
where Samuel served?

00:12.479 --> 00:13.687
Uh,

00:13.687 --> 00:15.687
the tabernacle?

00:15.687 --> 00:17.354
Good!

00:17.354 --> 00:19.354
That was like his house.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.979
But it was also Jehovah’s house.

00:22.770 --> 00:24.770
How do you think he treated it?

00:24.770 --> 00:26.437
Oh, he kept it clean!

00:27.687 --> 00:29.312
That’s right!

00:30.520 --> 00:33.145
The Kingdom Hall is like Jehovah’s house too.

00:33.145 --> 00:35.145
How should we treat it?

00:35.145 --> 00:37.312
Mmm, oh!

00:56.229 --> 00:57.229
Whew!

00:57.229 --> 00:58.937
Nice job, Caleb!

00:58.937 --> 01:00.937
When we keep the Kingdom Hall clean,

01:00.937 --> 01:15.085
we show Jehovah that we love him.

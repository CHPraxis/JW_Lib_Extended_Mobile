So you are excited
to go out in service!

00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think you are ready?

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so fast!

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you go in the ministry,

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are a few things
we need to go over.

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we must learn the three P’s.

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The three P’s?

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparation,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal appearance,

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and proper behavior.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, preparation.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparation is the first pillar

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of success in the ministry.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every job
requires the proper tools.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes
to tools for preaching,

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the variety
might seem intimidating.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But never fear!

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the Teaching Toolbox.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finding the right tools
is easier than ever!

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once you have your tools,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make sure and practice
your presentation

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before you leave the house.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wouldn’t want to be preparing
on the doorstep.

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that you are well-prepared,

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:06.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s time to talk
about personal appearance.

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we look is very important
because we represent Jehovah.

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting ready for the ministry,
we need to make sure

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our appearance
is saying the right things.

00:01:17.222 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants your appearance
to be well-arranged and modest.

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What that means is
that we look and smell clean;

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our clothes fit well,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not too well;

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hair is done;

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:38.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we aren’t drawing
too much attention to ourselves.

00:01:38.243 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking sharp, my son!

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:44.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s time
to talk about proper behavior.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our conduct while in the ministry

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is another way
we can bring praise to Jehovah.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So make sure you are
on your best behavior.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Avoid talking or laughing loudly,

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
playing around,

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or intruding
on anyone’s property or privacy.

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, no eating at the door.

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, when we go
door to door, people see us,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and good behavior
gives a good witness.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would never want
to give anyone

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a reason to find fault
with our ministry.

00:02:16.532 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I go out in service now?

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looks like you are ready.

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to put
the three P’s to the test.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi! My name is Caleb.
What’s your name?

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Caleb!

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is . . .

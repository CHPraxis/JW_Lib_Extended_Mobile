00:06.318 --> 00:08.736
I’ve been an insecure and reserved person 


00:08.737 --> 00:11.000
since childhood. 


00:13.200 --> 00:15.118
When I finished school, 


00:15.118 --> 00:17.996
my report said 
that I was unable to express myself 


00:17.997 --> 00:21.190
and that I had a limited vocabulary. 


00:21.190 --> 00:25.378
Those words injured 
my already low self-esteem. 


00:25.378 --> 00:29.000
So I started to wonder, 
‘What am I living for?’ 


00:31.927 --> 00:33.929
During my teenage years, 


00:33.928 --> 00:36.015
I began to drink alcohol. 


00:36.015 --> 00:39.477
Life seemed meaningless to me. 


00:39.477 --> 00:41.479
I felt depressed 


00:41.478 --> 00:44.000
and started to have suicidal thoughts. 


00:49.570 --> 00:53.490
When I was around 20, 
I became obsessed with hard rock. 


00:53.490 --> 00:57.000
This music really charged me with energy. 


00:58.995 --> 01:02.332
I loved its roughness and rapidness. 


01:02.332 --> 01:05.000
It whipped me into a frenzy. 


01:07.378 --> 01:10.631
In time, I became rude and aggressive. 


01:10.632 --> 01:12.635
I often quarreled 


01:12.635 --> 01:14.637
with those close to me. 


01:14.637 --> 01:17.430
This, of course, did not bring me happiness. 


01:17.430 --> 01:20.475
I started to have suicidal thoughts again, 


01:20.475 --> 01:23.000
but serious ones this time. 


01:24.313 --> 01:27.023
The only thing that stopped me 
was the thought that my mom 


01:27.023 --> 01:29.860
would not survive it. 


01:29.860 --> 01:31.862
I tried to take my mind off these thoughts, 


01:31.862 --> 01:35.657
and I began to want to do something for God. 


01:35.657 --> 01:38.327
For the first time in my life, 
I poured out my heart 


01:38.327 --> 01:40.329
to God in prayer. 


01:40.328 --> 01:43.831
I asked him to help me find 
my purpose in life. 


01:43.832 --> 01:45.500
Just two hours later, 


01:45.500 --> 01:47.878
Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked 


01:47.878 --> 01:51.340
on my door and offered a Bible study. 


01:51.340 --> 01:54.000
That is how my new, happy life began. 


01:57.053 --> 01:58.805
Although it wasn’t easy for me, 


01:58.805 --> 02:02.000
I got rid of everything that was related 
to hard rock and alcohol. 


02:03.977 --> 02:07.147
I thought that I would never be able 
to tell others about my faith. 


02:07.147 --> 02:08.857
At the same time, however, 


02:08.857 --> 02:11.860
I understood that people 
needed to hear about it. 


02:11.860 --> 02:13.862
But to my surprise, 


02:13.862 --> 02:16.490
my preaching gave me confidence. 


02:16.490 --> 02:19.785
It also strengthened my faith. 


02:19.785 --> 02:22.705
Now I have a good family. 


02:22.705 --> 02:24.832
I’m happy that I’ve been able to help people, 


02:24.832 --> 02:26.834
including my sister and mom, 


02:26.833 --> 02:29.000
to learn the truth from the Bible. 


02:30.420 --> 02:32.630
Throughout my life as a Christian, 


02:32.630 --> 02:37.427
Jehovah’s words at Hebrews 13:5 
have greatly supported me: 


02:37.427 --> 02:39.805
“I will never leave you, 


02:39.805 --> 02:41.765
and I will never abandon you.”


02:41.765 --> 02:43.892
And he didn’t abandon me, 


02:43.892 --> 02:53.424
even when I did not know him.

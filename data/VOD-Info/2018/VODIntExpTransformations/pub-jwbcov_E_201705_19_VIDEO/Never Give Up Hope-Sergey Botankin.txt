00:06 I’ve been an insecure and reserved person
00:08 since childhood.
00:13 When I finished school,
00:15 my report said  that I was unable to express myself
00:17 and that I had a limited vocabulary.
00:21 Those words injured  my already low self-esteem.
00:25 So I started to wonder,  ‘What am I living for?’
00:31 During my teenage years,
00:33 I began to drink alcohol.
00:36 Life seemed meaningless to me.
00:39 I felt depressed
00:41 and started to have suicidal thoughts.
00:49 When I was around 20,  I became obsessed with hard rock.
00:53 This music really charged me with energy.
00:58 I loved its roughness and rapidness.
01:02 It whipped me into a frenzy.
01:07 In time, I became rude and aggressive.
01:10 I often quarreled
01:12 with those close to me.
01:14 This, of course, did not bring me happiness.
01:17 I started to have suicidal thoughts again,
01:20 but serious ones this time.
01:24 The only thing that stopped me  was the thought that my mom
01:27 would not survive it.
01:29 I tried to take my mind off these thoughts,
01:31 and I began to want to do something for God.
01:35 For the first time in my life,  I poured out my heart
01:38 to God in prayer.
01:40 I asked him to help me find  my purpose in life.
01:43 Just two hours later,
01:45 Jehovah’s Witnesses knocked
01:47 on my door and offered a Bible study.
01:51 That is how my new, happy life began.
01:57 Although it wasn’t easy for me,
01:58 I got rid of everything that was related  to hard rock and alcohol.
02:03 I thought that I would never be able  to tell others about my faith.
02:07 At the same time, however,
02:08 I understood that people  needed to hear about it.
02:11 But to my surprise,
02:13 my preaching gave me confidence.
02:16 It also strengthened my faith.
02:19 Now I have a good family.
02:22 I’m happy that I’ve been able to help people,
02:24 including my sister and mom,
02:26 to learn the truth from the Bible.
02:30 Throughout my life as a Christian,
02:32 Jehovah’s words at Hebrews 13:5  have greatly supported me:
02:37 “I will never leave you,
02:39 and I will never abandon you.”
02:41 And he didn’t abandon me,
02:43 even when I did not know him.

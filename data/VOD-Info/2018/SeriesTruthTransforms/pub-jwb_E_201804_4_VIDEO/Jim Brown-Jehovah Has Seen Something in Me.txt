00:05 I’m 53 years old.
00:08 I was known as a troublemaker.
00:11 I was fighting in the bars.
00:14 It comes to a point to where you begin to enjoy it.
00:17 He was flat-out scary.
00:20 He was a very mean and violent man,
00:23 so everybody kind of kept their distance from him.
00:27 My language was detestable.
00:31 I would make grown men blush
00:33 by the things that I would say and things that I would do.
00:36 I was involved with some bikers,
00:39 and they were trying to prospect me into getting into their club.
00:43 Things were escalating.
00:45 We got married very young, and we were 17.
00:49 And we had my oldest daughter.
00:51 I was the mom, and he lived a life
00:55 of being out with his friends and partying.
00:59 About that time, my wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:03 It was a big change for her,  but she explained the reasoning behind it.
01:07 I couldn’t argue with it.
01:08 She talked me into studying.
01:11 I studied from 20 years old to 30.
01:16 I had always seen it.
01:18 I had always seen that it was good.
01:19 I knew that this was where I needed to be.
01:21 Somehow, I just could never break free  of the person that I was.
01:25 My mom always raised us in the truth,
01:27 growing up, and that’s what we knew.
01:29 So, then, to see my dad,
01:30 where he was so different
01:33 but yet believed it to be the truth,
01:36 and then to see that his lifestyle  didn’t do him any good
01:39 was kind of a good example
01:42 of a bad example, if that makes sense.
01:47 I was afraid of the change.
01:49 People accepted me for who I was,
01:52 being the tough guy, being Jimmy Brown.
01:56 The scripture comes to mind:
01:58 “I planted, Apollos watered,  but God kept making it grow.”
02:01 Many brothers have studied with Jim
02:03 from time to time over the years.
02:06 I just happened to be the one  at the time in his life
02:10 when he was taking the truth and running with it.
02:15 I wanted to be a better person.
02:17 I truly knew that this was just
02:20 not the way of life that I wanted anymore.
02:25 He changed his friends;  he changed his life;
02:27 he changed his dress and grooming;
02:29 he changed his speech patterns;
02:31 he changed the way he was a grandfather;
02:34 he changed the way he was a father;  he changed the way he was a husband.
02:37 Everything changed about him.
02:42 I knew the work that Witnesses do
02:44 —going out door to door talking to people.
02:46 I thought I could never do that.
02:47 Whoa!  Me, going door to door?
02:49 I’m going to run into people that I know,
02:52 that I drank with for years and years.
02:54 How can I face them now?
02:57 I had always told my wife,
02:59 “It would be much easier for me
03:01 to become a Witness if I didn’t live here.”
03:04 But how wrong I was
03:07 because what a witness my changes have been
03:09 to so many people in town.
03:15 One of my favorite things to do
03:17 is bridge witnessing with my granddaughter.
03:21 People are fishing on the bridge —some have been there all night.
03:24 I even have return visits that I do
03:26 because people regularly  come down on the weekend
03:28 to fish on the bridges.
03:30 I seize every opportunity.
03:32 My kids laugh at me.
03:34 He’ll witness to anybody, anytime, anywhere.
03:37 You’ll see some raggedy-taggedy, old, rough guy
03:41 that he knew and brought to the Kingdom Hall.
03:43 In a few weeks, he’s got a new suit on,
03:45 got a haircut, clean-shaven, and just—
03:49 This is the effect he has on the people
03:52 that he comes in contact with.
03:55 I love life now.
03:57 I have true friends.
03:59 I know that I have hope for the future.
04:02 Jehovah has seen something in me,
04:05 and he’s brought it to light
04:07 that I am a good person.
04:10 I can be a good human being;  I can help other people;
04:13 I can be loved by Him.
04:19 It’s priceless.

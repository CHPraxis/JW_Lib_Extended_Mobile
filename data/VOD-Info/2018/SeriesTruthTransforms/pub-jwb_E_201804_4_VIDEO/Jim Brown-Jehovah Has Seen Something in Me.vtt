00:05.943 --> 00:08.195
I’m 53 years old.


00:08.195 --> 00:11.948
I was known as a troublemaker.


00:11.948 --> 00:14.993
I was fighting in the bars.


00:14.993 --> 00:17.663
It comes to a point to where
you begin to enjoy it.


00:17.663 --> 00:20.081
He was flat-out scary.


00:20.082 --> 00:23.127
He was a very mean and violent man,


00:23.127 --> 00:27.339
so everybody
kind of kept their distance from him.


00:27.338 --> 00:31.343
My language was detestable. 


00:31.343 --> 00:33.345
I would make grown men blush


00:33.345 --> 00:36.182
by the things that I would say
and things that I would do. 


00:36.182 --> 00:39.142
I was involved with some bikers, 


00:39.142 --> 00:43.064
and they were trying to prospect me
into getting into their club. 


00:43.063 --> 00:45.481
Things were escalating.


00:45.482 --> 00:49.445
We got married very young,
and we were 17.


00:49.445 --> 00:51.822
And we had my oldest daughter.


00:51.822 --> 00:55.159
I was the mom,
and he lived a life


00:55.158 --> 00:59.788
of being out with his friends
and partying.


00:59.788 --> 01:03.500
About that time, my wife started studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


01:03.500 --> 01:07.295
It was a big change for her, 
but she explained the reasoning behind it. 


01:07.295 --> 01:08.922
I couldn’t argue with it. 


01:08.922 --> 01:11.634
She talked me into studying.


01:11.633 --> 01:16.388
I studied from 20 years old to 30. 


01:16.388 --> 01:18.056
I had always seen it.


01:18.057 --> 01:19.517
I had always seen that it was good. 


01:19.517 --> 01:21.394
I knew that this was where I needed to be. 


01:21.393 --> 01:25.271
Somehow, I just could never break free 
of the person that I was.


01:25.272 --> 01:27.274
My mom always raised us in the truth, 


01:27.273 --> 01:29.276
growing up, and that’s what we knew. 


01:29.277 --> 01:30.652
So, then, to see my dad, 


01:30.652 --> 01:33.114
where he was so different


01:33.113 --> 01:36.116
but yet believed it to be the truth, 


01:36.117 --> 01:39.995
and then to see that his lifestyle 
didn’t do him any good 


01:39.995 --> 01:42.665
was kind of a good example


01:42.665 --> 01:45.000
of a bad example, if that makes sense.


01:47.335 --> 01:49.380
I was afraid of the change. 


01:49.380 --> 01:52.340
People accepted me for who I was, 


01:52.340 --> 01:56.970
being the tough guy, being Jimmy Brown.


01:56.970 --> 01:58.388
The scripture comes to mind:


01:58.388 --> 02:01.433
“I planted, Apollos watered, 
but God kept making it grow.” 


02:01.433 --> 02:03.768
Many brothers have studied with Jim 


02:03.768 --> 02:06.105
from time to time over the years. 


02:06.105 --> 02:10.025
I just happened to be the one 
at the time in his life 


02:10.025 --> 02:14.000
when he was taking the truth
and running with it.


02:15.363 --> 02:17.573
I wanted to be a better person. 


02:17.573 --> 02:20.493
I truly knew that this was just


02:20.493 --> 02:23.000
not the way of life that I wanted anymore.


02:25.040 --> 02:27.125
He changed his friends; 
he changed his life; 


02:27.125 --> 02:29.127
he changed his dress and grooming; 


02:29.127 --> 02:31.672
he changed his speech patterns; 


02:31.672 --> 02:34.634
he changed the way he was a grandfather; 


02:34.633 --> 02:37.093
he changed the way he was a father; 
he changed the way he was a husband. 


02:37.093 --> 02:40.000
Everything changed about him.


02:42.307 --> 02:44.309
I knew the work that Witnesses do


02:44.308 --> 02:46.311
—going out door to door talking to people. 


02:46.312 --> 02:47.897
I thought I could never do that. 


02:47.897 --> 02:49.565
Whoa! 
Me, going door to door? 


02:49.565 --> 02:52.067
I’m going to run into people that I know, 


02:52.067 --> 02:54.654
that I drank with for years and years. 


02:54.653 --> 02:57.530
How can I face them now? 


02:57.530 --> 02:59.533
I had always told my wife, 


02:59.533 --> 03:01.535
“It would be much easier for me 


03:01.535 --> 03:04.203
to become a Witness if I didn’t live here.” 


03:04.203 --> 03:07.081
But how wrong I was 


03:07.082 --> 03:09.835
because what a witness my changes have been 


03:09.835 --> 03:12.000
to so many people in town.


03:15.257 --> 03:17.384
One of my favorite things to do 


03:17.383 --> 03:21.263
is bridge witnessing with my granddaughter. 


03:21.263 --> 03:24.766
People are fishing on the bridge
—some have been there all night. 


03:24.767 --> 03:26.769
I even have return visits that I do 


03:26.768 --> 03:28.936
because people regularly 
come down on the weekend 


03:28.937 --> 03:30.939
to fish on the bridges. 


03:30.938 --> 03:32.941
I seize every opportunity. 


03:32.942 --> 03:34.902
My kids laugh at me.


03:34.902 --> 03:37.612
He’ll witness to anybody, anytime, anywhere.


03:37.612 --> 03:41.367
You’ll see some raggedy-taggedy,
old, rough guy


03:41.367 --> 03:43.910
that he knew
and brought to the Kingdom Hall. 


03:43.910 --> 03:45.912
In a few weeks,
he’s got a new suit on,


03:45.912 --> 03:49.709
got a haircut,
clean-shaven, and just—


03:49.708 --> 03:52.293
This is the effect he has on the people 


03:52.293 --> 03:55.338
that he comes in contact with.


03:55.338 --> 03:57.340
I love life now. 


03:57.340 --> 03:59.342
I have true friends. 


03:59.342 --> 04:02.012
I know that I have hope for the future. 


04:02.012 --> 04:05.599
Jehovah has seen something in me, 


04:05.598 --> 04:07.600
and he’s brought it to light 


04:07.600 --> 04:10.228
that I am a good person. 


04:10.228 --> 04:13.731
I can be a good human being; 
I can help other people; 


04:13.732 --> 04:17.000
I can be loved by Him. 


04:19.153 --> 04:34.691
It’s priceless.

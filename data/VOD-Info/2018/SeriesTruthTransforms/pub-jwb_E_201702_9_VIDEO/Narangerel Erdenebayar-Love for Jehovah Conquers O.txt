00:04 My name is Narangerel.
00:07 I was born and raised  in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
00:12 My father, my younger brother  and I were in the army.
00:17 During that time,
00:19 I had money  to buy whatever I wanted
00:22 and enjoyed going drinking  with my friends,
00:25 which made me feel better
00:28 —at times even satisfied and happy.
00:31 But my stressful life quickly returned.
00:37 One of my best friends started to study
00:40 the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:42 She used to give me tracts
00:44 and talk about Jehovah often.
00:47 But I never read them.
00:49 One day when I was feeling  really down,
00:55 I wondered what was in those tracts
00:58 and decided to read them.
01:13 I really liked what I read.
01:21 I wanted to know more about it,
01:23 so I called my friend and said,
01:25 “Can you please  teach me about the Bible?”
01:27 Then I started to study the Bible
01:30 and go to the meetings.
01:32 At one meeting,  I heard,
01:34 “Jehovah God listens and answers  his servant’s prayers.”
01:38 This truth touched my heart.
01:41 I decided to learn more about God
01:44 and to cultivate  a close relationship with him
01:47 and to worship him.
01:50 I told my father about my decision  to retire from the military.
01:55 Of course,  he didn’t want to accept it;
01:57 he tried everything to stop me.
02:01 I felt bad that I was  letting my family down.
02:07 But I really loved Jehovah.
02:13 I never looked back.
02:18 But I had another obstacle  to overcome.
02:22 I lived with my boyfriend.
02:26 He never accepted the Bible truths.
02:30 I loved both Jehovah and him.
02:34 I didn’t want to lose either of them.
02:37 So I prayed to Jehovah,
02:39 “Please help me  that he legally marries me
02:43 and let me be a servant of you.”
02:46 I did everything I could do.
02:49 But he said,  “If you don’t leave this religion,
02:53 I will never marry you.”
02:58 Later, he told me,
03:00 “I am going abroad;  come with me.”
03:05 To be honest,
03:07 I thought I could go  with him and get married
03:11 —then become a servant of God.
03:16 But I prayed to Jehovah,
03:18 “Please help me  to make the right decision.”
03:22 Then I realized
03:24 that I had to cut off the relationship
03:26 with him who didn’t want to marry me.
03:36 I cried until I had no tears left.
03:42 I really loved him.
03:44 But my love for Jehovah  was much stronger.
03:50 I was surprised at myself  that I made this decision.
03:58 In March 2008 I was baptized,
04:02 and I started regular pioneering  from that December.
04:07 I was appointed to be  a special pioneer in August 2010,
04:12 and I’m joyfully serving  in the city of Darkhan.
04:25 I’m still single,
04:27 but now I have many friends
04:30 who love Jehovah and care for me.
04:34 I have more self-respect than before.
04:59 For me,  the real satisfaction and happiness
05:04 come from working  with Jehovah and serving him.

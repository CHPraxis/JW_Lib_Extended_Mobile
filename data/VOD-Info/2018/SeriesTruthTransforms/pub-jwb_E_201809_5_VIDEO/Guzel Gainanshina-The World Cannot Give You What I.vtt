00:05.234 --> 00:08.612
‎I lived in the north, 
with the glorious dark, starlit sky 

00:08.612 --> 00:10.698
‎and the beauty of fir trees. 

00:10.698 --> 00:13.158
‎I thought it was 
the most wonderful place in the world.

00:13.158 --> 00:16.161
‎My mom was always drawing 
my attention to the beauty of creation. 

00:16.996 --> 00:19.206
‎And she always told me, 

00:19.206 --> 00:22.209
‎“My daughter, it’s so important 
to live your life in the right way.”

00:22.209 --> 00:24.211
‎And the questions 
that stayed with me were:

00:24.211 --> 00:26.547
‎‘So why are we alive? 

00:26.547 --> 00:30.426
‎Why is there so much 
suffering, injustice, pain?’ 

00:30.426 --> 00:33.470
‎When I was 18, 
I took up a form of karate 

00:33.470 --> 00:35.681
‎known as Kyokushinkai. 

00:37.683 --> 00:41.020
‎Just imagine a large number 
of people in kimonos, standing in rows 

00:41.020 --> 00:43.105
‎bravely and without a shadow of fear, 

00:43.105 --> 00:46.066
‎working on improving their blows 
and striving to progress. 

00:46.066 --> 00:49.361
‎I thought: ‘This is it! 
This is what I’ve been looking for!’ 

00:49.361 --> 00:51.906
‎I set the goal of reaching 
the next world championships, 

00:51.906 --> 00:53.908
‎winning a high place, 

00:53.908 --> 00:56.785
‎and immortalizing myself 
so that my name would remain 

00:56.785 --> 00:58.704
‎and generations would remember me. 

01:03.417 --> 01:06.587
‎Among those sportsmen, although I saw 
a lot of nice words and slogans, 

01:06.587 --> 01:09.423
‎not everything was 
as pure as I’d hoped for. 

01:11.675 --> 01:14.345
‎And then on one occasion, 
I was sitting down 

01:15.429 --> 01:17.431
‎and feelings of emptiness 

01:17.431 --> 01:20.184
‎just wouldn’t leave me alone. 

01:20.184 --> 01:22.478
‎And for the first time in my life, 

01:22.478 --> 01:24.480
‎I talked to God. 

01:24.480 --> 01:26.523
‎And then I prayed: 

01:26.523 --> 01:29.234
‎“I don’t understand you. 

01:29.234 --> 01:32.821
‎“Why is there 
so much beauty in the world 

01:32.821 --> 01:35.366
‎“and yet so much suffering? 

01:36.367 --> 01:38.494
‎“Is that really what you want 

01:38.494 --> 01:40.162
‎—for us to live like this?” 

01:40.162 --> 01:43.457
‎I prayed, I guess, 
for about four hours. 

01:43.457 --> 01:46.543
‎You know, the strongest feeling 
of emptiness and loneliness 

01:47.461 --> 01:50.089
‎is that of a creation 

01:50.089 --> 01:51.674
‎without its Creator. 

01:51.674 --> 01:54.468
‎And I was so lonely at that time. 

01:56.428 --> 02:00.391
‎And a while afterwards, 
there was a knock at my door. 

02:00.391 --> 02:04.478
‎It was Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

02:06.522 --> 02:08.065
‎I started studying the Bible. 

02:08.065 --> 02:09.608
‎It was so wonderful! 

02:11.652 --> 02:14.655
‎On one occasion, 
the sister who studied with me 

02:14.655 --> 02:16.657
‎looked up at me, 
and when she looked at those bruises 

02:17.741 --> 02:19.743
‎and those beaten-up knuckles, 

02:21.245 --> 02:24.248
‎she took a deep breath 
and shook her head. 

02:24.248 --> 02:25.874
‎I said, “Is there something wrong?” 

02:26.959 --> 02:29.586
‎She said, 
“You know, I’m in great pain.” 

02:29.586 --> 02:32.464
‎I said, “Why are you in pain?” 

02:32.464 --> 02:33.590
‎She said: “Well, 

02:33.590 --> 02:36.135
‎“I’m looking at 
your hands, your elbows,

02:36.135 --> 02:38.012
‎“your battered legs, all of that. 

02:38.012 --> 02:41.223
‎Doesn’t it hurt?” 

02:41.223 --> 02:43.934
‎I said, “Well, yes.” 

02:43.934 --> 02:48.647
‎And she said, “You know, 
it hurts me to see you in pain.”

02:48.647 --> 02:52.276
‎And I started to understand 
that Jehovah is the true God 

02:52.276 --> 02:54.611
‎and that this really was the truth. 

02:55.529 --> 02:57.156
‎It was difficult. 

02:57.156 --> 03:01.118
‎The pressure from relatives 
and friends was very strong. 

03:01.118 --> 03:03.203
‎But the most difficult thing 

03:03.203 --> 03:06.415
‎that I had to battle with 
was my strong attachment to karate. 

03:07.708 --> 03:10.210
‎Just a year remained 
until the world championships. 

03:10.210 --> 03:11.837
‎I had prepared for them. 

03:11.837 --> 03:16.133
‎I had been working 
toward that goal for five years. 

03:16.133 --> 03:19.053
‎Glory can seem really sweet 

03:19.053 --> 03:23.932
‎when you are the victor, 
when your opponents fall to the ground. 

03:28.103 --> 03:29.897
‎So I flew to the world championships. 

03:29.897 --> 03:32.399
‎When I made it to the last four winners 

03:32.399 --> 03:35.402
‎and I had to fight for third place, 

03:35.402 --> 03:37.613
‎I wanted to ask my trainer 
to let me stop. Why? 

03:37.613 --> 03:41.700
‎Because I couldn’t feel 
a single place on my body 

03:41.700 --> 03:43.535
‎—everything was beaten up. 

03:43.535 --> 03:44.870
‎But he said: 

03:44.870 --> 03:48.791
‎“You know, we love you so much. 
Go for it!”

03:48.791 --> 03:52.669
‎And at that moment, 
it felt as though I was weighing love 

03:52.669 --> 03:54.129
‎—the world’s love 

03:54.129 --> 03:56.632
‎and the love of Jehovah’s organization. 

03:56.632 --> 03:59.051
‎It seemed to me 
that the world was saying: 

03:59.051 --> 04:02.638
‎“We love you. 
Now just go and die!”

04:02.638 --> 04:05.140
‎But the love in the organization says, 

04:05.140 --> 04:07.351
‎“It hurts me to see you in pain.” 

04:07.351 --> 04:11.730
‎I realized that the world 
can’t give you what it doesn’t have. 

04:11.730 --> 04:13.982
‎It doesn’t know how to love. 

04:13.982 --> 04:15.984
‎But, nevertheless, I went to the fight 

04:15.984 --> 04:18.779
‎and became the bronze medalist. 

04:20.614 --> 04:24.159
‎And when I stood 
on the podium of glory, 

04:24.159 --> 04:28.288
‎I understood that glory 
among people who don’t love you 

04:28.288 --> 04:30.499
‎weighs no more than emptiness. 

04:31.583 --> 04:34.002
‎If a person dedicates his life 

04:34.002 --> 04:36.421
‎to glorifying himself,
he will always meet 

04:36.421 --> 04:39.216
‎with disappointment and emptiness.

04:39.216 --> 04:42.636
‎So I made the firm decision 
to escape from karate. 

04:43.554 --> 04:45.597
‎I started preaching, 
and I was baptized in 2005 

04:45.597 --> 04:48.392
‎at the summer convention in Kurgan. 

04:50.978 --> 04:53.063
‎Later, I started full-time service. 

04:53.063 --> 04:57.192
‎I learned the Tatar language 
so that I could serve in that territory.

04:59.236 --> 05:01.238
‎Now, when in the evenings 

05:01.238 --> 05:05.284
‎I look up at the starry sky, 
I feel not hopelessness, 

05:05.284 --> 05:07.536
‎but tremendous joy 

05:07.536 --> 05:10.747
‎because I know who is behind it all: 

05:10.747 --> 05:25.118
‎our loving Creator, Jehovah God.

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My father was a self-made factory owner. 

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He started a business working 
with rubber and plastics,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we led a financially comfortable way of life.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in the middle of the 1970’s,

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.170 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎things started going badly with his work. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For this reason,

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he fell into a depression, 
and he committed suicide. 

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was a great shock.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I went to the wall and wrote the words

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“He lives.” 

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:43.272 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I didn’t want to believe that from that day on,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I wouldn’t see my father again.

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At the age of about ten, I began to develop

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎strong antireligious tendencies. 

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:57.369 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And later, at the age of 17,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.414 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I also expressed them by participating

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the most important incident

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the student movement 
against the military junta

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that was prevailing in Greece 
and ruling the country. 

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:14.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I became a member of the Communist Party.

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I went to Santorini and started a business. 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I opened a bar. 

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Of course, all this included unsavory things

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎like immorality, drugs,

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and plenty of alcohol.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A few months later, 
I left to study in Germany. 

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was the first time I met 
a brother engaging in street work. 

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.160 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎People would approach him,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and some would swear; 
some even spat at him. 

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It impressed me immensely

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:46.251 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how he stood calmly 
and accepted this treatment. 

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had interesting conversations.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My studies ended, and I returned to Greece

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:55.010 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to take on the responsibility of the factory. 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I finished my studies in Germany,

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I left with a sense of deep respect

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.852 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The influence of my friends

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.942 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎led me to go into the military,

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:13.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and there I saw a huge amount of corruption. 

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.823 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The hope I had that we humans

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would be able to succeed 
without external help 

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:20.536 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—without God—
began to collapse, 

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then the things I had heard

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from Jehovah’s Witnesses
suddenly came to my mind.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The same afternoon, 
I sought out a family friend,

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the mother of a childhood friend, named Lily. 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said to her, “Please give me a Bible

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and some Bible study publications
because I want to study them.” 

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:43.684 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I read everywhere,

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:46.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and anything that I didn’t understand,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I wrote down in a notebook. 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got to the point, in just a few days,

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where I had written down 80 to 90 questions. 

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:56.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Harry impressed me

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because every time I asked him a question,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:01.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he gave me the answer from the Bible. 

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:05.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That convinced me that I’d found the truth. 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So in that moment,

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I decided to leave the military 
and to quit smoking.

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A few months passed by,

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where I was occupied mostly with the factory,

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until I recognized

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that for me to make progress in the truth,

00:03:22.556 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had to sell my shares in the factory. 

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And on July 7, 1984, I was baptized.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The authorities
—the police, the mayor,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the health inspectors—
began to demand money

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:38.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that I could keep the bar open.

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:44.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I refused all the things they asked of me,

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:46.455 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and so the war became harder

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until one night when I went 
to open the door to enter my home;

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I heard a tramping from behind,

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I tried to turn and see,
and as I turned,

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:00.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was hit in the face. 

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:02.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During that time,

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.099 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when all of this was happening, 
my brother Dimitris arrived.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As brothers, 
we never really had a relationship. 

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When he came to Santorini 
and began to talk to me

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and help me understand 
what was happening to me,

00:04:18.946 --> 00:04:23.575 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I realized that this was a different Dimitris. 

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:26.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I said to him, “I want us 
to start studying the Bible together.” 

00:04:26.995 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had the Bible with me 
almost everywhere I went

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:31.959 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that I could read it. 

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:36.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I realized that Jehovah was helping me 
to understand what I was living for. 

00:04:36.797 --> 00:04:39.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He was helping me to understand

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that I could have a real goal, a purpose,

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and a hope.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:49.059 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On the day of my baptism,
I felt that I was drawing closer to Jehovah. 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I felt like my smile went from ear to ear. 

00:04:54.982 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And now with Lydia,

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I have the great joy of serving 

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:02.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Romany territory. 

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:05.367 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We enjoy very nice Bible studies. 

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:07.411 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is truly something 

00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that shows you Jehovah’s love,

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎interest, and affection

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.585 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—things that I had felt 

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many years ago 
when I studied with my brother.

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:20.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Today, my brother and I 
love each other very much.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:24.303 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is a relationship characterized

00:05:24.303 --> 00:05:26.638 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by brotherly love

00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:30.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as it is expressed in the Bible. 

00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:32.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We are very close to each other. 

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:35.063 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is really a change. 

00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now we are truly brothers!

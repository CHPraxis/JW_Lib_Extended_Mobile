00:09.978 --> 00:12.645
It was a really great privilege 
for us as Bethelites 


00:12.645 --> 00:15.103
to be able to study for six days. 


00:15.103 --> 00:17.978
The Governing Body 
giving us time to study more


00:17.978 --> 00:20.686
about Jehovah’s qualities was tremendous 


00:20.687 --> 00:22.770
to help build our spirituality.


00:22.770 --> 00:24.770
For many Bethelites, 


00:24.770 --> 00:27.437
this was like a gift from Jehovah 


00:27.437 --> 00:30.604
because they had never attended before. 


00:30.603 --> 00:31.853
In fact, one couple 


00:31.853 --> 00:34.561
who had been 50 years in full-time service 


00:34.562 --> 00:37.000
had never attended the pioneer school before.


00:38.895 --> 00:41.062
I’d been invited twice before, 


00:41.062 --> 00:45.479
but unfortunately, 
both times I wasn’t able to go. 


00:45.478 --> 00:47.770
I felt like Jehovah 
was giving me a third chance, 


00:47.770 --> 00:50.000
and this time I wouldn’t miss it.


00:51.062 --> 00:53.562
At first, you feel a little like, 


00:53.562 --> 00:55.645
this is strange; 


00:55.645 --> 00:57.645
you’re at Bethel; 
you’re not out pioneering. 


00:57.645 --> 00:59.895
But then, 
when you’ve gone to the school 


00:59.895 --> 01:03.395
and you’ve seen what the school 
actually does for your ministry, 


01:03.395 --> 01:05.478
it was really— 


01:05.478 --> 01:06.811
You can see why the Governing Body— 


01:06.812 --> 01:10.645
It was such a kind gift for them 
to give us this privilege of coming.


01:10.645 --> 01:13.478
You’re surrounded by people 
who have been pioneers for years; 


01:13.478 --> 01:16.645
some have been to Gilead; 
some have been in the traveling work; 


01:16.645 --> 01:19.103
some have conducted 
pioneer schools themselves. 


01:19.103 --> 01:22.311
It’s the best.


01:22.312 --> 01:25.229
Even though they’re 
in this spiritual environment, 


01:25.228 --> 01:27.520
they need to be upbuilt.


01:27.520 --> 01:30.228
As Bethelites, 
we go out in service 


01:30.228 --> 01:32.853
not as much as we did 
when we were pioneering. 


01:32.853 --> 01:35.811
So being able to have 
an effective use of our time 


01:35.812 --> 01:38.270
in the ministry makes a big difference.


01:38.270 --> 01:41.978
You learn a lot about the field ministry 
in pioneer school. 


01:41.978 --> 01:43.895
So in a month when 30 hours was an option, 


01:43.895 --> 01:46.228
I applied to auxiliary pioneer 


01:46.228 --> 01:49.561
and I also tried to participate 
a lot in the ministry on weekends. 


01:49.562 --> 01:52.000
This way I was able 
to prepare for the school.


01:54.312 --> 01:56.520
I think that every Christian 
needs to have goals, 


01:56.520 --> 02:00.270
and even for us serving in Bethel, 
we need goals. 


02:00.270 --> 02:02.437
So the main thing I learned from the school 


02:02.437 --> 02:04.395
is that even while working in Bethel, 


02:04.395 --> 02:06.353
I can do more for the congregation 


02:06.353 --> 02:08.270
and make a bigger effort in the ministry.


02:08.270 --> 02:11.103
After the pioneer school, 


02:11.103 --> 02:13.770
I realized I needed to cultivate 


02:13.770 --> 02:16.103
more humility in my Bethel service 


02:16.103 --> 02:19.686
and the field ministry.


02:19.687 --> 02:21.604
Because there’s so much spiritual food 


02:21.603 --> 02:23.520
available at Bethel, 


02:23.520 --> 02:25.978
it can become easy to neglect personal study. 


02:25.978 --> 02:28.561
Listening to the deeply meditated comments 


02:28.562 --> 02:32.145
from the students 
and the instructors really stimulated me 


02:32.145 --> 02:34.562
to also meditate more deeply.


02:34.562 --> 02:36.145
During the school, 


02:36.145 --> 02:38.478
I had to study more than usual, 


02:38.478 --> 02:40.728
so I had to set aside more time for reading 


02:40.728 --> 02:42.395
so as to be well-prepared for class.


02:42.395 --> 02:44.395
It was really practical for me 


02:44.395 --> 02:46.395
to improve my ministry, 


02:46.395 --> 02:48.312
and it was really nice 
because with this new school, 


02:48.312 --> 02:49.812
we had a demonstration 


02:49.812 --> 02:53.000
of what we have to avoid 
and what is good to do.


02:54.478 --> 02:58.186
There was a demonstration 
about what not to do on a Bible study, 


02:58.187 --> 03:01.145
and I saw myself doing some of those things. 


03:01.145 --> 03:03.395
So I realized that I really needed 


03:03.395 --> 03:05.937
to get better at conducting Bible studies.


03:05.937 --> 03:09.312
I remember one demonstration that taught us 


03:09.312 --> 03:13.000
how we can witness informally 
in a supermarket line, for example. 


03:15.270 --> 03:17.437
That demonstration 
gave me more confidence 


03:17.437 --> 03:20.312
to witness informally.


03:20.312 --> 03:22.354
In the school,
we learned a lot about Jesus


03:22.353 --> 03:25.061
—how he was hardworking, zealous, 


03:25.062 --> 03:29.145
and showed genuine interest 
in the people around him. 


03:29.145 --> 03:31.895
That example helped me 
to be more hardworking and zealous, 


03:31.895 --> 03:34.520
as well as to be more approachable 
to those whom I work with.


03:34.520 --> 03:36.520
That’s why we’re here in Bethel


03:36.520 --> 03:38.812
—it’s to support the preaching work. 


03:38.812 --> 03:41.229
So it doesn’t matter what assignment we have. 


03:41.228 --> 03:42.561
In a way, it’s connected to that.


03:42.562 --> 03:45.187
The fruitage of the spirit 
is good not just for the ministry 


03:45.187 --> 03:49.000
but it’s good for everything in everyday life 
toward our brothers and sisters.


03:51.020 --> 03:54.000
Love is such an important quality 
for Bethelites. 


03:55.395 --> 03:57.187
I work in the Computer Department, 


03:57.187 --> 03:59.312
but I don’t treat computers with love. 


03:59.312 --> 04:01.687
But the school strengthened my determination 


04:01.687 --> 04:04.000
to treat my brothers and sisters with love.


04:05.353 --> 04:07.395
Out of all the other schools I’ve attended, 


04:07.395 --> 04:09.687
this school had the most impact on my life. 


04:09.687 --> 04:12.479
In just one week, 
it strengthens our faith, 


04:12.478 --> 04:15.478
widens our view of things, 
trains our conscience, 


04:15.478 --> 04:17.603
and deepens our love.


04:17.603 --> 04:19.520
It definitely 


04:19.520 --> 04:21.770
stimulated the pioneer spirit. 


04:21.770 --> 04:23.520
Even though we’re not pioneers, 


04:23.520 --> 04:25.770
it helped us to understand 


04:25.770 --> 04:28.520
the importance of the pioneer service 


04:28.520 --> 04:31.312
and how it contributes 
to our overall joy 


04:31.312 --> 04:32.770
in serving Jehovah. 


04:32.770 --> 04:35.562
So that’s something 
that we would never want to neglect. 


04:35.562 --> 04:39.895
We really appreciated 
the emphasis that was placed on that 


04:39.895 --> 04:54.417
and how it also helps to keep 
our close relationship with Jehovah.

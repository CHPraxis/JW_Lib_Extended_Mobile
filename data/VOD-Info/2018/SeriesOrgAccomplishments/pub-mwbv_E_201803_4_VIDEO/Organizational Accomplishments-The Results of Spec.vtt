In the first century,

00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle Paul received a vision

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which he was invited
to “step over into Macedonia.”

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul and his traveling companions
eagerly accepted the invitation,

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they enjoyed Jehovah’s rich blessing

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as evidenced in the positive results
they experienced in their ministry.

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Service Committee is as eager

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow the lead of the holy spirit

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Paul was in the first century.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are still many parts of the world

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:44.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where branches need publishers

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “step over”
and help them give a thorough witness.

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To meet the need, the Service Committee
has arranged for such branches

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:56.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive assistance
by means of special preaching campaigns.

00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Local publishers

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exemplary brothers and sisters

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from other lands are invited to participate.

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:10.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, such publishers
who respond to the initial invitation,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
later decide to move to these areas of need.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years,
special preaching campaigns

00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been held in Africa, Asia,

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Europe,
and South America.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have been some of the results
of such special preaching campaigns?

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:31.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the recent past,

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than a million Arabic-speaking refugees

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have fled to Europe.

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:41.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Service Committee arranged
for the Central Europe branch

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold a special preaching campaign
to reach these refugees.

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 600 publishers

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different parts 
of the world participated,

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they distributed
some 30,000 pieces of literature.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the refugees have been
very receptive to the good news,

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:04.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even approaching publishers
at the literature carts and asking:

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can you help us?
What does the Bible actually teach?”

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This special campaign concluded

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an Arabic-language regional convention,

00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was a milestone for the Arabic field.

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:22.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 1,600 attended

00:02:22.325 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 43 different countries.

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Approximately 25 percent
of those in attendance

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were interested persons.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outstanding campaigns
have also been held in Bulgaria.

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2009,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bulgaria reported
a publisher-to-population ratio

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 to 4,600.

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then, four special preaching campaigns
have been held there

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 1,782 publishers

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from countries
throughout Europe participated.

00:02:55.525 --> 00:03:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They placed
over 175,000 pieces of literature,

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started 1,775 Bible studies,

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 8 congregations and 7 groups
have been formed.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider one example:

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before 2010,

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were no Witnesses
in the village of Karlovo.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That year
a special preaching campaign was organized.

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:26.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
a man named Gosho was contacted.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From his own reading of the Bible,

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he realized that the local churches
do not teach the truth.

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he stopped attending church services

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but never stopped praying.

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the campaign,
he met Jehovah’s Witnesses on the street.

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to talk with him about the Bible,

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:49.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he interrupted them and asked,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe that Jesus is equal to God?”

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers answered, “No.”

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe that God is a trinity?

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you collect a tithe?”

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:05.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers again answered, “No.”

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then you are welcome in my home,”
said Gosho.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, a Bible study was started

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with him and his wife, Ivanka,

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their son, Bogomil.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both Ivanka and Bogomil

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are now baptized.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Senegal has a vast untouched territory.

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2015,

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the country’s publisher-to-population ratio

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was 1 to more than 12,000.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years,
the Service Committee arranged

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for three special preaching campaigns
in Senegal.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister from Portugal asked a householder

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she believed that God
had the power to resurrect the dead.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a ridiculing way,
the woman replied:

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You mean my dead husband

00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who’s been dead a long time
will come out of the grave?

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this what you are telling me?”

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:05.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister answered:

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what God has promised to do.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will resurrect him alive in the flesh.”

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing that the sister was serious,
the woman asked,

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it really possible?”

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister answered, 
“It is written in God’s Word.”

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With great joy,

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the woman started to dance.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister highlighted information
on the resurrection

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>Listen to God</i>  brochure.

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the woman started dancing with joy.

00:05:39.022 --> 00:05:43.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Romania,
there are some four and a half million people

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who live in unassigned territories.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:48.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During a two-month campaign,

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:53.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publishers covered 1,359 localities

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a population of 1.8 million.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers started
more than 1,000 Bible studies.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is just one experience:

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Costel and Luminitza were very active
in their Orthodox religion.

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Luminitza could not find answers

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to her Bible questions,

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Costel saw much hypocrisy
with the priests.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luminitza heard about Jehovah’s Witnesses
from her neighbor

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who studied the Bible by telephone
with a Witness relative.

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:26.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the special campaign,

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two brothers knocked on the couple’s door.

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luminitza was happy

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses
had finally come to preach in her village.

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:38.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She immediately accepted a Bible study.

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually,
Costel and their two teenage children

00:06:42.185 --> 00:06:44.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joined in the study.

00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family immediately put into practice
what they learned from the Bible.

00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the family learned on their own

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they told their study conductors:

00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We don’t want to keep sinning
against Jehovah.

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How many other things are we doing
that Jehovah hates?

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us everything that we are doing wrong
so that we can stop!”

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In seven months,

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire family began preaching
with the congregation.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After one month of sharing in the ministry,

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had started three Bible studies
in the village.

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One year after their first contact
with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Costel and Luminitza were baptized

00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:31.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at their first regional convention.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Costel is a ministerial servant,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and both children
are progressing very well spiritually.

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever shared in preaching
in seldom-worked or unassigned territories?

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such concerted efforts have yielded

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great success in many countries.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Brazil branch invited publishers
throughout the branch territory

00:07:55.925 --> 00:07:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to participate in a preaching effort

00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that focused on the thousands
living along the Amazon River.

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 10,000 local brothers
and sisters gave their support.

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:11.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation’s territory,

00:08:11.607 --> 00:08:15.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 400 people requested a Bible study.

00:08:15.044 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of those who participated
in the preaching effort

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
described it as “a life-changing experience,”

00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some decided to move

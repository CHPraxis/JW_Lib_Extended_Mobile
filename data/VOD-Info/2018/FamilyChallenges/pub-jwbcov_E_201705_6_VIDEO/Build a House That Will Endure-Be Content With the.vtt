00:05.358 --> 00:09.070
The biggest challenge for me 
and my family has been illness, 


00:09.070 --> 00:12.992
not having enough money 
to pay for the treatment we need. 


00:12.992 --> 00:16.412
Each week I have to save up enough money 


00:16.412 --> 00:20.000
just to feed my family.


00:23.668 --> 00:26.630
We were deeply saddened by our situation. 


00:26.630 --> 00:29.048
First, it was a challenge 


00:29.048 --> 00:30.716
for us to make ends meet 


00:30.717 --> 00:33.000
because I didn’t have a regular job. 


00:37.057 --> 00:39.685
I also worried 
about how my children would suffer 


00:39.685 --> 00:42.000
if we did not have 
sufficient food and other material needs.


00:50.862 --> 00:53.490
I began to think 
that moving to another country 


00:53.490 --> 00:55.952
was the only way 
to provide for my family. 


00:55.952 --> 00:58.412
As 1 Timothy 5:8 says, 


00:58.412 --> 01:01.000
it is my responsibility to support them.


01:09.715 --> 01:12.092
What kept me from moving to another country 


01:12.092 --> 01:14.470
is my love for Jehovah and for my family. 


01:14.470 --> 01:17.055
As Philippians 1:10 says, 


01:17.055 --> 01:19.642
we should “make sure 
of the more important things,” 


01:19.642 --> 01:25.000
and for my family, 
our spirituality is very important.


01:32.028 --> 01:36.000
The fine advice of an elder strengthened me. 


01:37.075 --> 01:41.000
He asked, 
“Does Jehovah only shower blessings abroad?” 


01:48.128 --> 01:50.463
I remember what he said. 


01:50.463 --> 01:52.465
From then on, 


01:52.465 --> 01:54.968
I realized 
that the most important thing in life 


01:54.968 --> 01:57.345
is our spirituality, 


01:57.345 --> 02:00.807
not the material things 
that we can get from this world, 


02:00.807 --> 02:04.000
for it will also vanish.


02:10.400 --> 02:13.278
A great blessing 
has been keeping our family united 


02:13.278 --> 02:16.000
and happy despite our difficult situation. 


02:17.198 --> 02:20.951
I serve as a ministerial servant 
and an auxiliary pioneer. 


02:20.952 --> 02:23.497
My daughter, Fátima, is a regular pioneer. 


02:23.497 --> 02:27.000
Without a doubt, Jehovah blesses our efforts.


02:28.710 --> 02:30.753
Giving makes me happy. 


02:30.753 --> 02:34.425
Other brothers and sisters 
go through times of need just as we do. 


02:34.425 --> 02:37.135
Thinking of this helps me to focus, 
not on my problems, 


02:37.135 --> 02:41.000
but rather on our brotherhood and Jehovah.


02:44.142 --> 02:46.145
I am deeply convinced 


02:46.145 --> 02:50.273
that we made the right decision as a family. 


02:50.273 --> 02:52.233
And now we are very happy 


02:52.233 --> 02:56.000
despite having little materially 
because I feel content. 


03:00.408 --> 03:02.368
They say: 
If you are content, you are rich. 


03:02.368 --> 03:04.830
And the scripture says 


03:04.830 --> 03:20.825
it is “Jehovah that makes one rich, 
and He adds no pain with it.”

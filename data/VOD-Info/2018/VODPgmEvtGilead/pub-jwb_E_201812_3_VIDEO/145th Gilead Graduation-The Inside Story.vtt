In the past few graduation programs,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had a new feature entitled

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Inside Story,

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to have another “inside story.”

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:17.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the instructors, Brother Trent Lippold,

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now going to present that to us.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From far in the North Atlantic
to the islands of the South Pacific,

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will meet
some cool and colorful brothers

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sisters in this 145th class.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They serve on 5 continents,
represent 31 countries,

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak
more than 45 individual, or different, languages.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s meet our first guest,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s from the Central European branch,
Brother Alex Scholz.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Alex.
Good.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex, I understand in your assignment,

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have quite, how shall we say,
quite an expansive assignment.

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I work with a team
that helps foreign-language circuits.

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:31.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, very nice.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So foreign-language circuits in Germany?

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not just Germany.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Farther.

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Foreign-language circuits
in the Central European branch.

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even a little farther, Trent.

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Alex, you’re going
to have to help me out with this.

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What exactly does your assignment involve?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our team in the Central Europe branch

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works with 22 other branch offices

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to form and coordinate

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign-language circuits that span the continent

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in languages that are assigned to the project

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Service Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:03.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that sounds huge.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There must be a good reason for it.

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:06.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.
Sure, there is.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, as we know, normally a circuit

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consists of a group of congregations

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps a few groups
within one branch territory.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in Europe,
we know we have quite a number of countries

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also a number of branch territories.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened in the past
is that in some languages,

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were foreign-language congregations
or groups that had to be visited

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:32.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a local circuit overseer
who didn’t speak the language.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:35.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was simply
because perhaps in this branch territory,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t have a circuit overseer
who speaks the language

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they didn’t have enough congregations

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to form their own foreign-language circuit

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that branch territory.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:49.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that, of course, poses a challenge
if the CO doesn’t speak that language

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he’s not so familiar
with the territory or that language field.

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, I can see that.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it would be difficult for him to really give
specific direction to the congregation.

00:02:58.127 --> 00:02:59.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the thing.

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some publishers
in these groups perhaps felt isolated.

00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides,
they didn’t necessarily have circuit assemblies

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:09.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or pioneer meetings
in their language or in their vicinity.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right. But I know the Governing Body
made a change about that.

00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:14.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, and that was excellent.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it’s a beautiful project.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 2016, we now have what we call

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:23.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign-language circuits
that span branch territories in Europe.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. Well, how does this work now?

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, imagine Europe,
or perhaps it’s best we take a look at a map.

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:31.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a map of Europe?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK. We have a map.

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Super. Very good.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is how we look at Europe in this project

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Europe without borders.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:39.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All we want to see is,

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:43.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are
the foreign-language congregations and groups?

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe it’s best we can see this
in one example with the Chinese field.

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:47.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we look at all the congregations and groups

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we see them depicted here),

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:56.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and simply what we do
is we group them together

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a number of parameters into circuits.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is regardless of any national borders.

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:08.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what results is all these groups
and congregations are in actual circuits.

00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have their circuit events,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have their pioneer meetings,

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have their circuit overseer
who speaks their language,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they meet together
for circuit assemblies.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More people come together
from various countries.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful atmosphere.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:25.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.
That’s incredible.

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:26.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is the Chinese circuit.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Chinese.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have Russian here with . . .

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:30.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . the 20 circuits
that we have right now that span Europe.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s the Romany field
with growing circuits in Europe.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very interesting.

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how many are we talking about, Alex?

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now we have in the project 115 circuits

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with more than 4,000 congregations
and groups involved.

00:04:48.938 --> 00:04:49.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow.

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to date, 18 languages
have been assigned to the project.

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is remarkable.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what would you say?

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have the brothers and sisters

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in these foreign-language congregations
and circuits been affected?

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:03.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have
very positive reflections from the field.

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:08.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers often appreciate
the fact that they now receive

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:11.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
theocratic care by a circuit overseer

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:14.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who speaks their language,
and that’s a beautiful aspect.

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides that, because of this 
now theocratically borderless Europe,

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we want to call it this way,

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as branch offices
have more opportunity to work together

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to organize conventions in these languages,

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit assemblies, schools, pioneer meetings.

00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:34.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of this furthers the preaching work,
and that’s amazing to see.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s the benefit, isn’t it?
That’s tremendous.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Alex, for us in Gilead,

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:43.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of the instructors of Gilead,
we’ve been in the circuit work.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So circuit work is close to our hearts.

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I’m looking at these huge circuits,

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m asking myself,

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:53.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do these circuit overseers
care for such huge territories?’

00:05:53.136 --> 00:05:54.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it like?

00:05:54.137 --> 00:05:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that’s a very good question

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because these brothers and sisters
work so hard in these fields.

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we have a little video

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that follows one traveling couple,
Brother and Sister Dietrich.

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are traveling in one of the Albanian circuits

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that span branch territories in Europe.

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’d like, we could take a look
at the video and see how they’re doing.

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent.
Let’s look at the video now then.

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many Albanian Witnesses are settled

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:24.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different countries,

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they are not isolated.

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Edlira and I are serving

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of three Albanian circuits in Europe

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that span branch territories.

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serving a multinational circuit

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes extra effort and planning.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But seeing Jehovah’s care for his people,

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter the situation, is worth it.

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re a small congregation in a foreign country.

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:05.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our circuit is now supported
by Albanian-speaking brothers

00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:07.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from several European countries,

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we feel the unity 
in our brotherhood even more.

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:21.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this regional convention,

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters 
are attending from Germany,

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Austria, Belgium, Great Britain,

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Switzerland.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have met many friends
who speak our language.

00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are learning a lot about them

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are encouraged by their examples of faith.

00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:50.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the circuit, those in northern Italy

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are together with others 
in Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.

00:07:56.993 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are united across national borders

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with others who speak Albanian.

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:13.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful, Alex

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:15.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—united in the spiritual paradise—
no borders.

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.
That’s true.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about this, though, Alex.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
some say that language actually divides.

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that goes back to the Tower of Babel.

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some might feel that, well,
by grouping people into language groups,

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re actually dividing people.

00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you answer that?

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know language 
definitely has the potential to divide

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no question.

00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:42.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, honestly,
by the way the organization is using language,

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see the opposite effect taking place.

00:08:45.675 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, this project is not about promoting

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:53.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particular cultures or particular languages.

00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What this project allows us to do

00:08:56.118 --> 00:08:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to reach across man-made borders

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to unite our brothers and sisters
by using their local language

00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:08.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach the true and pure language.

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is unity, as we’ve seen in the video.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we look forward to hearing
about more of those details.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just maybe in conclusion, Alex,
one final thought.

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking about your assignment,
is there one particular thought from Gilead

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I know there’s probably many),
but is there one particular thought

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you would like to especially apply
in your assignment?

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you’re right.
There are many.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe just one
that was repeatedly mentioned in class

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how Jesus worked with others

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never as a superior,
but as a friend, as a confidant—

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open, trusted communication.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s a beautiful example.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just hope that I can pick up
a little bit of this wonderful example

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I have the privilege
to talk to the circuit overseers

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out there in this huge field.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when we talk
to the other responsible brothers

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the other branch offices,
that it is this open, trusted communication

00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as friends and as fellow workers.

00:10:04.487 --> 00:10:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have the same goal
—furthering the preaching work.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a goal I have.

00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:11.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.
It’s a valuable point for all of us.

00:10:11.394 --> 00:10:15.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Alex, may Jehovah richly bless you
and your wife, Tabitha, in your assignment.

00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:18.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our next guest,

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:29.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s Brother Thomas Bohnfeldt
from Greenland.

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Thomas.

00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:34.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, welcome Thomas.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:39.088 --> 00:10:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look very comfortable.

00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank you.
I am.

00:10:43.326 --> 00:10:44.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you call that?

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an anorak.

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
it’s all about staying warm in Greenland.

00:10:50.933 --> 00:10:54.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, actually, this is traditional formal wear,

00:10:54.036 --> 00:10:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is used for special occasions.

00:10:56.372 --> 00:11:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many brothers wear it
at the conventions on the day of baptism.

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is very special.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I like Greenland already;
I can tell you that.

00:11:04.447 --> 00:11:07.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think of Greenland, though,
I’m not thinking green land;

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m thinking ice, snow.

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you are right.
It is really a land of ice and snow.

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:18.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle.

00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The biggest part of the land
is the Greenland Ice Sheet,

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s up to 3,000 meters thick in the center.

00:11:25.968 --> 00:11:29.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from there,
huge icebergs break off out to the sea.

00:11:29.905 --> 00:11:31.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Icebergs like this one.

00:11:31.907 --> 00:11:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that definitely sounds cool to me.

00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what I wonder though is,

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:42.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the people like in Greenland?

00:11:42.718 --> 00:11:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, that’s where the warmth is.

00:11:44.754 --> 00:11:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People in Greenland
are very kind and warmhearted.

00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many speak Danish,

00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the majority
—the native Inuit—

00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak Greenlandic.

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greenlandic—when I think of Greenlandic,
the only thing that comes to mind is long words.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, that’s the first thing
many people notice about Greenlandic.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
we have the title of The Watchtower on two lines.

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:17.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you say it?

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I don’t think I can, actually.

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:22.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you said it so well.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I look at that, though, I wonder,

00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:26.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have spelling contests in Greenland?

00:12:26.562 --> 00:12:28.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we don’t have time for that.

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You and Peninna, do you speak Greenlandic?

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:36.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we do now.
But we are still learning.

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.
How did you learn Greenlandic?

00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:43.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we are originally from Denmark
and brought up in Denmark.

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:45.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, interestingly,

00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents actually were special pioneers

00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they were young in Greenland

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped form a congregation.

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:55.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s very interesting.
That’s a nice spiritual heritage to have.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some years ago,
we visited Greenland as a family,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we see pictures here.

00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:02.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You still look relaxed, Thomas.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, back then I remembered,
‘Perhaps I could serve in Greenland sometime.’

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that thought just—

00:13:09.171 --> 00:13:09.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:10.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I forgot that thought.

00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but then years passed.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to court Peninna,
and when we were engaged to marry,

00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we asked the branch where we could serve.

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:24.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to our surprise,
they asked us to start learning Greenlandic.

00:13:24.286 --> 00:13:28.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we moved to Copenhagen
and took some language courses.

00:13:28.624 --> 00:13:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after three years,
we were sent to Greenland as special pioneers

00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:34.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped support the translation office.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing.

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:39.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s almost like you were following
in your parents’ footsteps, then, to Greenland.

00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:41.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was it an easy adjustment?

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Denmark? Greenland?

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
Denmark and Greenland are very different.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with the help from Jehovah

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also with support from brothers, we adapted.

00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:57.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah,
it looks like you’ve fully adapted, actually.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that your assignment
has changed a little bit over the years.

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:06.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we are at the RTO in Nuuk,
in the Greenlandic RTO.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:11.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are four of us full-time, and we have
more than ten part-time commuters.

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:16.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so that’s more than 14
in the RTO but still a small group.

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a lot of work for a translation office.

00:14:20.676 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there benefits?

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you seen the benefits
from the work you’re doing?

00:14:23.812 --> 00:14:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, definitely.

00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:29.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in Greenlandic,
there’s not much published secularly

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our publications
have been published for many years.

00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they are very well-known.

00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So people really love
when they see our literature.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides that,
our videos in Greenlandic are a great support

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many of the need-greaters
coming to support the ministry in Greenlandic.

00:14:46.769 --> 00:14:47.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I wondered what the ministry was like.

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:51.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we did a little homework on Greenland.

00:14:51.373 --> 00:14:54.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know there are five congregations in Greenland,

00:14:54.209 --> 00:14:56.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 170 publishers,

00:14:56.745 --> 00:15:00.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and around 56,000 people that live in Greenland.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:04.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also understand
that a lot of them live in very remote villages.

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you reach 
those people in these isolated areas?

00:15:08.524 --> 00:15:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, well, that’s all about timing.

00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:11.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timing?

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to help you understand it, we have a video

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:18.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a congregation far north of Nuuk

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the village of Ilulissat,
meaning “icebergs.”

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s have a look,
and let’s visit the icebergs.

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For about seven months of the year,

00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:41.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greenland looks like this.

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:46.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the ice melts,

00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:51.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
signs of life begin to emerge

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers and sisters get moving!

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Danish congregation
in the town of Ilulissat also preaches

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:06.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Greenlandic-speaking people.

00:16:06.515 --> 00:16:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the northernmost congregation

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Greenland.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They travel to many remote villages

00:16:14.456 --> 00:16:16.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spread the good news

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:20.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Greenlandic.

00:16:34.043 --> 00:16:36.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory spans hundreds of miles.

00:16:36.612 --> 00:16:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, they are preaching
in the village of Oqaatsut.

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good to be out of the boat
after their long journey,

00:16:51.694 --> 00:16:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their work is just beginning.

00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:03.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve had good results
in these villages before.

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Sara from a village farther north.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:09.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to study,

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:12.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she lived too far away for a regular visit.

00:17:12.347 --> 00:17:14.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a sister in Ilulissat

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
studied with her over the phone.

00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:24.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would tie in to the meetings
during the long, cold months of winter,

00:17:28.363 --> 00:17:31.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she felt that wasn’t enough.

00:17:31.433 --> 00:17:35.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she moved some 300 miles to Ilulissat.

00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:39.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She remembers the tears at her first meeting.

00:17:39.608 --> 00:17:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sara was now with her spiritual family.

00:17:43.846 --> 00:17:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, she was baptized.

00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:54.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The weather and distances
make it difficult for the brothers and sisters,

00:17:54.923 --> 00:17:58.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they return to these villages year after year,

00:17:59.962 --> 00:18:03.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
searching for more ‘friends of peace’

00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:06.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the vast and isolated regions

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of northern Greenland.

00:18:21.383 --> 00:18:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was fantastic, Thomas.

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it looks like there is
a lot of work to do in Greenland.

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:27.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there is.

00:18:27.556 --> 00:18:31.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And arrangements have been made
so that Sarah and other native speakers

00:18:31.727 --> 00:18:36.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can tie in to the Greenlandic meetings
in Nuuk for some parts of the meeting.

00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:39.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And besides that, at our meetings in Nuuk,

00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also use simultaneous translation

00:18:42.104 --> 00:18:44.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using headphones and radio

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that whether you speak
Danish or Greenlandic,

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can participate and benefit.

00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:18:49.745 --> 00:18:50.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is absolutely amazing.

00:18:50.913 --> 00:18:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you say “wow” in Greenlandic?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll leave that for you.

00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:02.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much for being with us, Thomas.

00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:05.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, again, for you 
and your wife Peninna as well,

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wish you
Jehovah’s blessing in your assignment.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:18.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so far we’ve been talking
about unity and language.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of the students have prepared
a song that addresses just those themes.

00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:26.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s enjoy the song
that they’ve prepared to sing to their classmates.

00:22:42.711 --> 00:22:45.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a beautiful song
sung in the 24 languages

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the heart of their classmates
but with one voice.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our next guests,

00:22:50.385 --> 00:22:53.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meraf and Yohannes Gorems from Ethiopia.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:22:58.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Johnny.

00:22:58.493 --> 00:23:00.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Meraf.

00:23:00.262 --> 00:23:01.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:03.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please.

00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:09.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand they call you Johnny, actually.

00:23:09.604 --> 00:23:12.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Johnny, you and Meraf
have a different assignment.

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you explain what your assignment is?

00:23:14.676 --> 00:23:16.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not Bethelites.

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:19.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve in the circuit work.

00:23:19.014 --> 00:23:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you like Bethelites?

00:23:20.148 --> 00:23:21.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like.

00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:25.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:29.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the circuit work like in Ethiopia?

00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:31.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are the people in Ethiopia like?

00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:35.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ethiopian people
are generally kind, warm,

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:39.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hospitable, open to talking,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and most are religious people.

00:23:42.471 --> 00:23:47.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is easy to start conversations
because they love spiritual matters.

00:23:47.476 --> 00:23:48.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:23:48.643 --> 00:23:51.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there maybe one experience,
one special experience,

00:23:51.413 --> 00:23:53.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stands out to you?

00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:58.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned a circuit
in the southern part of Ethiopia.

00:23:58.386 --> 00:24:01.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two special pioneers served there.

00:24:01.957 --> 00:24:06.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them asked me if I would go with him.

00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a return visit.

00:24:09.131 --> 00:24:11.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two years ago, he met this man

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he wanted to go back again.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait, so this is after two years.

00:24:18.073 --> 00:24:20.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a nice call;
he studied with people there;

00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:22.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now two years later,
he wants to go back.

00:24:22.944 --> 00:24:24.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did he wait so long?

00:24:24.513 --> 00:24:26.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it was too remote.

00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:27.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How remote was it?

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:32.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes three days
from a nearby city to get there.

00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:37.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started by bus,
and we arrived in one small city.

00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:41.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we took a truck, seven to nine hours.

00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:45.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we spent all night on that road.

00:24:47.035 --> 00:24:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sleeping on the road
—OK, there is a picture.

00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:51.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, but I slept well.

00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:57.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I presume you took a truck
because there were no more buses.

00:24:57.212 --> 00:24:59.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the buses end, and now you take the truck.

00:24:59.214 --> 00:25:01.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the truck, you walked?

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I walked the rest of the way.

00:25:03.985 --> 00:25:05.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Short walk?

00:25:05.387 --> 00:25:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Depends what you call short.

00:25:09.558 --> 00:25:13.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If 11 hours is short to you, then yes.

00:25:16.898 --> 00:25:17.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eleven hours?

00:25:17.899 --> 00:25:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was it like
walking 11 hours to this village?

00:25:22.904 --> 00:25:27.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we walked in the jungle, I got scared.

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:30.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I was thinking,

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If something happens here,
how could I get out of this jungle?’

00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could you get out?

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:38.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, so I prayed.

00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:43.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately,
my thoughts changed from fear to boldness.

00:25:43.592 --> 00:25:47.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking
that this is a privilege, like the apostles.

00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:48.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Meraf, you were not with Yohannes.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what were you thinking while he was gone?

00:25:53.602 --> 00:25:55.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean,
this is three days already he was gone.

00:25:55.904 --> 00:25:58.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the hardest part of my life

00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:01.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was no network to contact him.

00:26:01.076 --> 00:26:04.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know whether he
was alive, wounded, or lost.

00:26:04.045 --> 00:26:05.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no idea.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we were in a circuit visit,

00:26:07.682 --> 00:26:11.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I should look strong in front of others.

00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:15.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I couldn’t say anything,
but I was praying and crying a lot.

00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:21.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you reached the village
after your 11-hour walk.

00:26:21.496 --> 00:26:23.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You found the interested person?

00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:27.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.
He had other Bible students.

00:26:27.802 --> 00:26:29.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interested person had Bible students?

00:26:29.204 --> 00:26:30.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interested person.

00:26:30.739 --> 00:26:32.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long did you stay?

00:26:32.474 --> 00:26:37.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My plan was one or two days
to spend there, but I couldn’t.

00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the interest, you couldn’t leave?

00:26:38.947 --> 00:26:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, because of two things.

00:26:40.982 --> 00:26:45.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing: They were very interested,
so I had to stay there.

00:26:47.722 --> 00:26:52.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other thing was our legs were like wood.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like wood?

00:26:53.094 --> 00:26:54.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:26:54.963 --> 00:26:56.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From 11 hours of walking?

00:26:56.064 --> 00:26:57.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eleven hours, yeah.

00:26:57.232 --> 00:27:02.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we arrived there, we became strong.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:04.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our tiredness was lifted

00:27:04.806 --> 00:27:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the interested person
really enjoyed that conversation.

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did you leave the village?

00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sunday
—Sunday morning.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:15.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your legs were feeling better?

00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we spent nine hours.

00:27:18.687 --> 00:27:21.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to one area

00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:24.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we had a telephone,

00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:26.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I could call her.

00:27:26.828 --> 00:27:30.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you walked nine hours to get to a telephone.

00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:32.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that phone call like, Meraf?

00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:35.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I told you,
I wanted to cry because I was so worried.

00:27:35.637 --> 00:27:38.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he called and said my name.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:40.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was so happy, and I started to cry.

00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:44.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s happened since then, after that visit?

00:27:44.612 --> 00:27:46.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what’s happened to them?

00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:50.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of them now have gotten baptized.

00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, one circuit overseer

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:56.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one special pioneer visited them.

00:27:56.858 --> 00:27:58.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a video.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you would like to see them?

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:04.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No maybe.
Let’s have a look at the video, please.

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:09.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our journey begins here in Sodo.

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:13.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sodo has a thriving Amharic congregation

00:28:13.575 --> 00:28:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and three congregations in Wolaita.

00:28:17.212 --> 00:28:20.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, the brothers travel to support the search,

00:28:20.415 --> 00:28:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in villages far away.

00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, their destination 
is the small village of Salaysh.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The journey is long, but the brothers settle in

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy the beautiful countryside.

00:28:43.571 --> 00:28:46.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first stop is Sawla,
where our brothers

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:49.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sisters are waiting for them.

00:28:49.911 --> 00:28:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the end of the line for the bus ride.

00:28:53.782 --> 00:28:56.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How nice it will be to have a good night’s rest.

00:28:58.853 --> 00:29:02.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is time to start walking,

00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:05.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless you can catch a ride on one of these.

00:29:10.064 --> 00:29:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, they cross valleys,

00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:15.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mountains,

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:18.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and rivers
—some small

00:29:18.873 --> 00:29:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some not so small.

00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:24.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, the brothers 
have to wade through the river first;

00:29:24.412 --> 00:29:28.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then the drivers bring the motorbikes across.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:31.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I had this option on my first trip.

00:29:35.156 --> 00:29:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One more stop;

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:41.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
time for a delicious meal
in Layha with the local brothers.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still smell

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:46.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fresh roasted coffee.

00:29:51.673 --> 00:29:54.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, they make it to Salaysh.

00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:58.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How I miss these brothers and sisters!

00:29:58.313 --> 00:30:03.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met this brother years ago on my first visit.

00:30:09.724 --> 00:30:13.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are ten publishers now in Salaysh.

00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They conduct 24 Bible studies,

00:30:16.097 --> 00:30:18.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many are attending the meetings.

00:30:18.433 --> 00:30:23.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To think this all started 
with just one interested person.

00:30:25.273 --> 00:30:29.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do our brothers feel 
to be part of God’s organization?

00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:31.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loved us.

00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of his love, he drew us to him.

00:30:34.282 --> 00:30:37.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made us a part
of the international brotherhood.

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:40.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are very happy, and we thank Jehovah.

00:30:42.457 --> 00:30:45.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank him from our heart.

00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:47.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I am thankful to Jehovah

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:49.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he included these dear friends

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:52.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join him in the search for more sheep.

00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:06.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must be very happy to see those faces.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:31:07.315 --> 00:31:09.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just thinking about that trip,

00:31:09.284 --> 00:31:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you were out there walking in the jungle,

00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:13.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going all of that way,

00:31:13.988 --> 00:31:15.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you learn from that?

00:31:15.857 --> 00:31:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah’s hand

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during that difficult trip.

00:31:21.796 --> 00:31:23.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah carried me.

00:31:23.798 --> 00:31:27.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t fear,
because we saw Jehovah’s hand.

00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt we were in Jehovah’s hand.

00:31:29.804 --> 00:31:30.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful.

00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:31.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Meraf?

00:31:31.639 --> 00:31:34.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Waiting alone,
not knowing what was happening to Yohannes,

00:31:34.676 --> 00:31:37.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you learn from that experience?

00:31:37.078 --> 00:31:40.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I was thinking,

00:31:40.448 --> 00:31:42.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know that Jehovah can protect him.’

00:31:42.717 --> 00:31:46.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was telling myself this,
and that kept me strong.

00:31:46.955 --> 00:31:49.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing Jehovah’s will, Jehovah can protect him.

00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:50.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yohannes and Meraf, thank you so much

00:31:52.727 --> 00:31:55.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your experiences
and being with us on The Inside Story.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:55.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:56.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:32:01.769 --> 00:32:03.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every one of the students has a story.

00:32:03.771 --> 00:32:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a story, and maybe one day,

00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:08.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll all get to hear them.

00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:10.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for today,
we’ve just scratched the surface.

00:32:10.812 --> 00:32:13.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been so encouraging to see the lengths

00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:16.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers and sisters will go
to find ‘friends of peace.’

00:32:16.718 --> 00:32:19.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it has been
very touching to hear the lengths

00:32:19.153 --> 00:32:23.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will go
to find his “little sheep” to bring them back.

00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:27.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look forward to seeing you again
on another episode of The Inside Story.

00:32:27.528 --> 00:32:31.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s all for this time from the 145th class.

00:32:51.185 --> 00:32:55.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’d like to thank all those
involved with producing The Inside Story.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It truly was appreciated by each one of us.

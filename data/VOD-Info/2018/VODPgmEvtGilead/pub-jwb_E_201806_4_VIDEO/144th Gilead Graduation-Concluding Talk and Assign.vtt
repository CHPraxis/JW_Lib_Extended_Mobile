WEBVTT

00:01.685 --> 00:05.288
We go back to Wednesday,

00:05.288 --> 00:09.025
June 23, 1943,

00:09.025 --> 00:11.961
and the principal talk 
of the Gilead graduation

00:11.961 --> 00:13.963
was delivered by Brother Knorr,

00:13.963 --> 00:15.865
who spoke on the subject

00:15.865 --> 00:19.736
“Work, Patience, and Faith.”

00:19.736 --> 00:22.138
Don’t write that down 
because that’s not the theme

00:22.138 --> 00:24.240
that we’re going to consider today.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.911
But we have another member 
of the Governing Body, Brother Sam Herd,

00:27.911 --> 00:30.947
and he’s going to speak 
on the intriguing theme

00:30.947 --> 00:33.583
“Humbly Humble.”

00:39.723 --> 00:42.392
If I should ask you, 
Are you humble students?

00:42.392 --> 00:45.228
and you say yes, then you’re not humble.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.800
But you look humble.

00:54.270 --> 00:56.372
It’s been a good program up until now.

00:56.372 --> 00:58.875
We’ll see what follows.

01:03.780 --> 01:06.182
We all know that we must be humble

01:06.182 --> 01:08.184
through and through.

01:08.184 --> 01:12.322
This is something that Jehovah 
requires of all his servants

01:12.322 --> 01:15.191
—not proud to be humble,

01:15.191 --> 01:18.294
but humbly humble.

01:18.294 --> 01:20.530
That’s what pleases God.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.233
So that’s what we’re going to talk about.

01:23.233 --> 01:25.769
But what do we mean by humble?

01:25.769 --> 01:28.505
Well, it’s lowliness of mind.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.040
Certainly, it’s not pompous

01:31.040 --> 01:34.744
—filled to the gills with self-importance.

01:34.744 --> 01:36.980
Jehovah says at Proverbs 8:13:

01:36.980 --> 01:41.751
“I hate self-exaltation and pride.”

01:42.519 --> 01:45.522
So we want to let that sink into our hearts.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.092
Pride is something that Jehovah hates,

01:49.092 --> 01:53.196
but he is pleased 
with those who are humble.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.933
Now, you’ve increased 
your spiritual knowledge

01:56.933 --> 01:59.302
while attending Gilead School,

01:59.302 --> 02:02.839
but you have not scratched the surface

02:02.839 --> 02:06.276
of what you will know in the future.

02:06.276 --> 02:09.979
Your understanding 
of many things has been sharpened

02:09.979 --> 02:12.715
in these few months that you’ve been here,

02:12.715 --> 02:16.786
and now you are eager 
to tell others about what you’ve learned.

02:16.786 --> 02:18.988
And there’s certainly 
nothing wrong with that;

02:18.988 --> 02:21.090
we can say it’s good.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.294
But here’s a caution:

02:24.294 --> 02:28.498
Be careful;

02:28.498 --> 02:33.503
be extremely careful

02:33.503 --> 02:37.707
not to become a show-off,

02:37.707 --> 02:42.612
standing head and shoulders 
above your brothers and sisters

02:42.612 --> 02:47.116
in your branches 
or in your congregations.

02:47.116 --> 02:51.788
Don’t toot your horn.

02:51.788 --> 02:53.857
“Get someone else to blow your horn

02:53.857 --> 02:56.426
and the sound will carry twice as far,”

02:56.426 --> 02:58.595
said Will Rogers.

02:59.829 --> 03:03.766
Better yet, consider what Jehovah inspired

03:03.766 --> 03:08.771
to be written at Proverbs 27:2:

03:08.771 --> 03:11.274
“Let someone else praise you,

03:11.274 --> 03:14.844
“and not your own mouth;

03:14.844 --> 03:19.249
others, and not your own lips.”

03:19.249 --> 03:21.918
Now, while it may be true

03:21.918 --> 03:26.656
that they may not know as much as you,

03:26.656 --> 03:29.225
what they do know will carry them

03:29.225 --> 03:32.595
through the end of this system of things

03:32.595 --> 03:34.764
into the new world.

03:34.764 --> 03:39.102
Jehovah loves them 
just as much as he loves you.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.771
Now, I heard an experience years ago

03:41.771 --> 03:45.775
about a Bible student 
who was just starting to study.

03:45.775 --> 03:48.711
He knows a few things and loves the truth,

03:48.711 --> 03:50.713
as much as he knows.

03:50.713 --> 03:54.284
Then he comes down sick unto death,

03:54.284 --> 03:58.221
and the doctor at the hospital says, 
“You must have a blood transfusion.”

03:58.221 --> 04:02.725
But he knows enough, 
“No blood for me, no blood transfusion.”

04:02.725 --> 04:05.795
His family is not in the truth, 
“Take that blood, Boy!”

04:05.795 --> 04:07.797
“No. No blood for me.”

04:07.797 --> 04:09.299
Others try to get him to take blood.

04:09.299 --> 04:11.134
“No blood for me.”

04:11.134 --> 04:14.704
And so the doctor operates and is successful;

04:14.704 --> 04:17.206
everyone is happy.

04:17.206 --> 04:21.644
Then his teacher

04:21.644 --> 04:24.847
and others in the congregation

04:24.847 --> 04:27.483
are invited to the hospital.

04:27.483 --> 04:29.652
He has something to say.

04:29.652 --> 04:31.721
What is it?

04:31.721 --> 04:34.624
After they gather around his bed,

04:34.624 --> 04:37.927
they’re thinking 
that something has gone wrong.

04:37.927 --> 04:40.930
He’s going to have to take blood, 
and he’s willing to do it,

04:40.930 --> 04:45.935
when he says, 
“Why is it that we don’t take blood?”

04:49.639 --> 04:52.208
Now, he does not know

04:52.208 --> 04:55.878
that the Gentile Times ended in 1914;

04:57.714 --> 05:01.451
he doesn’t know 
the difference between sovereignty

05:01.451 --> 05:06.222
and all the other things 
that people talk about today.

05:06.222 --> 05:09.058
But he knows the truth

05:09.058 --> 05:12.628
—just a little bit of the truth.

05:12.628 --> 05:16.065
He’s not concerned 
with the vindication of God’s name

05:16.065 --> 05:21.070
and his sovereignty 
—the rightfulness of God’s rule.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.072
He doesn’t know that much,

05:23.072 --> 05:27.443
but he knows enough 
that when his life is on the line,

05:27.443 --> 05:30.880
he’d rather die than break God’s law,

05:30.880 --> 05:35.218
even if he can’t explain that law.

05:35.218 --> 05:37.253
Now, why say all that?

05:37.253 --> 05:40.123
It’s not how much we know 
that pleases Jehovah,

05:40.123 --> 05:43.893
but how we feel about what we know

05:43.893 --> 05:46.162
and how we have allowed that knowledge

05:46.162 --> 05:49.832
to increase our love for Jehovah.

05:49.832 --> 05:53.002
Now, I’m going to invite you 
to open your Bibles, Bible students

05:53.002 --> 05:55.004
—Gilead students.

05:55.004 --> 05:59.876
Let’s turn to Romans.

05:59.876 --> 06:04.647
We’re going to read the 12th chapter.

06:04.647 --> 06:06.649
We’re going to read a couple of verses.

06:06.649 --> 06:07.950
Where are they found?

06:07.950 --> 06:10.420
Well, verse 3 starts us off.

06:10.420 --> 06:14.690
It says: “For through the undeserved kindness 
given to me,

06:14.690 --> 06:18.761
“I tell everyone there among you 
not to think more of himself

06:18.761 --> 06:21.097
“than it is necessary to think,

06:21.097 --> 06:25.068
“but to think so as to have a sound mind,

06:25.068 --> 06:28.771
“each one as God has given to him

06:28.771 --> 06:31.240
a measure of faith.”

06:31.240 --> 06:33.576
There it is.

06:33.576 --> 06:37.246
We can’t get too stuck on ourselves

06:37.246 --> 06:39.348
and how much we know.

06:39.348 --> 06:43.686
That’s not what Jehovah wants out of us.

06:43.686 --> 06:46.789
Now look at verse 16:

06:46.789 --> 06:50.259
“Have the same attitude 
toward others as toward yourselves;

06:50.259 --> 06:53.729
“do not set your mind on lofty things,

06:53.729 --> 06:56.966
“but be led along with the lowly things.

06:56.966 --> 07:01.704
Do not become wise in your own eyes.”

07:02.839 --> 07:05.942
That’s good counsel isn’t it, 
Gilead students?

07:05.942 --> 07:07.944
Excellent counsel.

07:07.944 --> 07:12.882
But, you know, sometimes we need 
a little more than a couple of verses

07:12.882 --> 07:15.051
for it to reach the heart.

07:16.886 --> 07:20.056
We need to know a few more things.

07:20.056 --> 07:25.061
Knowledge has been given to us

07:25.061 --> 07:27.930
in great abundance these few months

07:27.930 --> 07:30.967
that we’ve been here at Gilead School,

07:30.967 --> 07:33.002
and we’ve just loved it.

07:33.002 --> 07:35.004
But at 1 Corinthians 8:1,

07:35.004 --> 07:38.574
it tells us something 
that we want to think seriously about.

07:38.574 --> 07:41.277
It says: “We know we all have knowledge.”

07:41.277 --> 07:43.279
Now, here it’s coming:

07:43.279 --> 07:48.284
“Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.”

07:48.284 --> 07:50.419
Now, you’ve got a lot of knowledge,

07:50.419 --> 07:54.257
so be careful 
that it does not puff you up

07:54.257 --> 07:58.528
so that you stand 
head and shoulders higher

07:58.528 --> 08:02.398
than your brothers 
and sisters in the congregation.

08:02.398 --> 08:06.068
Jehovah loves them 
just as much as he loves you,

08:06.068 --> 08:08.838
who have this advanced knowledge now

08:08.838 --> 08:11.974
because of your schooling.

08:11.974 --> 08:16.212
Be as humble as a little child,

08:16.212 --> 08:21.250
and Jesus tells us a little bit 
about that in Matthew chapter 18.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.686
This is what he said in verses 3 and 4:

08:23.686 --> 08:25.922
“Truly I say to you, unless you turn around

08:25.922 --> 08:27.924
“and become as young children,

08:27.924 --> 08:31.661
“you will by no means enter 
into the Kingdom of the heavens.

08:31.661 --> 08:34.630
“Therefore, whoever will humble himself

08:34.630 --> 08:36.632
“like this young child

08:36.632 --> 08:39.168
“is the one who is the greatest

08:39.168 --> 08:42.405
in the Kingdom of the heavens.”

08:42.405 --> 08:46.909
So we say, humbly be humble.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.346
Jehovah God, the Most High,

08:50.346 --> 08:55.351
the Universal Sovereign, 
“the King of eternity,” is humble.

08:55.351 --> 08:59.322
This is what King David said of him

08:59.322 --> 09:01.457
in Psalm 18,

09:01.457 --> 09:04.961
‘Your own humility will make me great.’

09:06.762 --> 09:11.033
And it’s God’s humility 
that makes us great too.

09:11.033 --> 09:15.771
If Jehovah were not humble, 
we would not be here.

09:15.771 --> 09:20.743
Not one of mankind would be alive.

09:20.743 --> 09:24.714
He’s humble, 
and He has a right to expect humility

09:24.714 --> 09:28.918
out of each and every one of us.

09:28.918 --> 09:33.256
And we need to help 
each other to be humble

09:33.256 --> 09:36.926
—not glorify a human.

09:39.061 --> 09:44.066
So we say this because sometimes 
some of our brothers and sisters

09:44.066 --> 09:46.102
look at us 
—as members of the Governing Body—

09:46.102 --> 09:48.271
as if we’re already angels,

09:48.271 --> 09:51.307
and all you have to do 
is ask our wives if we’re angels.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.343
You’ll get a true story.

09:55.111 --> 09:56.445
We’re not.

09:56.445 --> 09:59.448
We’re just sinners like all the rest of you.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.450
So don’t elevate us

10:01.450 --> 10:04.854
above where we are or what we are.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.557
If we want to elevate anything, 
elevate Jehovah.

10:08.557 --> 10:12.161
Now, that doesn’t mean that we feel

10:12.161 --> 10:14.930
that you have wronged us in some way.

10:14.930 --> 10:16.098
No, you haven’t.

10:16.098 --> 10:17.500
You’re just human.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.336
And as humans, we’re filled with sin

10:20.336 --> 10:22.605
and we get carried away.

10:22.605 --> 10:27.310
But help us to be humble, too,

10:27.310 --> 10:30.913
rather than elevating us.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.916
The Bible tells us of Jehovah:

10:33.916 --> 10:36.285
“He stoops down to look on heaven and earth”

10:36.285 --> 10:38.587
—Psalm 113:6.

10:38.587 --> 10:39.689
What does that mean?

10:39.689 --> 10:41.857
Well, he unbends;

10:41.857 --> 10:44.860
he waives the privilege of rank.

10:46.462 --> 10:48.464
Jehovah does that.

10:48.464 --> 10:53.135
So he’s teaching us 
to waive the privilege of rank.

10:53.135 --> 10:57.139
We’re all brothers; that’s all we are.

10:57.139 --> 11:01.544
We don’t measure up 
as tall as Jesus, we just try to.

11:01.544 --> 11:06.549
We try to dog his steps as best we can.

11:06.549 --> 11:08.818
Follow the example of Jehovah.

11:08.818 --> 11:11.387
He allowed Abraham 
to question His righteousness

11:11.387 --> 11:15.157
in purposing to destroy 
the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

11:15.157 --> 11:17.860
In Genesis chapter 18,

11:17.860 --> 11:21.263
Abraham says, 
‘If there are 50 righteous men,

11:21.263 --> 11:23.399
are you still going to destroy everything?’

11:23.399 --> 11:25.468
He says, ‘No, I will not.’

11:25.468 --> 11:27.470
Then Abraham comes back, ‘45?’

11:27.470 --> 11:29.338
He says, 
‘No, I will not destroy them.’

11:29.338 --> 11:29.939
‘40?’

11:29.939 --> 11:31.107
‘No, I will not.’

11:31.107 --> 11:31.841
‘30?’

11:31.841 --> 11:32.508
‘No.’

11:32.508 --> 11:33.142
‘20?’

11:33.142 --> 11:33.843
‘No.’

11:33.843 --> 11:34.610
‘10?’

11:34.610 --> 11:36.011
‘No.’

11:36.011 --> 11:39.348
OK, Abraham, that’s enough; 
close your mouth.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.520
Now, I added that.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.522
Do you know what the Bible really says?

11:46.522 --> 11:48.991
It says: “When Jehovah 
finished speaking to Abraham,

11:48.991 --> 11:51.627
he went his way”

11:51.627 --> 11:53.829
—still humble.

11:53.829 --> 11:57.032
On a couple of occasions 
He allowed Moses to reason with Him

11:57.032 --> 12:01.470
as if He was another human.

12:01.470 --> 12:06.475
It took humility for Him 
to grant Moses’ pleas, but He did.

12:07.243 --> 12:10.613
Now, what about Jesus? 
Was he humble?

12:10.613 --> 12:12.615
Well, let’s take a look

12:12.615 --> 12:17.052
at Philippians 2:5-8.

12:17.052 --> 12:18.788
Can we do that?

12:18.788 --> 12:22.725
Philippians 2:5-8.

12:22.725 --> 12:25.761
Now, we understand that some of you

12:25.761 --> 12:29.265
do not have your iPad or your Bible,

12:29.265 --> 12:32.735
but that’s all right.

12:32.735 --> 12:34.737
You’ll have time to get it later.

12:34.737 --> 12:39.375
Now, here in the second chapter,

12:39.375 --> 12:44.380
we’re able to read starting with verse 5.

12:44.380 --> 12:47.383
It says: 
“Keep this mental attitude in you

12:47.383 --> 12:49.385
“that was also in Christ Jesus,

12:49.385 --> 12:52.154
“who, although he 
was existing in God’s form,

12:52.154 --> 12:54.523
“gave no consideration to a seizure,

12:54.523 --> 12:56.992
“namely, that he should be equal to God.

12:56.992 --> 13:00.429
“No, but he emptied himself 
and took a slave’s form

13:00.429 --> 13:03.299
“and became human.

13:03.299 --> 13:08.170
“More than that, 
when he came as a man,

13:08.170 --> 13:13.075
“he humbled himself 
and became obedient to the point of death,

13:13.075 --> 13:17.413
yes, death on a torture stake.”

13:17.413 --> 13:21.717
So, yes, Jesus was humble,

13:21.717 --> 13:24.787
and Jesus washed the feet

13:24.787 --> 13:27.189
—the dirty feet— 
of his apostles

13:27.189 --> 13:30.192
to show them how to be humble.

13:30.192 --> 13:35.197
That was a job that a servant 
should have done, or a slave’s job.

13:35.831 --> 13:38.501
He lowered himself in front of them.

13:38.501 --> 13:42.004
Perhaps he was on his knees 
when he washed their feet

13:42.004 --> 13:43.372
—John 13.

13:43.372 --> 13:44.507
Now, why would I say that?

13:44.507 --> 13:47.109
Well, I saw a picture—

13:47.109 --> 13:50.212
I saw a picture

13:50.212 --> 13:55.017
in the office building in Warwick,

13:55.017 --> 13:57.319
a beautiful picture.

13:57.319 --> 14:00.923
Jesus is washing the feet of his apostles.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.491
And where is he at?

14:02.491 --> 14:03.926
He’s on his knees.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.261
Now, the Bible doesn’t say he was on his—

14:05.261 --> 14:06.262
I looked that up;

14:06.262 --> 14:08.864
it didn’t say that in John the 13th chapter.

14:08.864 --> 14:13.869
But, how are you going to wash feet 
if you don’t get down toward the feet?

14:13.869 --> 14:17.072
So there he was 
—on his knees—

14:17.072 --> 14:19.542
teaching them a lesson.

14:19.542 --> 14:22.511
The apostle Paul 
set a fine example of humility.

14:22.511 --> 14:25.814
He called himself ‘a slave of Jesus Christ’

14:25.814 --> 14:28.284
—Philippians 1:1.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.153
Now, if he had not been humble,

14:31.153 --> 14:35.591
he would not have written 
these words that I’m about to read:

14:35.591 --> 14:38.127
“For I know that in me, 
that is, in my flesh,

14:38.127 --> 14:40.396
“there dwells nothing good;

14:40.396 --> 14:42.898
“for I have the desire to do what is fine

14:42.898 --> 14:45.334
“but not the ability to carry it out.

14:45.334 --> 14:48.537
“For I do not do the good that I wish,

14:48.537 --> 14:50.573
“but the bad that I do not wish

14:50.573 --> 14:52.575
is what I practice”

14:52.575 --> 14:55.477
—Romans 7.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.414
And he was given a supernatural vision,

14:58.414 --> 15:02.051
or visions, I should say, 
and revelations.

15:02.051 --> 15:05.688
He was used mightily by Jehovah God.

15:05.688 --> 15:10.059
At Acts 19:11-16,

15:10.059 --> 15:12.795
we’re able to see that.

15:12.795 --> 15:16.632
It says: “And God kept performing 
extraordinary powerful works

15:16.632 --> 15:21.370
“through the hands of Paul,

15:21.370 --> 15:25.808
“so that even cloths and aprons 
that had touched his body

15:25.808 --> 15:27.810
“were carried to the sick,

15:27.810 --> 15:29.812
“and the diseases left them,

15:29.812 --> 15:31.847
“and the wicked spirits came out.

15:31.847 --> 15:35.684
“But some of the Jews 
who traveled around casting out demons

15:35.684 --> 15:40.889
“also tried to use 
the name of the Lord Jesus

15:40.889 --> 15:43.592
“over those who had wicked spirits;

15:43.592 --> 15:46.495
“they would say: ‘I solemnly charge you

15:46.495 --> 15:49.999
“by Jesus whom Paul preaches.’

15:49.999 --> 15:52.001
“Now there were seven sons

15:52.001 --> 15:56.305
“of a Jewish chief priest 
named Sceva doing this.

15:56.305 --> 16:00.309
“But in answer 
the wicked spirit said to them:

16:00.309 --> 16:03.779
“‘I know Jesus 
and I am acquainted with Paul;

16:03.779 --> 16:06.749
“but who are you?’

16:06.749 --> 16:10.886
“At that the man 
with the wicked spirit leaped on them,

16:10.886 --> 16:13.622
“overpowered them one after the other,

16:13.622 --> 16:15.658
“and prevailed against them,

16:15.658 --> 16:19.495
“so that they fled naked and wounded

16:19.495 --> 16:22.631
out of that house.”

16:22.631 --> 16:26.735
Evidently, they were not humbly humble

16:26.735 --> 16:31.740
for Jesus to let them use his name 
to cast out the wicked spirits.

16:31.740 --> 16:36.679
Paul was inspired 
to write 14 of the 27 books

16:36.679 --> 16:38.814
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

16:38.814 --> 16:43.485
Now, he did not get bigheaded, 
but he stayed humble.

16:46.055 --> 16:48.323
He’s not the only humble soul.

16:48.323 --> 16:51.427
Here’s another one: 
Nathan H. Knorr,

16:51.427 --> 16:55.297
the third president 
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society,

16:55.297 --> 16:58.367
wants to visit a member 
of the Writing Department

16:58.367 --> 17:00.436
in the member’s office.

17:00.436 --> 17:04.440
And he stated, that is, Brother Knorr stated,

17:04.440 --> 17:07.543
this—the member’s office—

17:07.543 --> 17:09.945
this is where “the most important

17:09.945 --> 17:13.649
“as well as the most difficult work 
takes place.

17:13.649 --> 17:17.653
That’s why I do so little of it.”

17:17.653 --> 17:20.255
Isn’t that beautiful?

17:20.255 --> 17:22.257
That’s a humble statement.

17:22.257 --> 17:25.828
You know what I say behind it? 
I say “Amen” to it.

17:25.828 --> 17:29.031
I’m on the Writing Committee 
of the Governing Body

17:29.031 --> 17:31.366
for some unknown reason.

17:33.502 --> 17:35.904
I can’t write,

17:35.904 --> 17:38.507
not a lick,

17:38.507 --> 17:40.509
but there I am.

17:40.509 --> 17:43.278
The humility shown by Brother Knorr

17:43.278 --> 17:45.280
made me think back in time

17:45.280 --> 17:47.282
to when a group of traveling overseers

17:47.282 --> 17:49.718
were attending school 
in Crownsville, Maryland.

17:49.718 --> 17:52.054
Brother Ted Jaracz 
was one of the instructors,

17:52.054 --> 17:54.056
and he got up early one morning

17:54.056 --> 17:56.925
and prepared a hot breakfast for all of us.

17:56.925 --> 17:59.595
He did that on his own.

17:59.595 --> 18:01.930
I was one of the instructors,

18:01.930 --> 18:05.567
but it didn’t cross my mind 
to do a thing like that.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.470
Maybe I wasn’t humbly humble,

18:08.470 --> 18:11.974
or if I was, I didn’t show it.

18:16.445 --> 18:18.714
I can’t cook either,

18:18.714 --> 18:21.216
not a lick.

18:23.986 --> 18:26.555
What does it take to be exalted?

18:26.555 --> 18:29.892
Let’s let the Bible answer at Luke 14:11:

18:29.892 --> 18:32.895
“For everyone who exalts himself 
will be humbled,

18:32.895 --> 18:35.731
and whoever humbles himself 
will be exalted.”

18:35.731 --> 18:37.332
What does it take?

18:37.332 --> 18:39.501
It takes humility.

18:39.501 --> 18:42.938
Don’t learn that others are superior

18:42.938 --> 18:44.940
the hard way.

18:44.940 --> 18:48.944
Take a lesson 
from my old hound dog named Booser.

18:50.913 --> 18:54.082
Sometimes he would follow us to town.

18:55.684 --> 18:59.354
And one day, we passed a home

18:59.354 --> 19:02.224
where usually there was 
a little dog that lived there,

19:02.224 --> 19:04.726
but he had died.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.095
And something caught Booser’s nose,

19:07.095 --> 19:09.231
and so Booser 
was sniffing around, sniffing around.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.233
And he went over near the house,

19:11.233 --> 19:15.304
and a big Dalmatian 
came charging around the side of the house,

19:15.304 --> 19:17.306
and he attacked Booser.

19:17.306 --> 19:19.441
Booser put up a fight,

19:19.441 --> 19:22.744
but he lost,

19:22.744 --> 19:25.214
and the Dalmatian won.

19:25.214 --> 19:28.450
Booser tucked his tail between his legs,

19:28.450 --> 19:32.354
and he darted out of there 
like a streak of lightning.

19:32.354 --> 19:34.356
Well, a couple of weeks later,

19:34.356 --> 19:37.993
Booser wanted to go to town 
with us again—walking.

19:37.993 --> 19:40.796
But we noticed that when we got 
to the Dalmatian’s house,

19:40.796 --> 19:42.798
Booser was gone.

19:42.798 --> 19:46.335
Booser took a long trip around the house

19:46.335 --> 19:48.570
and met us downtown.

19:52.808 --> 19:54.810
We’re about to wrap this up.

19:59.548 --> 20:02.050
He was humbly humble.

20:03.919 --> 20:06.755
He viewed the Dalmatian as superior.

20:07.723 --> 20:12.160
Now, students, 
do you get the point of Booser’s example?

20:12.160 --> 20:15.197
View others as superior.

20:15.197 --> 20:18.233
They probably are.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.423
That was a fantastic talk

20:41.423 --> 20:46.228
—and I assure you, 
Sam is a very humble person.

20:46.228 --> 20:48.397
He just can’t cook.

20:52.968 --> 20:57.406
Well, we have a few announcements for you.

20:57.406 --> 21:01.043
First of all, 
you’ll be interested in the attendance.

21:01.043 --> 21:06.014
In Canada, there are 902.

21:06.014 --> 21:10.852
And here in the United States, 9,702

21:10.852 --> 21:15.724
for a total of 10,604.

21:15.724 --> 21:18.593
Now, of course, we know 
that with the streaming many,

21:18.593 --> 21:23.031
many more are going to be looking in 
on the program later.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.702
So it’s going to be a lot more than 10,000.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.405
Now, we’ve had some beautiful expressions

21:30.405 --> 21:34.643
from the branches 
—greetings to our students.

21:34.643 --> 21:37.112
We don’t have time to read all of them.

21:37.112 --> 21:40.248
They will go in the archives 
of the Teaching Committee.

21:40.248 --> 21:42.584
If I can’t read all of them,

21:42.584 --> 21:45.687
I don’t want to read just one or two.

21:45.687 --> 21:48.023
But here are the countries 
that are represented

21:48.023 --> 21:50.592
that have sent beautiful expressions to us:

21:50.592 --> 21:53.161
Angola, Argentina,

21:53.161 --> 21:57.065
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil,

21:57.065 --> 22:01.903
Britain, Bulgaria, Burundi, Canada,

22:01.903 --> 22:05.273
Finland, France, Georgia,

22:05.273 --> 22:09.611
Ghana, Haiti, Hong Kong, Italy,

22:09.611 --> 22:13.648
Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea,

22:13.648 --> 22:16.284
Madagascar, Mozambique,

22:16.284 --> 22:18.854
Netherlands, Nigeria,

22:18.854 --> 22:21.790
Papua New Guinea, Portugal,

22:21.790 --> 22:26.461
Sierra Leone, Thailand, and Ukraine.

22:26.461 --> 22:28.897
And that’s just about 
the end of the alphabet.

22:28.897 --> 22:31.867
So we appreciate all of these greetings

22:31.867 --> 22:34.469
—beautiful expressions of appreciation

22:34.469 --> 22:38.240
from the folks in these branches.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.611
Well, we go back to 1943,

22:42.611 --> 22:46.581
and following the principal talk, 
what happened?

22:46.581 --> 22:49.317
Here’s what we read
—here’s the report:

22:49.317 --> 22:53.055
‘A large case containing the diplomas

22:53.055 --> 22:56.425
‘was opened and put on the podium table.

22:56.425 --> 22:59.594
‘One by one all the students were called

22:59.594 --> 23:02.764
to come forward to receive their diplomas.’

23:02.764 --> 23:06.068
Well, we’re going to follow 
that pattern right now;

23:06.068 --> 23:09.571
that pattern established 75 years ago.

23:09.571 --> 23:13.508
And I’m very happy to have 
Brother David Schafer with me.

23:13.508 --> 23:16.878
If you were present 
for the introductions of the class,

23:16.878 --> 23:21.483
you know what a beautiful job David did 
with all the names of the students.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.919
And so, behold

23:23.919 --> 23:27.989
the 144th class of Gilead.

23:29.257 --> 23:31.860
And first, we have Brother and Sister Abou

23:31.860 --> 23:34.796
who will be returning to the Middle East.

23:41.403 --> 23:45.540
Brother and Sister Aloi 
will be serving in the Middle East.

will be returning to the Netherlands.

25:40.188 --> 25:43.858
Brother and Sister Menjou 
will be returning to Britain.

25:50.165 --> 25:53.835
Brother and Sister Miçani 
will be returning to Albania.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.478
Sister Nguyễn will be returning to Asia.

26:08.483 --> 26:12.921

Brother Ouédraogo will be returning to Benin.

26:34.509 --> 26:38.747
Brother and Sister Pétursson 
will be returning to Denmark.

26:44.152 --> 26:48.556
Brother and Sister Sandy 
will be returning to Sierra Leone.

26:56.364 --> 27:00.368
Brother and Sister Santos 
will be returning to Portugal.

27:06.775 --> 27:11.646
Brother Scarmato 
will be returning to Argentina.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.988
Brother and Sister Stepanov

27:49.150 --> 27:54.289
Brother and Sister Wembalola 
will be serving in Madagascar.

27:59.794 --> 28:04.666
And Sister Wójcik 
will be returning to Poland.

28:25.687 --> 28:27.689
And here they are.

28:46.975 --> 28:51.079
Let’s go back to 1943.

28:51.079 --> 28:54.582
Once all the diplomas 
were handed out, what happened?

28:54.582 --> 28:58.219
Well, the report tells us 
that a representative of the class

28:58.219 --> 29:01.589
read a statement 
expressing the students’ appreciation

29:01.589 --> 29:03.758
for the privilege of attending Gilead

29:03.758 --> 29:06.127
and assuring the Governing Body 
of their loyalty

29:06.127 --> 29:09.130
to Jehovah and his organization.

29:09.130 --> 29:12.033
We’re going to follow the same pattern today,

29:12.033 --> 29:14.936
and Brother Richard Chilton is going to read

29:14.936 --> 29:18.306
a class letter on behalf of the class.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.748
“To the Governing Body.

29:26.748 --> 29:29.050
“Dear Brothers:

29:29.050 --> 29:32.654
“Few things in life 
bring greater satisfaction

29:32.654 --> 29:37.358
“than meaningful discussions 
on spiritual topics with dear friends.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.360
“Over the last five months,

29:39.360 --> 29:41.696
“we have enjoyed the blessing

29:41.696 --> 29:45.900
“of being immersed 
in such discussions on a daily basis.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.537
“As we studied the Bible book by book,

29:49.537 --> 29:53.107
“the examples 
of faithful men and women of the past

29:53.107 --> 29:57.045
“came to life and touched 
our hearts in new ways.

29:57.045 --> 30:01.049
“Reliving the modern-day history 
of Jehovah's organization,

30:01.049 --> 30:03.952
“we marveled at the faith,

30:03.952 --> 30:06.888
“courage, and self-sacrifice

30:06.888 --> 30:09.991
“of those who have gone before us.

30:09.991 --> 30:13.962
“Our skills in the ministry 
were refined through workshops,

30:13.962 --> 30:18.833
“and our desire to share 
in the preaching work intensified.

30:18.833 --> 30:20.969
“As the weeks passed,

30:20.969 --> 30:25.740
“fellow students became our close friends.

30:25.740 --> 30:29.544
“Now, as the class has come to an end,

30:29.544 --> 30:33.548
“tears come to our eyes 
as we think about parting ways,

30:33.548 --> 30:35.817
“but we will treasure the memories

30:35.817 --> 30:38.887
“of the stimulating 
‘interchange of encouragement’

30:38.887 --> 30:41.890
“with our new group of friends.

30:41.890 --> 30:46.427
“And what a blessing to be guided 
by mature, devoted instructors

30:46.427 --> 30:50.965
“who combined 
‘spiritual matters with spiritual words.’

30:50.965 --> 30:55.670
“We are grateful for their loving support 
as they nurtured our spiritual growth,

30:55.670 --> 31:00.675
“and we will never forget their example 
of zeal for God’s Word.

31:00.675 --> 31:05.013
“Getting to know the Bethel family 
has been a real delight

31:05.013 --> 31:08.249
“—young people 
who expend themselves energetically

31:08.249 --> 31:10.518
“in the service of the God they love

31:10.518 --> 31:13.254
“and older ones who display the wisdom

31:13.254 --> 31:15.456
“that comes with decades of experience

31:15.456 --> 31:17.825
“in applying Christian principles.

31:17.825 --> 31:20.528
“Their kindness, friendship,

31:20.528 --> 31:24.332
“and hospitality have touched our hearts.

31:24.332 --> 31:27.702
“Sometimes we think 
we know our friends well,

31:27.702 --> 31:30.438
“but our appreciation for them is enhanced

31:30.438 --> 31:34.876
“as we find out more about good deeds 
they have done in the past.

31:34.876 --> 31:39.881
“This has been the case 
in our relationship with our God.

31:39.881 --> 31:44.018
“Jehovah constantly surprises 
and delights us.

31:44.018 --> 31:47.255
“As we reflect on all that he is

31:47.255 --> 31:49.624
“and all that he has done,

31:49.624 --> 31:54.429
“we feel moved to praise his beautiful name.

31:54.429 --> 31:59.133
“While this school 
has far exceeded our expectations,

31:59.133 --> 32:02.770
“it has also left us longing for more.

32:02.770 --> 32:05.573
“We are resolved to continue our program

32:05.573 --> 32:08.209
“of meaningful personal study.

32:08.209 --> 32:12.580
“As Moses said at Deuteronomy 30:11:

32:12.580 --> 32:17.585
“‘This commandment . . . 
is not . . . beyond your reach.

32:17.585 --> 32:22.590
“It is not in the heavens, . . . 
nor . . . on the other side of the sea.’

32:22.590 --> 32:26.794
“In any situation, 
we know we will always find

32:26.794 --> 32:29.063
“an illuminating Scriptural principle,

32:29.063 --> 32:32.500
“an encouraging thought, 
or an informative article

32:32.500 --> 32:35.136
“to help us to do what is right.

32:35.136 --> 32:37.805
“Our Gilead course may be over,

32:37.805 --> 32:40.908
“but we are left 
with an even greater appreciation

32:40.908 --> 32:44.379
“for the wealth of spiritual food 
in our publications

32:44.379 --> 32:47.482
“which remains to be explored.

32:47.482 --> 32:52.487
“We would not exchange 
the past five months for anything!

32:52.487 --> 32:55.923
“We sincerely thank 
the Governing Body for arranging

32:55.923 --> 33:00.161
“for us to benefit 
from this magnificent spiritual education,

33:00.161 --> 33:03.965
“and we assure you 
that we will do all we can

33:03.965 --> 33:07.301
“to use these treasures to build up others.

33:07.301 --> 33:12.306
Your brothers and sisters, 
the 144th class of Gilead.”

33:39.867 --> 33:43.671
Well, what more can we add?

33:43.671 --> 33:46.674
All we can say is that we love you,

33:46.674 --> 33:49.777
and we pray Jehovah’s rich blessing upon you,

33:49.777 --> 33:52.980
and may this school of Gilead

33:52.980 --> 33:56.184
continue to serve as a symbol

33:56.184 --> 34:07.489
of the peace and unity 
of Jehovah’s organization.

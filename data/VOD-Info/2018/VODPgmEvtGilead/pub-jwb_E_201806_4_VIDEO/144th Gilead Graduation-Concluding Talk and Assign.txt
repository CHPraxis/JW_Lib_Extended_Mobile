00:01 We go back to Wednesday,
00:05 June 23, 1943,
00:09 and the principal talk  of the Gilead graduation
00:11 was delivered by Brother Knorr,
00:13 who spoke on the subject
00:15 “Work, Patience, and Faith.”
00:19 Don’t write that down  because that’s not the theme
00:22 that we’re going to consider today.
00:24 But we have another member  of the Governing Body, Brother Sam Herd,
00:27 and he’s going to speak  on the intriguing theme
00:30 “Humbly Humble.”
00:39 If I should ask you,  Are you humble students?
00:42 and you say yes, then you’re not humble.
00:48 But you look humble.
00:54 It’s been a good program up until now.
00:56 We’ll see what follows.
01:03 We all know that we must be humble
01:06 through and through.
01:08 This is something that Jehovah  requires of all his servants
01:12 —not proud to be humble,
01:15 but humbly humble.
01:18 That’s what pleases God.
01:20 So that’s what we’re going to talk about.
01:23 But what do we mean by humble?
01:25 Well, it’s lowliness of mind.
01:28 Certainly, it’s not pompous
01:31 —filled to the gills with self-importance.
01:34 Jehovah says at Proverbs 8:13:
01:36 “I hate self-exaltation and pride.”
01:42 So we want to let that sink into our hearts.
01:45 Pride is something that Jehovah hates,
01:49 but he is pleased  with those who are humble.
01:53 Now, you’ve increased  your spiritual knowledge
01:56 while attending Gilead School,
01:59 but you have not scratched the surface
02:02 of what you will know in the future.
02:06 Your understanding  of many things has been sharpened
02:09 in these few months that you’ve been here,
02:12 and now you are eager  to tell others about what you’ve learned.
02:16 And there’s certainly  nothing wrong with that;
02:18 we can say it’s good.
02:21 But here’s a caution:
02:24 Be careful;
02:28 be extremely careful
02:33 not to become a show-off,
02:37 standing head and shoulders  above your brothers and sisters
02:42 in your branches  or in your congregations.
02:47 Don’t toot your horn.
02:51 “Get someone else to blow your horn
02:53 and the sound will carry twice as far,”
02:56 said Will Rogers.
02:59 Better yet, consider what Jehovah inspired
03:03 to be written at Proverbs 27:2:
03:08 “Let someone else praise you,
03:11 “and not your own mouth;
03:14 others, and not your own lips.”
03:19 Now, while it may be true
03:21 that they may not know as much as you,
03:26 what they do know will carry them
03:29 through the end of this system of things
03:32 into the new world.
03:34 Jehovah loves them  just as much as he loves you.
03:39 Now, I heard an experience years ago
03:41 about a Bible student  who was just starting to study.
03:45 He knows a few things and loves the truth,
03:48 as much as he knows.
03:50 Then he comes down sick unto death,
03:54 and the doctor at the hospital says,  “You must have a blood transfusion.”
03:58 But he knows enough,  “No blood for me, no blood transfusion.”
04:02 His family is not in the truth,  “Take that blood, Boy!”
04:05 “No. No blood for me.”
04:07 Others try to get him to take blood.
04:09 “No blood for me.”
04:11 And so the doctor operates and is successful;
04:14 everyone is happy.
04:17 Then his teacher
04:21 and others in the congregation
04:24 are invited to the hospital.
04:27 He has something to say.
04:29 What is it?
04:31 After they gather around his bed,
04:34 they’re thinking  that something has gone wrong.
04:37 He’s going to have to take blood,  and he’s willing to do it,
04:40 when he says,  “Why is it that we don’t take blood?”
04:49 Now, he does not know
04:52 that the Gentile Times ended in 1914;
04:57 he doesn’t know  the difference between sovereignty
05:01 and all the other things  that people talk about today.
05:06 But he knows the truth
05:09 —just a little bit of the truth.
05:12 He’s not concerned  with the vindication of God’s name
05:16 and his sovereignty  —the rightfulness of God’s rule.
05:21 He doesn’t know that much,
05:23 but he knows enough  that when his life is on the line,
05:27 he’d rather die than break God’s law,
05:30 even if he can’t explain that law.
05:35 Now, why say all that?
05:37 It’s not how much we know  that pleases Jehovah,
05:40 but how we feel about what we know
05:43 and how we have allowed that knowledge
05:46 to increase our love for Jehovah.
05:49 Now, I’m going to invite you  to open your Bibles, Bible students
05:53 —Gilead students.
05:55 Let’s turn to Romans.
05:59 We’re going to read the 12th chapter.
06:04 We’re going to read a couple of verses.
06:06 Where are they found?
06:07 Well, verse 3 starts us off.
06:10 It says: “For through the undeserved kindness  given to me,
06:14 “I tell everyone there among you  not to think more of himself
06:18 “than it is necessary to think,
06:21 “but to think so as to have a sound mind,
06:25 “each one as God has given to him
06:28 a measure of faith.”
06:31 There it is.
06:33 We can’t get too stuck on ourselves
06:37 and how much we know.
06:39 That’s not what Jehovah wants out of us.
06:43 Now look at verse 16:
06:46 “Have the same attitude  toward others as toward yourselves;
06:50 “do not set your mind on lofty things,
06:53 “but be led along with the lowly things.
06:56 Do not become wise in your own eyes.”
07:02 That’s good counsel isn’t it,  Gilead students?
07:05 Excellent counsel.
07:07 But, you know, sometimes we need  a little more than a couple of verses
07:12 for it to reach the heart.
07:16 We need to know a few more things.
07:20 Knowledge has been given to us
07:25 in great abundance these few months
07:27 that we’ve been here at Gilead School,
07:30 and we’ve just loved it.
07:33 But at 1 Corinthians 8:1,
07:35 it tells us something  that we want to think seriously about.
07:38 It says: “We know we all have knowledge.”
07:41 Now, here it’s coming:
07:43 “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.”
07:48 Now, you’ve got a lot of knowledge,
07:50 so be careful  that it does not puff you up
07:54 so that you stand  head and shoulders higher
07:58 than your brothers  and sisters in the congregation.
08:02 Jehovah loves them  just as much as he loves you,
08:06 who have this advanced knowledge now
08:08 because of your schooling.
08:11 Be as humble as a little child,
08:16 and Jesus tells us a little bit  about that in Matthew chapter 18.
08:21 This is what he said in verses 3 and 4:
08:23 “Truly I say to you, unless you turn around
08:25 “and become as young children,
08:27 “you will by no means enter  into the Kingdom of the heavens.
08:31 “Therefore, whoever will humble himself
08:34 “like this young child
08:36 “is the one who is the greatest
08:39 in the Kingdom of the heavens.”
08:42 So we say, humbly be humble.
08:48 Jehovah God, the Most High,
08:50 the Universal Sovereign,  “the King of eternity,” is humble.
08:55 This is what King David said of him
08:59 in Psalm 18,
09:01 ‘Your own humility will make me great.’
09:06 And it’s God’s humility  that makes us great too.
09:11 If Jehovah were not humble,  we would not be here.
09:15 Not one of mankind would be alive.
09:20 He’s humble,  and He has a right to expect humility
09:24 out of each and every one of us.
09:28 And we need to help  each other to be humble
09:33 —not glorify a human.
09:39 So we say this because sometimes  some of our brothers and sisters
09:44 look at us  —as members of the Governing Body—
09:46 as if we’re already angels,
09:48 and all you have to do  is ask our wives if we’re angels.
09:52 You’ll get a true story.
09:55 We’re not.
09:56 We’re just sinners like all the rest of you.
09:59 So don’t elevate us
10:01 above where we are or what we are.
10:04 If we want to elevate anything,  elevate Jehovah.
10:08 Now, that doesn’t mean that we feel
10:12 that you have wronged us in some way.
10:14 No, you haven’t.
10:16 You’re just human.
10:17 And as humans, we’re filled with sin
10:20 and we get carried away.
10:22 But help us to be humble, too,
10:27 rather than elevating us.
10:31 The Bible tells us of Jehovah:
10:33 “He stoops down to look on heaven and earth”
10:36 —Psalm 113:6.
10:38 What does that mean?
10:39 Well, he unbends;
10:41 he waives the privilege of rank.
10:46 Jehovah does that.
10:48 So he’s teaching us  to waive the privilege of rank.
10:53 We’re all brothers; that’s all we are.
10:57 We don’t measure up  as tall as Jesus, we just try to.
11:01 We try to dog his steps as best we can.
11:06 Follow the example of Jehovah.
11:08 He allowed Abraham  to question His righteousness
11:11 in purposing to destroy  the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.
11:15 In Genesis chapter 18,
11:17 Abraham says,  ‘If there are 50 righteous men,
11:21 are you still going to destroy everything?’
11:23 He says, ‘No, I will not.’
11:25 Then Abraham comes back, ‘45?’
11:27 He says,  ‘No, I will not destroy them.’
11:29 ‘40?’
11:29 ‘No, I will not.’
11:31 ‘30?’
11:31 ‘No.’
11:32 ‘20?’
11:33 ‘No.’
11:33 ‘10?’
11:34 ‘No.’
11:36 OK, Abraham, that’s enough;  close your mouth.
11:41 Now, I added that.
11:44 Do you know what the Bible really says?
11:46 It says: “When Jehovah  finished speaking to Abraham,
11:48 he went his way”
11:51 —still humble.
11:53 On a couple of occasions  He allowed Moses to reason with Him
11:57 as if He was another human.
12:01 It took humility for Him  to grant Moses’ pleas, but He did.
12:07 Now, what about Jesus?  Was he humble?
12:10 Well, let’s take a look
12:12 at Philippians 2:5-8.
12:17 Can we do that?
12:18 Philippians 2:5-8.
12:22 Now, we understand that some of you
12:25 do not have your iPad or your Bible,
12:29 but that’s all right.
12:32 You’ll have time to get it later.
12:34 Now, here in the second chapter,
12:39 we’re able to read starting with verse 5.
12:44 It says:  “Keep this mental attitude in you
12:47 “that was also in Christ Jesus,
12:49 “who, although he  was existing in God’s form,
12:52 “gave no consideration to a seizure,
12:54 “namely, that he should be equal to God.
12:56 “No, but he emptied himself  and took a slave’s form
13:00 “and became human.
13:03 “More than that,  when he came as a man,
13:08 “he humbled himself  and became obedient to the point of death,
13:13 yes, death on a torture stake.”
13:17 So, yes, Jesus was humble,
13:21 and Jesus washed the feet
13:24 —the dirty feet—  of his apostles
13:27 to show them how to be humble.
13:30 That was a job that a servant  should have done, or a slave’s job.
13:35 He lowered himself in front of them.
13:38 Perhaps he was on his knees  when he washed their feet
13:42 —John 13.
13:43 Now, why would I say that?
13:44 Well, I saw a picture—
13:47 I saw a picture
13:50 in the office building in Warwick,
13:55 a beautiful picture.
13:57 Jesus is washing the feet of his apostles.
14:00 And where is he at?
14:02 He’s on his knees.
14:03 Now, the Bible doesn’t say he was on his—
14:05 I looked that up;
14:06 it didn’t say that in John the 13th chapter.
14:08 But, how are you going to wash feet  if you don’t get down toward the feet?
14:13 So there he was  —on his knees—
14:17 teaching them a lesson.
14:19 The apostle Paul  set a fine example of humility.
14:22 He called himself ‘a slave of Jesus Christ’
14:25 —Philippians 1:1.
14:28 Now, if he had not been humble,
14:31 he would not have written  these words that I’m about to read:
14:35 “For I know that in me,  that is, in my flesh,
14:38 “there dwells nothing good;
14:40 “for I have the desire to do what is fine
14:42 “but not the ability to carry it out.
14:45 “For I do not do the good that I wish,
14:48 “but the bad that I do not wish
14:50 is what I practice”
14:52 —Romans 7.
14:55 And he was given a supernatural vision,
14:58 or visions, I should say,  and revelations.
15:02 He was used mightily by Jehovah God.
15:05 At Acts 19:11-16,
15:10 we’re able to see that.
15:12 It says: “And God kept performing  extraordinary powerful works
15:16 “through the hands of Paul,
15:21 “so that even cloths and aprons  that had touched his body
15:25 “were carried to the sick,
15:27 “and the diseases left them,
15:29 “and the wicked spirits came out.
15:31 “But some of the Jews  who traveled around casting out demons
15:35 “also tried to use  the name of the Lord Jesus
15:40 “over those who had wicked spirits;
15:43 “they would say: ‘I solemnly charge you
15:46 “by Jesus whom Paul preaches.’
15:49 “Now there were seven sons
15:52 “of a Jewish chief priest  named Sceva doing this.
15:56 “But in answer  the wicked spirit said to them:
16:00 “‘I know Jesus  and I am acquainted with Paul;
16:03 “but who are you?’
16:06 “At that the man  with the wicked spirit leaped on them,
16:10 “overpowered them one after the other,
16:13 “and prevailed against them,
16:15 “so that they fled naked and wounded
16:19 out of that house.”
16:22 Evidently, they were not humbly humble
16:26 for Jesus to let them use his name  to cast out the wicked spirits.
16:31 Paul was inspired  to write 14 of the 27 books
16:36 of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
16:38 Now, he did not get bigheaded,  but he stayed humble.
16:46 He’s not the only humble soul.
16:48 Here’s another one:  Nathan H. Knorr,
16:51 the third president  of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society,
16:55 wants to visit a member  of the Writing Department
16:58 in the member’s office.
17:00 And he stated, that is, Brother Knorr stated,
17:04 this—the member’s office—
17:07 this is where “the most important
17:09 “as well as the most difficult work  takes place.
17:13 That’s why I do so little of it.”
17:17 Isn’t that beautiful?
17:20 That’s a humble statement.
17:22 You know what I say behind it?  I say “Amen” to it.
17:25 I’m on the Writing Committee  of the Governing Body
17:29 for some unknown reason.
17:33 I can’t write,
17:35 not a lick,
17:38 but there I am.
17:40 The humility shown by Brother Knorr
17:43 made me think back in time
17:45 to when a group of traveling overseers
17:47 were attending school  in Crownsville, Maryland.
17:49 Brother Ted Jaracz  was one of the instructors,
17:52 and he got up early one morning
17:54 and prepared a hot breakfast for all of us.
17:56 He did that on his own.
17:59 I was one of the instructors,
18:01 but it didn’t cross my mind  to do a thing like that.
18:05 Maybe I wasn’t humbly humble,
18:08 or if I was, I didn’t show it.
18:16 I can’t cook either,
18:18 not a lick.
18:23 What does it take to be exalted?
18:26 Let’s let the Bible answer at Luke 14:11:
18:29 “For everyone who exalts himself  will be humbled,
18:32 and whoever humbles himself  will be exalted.”
18:35 What does it take?
18:37 It takes humility.
18:39 Don’t learn that others are superior
18:42 the hard way.
18:44 Take a lesson  from my old hound dog named Booser.
18:50 Sometimes he would follow us to town.
18:55 And one day, we passed a home
18:59 where usually there was  a little dog that lived there,
19:02 but he had died.
19:04 And something caught Booser’s nose,
19:07 and so Booser  was sniffing around, sniffing around.
19:09 And he went over near the house,
19:11 and a big Dalmatian  came charging around the side of the house,
19:15 and he attacked Booser.
19:17 Booser put up a fight,
19:19 but he lost,
19:22 and the Dalmatian won.
19:25 Booser tucked his tail between his legs,
19:28 and he darted out of there  like a streak of lightning.
19:32 Well, a couple of weeks later,
19:34 Booser wanted to go to town  with us again—walking.
19:37 But we noticed that when we got  to the Dalmatian’s house,
19:40 Booser was gone.
19:42 Booser took a long trip around the house
19:46 and met us downtown.
19:52 We’re about to wrap this up.
19:59 He was humbly humble.
20:03 He viewed the Dalmatian as superior.
20:07 Now, students,  do you get the point of Booser’s example?
20:12 View others as superior.
20:15 They probably are.
20:38 That was a fantastic talk
20:41 —and I assure you,  Sam is a very humble person.
20:46 He just can’t cook.
20:52 Well, we have a few announcements for you.
20:57 First of all,  you’ll be interested in the attendance.
21:01 In Canada, there are 902.
21:06 And here in the United States, 9,702
21:10 for a total of 10,604.
21:15 Now, of course, we know  that with the streaming many,
21:18 many more are going to be looking in  on the program later.
21:23 So it’s going to be a lot more than 10,000.
21:26 Now, we’ve had some beautiful expressions
21:30 from the branches  —greetings to our students.
21:34 We don’t have time to read all of them.
21:37 They will go in the archives  of the Teaching Committee.
21:40 If I can’t read all of them,
21:42 I don’t want to read just one or two.
21:45 But here are the countries  that are represented
21:48 that have sent beautiful expressions to us:
21:50 Angola, Argentina,
21:53 Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil,
21:57 Britain, Bulgaria, Burundi, Canada,
22:01 Finland, France, Georgia,
22:05 Ghana, Haiti, Hong Kong, Italy,
22:09 Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea,
22:13 Madagascar, Mozambique,
22:16 Netherlands, Nigeria,
22:18 Papua New Guinea, Portugal,
22:21 Sierra Leone, Thailand, and Ukraine.
22:26 And that’s just about  the end of the alphabet.
22:28 So we appreciate all of these greetings
22:31 —beautiful expressions of appreciation
22:34 from the folks in these branches.
22:38 Well, we go back to 1943,
22:42 and following the principal talk,  what happened?
22:46 Here’s what we read —here’s the report:
22:49 ‘A large case containing the diplomas
22:53 ‘was opened and put on the podium table.
22:56 ‘One by one all the students were called
22:59 to come forward to receive their diplomas.’
23:02 Well, we’re going to follow  that pattern right now;
23:06 that pattern established 75 years ago.
23:09 And I’m very happy to have  Brother David Schafer with me.
23:13 If you were present  for the introductions of the class,
23:16 you know what a beautiful job David did  with all the names of the students.
23:21 And so, behold
23:23 the 144th class of Gilead.
23:29 And first, we have Brother and Sister Abou
23:31 who will be returning to the Middle East.

27:42 Brother Voyevodin will be returning to Asia.
27:49 Brother and Sister Wembalola  will be serving in Madagascar.
27:59 And Sister Wójcik  will be returning to Poland.
28:25 And here they are.
28:46 Let’s go back to 1943.
28:51 Once all the diplomas  were handed out, what happened?
28:54 Well, the report tells us  that a representative of the class
28:58 read a statement  expressing the students’ appreciation
29:01 for the privilege of attending Gilead
29:03 and assuring the Governing Body  of their loyalty
29:06 to Jehovah and his organization.
29:09 We’re going to follow the same pattern today,
29:12 and Brother Richard Chilton is going to read
29:14 a class letter on behalf of the class.
29:24 “To the Governing Body.
29:26 “Dear Brothers:
29:29 “Few things in life  bring greater satisfaction
29:32 “than meaningful discussions  on spiritual topics with dear friends.
29:37 “Over the last five months,
29:39 “we have enjoyed the blessing
29:41 “of being immersed  in such discussions on a daily basis.
29:45 “As we studied the Bible book by book,
29:49 “the examples  of faithful men and women of the past
29:53 “came to life and touched  our hearts in new ways.
29:57 “Reliving the modern-day history  of Jehovah's organization,
30:01 “we marveled at the faith,
30:03 “courage, and self-sacrifice
30:06 “of those who have gone before us.
30:09 “Our skills in the ministry  were refined through workshops,
30:13 “and our desire to share  in the preaching work intensified.
30:18 “As the weeks passed,
30:20 “fellow students became our close friends.
30:25 “Now, as the class has come to an end,
30:29 “tears come to our eyes  as we think about parting ways,
30:33 “but we will treasure the memories
30:35 “of the stimulating  ‘interchange of encouragement’
30:38 “with our new group of friends.
30:41 “And what a blessing to be guided  by mature, devoted instructors
30:46 “who combined  ‘spiritual matters with spiritual words.’
30:50 “We are grateful for their loving support  as they nurtured our spiritual growth,
30:55 “and we will never forget their example  of zeal for God’s Word.
31:00 “Getting to know the Bethel family  has been a real delight
31:05 “—young people  who expend themselves energetically
31:08 “in the service of the God they love
31:10 “and older ones who display the wisdom
31:13 “that comes with decades of experience
31:15 “in applying Christian principles.
31:17 “Their kindness, friendship,
31:20 “and hospitality have touched our hearts.
31:24 “Sometimes we think  we know our friends well,
31:27 “but our appreciation for them is enhanced
31:30 “as we find out more about good deeds  they have done in the past.
31:34 “This has been the case  in our relationship with our God.
31:39 “Jehovah constantly surprises  and delights us.
31:44 “As we reflect on all that he is
31:47 “and all that he has done,
31:49 “we feel moved to praise his beautiful name.
31:54 “While this school  has far exceeded our expectations,
31:59 “it has also left us longing for more.
32:02 “We are resolved to continue our program
32:05 “of meaningful personal study.
32:08 “As Moses said at Deuteronomy 30:11:
32:12 “‘This commandment . . .  is not . . . beyond your reach.
32:17 “It is not in the heavens, . . .  nor . . . on the other side of the sea.’
32:22 “In any situation,  we know we will always find
32:26 “an illuminating Scriptural principle,
32:29 “an encouraging thought,  or an informative article
32:32 “to help us to do what is right.
32:35 “Our Gilead course may be over,
32:37 “but we are left  with an even greater appreciation
32:40 “for the wealth of spiritual food  in our publications
32:44 “which remains to be explored.
32:47 “We would not exchange  the past five months for anything!
32:52 “We sincerely thank  the Governing Body for arranging
32:55 “for us to benefit  from this magnificent spiritual education,
33:00 “and we assure you  that we will do all we can
33:03 “to use these treasures to build up others.
33:07 Your brothers and sisters,  the 144th class of Gilead.”
33:39 Well, what more can we add?
33:43 All we can say is that we love you,
33:46 and we pray Jehovah’s rich blessing upon you,
33:49 and may this school of Gilead
33:52 continue to serve as a symbol
33:56 of the peace and unity  of Jehovah’s organization.

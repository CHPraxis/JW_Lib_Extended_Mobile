WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.421
In recent times,

00:04.421 --> 00:09.059
a very popular segment 
on the Gilead graduations

00:09.059 --> 00:11.528
has been a video presentation

00:11.528 --> 00:15.899
that features one of the instructors 
along with the students

00:15.899 --> 00:18.468
called The Inside Story.

00:18.468 --> 00:22.238
And we’re happy to present 
such a program today.

00:22.238 --> 00:26.443
The instructor who is going to serve 
as the moderator of this discussion

00:26.443 --> 00:29.079
is Brother Trent Lippold,

00:29.079 --> 00:33.650
and the students are going to get a chance 
to see what they look like on camera.

00:33.650 --> 00:35.652
Enjoy the program.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.728
February 1, 2018, 
marked an anniversary

00:44.728 --> 00:46.763
for the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:46.763 --> 00:48.965
Over the past 75 years,

00:48.965 --> 00:51.668
Gilead graduates have been going out 
to the ends of the earth

00:51.668 --> 00:54.771
to strengthen and stabilize 
Jehovah’s organization.

00:54.771 --> 00:57.307
And we just love reading 
yearbook experiences,

00:57.307 --> 01:01.678
and many of them are from those places 
that Gilead graduates have gone to.

01:01.678 --> 01:04.214
Well, today, 
we have the special opportunity

01:04.214 --> 01:07.283
to see and to hear 
some of the experiences

01:07.283 --> 01:10.120
of the 144th class of Gilead.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.457
So it’s my pleasure to welcome you 
to this edition of The Inside Story.

01:42.318 --> 01:44.988
Well, we’d like to introduce, 
right away, our first guest,

01:44.988 --> 01:47.657
and it’s Brother Alejandro Bascope 
from Bolivia.

01:54.998 --> 01:56.666
Welcome, Alejandro.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.768
It’s great to have you with us today.

01:58.768 --> 02:02.505
You and your wife, Ivon, 
serve together at the Bolivia branch.

02:02.505 --> 02:04.774
Can you tell us a little bit 
about what you do there?

02:04.774 --> 02:09.112
For the last 11 years, I have been working 
in the Service Department

02:09.112 --> 02:11.748
helping to organize 
the preaching efforts in the country.

02:11.748 --> 02:12.682
Very nice.

02:12.682 --> 02:15.618
And before you came to Bethel, 
what were you doing?

02:15.618 --> 02:19.556
Before Bethel, my wife and I 
spent some years in the circuit work,

02:19.556 --> 02:22.225
and before that, 
we were special pioneers.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.426
Very nice.

02:23.426 --> 02:27.063
So being at the branch, 
in the Service Department in Bolivia,

02:27.063 --> 02:30.233
must give you a nice opportunity 
to see the work that’s going on in Bolivia.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.736
Would you mind giving us a little update 
of how the work is going in Bolivia?

02:33.736 --> 02:34.737
Of course.

02:34.737 --> 02:39.475
Currently, we have 
more than 27,000 publishers in Bolivia.

02:39.475 --> 02:43.847
And last year, 
we had an increase of 4 percent.

02:43.847 --> 02:46.950
And we can see 
a great potential for the future

02:46.950 --> 02:51.621
because we are conducting 
more than 43,000 Bible studies.

02:52.655 --> 02:53.723
Wow, that is amazing!

02:53.723 --> 02:56.893
It sounds like the truth 
is reaching everywhere in Bolivia.

02:58.061 --> 03:01.231
Well, actually, 
not everywhere, but we are improving.

03:02.398 --> 03:05.501
So, what do you mean by that, 
not exactly everywhere?

03:05.501 --> 03:07.871
Bolivia has about 11 million people.

03:07.871 --> 03:11.140
And while most live in urban areas,

03:11.140 --> 03:15.945
there are about 35,000 
living in isolated spots

03:15.945 --> 03:18.715
along three main rivers in the north

03:18.715 --> 03:22.785
—Madre de Dios River, 
Beni River, and Mamoré River.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.888
So, what are you doing to reach those people?

03:24.888 --> 03:28.858
Well, in 2015, brothers started to organize

03:28.858 --> 03:31.527
the “four by four” preaching campaigns.

03:31.527 --> 03:32.528
“Four by four” 
—that’s interesting.

03:32.528 --> 03:33.897
Here we preach two by two.

03:33.897 --> 03:34.864
So is that . . .

03:35.965 --> 03:39.202
Yes, “four by four” 
refers to our vehicles.

03:39.202 --> 03:40.737
Of course!

03:40.737 --> 03:45.441
Last year, 
we had more than 300 vehicle groups

03:45.441 --> 03:47.911
participating in this campaign.

03:47.911 --> 03:50.079
We were able to reach many villages,

03:50.079 --> 03:52.315
but not all of them

03:52.315 --> 03:55.919
because some had no road access at all.

03:55.919 --> 03:57.921
Wow, that isolated.

03:57.921 --> 04:01.891
So how do you reach these places then 
that have no road access?

04:01.891 --> 04:04.327
Well, we began renting boats.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.231
We were able to reach 
many villages for the first time.

04:08.231 --> 04:12.001
We started many Bible studies.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.437
And after that, we reported the success

04:14.437 --> 04:17.106
to the Service Committee 
of the Governing Body.

04:17.106 --> 04:18.107
Wow, that sounds—

04:18.107 --> 04:20.310
I mean, it sounds 
like you solved the problem.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.312
Yes and no.

04:22.312 --> 04:26.516
We realized that in order 
to continue preaching there,

04:26.516 --> 04:29.452
we needed just a small thing

04:29.452 --> 04:31.454
—our own boat.

04:31.454 --> 04:32.588
Your own boat—

04:32.588 --> 04:34.691
What was wrong with the rented boats?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.259
Was there a problem?

04:36.259 --> 04:38.328
Well, not a problem, but many problems.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.833
Here’s an example 
of the boats we used to rent.

04:43.833 --> 04:47.003
You can see they are wooden, old;

04:47.003 --> 04:50.039
people and supplies are all crammed together.

04:51.107 --> 04:53.142
And in order to be more effective,

04:53.142 --> 04:55.178
we realized that we needed our own boat.

04:56.346 --> 04:58.348
It would be 
a little bit safer too, I suspect.

04:58.348 --> 05:01.484
Yes, you cannot be effective 
if you are squished.

05:03.820 --> 05:06.956
So tell us, did you get your own boat?

05:06.956 --> 05:09.359
Yeah, and we even gave it a name,

05:09.359 --> 05:12.295
Messenger of the Kingdom, 
or, in Spanish,

05:12.295 --> 05:14.297
Mensajero Del Reino.

05:14.297 --> 05:15.365
Very nice.

05:15.365 --> 05:16.866
So, what’s it like?

05:16.866 --> 05:19.836
How does preaching with boats work?

05:19.836 --> 05:21.204
Well, can I show you?

05:21.204 --> 05:23.206
Sure!

05:24.674 --> 05:28.745
Bolivia’s river witnessing 
started with wooden boats.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.148
But Jehovah says that instead of the wood,

05:32.148 --> 05:35.585
he would bring in better, stronger materials.

05:36.753 --> 05:41.391
Messenger of the Kingdom 
is custom-made for river witnessing.

05:41.391 --> 05:45.128
It’s small, 
so it can be taken to different towns

05:45.128 --> 05:47.730
and launched closer to where we’ll preach.

05:47.730 --> 05:52.668
The roof holds literature and supplies.

05:52.668 --> 05:57.407
Over 200 pioneers applied to help.

05:57.407 --> 06:01.277
They meet plenty of creatures on the river.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.781
With some, you don’t want to get too close.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.785
Jehovah’s beautiful creation 
is part of the journey.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.789
But the brothers and sisters 
are looking for people,

06:12.789 --> 06:17.260
ones “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

06:17.260 --> 06:19.796
They’ll often find interest in the morning,

06:19.796 --> 06:22.698
make return visits in the afternoon,

06:22.698 --> 06:27.136
and invite them to a meeting 
that same evening.

06:29.872 --> 06:32.742
A trip lasts seven to ten days.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.648
All the work and preparation

06:38.648 --> 06:41.184
is worth the effort.

06:41.184 --> 06:44.253
And before they know it, 
it’s back on the river

06:44.253 --> 06:46.255
and on to the next village.

06:55.231 --> 06:56.933
Alejandro, that looks very exciting.

06:56.933 --> 06:57.600
Yes.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.236
Of course, 
there are many potential dangers,

07:00.236 --> 07:03.506
like animals, strong currents, rocks.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.007
But it’s worth it.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.743
For example, in the village of Barranquilla,

07:07.743 --> 07:11.948
brothers met Alessandro 
the first time they came.

07:11.948 --> 07:13.983
And the next time,

07:13.983 --> 07:16.953
the whole village was waiting with Alessandro

07:16.953 --> 07:18.521
—over 40 people.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.958
All of them wanted to hear the good news,

07:21.958 --> 07:24.660
and many Bible studies were started.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.696
What a tremendous response!

07:26.696 --> 07:28.698
I think, Alejandro,

07:28.698 --> 07:30.700
that you’re going to have 
a lot more applicants

07:30.700 --> 07:34.036
to go on these boat-preaching tours.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.239
So, what would you say has been the effect

07:36.239 --> 07:39.408
on the publishers who make 
the trips to preach?

07:40.009 --> 07:43.279
Well, honestly, at first we were concerned

07:43.279 --> 07:46.115
about sending pioneers to the jungle.

07:46.115 --> 07:50.186
But they actually thanked us

07:50.186 --> 07:54.023
because they said 
it was very encouraging

07:54.023 --> 07:57.760
to share the truth 
with many interested people.

07:57.760 --> 08:02.765
They said it was a spiritual gift for them.

08:03.299 --> 08:05.701
For me and other brothers at the branch,

08:05.701 --> 08:10.706
it was very faith-strengthening 
to see how Jehovah removes any obstacles

08:10.706 --> 08:13.242
in order for the people 
to hear the good news.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.010
Very nice.

08:14.010 --> 08:17.446
And it’s faith-strengthening to us 
to be able to see those experiences.

08:17.446 --> 08:21.551
I can see why those pioneers 
thanked you for that opportunity.

08:21.551 --> 08:25.188
You have the nice privilege 
of organizing this work

08:25.188 --> 08:26.689
by working in the Service Department.

08:26.689 --> 08:30.193
But let me ask you, Alejandro, 
how many trips have you been on?

08:30.193 --> 08:31.861
None yet.

08:32.995 --> 08:37.333
My wife, Ivon, says 
that I need to become a good swimmer first.

08:38.801 --> 08:40.870
Your wife, Ivon, is a smart woman.

08:41.771 --> 08:45.274
Thank you very much, Alejandro, 
for sharing your experiences with us.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.617
So we’d like to invite out our next guest,

08:54.617 --> 08:56.619
and it’s Brother Arlindo Tito 
from Mozambique.

09:07.063 --> 09:09.065
Welcome, Arlindo.

09:09.065 --> 09:11.801
Arlindo, you are coming from Mozambique.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.237
Would you mind sharing a little bit 
of your background with us?

09:14.237 --> 09:15.271
Sure,

09:15.271 --> 09:19.475
I inherited the truth 
from my parents and my grandparents.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.245
And for the last seven years,

09:22.245 --> 09:24.714
I have been working 
at the branch in Mozambique

09:24.714 --> 09:27.216
—for some time, 
in the Audio/Video Department,

09:27.216 --> 09:29.685
but for most of the time 
in the Accounting Department.

09:30.553 --> 09:32.955
That’s a beautiful spiritual heritage 
that you have

09:32.955 --> 09:35.057
—and now Gilead School.

09:35.057 --> 09:38.227
But I understand 
that one of your assignments at Bethel

09:38.227 --> 09:42.265
was connected with part 
of the rich spiritual history of Mozambique.

09:42.265 --> 09:43.833
Yes, I had this privilege.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.069
But I could say 
 that it all started with singing.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.304
Singing?

09:48.304 --> 09:50.473
How was that? 
Could you explain that?

09:50.473 --> 09:51.674
Well,

09:51.674 --> 09:54.644
there was a time when singing 
was like a spiritual anchor

09:54.644 --> 09:56.646
for the brothers in Mozambique.

09:56.646 --> 10:00.916
Before 1991, 
we were under ban in Mozambique.

10:00.916 --> 10:04.620
So because the brothers 
didn’t want to get involved in politics,

10:04.620 --> 10:07.189
they were sent to a concentration camp.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.425
It was a reeducation camp

10:09.425 --> 10:12.695
—the government 
was trying to change their minds.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.798
So the life there could be very difficult,

10:15.798 --> 10:19.602
but the brothers would find 
a way to worship Jehovah.

10:19.602 --> 10:21.837
They would meet secretly.

10:21.837 --> 10:24.974
This is an example 
of a meeting that was held there

10:24.974 --> 10:27.009
in the middle of the forest at that time.

10:27.009 --> 10:29.011
It must have been very anxious for them

10:29.011 --> 10:31.714
—anxious moments having to meet 
together in secret like that.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.949
Yes, and it was at that time when singing

10:33.949 --> 10:36.285
became like a spiritual anchor for them.

10:36.285 --> 10:39.422
Right at the beginning, 
they were singing to stay courageous.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.424
In fact, the authorities were surprised

10:41.424 --> 10:45.061
because the brothers, 
instead of crying, they were singing.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.030
And at that time, 
there were older brothers

10:48.030 --> 10:52.368
who would teach other brothers 
to read the musical notes,

10:52.368 --> 10:54.603
and they would memorize the songs.

10:54.603 --> 10:57.573
And when they had no Bibles or songbooks

10:57.573 --> 11:00.509
and they were together, 
they would just sing.

11:00.509 --> 11:03.412
Wow, that is absolutely beautiful 
—the power of Kingdom songs.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.513
Very nice.

11:04.513 --> 11:07.616
So we know that after the ban in 1991,

11:07.616 --> 11:10.486
the brothers were now free to worship.

11:10.486 --> 11:14.123
So did singing continue to be 
an important part of their worship?

11:14.123 --> 11:16.892
Well, that’s what we wanted.

11:16.892 --> 11:18.794
It sounds like there’s a story.

11:18.794 --> 11:20.663
Would you mind explaining that?

11:20.663 --> 11:21.864
After the ban,

11:21.864 --> 11:24.734
we had many new ones 
coming into the truth.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.937
But in many rural areas in Mozambique,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.840
we have no electricity, no sound system,

11:30.840 --> 11:32.842
no recording of the songs.

11:32.842 --> 11:36.345
So at that time, it became a real challenge

11:36.345 --> 11:39.014
for the brothers to sing at the meetings.

11:39.014 --> 11:41.650
What about the older ones,
the ones who sang in the camps,

11:41.650 --> 11:43.486
couldn’t they help the new ones?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.555
Yes, but many of them had moved away,

11:46.555 --> 11:48.758
especially to the cities.

11:48.758 --> 11:51.927
So in rural areas, there was a great need.

11:52.862 --> 11:55.564
OK, but what about songbooks? 
Surely you had songbooks.

11:55.564 --> 11:56.832
Yes, we had them.

11:56.832 --> 11:59.301
But most could not read the musical notes.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.504
So they would sing, yes,

12:01.504 --> 12:05.408
but the melody would sound 
a little bit different from what we know.

12:05.408 --> 12:10.413
Yeah, so now we had freedom; 
they could worship Jehovah.

12:10.413 --> 12:13.149
But because of not having a sound system,

12:13.149 --> 12:15.418
they couldn’t fully enjoy the meetings

12:15.418 --> 12:19.088
because they couldn’t hear clearly 
what was being taught at the meetings.

12:19.088 --> 12:22.024
That must have been 
very discouraging in a sense.

12:22.024 --> 12:25.161
Well, did they get the help they needed?

12:25.161 --> 12:26.495
Yes, they did.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.864
And this is the beauty of this organization.

12:28.864 --> 12:33.068
Jehovah really takes care 
of everyone in his organization.

12:33.068 --> 12:36.806
In 2011, 
the Global Purchasing Department

12:36.806 --> 12:39.975
found a player 
that would really fit our needs.

12:40.443 --> 12:42.278
What do they call the player?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.680
We call it the unity player.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.550
It comes from the idea of singing in unity

12:47.550 --> 12:49.752
with our worldwide brotherhood.

12:49.752 --> 12:52.154
OK. Unity player 
—what does it look like?

12:53.088 --> 12:54.657
It’s not big. 
I have one here.

12:54.657 --> 12:55.658
Can I show you?

12:55.658 --> 12:57.226
Absolutely.

12:57.226 --> 12:58.227
Here it is.

12:58.227 --> 12:59.295
I was wondering what that was.

12:59.295 --> 13:02.298
I thought it was your lunch.

13:02.298 --> 13:04.300
Probably, my lunch 
would be bigger than this.

13:05.935 --> 13:09.605
But as you can see,

13:09.605 --> 13:12.908
it’s very easy to carry, 
very easy to operate,

13:12.908 --> 13:14.944
and it’s very practical.

13:14.944 --> 13:17.980
It can be plugged in if they have power,

13:17.980 --> 13:22.852
but if they don’t have power, 
it comes with a small solar panel,

13:22.852 --> 13:25.354
so it can be charged by the sun.

13:25.354 --> 13:26.922
You charge it with the sun.

13:26.922 --> 13:27.556
Yes.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.190
OK.

13:28.190 --> 13:31.760
Yeah, and we have plenty of sun, 
so that’s not a problem.

13:31.760 --> 13:36.765
But even if the sun fails, 
it comes with this hand crank,

13:36.765 --> 13:38.701
so it can be charged manually.

13:38.701 --> 13:39.702
Charge it by hand.

13:39.702 --> 13:40.436
Yeah, exactly.

13:40.436 --> 13:41.203
OK. 
Very nice.

13:41.203 --> 13:44.139
That’s very useful 
for us there in Mozambique.

13:44.139 --> 13:47.209
And it has a little place here

13:47.209 --> 13:51.514
where we can insert 
a micro SD card with all the songs.

13:51.514 --> 13:54.884
So now it’s just play and sing.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.086
Very nice. 
But it looks like that’s not all.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.022
Yes, it comes with this microphone.

14:00.022 --> 14:04.093
So after singing, this unity player 
can be used as the sound system;

14:04.093 --> 14:08.430
so they can hear clearly 
what is being taught at the meeting.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.766
It sounds like it does 
a lot more than your lunch would.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.201
Exactly.

14:12.201 --> 14:16.372
You know, I think it would be so neat 
to just be able to see a congregation

14:16.372 --> 14:18.908
when they get 
a unity player for the first time.

14:18.908 --> 14:21.110
Well, actually, you can see that.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.444
Just take a look.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.946
OK.

14:26.248 --> 14:30.586
This is the Nhantshembene Congregation 
in the south part of Mozambique.

14:30.586 --> 14:35.090
Psalm 33 tells us 
to “sing praises” to Jehovah,

14:35.090 --> 14:37.092
“along with shouts of joy.”

14:38.894 --> 14:42.464
But with no sound system, 
if they shout joyfully

14:42.464 --> 14:45.067
or sing fully from the heart 
like they want to,

14:45.067 --> 14:47.236
they will not hear the music.

14:47.236 --> 14:51.941
Listening to the spiritual food 
can also be difficult.

14:54.977 --> 14:59.315
To help, the brothers send a request 
for a unity player to the branch.

15:06.121 --> 15:09.191
The Broadcasting Department 
tests the new player.

15:09.191 --> 15:13.462
SD cards are loaded 
with all of the audio and video material

15:13.462 --> 15:15.998
available to them in Changana.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.669
Everything they need is packed inside

15:20.669 --> 15:24.106
and is soon on its way to the congregation.

15:31.580 --> 15:34.249
Setup is easy, and they quickly learn

15:34.249 --> 15:37.486
how to use the solar panel 
to charge the unit.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.724
This meeting will be different.

15:41.724 --> 15:43.859
Now they are able to sing to Jehovah

15:43.859 --> 15:47.863
the way their hearts move them.

15:49.498 --> 15:53.602
The Nhantshembene Congregation 
greatly appreciates this blessing

15:53.602 --> 15:55.704
and sends their love.

16:03.112 --> 16:06.815
It’s beautiful to see the joy on their faces 
when they get a unity player

16:06.815 --> 16:08.951
and they’re able to sing again.

16:08.951 --> 16:11.954
So it will be interesting to see 
what new technology is available

16:11.954 --> 16:15.624
that will be able to help Jehovah’s people 
even in the remotest parts of the earth

16:15.624 --> 16:18.027
to benefit in their true worship.

16:18.027 --> 16:20.195
Thank you so much, Arlindo, 
for being with us today.

16:27.536 --> 16:31.807
Many of us have 
a favorite Kingdom song or original song,

16:31.807 --> 16:35.177
often because it evokes 
in us a certain emotion.

16:35.177 --> 16:38.881
Well, we’d like to invite some 
of the students to the stage now.

16:38.881 --> 16:42.751
And they’ve specially arranged 
and are prepared to perform for us

16:42.751 --> 16:44.186
one of our Kingdom songs.

16:44.186 --> 16:45.187
Let’s listen to them.

16:57.399 --> 17:01.103
How can we endure

17:01.103 --> 17:08.510
When trials come, as Jesus said?

17:08.510 --> 17:13.949
Through his pain he saw

17:13.949 --> 17:21.123
The joy of better things ahead.

17:26.295 --> 17:32.301
God’s promise, God’s justice,

17:32.301 --> 17:38.073
Were thoughts on which he fed.

17:38.073 --> 17:44.379
We need to have endurance.

17:44.379 --> 17:50.786
Our faith we must defend.

17:50.786 --> 17:56.692
His love is our assurance.

17:56.692 --> 18:06.135
So we will keep enduring to the end.

18:08.937 --> 18:13.976
Though the passing years

18:13.976 --> 18:21.150
May bring us sorrow, bring us pain;

18:21.150 --> 18:25.587
There beyond the tears,

18:25.587 --> 18:32.594
We see the life that we can gain.

18:38.600 --> 18:44.373
To be there, feel free there,

18:44.373 --> 18:50.646
Determined we remain.

18:50.646 --> 18:56.351
We need to have endurance.

18:56.351 --> 19:02.324
Our faith we must defend.

19:02.324 --> 19:08.564
His love is our assurance.

19:08.564 --> 19:18.273
So we will keep enduring to the end.

19:20.709 --> 19:26.515
We will not give up

19:26.515 --> 19:33.088
Nor see the need for doubt or fear.

19:33.088 --> 19:38.427
Faithfully we’ll serve

19:38.427 --> 19:45.000
Until Jehovah’s day is here.

19:50.339 --> 19:56.411
Let’s keep on enduring.

19:56.411 --> 20:01.717
That time is very near.

20:01.717 --> 20:08.323
We need to have endurance.

20:08.323 --> 20:15.097
Our faith we must defend.

20:15.097 --> 20:20.736
His love is our assurance.

20:20.736 --> 20:31.546
So we will keep enduring to the end.

20:50.699 --> 20:52.701
What a touching song!

20:52.701 --> 20:57.472
And it very nicely introduces 
our next couple and their amazing story.

20:57.472 --> 21:00.442
Let’s welcome 
Brother Laddie and Cecelia Sandy.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.424
Brother and Sister Sandy, 
you are coming from Sierra Leone.

21:15.424 --> 21:17.993
And I understand that in 1997,

21:17.993 --> 21:20.696
you participated 
in the construction of the branch

21:20.696 --> 21:22.698
and soon thereafter began serving there.

21:22.698 --> 21:23.865
Is that correct?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.534
Yes, very correct.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.803
We are happily serving at the branch.

21:27.803 --> 21:31.406
But I understand that things 
didn’t remain that way, did they?

21:31.406 --> 21:33.742
No, things changed really quickly

21:33.742 --> 21:37.713
because our country 
was divided into civil war,

21:37.713 --> 21:41.283
and then just a month 
after the branch dedication,

21:41.283 --> 21:43.285
the rebels attacked Freetown.

21:44.319 --> 21:46.321
So, Laddie, what happened?

21:47.122 --> 21:50.425
The foreign missionaries were evacuated

21:50.425 --> 21:53.729
to a safer place in neighboring Guinea,

21:53.729 --> 21:58.600
and the expatriate Bethelites 
also left the country.

21:59.368 --> 22:01.503
So who was left 
at the branch then, Laddie?

22:01.503 --> 22:03.505
Just seven of us

22:03.505 --> 22:08.510
—Cecelia, three single brothers, 
a couple, and myself.

22:10.345 --> 22:13.015
OK, so did just the seven of you 
then stay in the branch?

22:13.015 --> 22:14.049
No.

22:14.049 --> 22:16.685
As things started getting worse,

22:16.685 --> 22:21.556
the brothers kept coming 
to the branch to seek refuge.

22:21.556 --> 22:25.460
There were so many 
that we couldn’t keep them all at the branch.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.929
We started distributing them

22:27.929 --> 22:30.165
to the different missionary homes 
in Freetown.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.902
So how many were you then at the branch?

22:34.870 --> 22:38.540
We were about 70 to 80 brothers 
and sisters at the branch.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.510
Wow! 
That’s amazing.

22:41.510 --> 22:44.179
So, Cecelia, how did you 
care for all those brothers and sisters?

22:45.180 --> 22:48.350
Well, we shared the food that we had,

22:48.350 --> 22:52.754
and the Bethel family 
kept eating less and less

22:52.754 --> 22:56.558
so our dear brothers 
had what they needed.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.128
OK. 
Well, they look happy in that photograph.

23:00.128 --> 23:02.731
Although, Laddie, 
the picture doesn’t look so good.

23:02.731 --> 23:05.133
That’s true. 
It survived the war.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.202
That’s why it has some scratches on it.

23:07.202 --> 23:09.638
OK, right, I understand.

23:09.638 --> 23:14.142
So when you were there, Cecelia, 
were you able to go out at all?

23:14.876 --> 23:15.710
Yes, we did.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.513
We did our best to go out in the ministry.

23:18.513 --> 23:23.418
But before going out in the morning, 
we had to listen to the news

23:23.418 --> 23:27.456
—the government’s radio and bush radio.

23:27.456 --> 23:30.492
Ah, OK, government radio I understand 
but bush radio?

23:30.492 --> 23:32.828
I’m not sure I understand what that is.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.832
Oh, it’s the news 
that you get by word of mouth.

23:36.832 --> 23:41.770
So the brothers would give their news,

23:41.770 --> 23:43.805
passersby would give their news,

23:43.805 --> 23:47.576
and then you decided 
where it was safe to go on that day.

23:47.576 --> 23:50.045
OK, I get it. 
Bush radio—interesting.

23:50.045 --> 23:52.047
Did you ever feel in danger?

23:52.047 --> 23:54.249
Were you in danger at the branch?

23:54.249 --> 23:55.317
Yes.

23:55.317 --> 24:00.122
One night, 
a brother and myself were in the lobby

24:00.122 --> 24:04.292
and two armed rebels appeared

24:04.292 --> 24:06.962
demanding that we open the door to them

24:06.962 --> 24:10.499
to get access into the branch.

24:10.499 --> 24:14.402
We were so frightened; 
we ran to safety.

24:14.402 --> 24:18.406
And they started shooting at the door 
—the locks on the door.

24:18.406 --> 24:21.243
But the door remained firm,

24:21.243 --> 24:26.248
and they didn’t think 
of shooting into the glass,

24:26.248 --> 24:28.350
because the door had two glass panes

24:28.350 --> 24:32.721
and that would help them 
to get easy access into the building itself.

24:34.289 --> 24:35.757
That was a very close call.

24:35.757 --> 24:36.892
Yes.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.960
So was that the end of it?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.962
No, they came again.

24:40.962 --> 24:43.465
They jumped the fence, 
as you can see in the picture.

24:43.465 --> 24:47.469
And this time, 
about 20 or more well-armed rebels

24:47.469 --> 24:50.038
shot their way into the branch.

24:50.038 --> 24:54.709
They started looting everything in the branch

24:54.709 --> 24:57.112
that they could lay hands on.

24:57.112 --> 24:59.114
It was a big mess.

24:59.114 --> 25:00.916
And that 
must have been absolutely terrifying.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.917
It was.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.153
What happened 
is that the brothers before that time

25:05.153 --> 25:09.291
prepared a safe room for us to hide in,

25:09.291 --> 25:11.493
in case of any emergency.

25:11.493 --> 25:14.629
But that room was never my favorite.

25:14.629 --> 25:17.098
I didn’t want to go into that room.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.601
Did you have another room 
that you thought you might like to go to?

25:19.601 --> 25:22.504
I did. 
I had my room that I preferred.

25:22.504 --> 25:24.539
It had food inside.

25:24.539 --> 25:28.210
It had AC inside 
—very nice and clean.

25:28.210 --> 25:30.946
It was very comfortable for me.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.114
Cecelia, did you tell Laddie about that?

25:33.715 --> 25:34.916
No, I didn’t tell him.

25:34.916 --> 25:36.952
I didn’t mention it to anybody.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.288
I just told Jehovah what I wanted to do,

25:40.288 --> 25:45.126
and I kept telling Him that I hoped 
the brothers would change their decision.

25:46.261 --> 25:47.929
But why didn’t you tell Laddie?

25:47.929 --> 25:52.934
I really didn’t want to influence him 
about how I felt and what I wanted,

25:52.934 --> 25:56.705
because it was not about us;

25:56.705 --> 25:58.740
it was not about me;

25:58.740 --> 26:01.910
it was about Jehovah and his people.

26:01.910 --> 26:03.912
That’s very nice.

26:03.912 --> 26:06.047
Laddie was responsible for many there,

26:06.047 --> 26:08.049
and you didn’t want 
to put that pressure on him.

26:08.049 --> 26:09.918
Very interesting. Thank you.

26:09.918 --> 26:11.386
So, Laddie, what happened now?

26:11.386 --> 26:13.221
You’re down in the room.

26:13.221 --> 26:15.056
What happened next?

26:15.056 --> 26:20.061
We were in that safe room 
trying very hard to stay out of sight,

26:20.061 --> 26:25.066
and one of the rebels came 
to the door where we were hiding

26:25.066 --> 26:27.936
trying to gain access into the room.

26:27.936 --> 26:31.106
While he was pushing on it, 
forcing his way,

26:31.106 --> 26:36.111
I heard one of the other armed men 
yelling at him:

26:36.911 --> 26:40.749
“Come from that place! 
You seem to be too greedy.

26:40.749 --> 26:43.451
We have more than enough. 
Come, let’s go!”

26:43.451 --> 26:45.820
And they just left like that.

26:45.820 --> 26:46.821
You came out then?

26:46.821 --> 26:49.658
No, we were still there 
until the following morning.

26:49.658 --> 26:52.594
It must have been terrifying 
there in that room.

26:52.594 --> 26:55.730
So was that the end then of troubles?

26:55.730 --> 26:57.966
No, that was not the end.

26:57.966 --> 27:02.070
The rebels also launched another operation

27:02.070 --> 27:04.272
known as Operation No Living Thing.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.642
Hang on, Operation No Living Thing.

27:07.642 --> 27:09.644
What would that mean, Laddie?

27:10.312 --> 27:12.881
Well, this was an operation that they decided

27:12.881 --> 27:15.817
to just kill anybody

27:15.817 --> 27:18.753
that came their way, any living thing

27:18.753 --> 27:21.489
—dogs, animals, humans.

27:21.489 --> 27:23.158
They just sprayed it like that.

27:23.158 --> 27:25.193
That was the operation that was launched.

27:25.193 --> 27:26.594
Wow!

27:26.594 --> 27:29.898
You said there were 
other refugees in the missionary homes.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.201
How were they faring at this time?

27:33.201 --> 27:34.469
They were not doing fine.

27:34.469 --> 27:37.639
They were suffering just like us.

27:37.639 --> 27:40.909
But we had some money with us at the branch.

27:40.909 --> 27:44.346
So I decided to take some money for them

27:44.346 --> 27:48.483
because if they have money, 
they can get food to survive.

27:48.483 --> 27:50.518
Although it was expensive

27:50.518 --> 27:54.189
and also very dangerous 
to take such a journey,

27:54.189 --> 27:56.524
Cecelia decided to go with me.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.763
Cecelia, 
why did you decide to go with Laddie?

28:01.763 --> 28:05.333
I decided to go because I thought

28:05.333 --> 28:09.003
if Laddie was willing to die 
for his brothers,

28:09.003 --> 28:12.374
if that’s what it meant 
for him to help them,

28:12.374 --> 28:15.043
then I might as well die with him.

28:15.043 --> 28:18.380
I didn’t want to live 
and have to explain what happened.

28:19.047 --> 28:20.281
Can you tell us, Laddie, what happened?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.549
Were you able to reach the missionary home?

28:22.450 --> 28:26.721
Yes. 
We put the money into a bag,

28:26.721 --> 28:30.625
and because there were a series of roadblocks

28:30.625 --> 28:33.528
—checkpoints—
that we had to go through,

28:33.528 --> 28:36.865
we decided to put some dirty clothes

28:36.865 --> 28:39.567
and stinky rags on top of the money.

28:39.567 --> 28:42.270
That would prevent them 
from going deep down

28:42.270 --> 28:44.305
to get access to the money.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.708
And by having access to the money,

28:46.708 --> 28:49.244
they would either kill us or take the money.

28:49.244 --> 28:52.981
So we made it through several 
of these checkpoints.

28:52.981 --> 28:56.384
As we were approaching the missionary home,

28:56.384 --> 28:58.486
at the last checkpoint there,

28:58.486 --> 29:02.023
we saw a group of boys,

29:02.023 --> 29:04.092
men, and women jubilating

29:04.092 --> 29:05.760
—just jumping up and down in the streets.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.329
You mean celebrating. 
They were celebrating.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.964
What were they celebrating?

29:09.964 --> 29:11.132
Well, they were chanting:

29:11.132 --> 29:14.202
“We’ve dropped the enemy jets. 
We’ve dropped the enemy jets.

29:14.202 --> 29:17.338
We’ve done it again. 
We’re happy.”

29:17.338 --> 29:19.541
What did you do then 
to get through the checkpoint?

29:19.541 --> 29:24.546
So we started to jump up and down 
with them as a strategy

29:24.546 --> 29:27.482
just to get our way 
through to the missionary home.

29:27.482 --> 29:29.484
Ah, so it’s the theocratic strategy.

29:29.484 --> 29:30.485
Yes.

29:30.485 --> 29:32.687
That’s a little bit like David 
when he went to the city of Gath

29:32.687 --> 29:34.189
and disguised his sanity.

29:34.189 --> 29:34.923
OK.

29:34.923 --> 29:36.958
I wonder, though, 
how did you think of that?

29:36.958 --> 29:40.562
Well, it just came spontaneously

29:40.562 --> 29:43.598
that Jehovah directed us to do that

29:43.598 --> 29:45.633
because this was not our plan.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.702
And we were not expecting 
anything like that to happen.

29:48.436 --> 29:49.537
Sure.

29:49.537 --> 29:52.674
Well, Jehovah helps 
in every situation, excellent.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.577
So you got through the checkpoint now.

29:55.577 --> 29:57.779
So, what happened? 
You made it to the missionary home?

29:57.779 --> 29:58.813
Yes.

29:58.813 --> 30:02.283
As we were very close 
to the missionary home,

30:02.283 --> 30:06.721
we threw the bag into the compound

30:06.721 --> 30:09.624
—the missionary home.

30:09.624 --> 30:11.960
The brothers came and took the bag

30:11.960 --> 30:15.697
while we gained access safely 
into the missionary home

30:15.697 --> 30:17.031
and delivered the money.

30:17.031 --> 30:19.567
And we tried to go back to the branch.

30:19.567 --> 30:21.736
And you were able 
to make it back to the branch?

30:21.736 --> 30:22.437
Yes.

30:22.437 --> 30:23.104
Safely?

30:23.104 --> 30:23.738
Yes.

30:23.738 --> 30:27.475
That is an absolutely incredible story, 
Laddie and Cecelia.

30:27.475 --> 30:29.677
Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

30:29.677 --> 30:34.215
Well, we know that in 2002, 
the civil war ended.

30:34.215 --> 30:38.353
And how has Jehovah blessed 
the brothers and sisters in Sierra Leone

30:38.353 --> 30:41.356
after enduring so much since that time?

30:41.356 --> 30:44.125
We have a video 
that we would like to show.

30:44.125 --> 30:45.426
Do you want to see it?

30:45.426 --> 30:47.395
I thought you might have one. 
I’d love to see it.

30:47.395 --> 30:49.397
OK, let’s watch.

30:50.632 --> 30:54.068
Many believe that some 200 years ago,

30:54.068 --> 30:58.239
freed American slaves 
founded Freetown under this cotton tree.

31:00.041 --> 31:02.176
For nearly a hundred years,

31:02.176 --> 31:04.712
Jehovah’s Witnesses have comforted people

31:04.712 --> 31:07.415
with hope of a better freedom

31:07.415 --> 31:10.652
—“the glorious freedom 
of the children of God.”

31:12.720 --> 31:16.758
During the 11-year civil war,

31:16.758 --> 31:18.726
700 people were baptized.

31:18.726 --> 31:21.996
And since the war’s end in 2002,

31:21.996 --> 31:25.633
the number of publishers 
has more than doubled.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.772
Here at the branch, we welcome visitors

31:30.772 --> 31:33.241
to see how we are serving Jehovah

31:33.241 --> 31:35.243
and caring for people’s spiritual needs.

31:37.111 --> 31:39.814
Where soldiers once ransacked,

31:39.814 --> 31:42.750
literature is being shipped 
to 40 congregations.

31:45.019 --> 31:48.990
Other Bethelites continue to work hard 
for Kingdom interests.

31:50.658 --> 31:53.027
This is Edward,

31:53.027 --> 31:55.797
a hardworking brother in the Bethel Office.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.300
He was one of the many 
who found refuge at the branch.

32:00.902 --> 32:04.138
Back then, 
someone told him to always remember

32:04.138 --> 32:06.174
how Jehovah protected and fed him.

32:06.741 --> 32:08.776
He did remember.

32:09.944 --> 32:12.413
And he serves with joy, 
along with his brothers

32:12.413 --> 32:14.849
and sisters in Sierra Leone.

32:25.827 --> 32:27.095
Thank you so much for that.

32:27.095 --> 32:30.365
Jehovah really has blessed 
the brothers and sisters in Sierra Leone.

32:30.365 --> 32:33.601
Now, you two, 
through your experience, endured so much.

32:33.601 --> 32:35.603
I wonder if you could share with us

32:35.603 --> 32:38.940
some of the lessons 
that you learned from your experience.

32:38.940 --> 32:40.942
Cecelia, what would you say?

32:40.942 --> 32:43.277
For me, it’s obedience.

32:43.277 --> 32:45.980
I forcefully—

32:45.980 --> 32:49.984
I forced myself to obey 
when the brothers said

32:49.984 --> 32:52.920
to go into that room that I didn’t like.

32:52.920 --> 32:56.858
And I’m glad that I forced myself to obey

32:56.858 --> 32:59.627
because as things turned out,

32:59.627 --> 33:02.630
the room that I really, really preferred

33:02.630 --> 33:05.366
was the worst damaged in the branch.

33:05.366 --> 33:07.669
The food was all taken away.

33:07.669 --> 33:10.705
They destroyed the door; 
they gained access inside;

33:10.705 --> 33:12.707
they destroyed the air conditioner.

33:12.707 --> 33:16.978
They destroyed everything 
beyond repair in that room.

33:16.978 --> 33:19.147
Obedience saves our lives.

33:19.147 --> 33:21.149
And we’re really happy too, Cecelia.

33:21.149 --> 33:23.317
And I understand that that other room

33:23.317 --> 33:25.853
now is your favorite room.

33:25.853 --> 33:28.256
It is my favorite. 
That’s where the commissary is.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.060
And the very spot where we were hiding,

33:32.060 --> 33:34.095
that’s where they put the bread shelf.

33:34.095 --> 33:37.265
When I collect my bread, 
I remember my story.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.002
Laddie, what would you say?

33:41.002 --> 33:43.204
What lesson did you learn?

33:43.204 --> 33:45.907
No matter how challenging 
the assignments may seem

33:45.907 --> 33:48.409
or how dangerous 
the situation may seem,

33:48.409 --> 33:52.080
Jehovah is there 
—and the international brotherhood too.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.416
Their prayers in our behalf help us.

33:55.416 --> 33:59.420
And if any other assignment

33:59.420 --> 34:01.456
like that comes our way,

34:01.456 --> 34:05.293
we’re willing to take it up 
because Jehovah is there for us.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.795
And our brothers 
will also pray in our behalf.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.164
Thank you so much, Laddie and Cecelia,

34:10.164 --> 34:12.500
for sharing 
your beautiful experience with us.

34:22.343 --> 34:24.445
It has been a very encouraging program,

34:24.445 --> 34:26.948
and we are so happy 
to have been able to get to know some

34:26.948 --> 34:30.184
of the members 
of the 144th class of Gilead.

34:30.184 --> 34:33.187
We look forward to seeing 
and hearing experiences

34:33.187 --> 34:35.356
of our brothers and sisters 
living their faith

34:35.356 --> 34:39.193
and displaying courage 
and enduring in their service to Jehovah.

34:39.193 --> 34:41.195
We thank you very much for being with us,

34:41.195 --> 35:05.313
and we look forward to seeing you 
on another edition of The Inside Story.

Now we come to the principal talk

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the graduation.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to be delivered by a member

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:10.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body, 
Brother Stephen Lett.

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the very interesting theme 
he has selected is

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We Can Learn Much From Peter!”

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear Gilead students,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:33.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let me ask you,
Who is your favorite Bible character?

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, during Gilead,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve examined many Bible characters;

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:43.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve learned
positive and negative lessons from them.

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:46.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps your favorite character changed,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remained the same,

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or now you have 
several favorite Bible characters.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter who your favorite character is,

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this talk, we’re going to learn

00:00:58.908 --> 00:01:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of the many lessons to be learned

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:06.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the very interesting Bible character Peter.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now first, let’s learn some things

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can learn
about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing we definitely learn

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:21.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that Jehovah and Jesus allow for

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in fact, apparently relish—

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different personalities among their servants.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate this,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:32.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s contrast the personality of Peter

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that of some of the other apostles.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to John chapter 20,

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s a very interesting little scripture

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlighting two different personalities.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:48.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 20:3:

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:53.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Peter and the other disciple
[who would be John]

00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:55.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“set out for the tomb.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The two of them began running together,

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:03.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the other disciple ran faster than Peter 
and reached the tomb first.

00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:08.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stooping forward,
he saw the linen cloths lying there,

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he did not go in.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:15.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Simon Peter also came, following him,

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he went into the tomb.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he saw the linen cloths lying there.”

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:28.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So John looked inside; Peter rushed inside.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another example:

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the mob came
to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 18:10

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that Peter drew his sword

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cut the right ear
of the slave of the high priest off.

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:49.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s think about this.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Peter
was going for that right ear?

00:02:54.224 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that would truly be impressive
—wouldn’t it?—

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go for that right ear and precisely take it off.

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:06.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, Peter was not a swordsman;

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:09.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a fisherman.

00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:13.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, he was going
for the man’s head, wasn’t he?

00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he missed and took the ear off.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what an impetuous,

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say, personality he had there!

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one more example:

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The resurrected Jesus

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:29.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on the shore of the Sea of Galilee;

00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the disciples are in the boat;

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and John says to Peter, “It is the Lord.”

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:38.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, upon hearing this,
Peter put his garment on

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and plunged into the sea.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other disciples came in the boat.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice,

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John spoke; Peter plunged.

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other disciples came in the boat;
Peter came swimming.

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:57.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very different personalities

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but, as we said,
Jehovah and Jesus relish

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:04.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these different personalities
among their servants.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what’s the lesson for us?

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in imitation of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re obligated

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:15.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “have love
for the whole association of [our] brothers.”

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:17.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 2:17.

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “whole” means 100 percent.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:24.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that certainly includes those
with very different personalities from ourselves

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ones from different cultures and backgrounds.

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re obligated to receive these ones

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into our company,
into our homes, into our hearts.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:40.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ve done a lot of this
in the last five months,

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you Gilead students.

00:04:42.165 --> 00:04:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you want to keep doing this

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:47.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, all of us want to do this.

00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:51.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s another thing we learn
about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter.

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:55.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are very forgiving.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s think about Jesus’ words

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 10:33.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In plain words

00:05:03.653 --> 00:05:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and our publications have said

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably plain Hebrew words,
it would have been—

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever disowns me before men,

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will also disown him

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before my Father who is in the heavens.”

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not once, not twice,
but three times Peter did it, didn’t he?

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet Jehovah and Jesus
completely forgave him

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was truly repentant.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, to somewhat counterbalance
what Peter had done,

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus allowed Peter

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reaffirm his love for Jesus three times.

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the lesson for us?

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must imitate Jehovah and Jesus

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being very forgiving.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Jehovah makes it clear
that He will forgive us

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:54.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in direct proportion to how we forgive others.

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t forgive others,
Jehovah won’t forgive us.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where does that leave us?

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:01.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doomed.

00:06:01.544 --> 00:06:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s say we do forgive,

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re pretty tight;
we’re pretty stingy.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s kind of hard to squeeze
a little forgiveness out of us.

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the indication is that Jehovah puts

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that same ruler on us that we put on others.

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
if we’re very generous in forgiving,

00:06:19.162 --> 00:06:22.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now Jehovah can be 
very generous in forgiving us.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if someone hurt you deeply

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—has sinned against you—

00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t view this as a bad thing;

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
view this as a big opportunity.

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got a big opportunity

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get a lot of forgiveness from Jehovah,

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so cash in on that opportunity.

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in addition to what we can learn

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter,

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many lessons (positive and negative)

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can learn from Peter himself.

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:54.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s a negative lesson:

00:06:56.466 --> 00:07:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, Peter spoke too quickly.

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:05.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had what has been called
hoof-and-mouth disease.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:07.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:09.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open mouth; insert foot.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:13.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of us
have the same problem, don’t we?

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:16.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s an example in Matthew chapter 16.

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:20.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was explaining
that he would have to go to Jerusalem,

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suffer many things, and be killed.

00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, quickly Peter spoke up,

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:27.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he actually rebuked Jesus

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if you can imagine that.

00:07:30.032 --> 00:07:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be kind to yourself, Lord;

00:07:33.236 --> 00:07:36.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not have this happen to you at all.”

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:39.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hoof-and-mouth disease
—wasn’t it?—

00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:42.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
followed by, as you could expect,

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some correction, humiliation:

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Get behind me, Satan!”

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the indication is

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even though Peter
had this problem, he overcame it.

00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He overcame this.

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several times he spoke too quickly.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at 1 Peter 3:10,

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:05.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was able to write 
with freeness of speech,

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know,
and he would have lived up to this:

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever would love life and see good days

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must guard his tongue.”

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he learned.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took time.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He learned just like we’re all learning.

00:08:20.183 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what’s the lesson for us?

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s summed up nicely here
in Proverbs chapter 18.

00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:26.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go there.

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 18:13:

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anyone replies
to a matter before he hears the facts,

00:08:34.297 --> 00:08:38.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is foolish and humiliating.”

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So none of us can perfectly bridle our tongues.

00:08:42.672 --> 00:08:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do well to try to restrain our lips,

00:08:46.209 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least until we’ve heard the facts.

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another negative lesson:

00:08:52.081 --> 00:08:55.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, Peter was overconfident.

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most notorious example

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew chapter 26:

00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although all the others
are stumbled in connection with you,

00:09:05.561 --> 00:09:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will never be stumbled!

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if I should have to die with you,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will by no means disown you.”

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was overconfidence, wasn’t it?

00:09:16.839 --> 00:09:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know it was ‘pride before the crash.’

00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was his problem?

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was relying,
at this point, on himself

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than Jehovah.

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But again, the indication is very strong

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he overcame that weakness.

00:09:33.222 --> 00:09:36.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, he was able to write at 1 Peter 5:6:

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Humble yourselves, therefore,
under the mighty hand of God.”

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:43.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t rely on yourself.

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:46.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be humble under Jehovah’s hand.

00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the lesson for us?

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like we learned at our convention

00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the last talk on Saturday—

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:57.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that true courage is not self-reliance.

00:09:57.747 --> 00:10:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True courage must be based

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on modest reliance on Jehovah.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we lean on ourselves,
or rely on ourselves,

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like leaning,
you could say, on a rubber crutch.

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you ever lean on a rubber crutch?

00:10:16.232 --> 00:10:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to fall, aren’t you?

00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at Deuteronomy 32:4,
Jehovah is “the Rock.”

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you lean on a rock,
now you have something.

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we learn that from Peter:

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t rely on yourself;
rely always on Jehovah.

00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s one more negative lesson:

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, Peter was ensnared

00:10:37.153 --> 00:10:39.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fear of man

00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:42.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, we could say, 
in his most infamous example,

00:10:42.491 --> 00:10:44.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fear of girl.

00:10:47.096 --> 00:10:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, in Matthew 26:

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:55.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Peter was sitting outside
and a servant girl came up and said to him:

00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:59.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“You too were with Jesus the Galilean!”

00:10:59.175 --> 00:11:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But he denied it.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:04.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“I do not know what you’re talking about.”

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He went out to the gatehouse;
another girl noticed him.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“This man was with Jesus.”

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again he denied it, even with an oath.’

00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:20.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his first two denials,
you could say, were fear of girl.

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:26.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is obviously clear

00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he truly overcame
that weakness, that problem,

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he became

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an outspoken, bold Witness
of Jehovah and Jesus.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think, for example, in Acts chapter 5,

00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Peter and the other apostles
were in front of the Sanhedrin,

00:11:45.087 --> 00:11:48.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the high priest said:
‘We ordered you

00:11:48.157 --> 00:11:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to quit teaching about this Jesus.’

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter said:
“We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:02.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And furthermore, this Jesus,
God has raised him from the dead.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:06.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This one that you killed.’

00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:08.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:12:08.677 --> 00:12:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No fear of man there, was there?

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He obviously overcame this problem.

00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s the lesson for us?

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to do our utmost to never be ensnared

00:12:20.523 --> 00:12:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fear of men, women, or girls.

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, always remembering

00:12:28.798 --> 00:12:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s Jehovah’s rating of us
that counts will help us.

00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humans can’t add five seconds
to their life, can they?

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:39.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can add or subtract eternity.

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:41.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, we’re going to move

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to some positive lessons
we can learn from Peter.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by far, his positive qualities

00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:51.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outweigh the negative qualities
that he displayed at times.

00:12:51.554 --> 00:12:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s one:
Peter waited on Jehovah.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:13:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a wonderful example
of this is in John chapter 6.

00:13:01.564 --> 00:13:05.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had stated
that unless you eat my flesh

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and drink my blood,

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not have everlasting life.

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible says
that many of the disciples were shocked;

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were stumbled;
they quit following Jesus.

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus said to Peter,
‘Do you want to leave also, Peter?’

00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:25.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember those beautiful words
coming out of Peter’s mouth?

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:29.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lord, whom shall we go away to?

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:33.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have [the] sayings of everlasting life.”

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you think about it,
Peter didn’t understand Jesus’ words

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:39.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at this point any more than the rest did,

00:13:39.468 --> 00:13:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was willing to wait
on Jehovah for further enlightenment.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in time, he learned that those words

00:13:47.142 --> 00:13:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have to be understood figuratively

00:13:49.178 --> 00:13:51.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we have to exercise faith

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ flesh and blood.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the lesson for us?

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Peter, we must show

00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a waiting attitude
for the “God of [our] salvation.”

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Micah 7:7.

00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:07.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here are just a few examples:

00:14:07.897 --> 00:14:11.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we willing to wait
—and this was touched on earlier in our program—

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
willing to wait with the right attitude

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:17.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any theocratic appointment,

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:20.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or privilege of service?

00:14:20.242 --> 00:14:22.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another example:

00:14:22.244 --> 00:14:27.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we willing to wait uncomplainingly
on Jehovah to correct

00:14:27.082 --> 00:14:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in his way, his time—

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any injustice that we perceive
in the congregation?

00:14:34.523 --> 00:14:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about this?

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we willing to wait patiently

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this could apply   
to some of the single ones—

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:43.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you willing to wait patiently on Jehovah

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:47.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide you a suitable marriage mate,

00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if you have to wait until the new world?

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, like Peter, let’s have a waiting attitude.

00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
here’s another positive lesson from Peter:

00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to make progress spiritually,

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was willing to move out of his comfort zones.

00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:08.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s get some examples.

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:13.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When invited, he promptly left
a life of pursuing material things

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:17.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a life of storing up treasure in heaven.

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:21.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And apparently,
he was an older man when he did this.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did not put
financial security ahead of following the Christ.

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:28.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or here’s another example:

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went from being
an unlettered, ordinary fisherman,

00:15:31.714 --> 00:15:36.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably talking primarily
to hired men and fish merchants,

00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being a bold Witness

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an unpopular message before thousands.

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:46.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One more example:

00:15:46.128 --> 00:15:48.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went from being very prejudiced

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:52.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Samaritans and Gentiles

00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:57.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to truly loving
his Samaritan and Gentile brothers.

00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the lesson for us?

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:03.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we willing to move out of our comfort zones

00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to make spiritual progress?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, all of you,
you know where your comfort zones are.

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:13.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But are you willing to move out
in order to make spiritual progress?

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about, in some cases,
especially if you’re given an assignment,

00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:20.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you willing to go
where the need is greater,

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah wants you to go?

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about reaching out
for various forms of the ministry

00:16:26.268 --> 00:16:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may not right now feel
so comfortable with

00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:33.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe public witnessing
or working business territory?

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:38.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about being
more courageous in informal witnessing,

00:16:38.213 --> 00:16:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though you may be
a quiet and shy type of person?

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:46.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s get
another positive lesson from Peter.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:49.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed discipline

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold rather than stumble him.

00:16:54.563 --> 00:16:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all the apostles,
he was the most outspoken, wasn’t he?

00:16:59.068 --> 00:17:03.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was matched
by his being the most frequently corrected,

00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:06.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reproved, rebuked.

00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But beautifully, he didn’t quit.

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:12.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up, did he?

00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:16.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we touched on this before,
when Jesus said, “Get behind me, Satan!”

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t read
that he pouted for weeks or months

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of that strong correction.

00:17:22.391 --> 00:17:25.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Bible indicates that six days later,

00:17:25.561 --> 00:17:28.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus took Peter, James, and John

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:31.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up into a mountain
to experience the transfiguration.

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:35.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about after Peter denied Jesus?

00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:39.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us 
that Jesus looked straight at Peter

00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:42.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in effect, indirect discipline.

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter recalled what Jesus said.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went outside, and he wept bitterly.

00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet you don’t read
that he kept beating himself

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he kept being depressed
over his serious sin of denying Jesus.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew Jehovah and Jesus had forgiven him.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he put it behind him
—didn’t he?—

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he moved ahead.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the lesson for us?

00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah disciplines those he loves.

00:18:09.738 --> 00:18:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t ever let 
that discipline harden or embitter you.

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:17.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let it soften you into a better person.

00:18:17.813 --> 00:18:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’ve committed sins in the past,

00:18:20.082 --> 00:18:22.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even serious sins, like Peter,

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s put them behind us and move ahead.

00:18:26.922 --> 00:18:31.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one more positive lesson
we’re going to talk about from Peter:

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gained and then he maintained

00:18:35.764 --> 00:18:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true humility.

00:18:37.833 --> 00:18:41.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true that he 
had to really work hard to gain it, didn’t he?

00:18:41.303 --> 00:18:44.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to work at it
because he and the other apostles

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:46.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been taught from infancy

00:18:46.608 --> 00:18:50.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strive to be the greatest
—seek prominence.

00:18:50.078 --> 00:18:53.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really indoctrinated
into their minds and hearts.

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And up until the very last night
of Jesus’ life on the earth,

00:18:58.287 --> 00:19:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter still had a problem
—didn’t he?—

00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:01.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other apostles too.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a problem.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was washing the feet.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:11.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 13
—Peter had not volunteered to do this

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:14.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even after Jesus started washing the feet.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought about that?

00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you don’t think of something
until someone else starts doing it,

00:19:19.975 --> 00:19:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you think,
‘Oh, well, let me help you with that.’

00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:24.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Peter say: ‘Oh. Oh, Lord.

00:19:24.746 --> 00:19:26.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I see you’re washing these feet here.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me help you.
Let me catch a couple of feet for you.’

00:19:31.854 --> 00:19:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No. 
Neither he nor any of the apostles volunteered.

00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:39.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They still had a problem at this point.

00:19:39.027 --> 00:19:43.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help and effort on his part,

00:19:43.532 --> 00:19:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time, he truly developed true humility.

00:19:47.536 --> 00:19:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went from the one striving to be the greatest

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:54.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the humbled man who lifted up Cornelius

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Cornelius tried to bow down to him.

00:19:57.646 --> 00:20:00.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that account in Acts chapter 10?

00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Peter lifted him up, saying:

00:20:03.018 --> 00:20:07.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Rise; I too am just a man.’”

00:20:08.557 --> 00:20:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about his genuine humility

00:20:10.993 --> 00:20:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the apostle Paul corrected him publicly

00:20:14.196 --> 00:20:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of the whole congregation?

00:20:16.198 --> 00:20:18.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if he would have still had pride—

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:22.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, who are you, Paul, to give me correction?

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:25.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve been in the truth a lot longer than you have.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When you were persecuting the Christians,

00:20:27.442 --> 00:20:29.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I was an apostle.

00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:33.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And furthermore,
you could have at least talked to me privately,

00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:35.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in front of the whole congregation.’

00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, he knew he was clearly wrong.

00:20:39.755 --> 00:20:42.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He deserved the counsel
no matter how it was given.

00:20:42.591 --> 00:20:44.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made the correction,

00:20:44.593 --> 00:20:48.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he harbored no grudge.

00:20:48.096 --> 00:20:50.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the indication is very powerful

00:20:50.899 --> 00:20:53.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he remained humble

00:20:53.101 --> 00:20:55.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite his many privileges.

00:20:55.704 --> 00:21:00.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, looking back over his life,
he had had many, many privileges.

00:21:00.142 --> 00:21:01.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He walked on water, at least for a few minutes;

00:21:06.782 --> 00:21:09.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw Jesus transfigured;

00:21:09.885 --> 00:21:14.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he performed many miracles,
including personally resurrecting Dorcas;

00:21:14.756 --> 00:21:18.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he received and used “the keys of the Kingdom”;

00:21:18.493 --> 00:21:20.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped many people into the truth.

00:21:20.929 --> 00:21:23.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But yet he remained truly humble

00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:26.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and could write with freeness of speech

00:21:26.468 --> 00:21:28.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his inspired letter,

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Peter 5:5,

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:35.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these beautiful words that we read very often.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“But all of you clothe yourselves

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:43.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with humility toward one another,

00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:47.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because God opposes the haughty ones,

00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:51.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he gives
undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where is Peter right now?

00:21:54.129 --> 00:21:56.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An immortal spirit

00:21:56.865 --> 00:22:00.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as one of the “12 foundation stones”

00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:03.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Messianic Kingdom.

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the lesson for us?

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:10.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must gain true humility like Peter did.

00:22:10.645 --> 00:22:15.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, if you think about it,
we’re absolutely unusable by Jehovah.

00:22:15.317 --> 00:22:18.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, we must remain humble

00:22:18.653 --> 00:22:23.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what privileges
we may or may not receive,

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Jehovah will never oppose us.

00:22:27.396 --> 00:22:32.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we will continue to receive
undeserved kindness from him.

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our discussion has highlighted

00:22:36.171 --> 00:22:41.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a few of the many lessons
to be learned from Peter.

00:22:41.176 --> 00:22:44.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that if you Gilead students
—soon-to-be graduates—

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make Peter a study project,

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:51.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could learn
many, many more valuable lessons

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course,
that’s true of many other Bible characters.

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:59.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But unquestionably,
there is so much to learn

00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the faithful, colorful, human apostle Peter.

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:15.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we come 
to the point where we’re going to make

00:23:15.277 --> 00:23:17.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the presentation of the diplomas,

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“To the Governing Body 
and the Bethel Family.

00:29:47.469 --> 00:29:50.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Dear Brothers: Five months ago,

00:29:50.605 --> 00:29:54.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we arrived with excitement 
from the four corners of the earth.

“We anxiously waited 
to be molded into the people

“that our Father, Jehovah, 
knew we could become.

“Despite denied visas, 
health issues, and insecurities,

00:30:05.854 --> 00:30:09.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were prepared 
to be taught by our Grand Instructor.

“Even after enrollment, 
further challenges presented themselves.

00:30:13.995 --> 00:30:17.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a class, we fought measles,

00:30:17.365 --> 00:30:21.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“endured quarantine, survived tornadoes,

00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:24.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nursed broken bones,

00:30:24.272 --> 00:30:27.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and comforted each other 
in the face of bereavement.

00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:31.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, these hurdles 
did not hamper us;

00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:34.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they drew us closer together as siblings

00:30:34.182 --> 00:30:36.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to our Father, Jehovah.

00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:39.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Isaiah gave us a glimpse 
into a heavenly school

“when he described the training Jesus 
was then receiving from Jehovah

“to prepare him for his earthly assignment.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Jesus’ special education saying:

“‘he awakens my ear 
to listen like the taught ones.’

00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus knew very well 
the purpose of his training:

00:31:01.976 --> 00:31:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘So that [he] may know how to answer 
the tired one with the right word.’

“Out of deep love and appreciation,

00:31:09.617 --> 00:31:12.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became 
the perfect reflection of his Father.

00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:16.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We too know very well 
the purpose of the loving training

00:31:16.324 --> 00:31:18.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we have received here at Gilead

00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:22.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—to answer the tired one, 
not out of our own thoughts,

“but with the words 
taught to us through God’s Word.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many in the brotherhood 
are like a smoldering wick

“and at times feel crushed in spirit.

00:31:31.573 --> 00:31:34.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus loved and cared for such ones.

“We are determined 
to reflect the love Jesus developed

“and refreshment to our brothers.

“for all that has been done for us.

welcomed us into their home

to a degree that we never imagined.

“The winsome words 
we received through the curriculum

the 145th Class of Gilead.”

00:33:26.921 --> 00:33:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is my opportunity

00:33:28.956 --> 00:33:31.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to say just a few final words to you.

00:33:31.926 --> 00:33:34.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been so many wonderful points

00:33:34.128 --> 00:33:36.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned on our program today.

00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember how
we started with our discussion

00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the need
to always bring glory to Jehovah

00:33:43.137 --> 00:33:45.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to be concerned
about our own glory.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember
we started off by mentioning

00:33:48.176 --> 00:33:50.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe it could be tempting

00:33:50.578 --> 00:33:53.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept glory
from others if they praise us.

00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:56.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then on the other hand,
if we get criticized,

00:33:56.384 --> 00:34:00.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may also be tempting
for us to try and justify ourselves

00:34:00.488 --> 00:34:04.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inadvertently bring glory to ourselves.

00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:08.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is another way too
that we may have to be careful

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:11.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about not bringing glory to ourselves.

00:34:11.265 --> 00:34:13.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can see this

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the example of the apostle Paul.

00:34:15.837 --> 00:34:17.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I know you didn’t bring your Bibles up.

00:34:17.705 --> 00:34:19.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All you have to do is listen.

00:34:19.607 --> 00:34:23.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one scripture, 1 Corinthians chapter 2

00:34:23.611 --> 00:34:26.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 2:1, 2.

00:34:26.247 --> 00:34:29.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a vital lesson
that we learn from the apostle Paul.

00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:33.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here he’s speaking
about when he went to Corinth.

00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:36.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we realize,
Corinth was a seat of learning.

00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:38.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greeks loved learning.

00:34:38.726 --> 00:34:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he say?

00:34:40.394 --> 00:34:42.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 1 and 2:

00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:44.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when I came to you, brothers,

00:34:44.799 --> 00:34:48.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I did not come with extravagant speech

00:34:48.803 --> 00:34:52.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or wisdom declaring 
the sacred secret of God to you.”

00:34:52.874 --> 00:34:54.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul didn’t use

00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:58.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“extravagant speech” to impress people.

00:34:58.279 --> 00:35:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says in verse 2: “For I decided.”

00:35:01.749 --> 00:35:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he made a decision.

00:35:03.751 --> 00:35:04.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:35:04.952 --> 00:35:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I decided not to know anything

00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:10.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among you except Jesus Christ.”

00:35:10.224 --> 00:35:12.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then if we look at verse 5,

00:35:12.894 --> 00:35:15.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “So that your faith [may] be,

00:35:15.797 --> 00:35:19.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.”

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:22.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful example Paul set

00:35:22.303 --> 00:35:24.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to not drawing attention

00:35:24.772 --> 00:35:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his own wisdom and ability,

00:35:27.642 --> 00:35:30.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though some
in Corinth because of this

00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:33.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt he wasn’t a very good speaker.

00:35:33.114 --> 00:35:36.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at how
Paul defended the good news

00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:39.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before audiences large and small,

00:35:39.287 --> 00:35:43.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he certainly was a very, very good orator.

00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:46.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had that ability, but he decided

00:35:46.127 --> 00:35:48.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tone it down

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he knew
the brothers there had a weakness.

00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:55.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what weaknesses
were prevalent at that time?

00:35:55.136 --> 00:35:57.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, among the Jewish people

00:35:57.305 --> 00:36:00.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and there were some Jewish people
there in Corinth as well—

00:36:00.374 --> 00:36:04.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they loved to quote great rabbis

00:36:04.478 --> 00:36:06.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and scholars.

00:36:06.848 --> 00:36:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, the Greeks loved
to quote the philosophers.

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:15.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what lesson
do you think we learn from this?

00:36:15.122 --> 00:36:17.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now as you go to your assignments,

00:36:17.992 --> 00:36:21.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps you might be tempted to say:

00:36:21.128 --> 00:36:24.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh! The instructor

00:36:24.365 --> 00:36:28.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a Governing Body member said this.”

00:36:30.171 --> 00:36:32.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why should we follow

00:36:32.306 --> 00:36:34.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the example of the apostle Paul?

00:36:34.475 --> 00:36:37.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you see,
if we have something worthwhile

00:36:37.678 --> 00:36:39.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey to the brothers and sisters,

00:36:39.947 --> 00:36:42.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find it in God’s Word
as you’ve been searching.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look in the library—Watchtower Library.

00:36:45.419 --> 00:36:48.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find something there, but don’t rely

00:36:48.122 --> 00:36:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon the “rabbis,”

00:36:51.259 --> 00:36:54.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “gurus,”

00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:57.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show that you have
some inside knowledge

00:36:57.398 --> 00:37:01.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cannot be verified
by other mere mortals.

00:37:01.535 --> 00:37:05.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, rely upon God’s Word.

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:08.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, rely on his Word and the publications

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:10.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have through his organization,

00:37:10.378 --> 00:37:12.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in that way, you can be sure

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will bring glory to Jehovah

00:37:15.182 --> 00:37:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to yourselves.

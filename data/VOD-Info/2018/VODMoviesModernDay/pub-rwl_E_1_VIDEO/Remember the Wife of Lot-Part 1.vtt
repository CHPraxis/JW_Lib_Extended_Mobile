00:11.365 --> 00:14.285
“No one can slave for two masters; 


00:14.285 --> 00:17.287
“for either he will hate the one 
and love the other, 


00:17.287 --> 00:20.917
“or he will stick to the one 
and despise the other. 


00:20.917 --> 00:24.587
You cannot slave for God
and for Riches.”


00:24.587 --> 00:26.880
Oh, excuse me, 
I have to talk to other clients as well.


00:26.880 --> 00:27.632
OK, thank you.


00:27.632 --> 00:32.260
I thought I could do both, 
but tonight I had to make a choice.


00:32.260 --> 00:34.263
How is it going, everyone? 


00:34.263 --> 00:35.263
Are you guys doing OK?


00:35.263 --> 00:36.973
Oh, yes, good. 


00:36.973 --> 00:39.893
When is Marty going to be here? 


00:39.893 --> 00:43.188
He was supposed to show me 
some other offerings in this building.


00:43.188 --> 00:45.856
Yes, Marty will be here
very soon, Sir. 


00:45.857 --> 00:48.194
Um, would you
care for another glass of wine?


00:48.193 --> 00:49.986
Ah, no, I don’t have much time. 


00:49.987 --> 00:51.322
I can’t stay long. 


00:51.322 --> 00:54.000
I have another
important meeting tonight.


00:56.785 --> 00:59.872
Everyone had tried to warn me. 


00:59.872 --> 01:02.000
They told me to remember, 


01:04.835 --> 01:07.000
to “remember the wife of Lot.”


01:31.320 --> 01:32.780
You can do it. 


01:32.780 --> 01:33.780
OK. 
Keep practicing, OK?


01:33.780 --> 01:34.615
OK.


01:34.615 --> 01:35.000
All right. 


01:37.533 --> 01:39.745
Oh, Tina, you already
started the rice.


01:39.745 --> 01:41.080
Uh-huh, I’m almost done.


01:41.080 --> 01:42.205
Good, good. 


01:42.205 --> 01:45.625
We are going to make your 
grandma’s special vegetable patty today.


01:45.625 --> 01:46.460
OK.


01:46.460 --> 01:47.335
Do you want to help me?


01:47.335 --> 01:48.587
Sure.


01:48.587 --> 01:50.714
Hey, girls, I’m home!


01:50.713 --> 01:51.340
Hey.


01:51.340 --> 01:52.925
Hi, Dad.


01:52.925 --> 01:54.968
Wow, you guys are busy. 


01:54.968 --> 01:57.261
Hey, Gloria, 
you went out in service today. 


01:57.262 --> 01:58.264
How did it go?


01:58.263 --> 02:00.431
Oh, yes, we had a really nice time. 


02:00.432 --> 02:02.852
I had some nice calls 
over on the east side of town.


02:02.852 --> 02:03.560
Oh, really?


02:03.560 --> 02:04.018
Yeah.


02:04.018 --> 02:05.811
Hey, you know, um, Joe?


02:05.812 --> 02:06.355
Yeah.


02:06.355 --> 02:08.190
The contractor I’ve been doing 
accounts for all these years?


02:08.190 --> 02:09.190
Uh-huh.


02:09.190 --> 02:11.193
Well, I got a chance
to witness to him today, 


02:11.193 --> 02:13.320
and he agreed to start a study.


02:13.320 --> 02:15.072
Wow, Dad, that’s awesome!


02:15.072 --> 02:16.324
Oh, that’s great! 


02:16.323 --> 02:17.531
I hope it works out.


02:17.532 --> 02:18.784
Yeah, I do too. 


02:18.783 --> 02:19.743
Ooh, what’s that? 


02:19.743 --> 02:20.743
Ooh, this looks good.


02:20.743 --> 02:23.038
Hey. 
You can wait a little bit.


02:23.038 --> 02:27.083
I don’t know what you’re making, 
but I’m sure it’s really good.


02:27.083 --> 02:29.293
Well, if you let us finish making it.


02:29.293 --> 02:31.296
Uh, OK, all right, all right, I give up. 
I give up. 


02:31.297 --> 02:32.799
I’m going to work on the budget. 


02:32.798 --> 02:34.550
OK, so just call me when it’s ready, 
all right?


02:34.550 --> 02:36.010
OK. 
Sure. 


02:36.010 --> 02:39.513
Oh, Tina, by the way, 
is your talk ready? 


02:39.513 --> 02:42.056
The circuit overseer will be there, 
so you want it to be perfect.


02:42.057 --> 02:43.392
It will be. 


02:43.392 --> 02:45.769
But that’s not until
next week anyway.


02:45.768 --> 02:47.771
How about your schoolwork?


02:47.772 --> 02:49.000
Already done.


03:02.660 --> 03:04.000
What’s that? 


03:11.545 --> 03:13.172
Hey, Dad? 


03:13.172 --> 03:16.509
There’s some strange man 
walking into our building.


03:16.508 --> 03:18.000
Strange man? 


03:24.348 --> 03:27.000
It’s OK, I’ll-I’ll—
Let me check. 


03:32.065 --> 03:33.692
It’s OK. 
It’s Joe.


03:33.692 --> 03:36.195
Joe? Why-
why is he coming here?


03:36.195 --> 03:37.237
I didn’t tell you. 


03:37.237 --> 03:38.947
Yeah, he’s going to pick up 
his books for the study. 


03:38.947 --> 03:39.574
All right?


03:39.573 --> 03:41.000
All right.


03:42.827 --> 03:44.829
Joe, thanks for coming over, man. 


03:44.828 --> 03:45.745
Yeah, come on in.


03:45.745 --> 03:46.372
Hey.


03:46.372 --> 03:48.374
Oh, if you don’t mind, 
can you take off your shoes? 


03:48.373 --> 03:50.708
You can just put them 
on the rack over here.


03:50.708 --> 03:51.876
Serious?


03:51.877 --> 03:53.879
Yeah. 
This is where we put all our shoes.


03:53.878 --> 03:54.880
All right.


03:54.880 --> 03:56.000
Yeah. 


03:57.842 --> 03:59.552
OK. 
Those are nice boots.


03:59.552 --> 04:00.594
Yep, thanks.


04:00.593 --> 04:01.845
I want you to meet my family. 


04:01.845 --> 04:05.057
This is, ah, 
this is my wife, Gloria.


04:05.057 --> 04:06.057
What’s up?


04:06.057 --> 04:07.517
And our daughters, 


04:07.517 --> 04:08.269
Tina and Anna.


04:08.268 --> 04:08.685
Hi.


04:08.685 --> 04:09.018
Hi.


04:09.018 --> 04:11.020
Yep, hello.


04:11.020 --> 04:13.023
OK. 
Why don’t we come into my office?


04:13.023 --> 04:13.856
Uh-huh.


04:13.857 --> 04:14.609
All right, come on over.


04:14.608 --> 04:16.000
OK.


04:17.027 --> 04:19.029
All right, here’s a chair. 


04:19.028 --> 04:21.156
Let’s see, let me get that for you. 


04:21.157 --> 04:22.867
And you can take a seat. 


04:22.867 --> 04:25.000
And, oh, before you do, 
can you grab the door? 


04:26.995 --> 04:28.000
Yeah. 


04:32.333 --> 04:34.335
Cozy, isn’t it?


04:34.335 --> 04:36.963
How do you get anything
done in here, man?


04:36.963 --> 04:38.340
I mean, it’s really convenient. 


04:38.340 --> 04:40.633
I mean, everything is at arm’s reach. 


04:40.633 --> 04:42.803
It works; it’s good.


04:42.803 --> 04:44.805
OK. 
So, what? 


04:44.805 --> 04:45.972
Are we going to study or what?


04:45.972 --> 04:49.392
Um, we can, if you like, 
but today I was just planning 


04:49.392 --> 04:51.229
on giving you the book 
I was talking to you about, 


04:51.228 --> 04:53.521
and also I wanted to give you 


04:53.522 --> 04:56.817
your own copy of the Bible 
so you can look up the scriptures. 


04:56.817 --> 04:59.000
So this is for you.


05:01.280 --> 05:03.657
Coming from my background 
as an accountant, 


05:03.657 --> 05:06.452
it’s organized so nicely. 


05:06.452 --> 05:09.329
It explains everything 
in such logical order. 


05:09.328 --> 05:11.498
And it also helps us to see 


05:11.498 --> 05:14.250
how the Bible applies 
to everyday topics.


05:14.250 --> 05:15.252
Like what?


05:15.252 --> 05:16.837
Being a diligent worker. 


05:16.837 --> 05:20.632
You’re going to see, the Bible, 
it says that working with your hands, 


05:20.632 --> 05:24.177
that’s good work too, 
just as long as you’re honest.


05:24.177 --> 05:27.347
I’m telling you, man, 
nobody is honest today, man, 


05:27.347 --> 05:29.015
not, not even my suppliers! 


05:29.015 --> 05:29.933
If I had it my way, 


05:29.933 --> 05:32.185
I’d take those guys 
and I’d give them what they deserve.


05:32.185 --> 05:33.437
OK. 
All right. 


05:33.437 --> 05:35.439
Joe, 


05:35.438 --> 05:38.941
look, I understand 
it’s not easy making a living.


05:38.942 --> 05:39.985
No. 
It’s not.


05:39.985 --> 05:41.987
But you know, many people
deal with upsetting situations 


05:41.987 --> 05:44.532
by applying Scriptural principles. 


05:44.532 --> 05:47.284
The Bible shows us 
how we can find true peace 


05:47.283 --> 05:51.078
and-and also how to get 
our emotions under control.


05:51.078 --> 05:54.000
I can’t help it, man! 
I was born angry!


05:55.667 --> 05:58.045
Joe, you’re going to learn 


05:58.045 --> 06:00.297
that the Bible tells us that 


06:00.297 --> 06:02.340
we have to make our minds over. 


06:02.340 --> 06:04.175
We have to
“put on the new personality.”


06:04.175 --> 06:05.177
What do you mean “new personality”? 


06:05.177 --> 06:07.137
I can’t be somebody I’m not, man!


06:07.137 --> 06:09.139
I understand. 


06:09.138 --> 06:12.100
I tell you what, 
why don’t we talk about this some more, 


06:12.100 --> 06:14.603
you know, when I come over 
to your place for the study, OK?


06:14.603 --> 06:16.480
Yeah, all right. 
Whatever.


06:16.480 --> 06:18.000
All right. 


06:20.983 --> 06:22.860
So we’ll see you at your place, 
Joe, OK?


06:22.860 --> 06:23.487
All right.


06:23.487 --> 06:25.000
Do you want to have 
something to eat before you go?


06:28.200 --> 06:31.000
No, I’m good. 
Thanks.


06:32.913 --> 06:35.248
Thanks again for coming by 
and picking up the books.


06:35.248 --> 06:36.250
OK.


06:36.250 --> 06:36.875
OK, Joe.


06:36.875 --> 06:37.458
All right.


06:37.458 --> 06:37.960
Be safe, man.


06:37.960 --> 06:38.377
Bye.


06:38.377 --> 06:38.919
I’ll see you soon.


06:38.918 --> 06:39.000
Bye.


06:44.507 --> 06:47.000
Ah, yeah!


06:52.640 --> 06:54.643
Boys, your dad is home. 


06:54.643 --> 06:57.000
Start getting ready for dinner. 
OK?


07:00.898 --> 07:02.275
Hey, boys.


07:02.275 --> 07:02.900
Hey.


07:02.900 --> 07:03.318
Hey, Dad.


07:03.318 --> 07:03.943
How is it going?


07:03.943 --> 07:04.000
All right.


07:05.320 --> 07:07.363
Hey, how’s it going?


07:07.363 --> 07:08.281
Uh, good.


07:08.282 --> 07:09.659
Good. 
How was your day?


07:09.658 --> 07:11.200
All right.


07:11.200 --> 07:13.203
Hey, so, what are those books?


07:13.203 --> 07:14.578
Oh, these? 


07:14.578 --> 07:15.496
Um. 


07:15.497 --> 07:17.040
Those are just some books 
from my accountant, Brian.


07:17.040 --> 07:18.750
Are they financial books? 


07:18.750 --> 07:20.585
Because that looks like a Bible.


07:20.585 --> 07:22.587
Yeah, yeah. 


07:22.587 --> 07:24.589
Brian is a pretty religious guy. 


07:24.588 --> 07:28.010
Um, you know,
he’s got a nice family too. 


07:28.010 --> 07:30.012
Anyways, so, 
what are we having for dinner?


07:30.012 --> 07:31.305
What? 


07:31.305 --> 07:33.348
When did you meet his family?


07:33.348 --> 07:34.808
Oh. 
I just saw them around. 


07:34.808 --> 07:36.435
Yeah, he said 
it might be good to come over, 


07:36.435 --> 07:38.978
uh, bring his wife, 
maybe, to meet you. 


07:38.978 --> 07:42.148
And they’ve got two daughters 
about Ricky and Arthur’s age. 


07:42.148 --> 07:42.898
Put the phone away. 


07:42.898 --> 07:43.608
Come on, let’s go. 


07:43.608 --> 07:45.318
Turn that game off. 
Let’s eat.


07:45.318 --> 07:46.778
I made your favorite dinner.


07:46.778 --> 07:48.613
Ooh, tacos. 


07:48.613 --> 07:51.000
OK, let’s say a prayer. 


07:52.575 --> 07:55.000
Lord Jesus,—


07:59.833 --> 08:02.043
Ruby, you have to convince Gloria. 


08:02.043 --> 08:03.003
She is your daughter. 


08:03.003 --> 08:05.630
She is making me look bad. 


08:05.630 --> 08:08.000
She is my niece, 
so the way she lives reflects on me too. 


08:09.300 --> 08:11.302
She just needs to come work
for my company, 


08:11.302 --> 08:12.887
then she’ll be successful. 


08:12.887 --> 08:15.140
You should talk to her about that, 
all right?


08:15.140 --> 08:18.000
OK, bye.


08:22.688 --> 08:24.733
OK. 
Tuesday, four o’clock. 


08:24.733 --> 08:26.000
OK, see you then.


08:28.820 --> 08:30.822
Would you like the crystal gel today?


08:30.822 --> 08:33.000
Um, it’s OK. 
It’s too expensive.


08:34.242 --> 08:35.660
You need more money, 


08:35.660 --> 08:37.828
not super rich, 


08:37.828 --> 08:41.248
but just enough to have 
what our relatives have, 


08:41.248 --> 08:43.210
or they’ll look down on you.


08:43.210 --> 08:45.212
Mom, we have enough money.


08:45.212 --> 08:48.882
Maybe enough for today, 
but what if you get sick?


08:48.882 --> 08:51.427
Mom, please listen to me.


08:51.427 --> 08:53.595
OK, you’re done. 
You can dry.


08:53.595 --> 08:55.013
OK.


08:55.013 --> 08:57.848
Hasn’t Brian lost 
some of his clients lately? 


08:57.848 --> 09:00.143
Now you have to take
care of yourself. 


09:00.143 --> 09:02.978
You know your uncle can help you 


09:02.978 --> 09:05.815
find a good job
in his real estate company.


09:05.815 --> 09:10.028
Mom, Jehovah will take care of us 
as long as we trust in him.


09:10.028 --> 09:13.030
You waste time on God, 


09:13.030 --> 09:15.325
doing that “pioneering thing,” 


09:15.325 --> 09:18.000
the time that you 
could use to make money. 


09:19.203 --> 09:21.665
How will you have enough
when you’re old?


09:21.665 --> 09:24.458
Mom, please listen to me.


09:24.458 --> 09:27.961
What? 
An old lady can’t give you some advice?


09:27.962 --> 09:29.380
No, but we’ve already talked about this.


09:29.380 --> 09:30.923
But you never listen.


09:30.923 --> 09:32.000
I listen! 


09:33.968 --> 09:38.000
Mom, I listen, 
but won’t you please listen to me once?


09:44.020 --> 09:46.272
Your girls have to help. 


09:46.272 --> 09:48.234
You have no sons. 


09:48.233 --> 09:51.401
So they are your
most important investment. 


09:51.402 --> 09:53.989
You have to get them into good jobs, 


09:53.988 --> 09:56.240
like your brother’s kids.


09:56.240 --> 09:59.577
We don’t expect our girls to provide us 
with money or support or anything. 


09:59.577 --> 10:00.454
No.


10:00.453 --> 10:03.165
You just don’t know 
what it’s like to be poor. 


10:03.165 --> 10:06.167
I know. 
I remember! 


10:06.167 --> 10:07.502
When I was young, 


10:07.502 --> 10:10.005
all I had to eat were turnips 


10:10.005 --> 10:12.507
that I dug out of the cold ground! 


10:12.507 --> 10:15.010
And I had to wear my sister’s shoes, 


10:15.010 --> 10:17.387
with holes in them! 


10:17.387 --> 10:19.000
Look at my shoes. 


10:21.432 --> 10:23.435
Do you see holes in them? 


10:23.435 --> 10:27.000
How do you think I got 
shoes with no holes, huh?


10:41.620 --> 10:43.622
This is a Bible-based magazine, 


10:43.622 --> 10:45.915
and Bible principles
can help us to cope 


10:45.915 --> 10:48.335
with any stress or anxiety 


10:48.335 --> 10:50.378
we may face in the future.


10:50.378 --> 10:53.798
My husband just lost his job, 
so this might help.


10:53.798 --> 10:56.091
Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. 


10:56.092 --> 10:58.762
Well, please be sure to read it 
and also check out our website.


10:58.762 --> 10:59.847
OK, thank you.


10:59.847 --> 11:01.000
Have a good day.


11:04.308 --> 11:06.686
Hey, that was good.


11:06.687 --> 11:09.000
Yeah, that was OK.


11:10.232 --> 11:12.234
Are you OK?


11:12.233 --> 11:14.401
Well, Brian, I’m worried. 


11:14.402 --> 11:18.155
What happened to her 
can happen to us too. 


11:18.155 --> 11:20.158
I mean, we need a stable income, 


11:20.158 --> 11:23.453
and I can get a job 
at my uncle’s real estate firm. 


11:23.453 --> 11:25.455
Maybe this is an answer to our prayers. 


11:25.455 --> 11:27.457
I might have to quit pioneering 


11:27.457 --> 11:29.584
until I settle in to work and stuff, 


11:29.583 --> 11:32.503
but just for a while, 
until we are financially more stable.


11:32.503 --> 11:35.756
Gloria, we have enough. 


11:35.757 --> 11:37.092
Besides, Jehovah will take care of us. 


11:37.092 --> 11:39.177
He always has. 


11:39.177 --> 11:41.179
We just have to trust in him.


11:41.178 --> 11:42.305
What about our girls? 


11:42.305 --> 11:44.807
They need a stable income to be pioneers. 


11:44.807 --> 11:45.000
They have—


11:48.853 --> 11:52.023
They need a stable income to be pioneers. 


11:52.023 --> 11:53.525
And they need to know where 
their next meal is coming from . . .


11:53.525 --> 11:54.275
Gloria.


11:54.275 --> 11:56.277
. . . and that they have 
enough clothes to keep them warm!


11:56.277 --> 11:59.114
Don’t you believe that Jehovah 
will keep his promise to help us?


11:59.113 --> 12:00.115
Of course! 


12:00.115 --> 12:02.242
But you never know 
what could happen tomorrow! 


12:02.242 --> 12:06.622
We don’t expect Jehovah just to drop 
everything we need into our laps, do we? 


12:06.622 --> 12:08.665
“Money is a protection,” right? 


12:08.665 --> 12:12.293
We just need to be realistic, 
and balanced, balanced!


12:12.293 --> 12:12.918
Gloria, Jesus said: 


12:12.918 --> 12:16.715
“Never be anxious about the next day.” 


12:16.715 --> 12:18.000
Oh, hello.


12:19.800 --> 12:21.343
Can I just take one of these?


12:21.343 --> 12:22.720
Yes, please do. 


12:22.720 --> 12:26.000
Please be sure to visit 
our website for more information.


12:28.685 --> 12:31.395
Oh, anyways, my Bible study Joe 
texted me earlier today. 


12:31.395 --> 12:33.815
So he’s looking forward 
to seeing us later at their place.


12:33.815 --> 12:36.483
Oh! 
I almost forgot. 


12:36.483 --> 12:38.486
What time are we supposed to be there?


12:38.487 --> 12:41.489
Um, right after we are done here and we take 
the cart back to the Kingdom Hall.


12:41.488 --> 12:43.908
OK, I want to stop by home 
and freshen up too.


12:43.908 --> 12:45.000
OK.


12:48.872 --> 12:52.209
So you guys meet a lot of different people 
when you do this work?


12:52.208 --> 12:55.086
Yes, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we like to meet people 


12:55.087 --> 12:58.674
from different backgrounds and cultures.


12:58.673 --> 13:02.260
Yeah, we like to meet people 
from other countries, don’t we, Mary?


13:02.260 --> 13:04.262
Yeah, we do. 


13:04.262 --> 13:07.682
But we already have 
our own religion and traditions. 


13:07.682 --> 13:09.809
They’re part of who we are. 


13:09.808 --> 13:12.686
Didn’t becoming a Witness 
mean you had to give that all up?


13:12.687 --> 13:13.647
Not at all. 


13:13.647 --> 13:17.484
We still enjoy our traditional food, 
music, and clothes, 


13:17.483 --> 13:19.568
and so many other things.


13:19.568 --> 13:21.946
Yeah, so we enjoy 
the best parts of all cultures. 


13:21.947 --> 13:24.407
We just avoid the parts 
that God disapproves of.


13:24.407 --> 13:25.950
Like what?


13:25.950 --> 13:28.412
Well, for example, 
my mother still prepares food 


13:28.412 --> 13:31.289
to offer to our dead ancestors 
on special days.


13:31.288 --> 13:32.206
Oh, wow. 


13:32.207 --> 13:34.917
Yeah, I don’t think 
I would ever do that.


13:34.917 --> 13:37.379
Well,
it’s like with the first-century Christians, 


13:37.378 --> 13:39.380
there were certain common attitudes 


13:39.380 --> 13:41.925
and Jewish customs 
that they had to leave behind.


13:41.925 --> 13:43.927
So, what did your family say 


13:43.927 --> 13:46.512
when you changed your religion?


13:46.512 --> 13:48.515
My mother was very upset. 


13:48.515 --> 13:52.768
She’s not so angry anymore, 
although she doesn’t understand.


13:52.768 --> 13:54.770
Oh, Gloria, Brian, 
these are our boys, 


13:54.770 --> 13:55.522
Arthur and Ricky.


13:55.522 --> 13:56.105
Oh, hi.


13:56.105 --> 13:56.898
This is Arthur


13:56.898 --> 13:57.773
and Ricky.


13:57.773 --> 13:58.273
Hi.


13:58.273 --> 13:59.441
They’re amazing boys.


13:59.442 --> 14:00.194
How’s it going?


14:00.193 --> 14:01.110
Yeah,


14:01.110 --> 14:02.320
my boys. 
How are you all doing?


14:02.320 --> 14:03.070
Good.


14:03.070 --> 14:03.780
Yeah.


14:03.780 --> 14:04.613
Good to meet you both. 


14:04.613 --> 14:06.240
So how old are you?


14:06.240 --> 14:07.242
I’m 16.


14:07.242 --> 14:08.242
No, you’re not.


14:08.242 --> 14:09.660
Almost 16.


14:09.660 --> 14:10.495
I’m 18.


14:10.495 --> 14:12.080
Oh, which high school do you attend?


14:12.080 --> 14:13.665
The one right down the street.


14:13.665 --> 14:15.042
Oh, that’s our girls’ school too! 


14:15.042 --> 14:18.252
Um, do you know Anna and Tina?


14:18.252 --> 14:21.840
Oh, yeah, I’ve— 
I’ve definitely seen them around. 


14:21.840 --> 14:25.000
They’re both so, uh, really brainy.


14:26.302 --> 14:27.000
OK.


14:28.555 --> 14:31.515
Let’s see.


14:31.515 --> 14:34.727
Your girls are very lovely. 


14:34.727 --> 14:37.355
I’m sure they’re very good girls.


14:37.355 --> 14:38.022
Oh, thank you! 


14:38.022 --> 14:40.817
You know, actually, they both want 
to be full-time Bible teachers.


14:40.817 --> 14:41.000
Wow.


14:42.902 --> 14:45.530
Oh, uh, by the way, you know, 
we wanted to invite you, 


14:45.530 --> 14:47.532
all of you, uh, 
to the hall this Sunday. 


14:47.532 --> 14:48.909
We have a special speaker.


14:48.908 --> 14:49.908
He’s very special, yes. 


14:49.908 --> 14:53.580
He’s dear to us, 
and we’ve known him for years.


14:53.580 --> 14:55.498
Nice.


14:55.498 --> 14:58.501
Uh, I don’t know.


14:58.502 --> 14:59.544
We’ll see. 


14:59.543 --> 15:02.171
Maybe. 
Just to check it out. 


15:02.172 --> 15:04.174
But we’ll have to talk about that.


15:04.173 --> 15:04.923
Yeah.


15:04.923 --> 15:05.716
OK.


15:05.717 --> 15:06.259
Yeah. 


15:06.258 --> 15:08.000
All right.


15:14.100 --> 15:16.102
Gloria, 
why did you give me that look 


15:16.102 --> 15:18.354
when I said that the girls 
wanted to be in full-time service?


15:18.353 --> 15:20.398
Well, 


15:20.398 --> 15:23.025
I was reminded recently 
that the safest road 


15:23.025 --> 15:25.027
is to get a good job 
with a good company.


15:25.027 --> 15:27.739
Oh. 


15:27.738 --> 15:29.781
Has your mom been talking 
to you about this again?


15:29.782 --> 15:30.867
She’s my mom. 


15:30.867 --> 15:32.244
I have to listen to her. 


15:32.243 --> 15:34.245
I owe it to her. 


15:34.245 --> 15:36.957
You know, my father died 
when my brother and I were young. 


15:36.957 --> 15:40.419
And then after that, 
my mom had to raise us on nearly nothing. 


15:40.418 --> 15:42.420
You know it very well.


15:42.420 --> 15:44.505
Yes, I know. 
She was very brave. 


15:44.505 --> 15:46.507
OK, but she didn’t know Jehovah. 


15:46.507 --> 15:47.967
We do. 


15:47.967 --> 15:50.804
Shouldn’t we be encouraging 
our girls to serve him full-time?


15:50.803 --> 15:52.346
Why can’t they do both? 


15:52.347 --> 15:54.349
Everyone has to work, right?


15:54.348 --> 15:56.935
OK, but what comes first
—work or Jehovah?


15:56.935 --> 15:59.603
But you see, 
there are so many Witnesses 


15:59.603 --> 16:01.940
that have prestigious, 
high-paying jobs.


16:01.940 --> 16:04.775
Yeah, but should we 
be pushing Anna and Tina 


16:04.775 --> 16:06.527
to succeed in this system?


16:06.527 --> 16:07.529
No, I’m not. 


16:07.528 --> 16:09.571
I just want them
to have a normal life, 


16:09.572 --> 16:12.200
and who knows how long
this system will last.


16:12.200 --> 16:12.825
Oh.


16:12.825 --> 16:15.077
And what is wrong with living
comfortably in the meantime?


16:15.077 --> 16:18.080
OK, this is not a “last days” question. 


16:18.080 --> 16:20.958
OK, it’s always been wrong
to strive to be rich.


16:20.958 --> 16:24.253
No, not rich, just plenty
—just enough to give them 


16:24.253 --> 16:26.796
peace of mind so that they
can sleep soundly.


16:26.797 --> 16:30.219
That’s exactly the opposite 
of what the Bible says: 


16:30.218 --> 16:32.970
“Sweet is the sleep
of the one serving, . . . 


16:32.970 --> 16:35.055
“but the plenty belonging to the rich . . . 


16:35.055 --> 16:37.100
does not permit him to sleep.”


16:37.100 --> 16:39.102
But don’t you think they need 


16:39.102 --> 16:41.855
a fallback career
—just in case?


16:41.855 --> 16:44.148
Just in case what? 


16:44.148 --> 16:47.000
In case Jesus was wrong? 


16:58.162 --> 17:00.164
So guess what?


17:00.163 --> 17:00.915
What?


17:00.915 --> 17:03.000
Mom is all freaked out 
because Ricky recognized my picture.


17:04.543 --> 17:05.670
Yeah, that figures. 


17:05.670 --> 17:08.505
He’s cute, but Mom
would never approve anyway.


17:08.505 --> 17:09.798
Of course not! 


17:09.798 --> 17:11.466
She’d say, 
“You’re too young, 


17:11.467 --> 17:12.885
and he’s not in the truth!”


17:12.885 --> 17:14.000
Yeah, not just that. 


17:15.430 --> 17:18.473
Their family isn’t as well-off as we are. 


17:18.473 --> 17:21.060
And don’t forget the “Ooh!” factor.


17:21.060 --> 17:21.937
Right! 


17:21.937 --> 17:24.814
If Grandma heard of it,
she’d go, “Ooh.” 


17:24.813 --> 17:26.856
Exactly.


17:26.857 --> 17:30.779
Hey, girls, 
you know what I’ve always told you. 


17:30.778 --> 17:34.781
You need to marry someone 
with the same standards as ours. 


17:34.782 --> 17:38.662
You have to consider their
family background and parents’ careers.


17:38.662 --> 17:42.040
Mom, doesn’t the Bible say 
‘marry only in the Lord,’ 


17:42.040 --> 17:43.540
not ‘only in your social class’?


17:43.540 --> 17:44.250
Yeah.


17:44.250 --> 17:45.000
Never mind! 


17:45.000 --> 17:46.710
Have you guys finished 
your homework yet? 


17:46.710 --> 17:48.713
Anna, your finals are coming up. 


17:48.713 --> 17:50.756
I don’t want you missing 
any more meetings than necessary. 


17:50.757 --> 17:53.000
OK?


17:54.260 --> 17:56.595
Gloria, 


17:56.595 --> 17:58.222
why should they miss any meetings? 


17:58.222 --> 18:00.057
You know, 
putting school before Jehovah, 


18:00.057 --> 18:02.269
that’s just practice 
for putting work before Jehovah.


18:02.268 --> 18:05.145
Sometimes they have to.


18:05.145 --> 18:06.355
Those.


18:06.355 --> 18:07.065
Oh, I like these.


18:07.065 --> 18:07.898
Me too.


18:07.898 --> 18:08.650
What are those? 


18:08.650 --> 18:10.777
You’re not going out 
in your sister’s shoes.


18:10.777 --> 18:11.569
Why not?


18:11.568 --> 18:12.903
Because I said so!


18:12.903 --> 18:14.780
But these are perfect, 
and she doesn’t wear them anymore.


18:14.780 --> 18:16.157
Never, never! 


18:16.157 --> 18:17.742
Your grandma had to wear 
her sister’s shoes, 


18:17.742 --> 18:18.910
and they had holes in them!


18:18.910 --> 18:20.287
Mom, calm down. 


18:20.287 --> 18:21.997
I don’t wear them anymore.


18:21.997 --> 18:23.624
She was so ashamed. 


18:23.623 --> 18:25.625
I made up my mind 
to make a lot of money 


18:25.625 --> 18:27.710
so no one would ever 
see me borrow clothes! 


18:27.710 --> 18:30.000
And you’re not going 
to borrow them either!


18:39.888 --> 18:41.681
Hey, so are you going to go or what?


18:41.682 --> 18:43.017
All right, I’ll go. 


18:43.017 --> 18:44.102
Now will you leave me alone?


18:44.102 --> 18:45.687
Well, you don’t have to go 
if you don’t want to.


18:45.687 --> 18:47.000
Well, if you don’t want me 
to go then I won’t.


18:48.022 --> 18:50.274
I do. 
OK, I said I do. 


18:50.273 --> 18:51.608
I want you to go.


18:51.608 --> 18:55.111
So I said I’d go. 
I’d go, just to see.


18:55.112 --> 18:58.074
OK. 
OK, good. 


18:58.073 --> 19:01.000
Good. 
Thank you.


19:06.248 --> 19:08.668
But this may be the only time.


19:08.668 --> 19:09.960
Maybe.


19:09.960 --> 19:12.838
Yeah, I’m going to tell you 
exactly what’s going to happen. 


19:12.838 --> 19:15.425
It’s the same thing that happens 
when I go to church. 


19:15.425 --> 19:17.052
The people don’t even
know that I’m there. 


19:17.052 --> 19:19.179
So why go?


19:19.178 --> 19:20.011
What?


19:20.012 --> 19:24.000
Nothing. 
You’ll see, you’ll see.


19:29.813 --> 19:30.981
Hey, Brian.
Hey, Dion.


19:30.982 --> 19:31.690
Good to see you.


19:31.690 --> 19:33.777
Good to see you too. 


19:33.777 --> 19:34.000
Hey, guys. 


19:35.235 --> 19:36.445
Meet Mary.


19:36.445 --> 19:37.613
Pleasure to meet you. 


19:37.613 --> 19:38.238
I’m Mike.


19:38.238 --> 19:39.948
Hey, Jule.


19:39.948 --> 19:41.000
How are you? 


19:43.535 --> 19:44.537
Good. 
How are you?


19:44.537 --> 19:46.872
We’d like to welcome back 
Brother Lee Williams 


19:46.872 --> 19:50.125
to deliver his final talk entitled 


19:50.125 --> 19:53.420
“No One Can Slave for Two Masters.” 


19:53.420 --> 19:56.000
Brother Williams, please.


20:07.768 --> 20:09.770
There are billions of people 


20:09.770 --> 20:13.000
who are enslaved
without even realizing it. 


20:14.233 --> 20:16.485
They unintentionally
do it to themselves 


20:16.485 --> 20:18.320
because they feel obligated 


20:18.320 --> 20:21.782
to follow the traditions of their culture, 


20:21.782 --> 20:25.285
and they put family 
and money ahead of God. 


20:25.285 --> 20:28.663
But Jesus made it clear that, 
sooner or later, 


20:28.663 --> 20:31.500
everyone on earth 
will have to choose 


20:31.500 --> 20:34.628
who or what 
they will serve as master


20:34.628 --> 20:36.630
—either Jehovah 


20:36.630 --> 20:40.635
or money and the power 
and prestige that goes with having it. 


20:40.635 --> 20:45.640
Notice how Jesus explained this 
at Matthew 6:24. 


20:45.640 --> 20:47.000
I invite you to open
your Bibles there, 


20:48.183 --> 20:51.186
Matthew 6:24. 


20:51.187 --> 20:53.397
And Jesus said: 


20:53.397 --> 20:56.775
“No one can slave for two masters; 


20:56.775 --> 21:00.613
“for either he will hate the one 
and love the other, 


21:00.613 --> 21:04.000
“or he will stick to the one 
and despise the other. 


21:05.200 --> 21:10.000
You cannot slave
for God and for Riches.” 


21:11.207 --> 21:16.795
Now, how could someone 
be divided in loyalty like this? 


21:16.795 --> 21:19.382
Well, let’s think of a Bible example: 


21:19.382 --> 21:22.092
Lot and his family. 


21:22.092 --> 21:25.680
Now, Lot moved his family near Sodom 


21:25.680 --> 21:28.432
and then later into the city, 


21:28.432 --> 21:30.935
although knowing that the men there 


21:30.935 --> 21:34.563
were “wicked, gross
sinners against Jehovah.” 


21:34.563 --> 21:37.441
Was he seeking material security? 


21:37.442 --> 21:40.000
Did he give in to pressure
from his wife? 


21:41.153 --> 21:45.281
Did they try to serve two masters? 


21:45.282 --> 21:48.535
Well, whatever the case, 
we know the results. 


21:48.535 --> 21:53.000
The family suffered spiritually, 
and they put their lives at risk. 


21:54.917 --> 21:59.422
Eventually, this attitude 
affected Lot’s wife so much 


21:59.422 --> 22:03.844
that she loved the comforts 
of Sodom more than Jehovah. 


22:03.843 --> 22:05.845
Even while Jehovah used the angels 


22:05.845 --> 22:08.472
to try to get them out
of that wicked city, 


22:08.472 --> 22:11.184
Lot’s wife looked back, 


22:11.183 --> 22:14.936
possibly because of her attachment 
to her things, 


22:14.937 --> 22:16.980
and she became 


22:16.980 --> 22:19.400
a pillar of salt. 


22:19.400 --> 22:23.905
Now, could Lot’s wife 
have avoided that tragic outcome? 


22:23.905 --> 22:25.907
Of course! 


22:25.907 --> 22:28.200
It didn’t have to end that way. 


22:28.200 --> 22:32.205
No wonder Jesus made 
the very direct comments 


22:32.205 --> 22:36.292
at Luke 17:32 when he said: 


22:36.292 --> 22:40.000
“Remember the wife of Lot.” 


22:41.130 --> 22:43.757
And there is the lesson for us: 


22:43.757 --> 22:47.637
We are living at a time
when it is vital 


22:47.637 --> 22:52.267
that we do not look back 
in a figurative sense. 


22:52.267 --> 22:54.560
What a sobering reminder 


22:54.560 --> 22:58.355
that we should put Jehovah God first 


22:58.355 --> 23:04.487
and seek his approval before family, 
money, and things.


23:04.487 --> 23:06.322
Tell your folks I said hello, OK?


23:06.322 --> 23:07.030
OK.


23:07.030 --> 23:10.450
All right, thank you, bye-bye.


23:10.450 --> 23:12.662
Brother Williams,
that was very inspiring.


23:12.662 --> 23:13.787
Oh, thank you, Brian. 


23:13.787 --> 23:14.789
I’m glad you thought so.


23:14.788 --> 23:17.123
I want you to meet Joe and Mary. 


23:17.123 --> 23:19.001
This is their first meeting.


23:19.002 --> 23:20.377
Oh, nice to meet you, 
Joe and Mary.


23:20.377 --> 23:21.712
Yeah. 
Yeah.


23:21.712 --> 23:22.464
Hi, Gloria.


23:22.463 --> 23:24.090
Hi, Brother Williams.


23:24.090 --> 23:27.260
I’ve got to tell you, 
all of this is so different from my church.


23:27.260 --> 23:29.845
I mean, I liked your sermon, 


23:29.845 --> 23:33.473
but believe me, we’re not a family 
that expects to ever get rich.


23:33.473 --> 23:36.143
We never have any money 
for anything anyways.


23:36.143 --> 23:37.143
Right. 


23:37.143 --> 23:38.603
Just a lot of debt.


23:38.603 --> 23:40.648
Yeah, 
but you know the important thing 


23:40.648 --> 23:43.275
is that we can have 
our spiritual needs taken care of. 


23:43.275 --> 23:45.653
God can take care of all
the other needs. 


23:45.653 --> 23:47.655
Well, I’m glad you were
able to make it today. 


23:47.655 --> 23:49.740
Hopefully, 
this won’t be your last time.


23:49.740 --> 23:50.700
Maybe.


23:50.700 --> 23:51.700
Thanks again, 
Brother Williams.


23:51.700 --> 23:52.452
OK. 
Take care.


23:52.452 --> 23:53.327
Take care.


23:53.327 --> 23:53.910
Bye, Gloria.


23:53.910 --> 23:54.537
Bye.


23:54.537 --> 23:55.997
Hey, 
so thanks for coming over, man. 


23:55.997 --> 23:58.249
I really appreciate the effort 
you made to come today.


23:58.248 --> 24:01.043
Yeah, I mean, it was good. 
I enjoyed it. 


24:01.043 --> 24:03.170
The speeches he gave were good.


24:03.170 --> 24:03.712
Yeah?


24:03.712 --> 24:05.047
Yeah, it was pretty nice.


24:05.047 --> 24:05.799
Good.


24:05.798 --> 24:07.466
So we’ll see.


24:07.467 --> 24:08.000
What did Mary think?


24:09.343 --> 24:11.386
Well, I don’t know. 
I have to check with her. 


24:11.387 --> 24:14.015
Um, I mean, 
this is a lot different than her church.


24:14.015 --> 24:15.015
Yeah.


24:15.015 --> 24:18.268
So later on I’ll-
I’ll get her take on it too.


24:18.268 --> 24:18.685
Yeah.


24:18.685 --> 24:19.228
Brian!


24:19.228 --> 24:20.228
Thanks again,
Brother Williams.


24:20.228 --> 24:21.063
It was good to see you again.


24:21.063 --> 24:22.146
I appreciate it.


24:22.147 --> 24:23.940
And Joe, 
it was nice meeting you.


24:23.940 --> 24:25.400
Yeah. 
All right. 


24:25.400 --> 24:26.235
Bye.


24:26.235 --> 24:27.612
Bye.


24:27.612 --> 24:32.199
Hey, Brian, 
where is Mr. Williams’ wife?


24:32.198 --> 24:32.783
He’s a widower. 


24:32.783 --> 24:35.076
Julia died a few years ago.


24:35.077 --> 24:35.745
Oh.


24:35.745 --> 24:37.372
But he took good care of her, 
right to the end.


24:37.372 --> 24:38.455
Man, that’s sad.


24:38.455 --> 24:39.540
Yeah.


24:39.540 --> 24:41.542
Especially when it’s your wife. 


24:41.542 --> 24:42.377
Wow.


24:42.377 --> 24:43.752
But you know what? 


24:43.752 --> 24:47.130
He’s convinced, and we’re all convinced, 
we’ll see her again in the new world. 


24:47.130 --> 24:50.383
And you know, despite his grief, 
he continues his work.


24:50.383 --> 24:51.135
Oh, yeah?


24:51.135 --> 24:51.718
Yeah.


24:51.718 --> 24:53.345
So how much does he make then?


24:53.345 --> 24:54.680
Oh, well,
he doesn’t make anything. 


24:54.680 --> 24:55.848
He’s-
he’s a volunteer.


24:55.848 --> 24:56.806
A volunteer?


24:56.807 --> 24:57.392
Yeah.


24:57.392 --> 25:01.000
Well, how does he afford that nice car, 
his phone, and his suit?


25:02.020 --> 25:03.938
Well, the congregations 
cover his basic expenses.


25:03.938 --> 25:06.441
What? 
The congregation? 


25:06.442 --> 25:08.194
Man, it sounds to me 
like he’s living off others 


25:08.193 --> 25:09.986
instead of working, 
like you say.


25:09.987 --> 25:12.615
Oh, no, no, Joe! 
You’ve got it all wrong. 


25:12.615 --> 25:14.492
He’s busy just like the rest of us. 


25:14.492 --> 25:16.494
He’s-
he’s busy preaching; 


25:16.493 --> 25:18.370
he’s preparing, teaching, 
listening to us. 


25:18.370 --> 25:19.413
It’s not like that.


25:19.413 --> 25:21.165
Yeah, but, 
you suppose he ever asks himself, 


25:21.165 --> 25:24.085
‘Can I make it in this “real world”?’ 
like you and I do every day.


25:24.085 --> 25:27.253
Joe, trust me, he knows 
what this world is really like. 


25:27.253 --> 25:30.006
I mean, he’s in it every day, 
helping people. 


25:30.007 --> 25:32.927
Besides,
before he learned the truth, 


25:32.927 --> 25:34.429
he had a prestigious career. 


25:34.428 --> 25:35.636
He just doesn’t talk about it.


25:35.637 --> 25:37.724
Man, I got to go. 


25:37.723 --> 25:39.058
Uh, hey, Mary!


25:39.058 --> 25:39.600
OK.


25:39.600 --> 25:41.977
We try to follow Bible principles 
as much as we can.


25:41.977 --> 25:42.729
Mary!


25:42.728 --> 25:43.145
Yeah?


25:43.145 --> 25:44.147
Are you ready to go?


25:44.147 --> 25:45.355
I’m ready. 


25:45.355 --> 25:46.607
Well, I have to go.


25:46.607 --> 25:47.232
OK.


25:47.232 --> 25:48.317
I’ll see you next time, OK?


25:48.317 --> 25:49.527
Hey, girls?


25:49.527 --> 25:50.694
Yeah, we have to get back,


25:50.693 --> 25:51.320
OK.


25:51.320 --> 25:52.070
Thanks again, man. 


25:52.070 --> 25:53.155
And I’ll see you next week?


25:53.155 --> 25:54.698
All right.


25:54.698 --> 25:55.490
Bye, Mary.


25:55.490 --> 25:56.242
Bye.


25:56.242 --> 25:56.742
Bye, girls. 


25:56.742 --> 25:57.284
Bye, Joe.


25:57.283 --> 25:58.868
Bye.


25:58.868 --> 26:01.663
You know, I really enjoyed 
Brother Williams’ talk today. 


26:01.663 --> 26:05.416
The part where he said: 
‘You cannot slave for two masters. 


26:05.417 --> 26:08.212
We cannot serve God and Riches.’ 


26:08.212 --> 26:10.214
I really liked that.


26:10.213 --> 26:13.175
Yeah, Brother Williams 
always gives nice talks. 


26:13.175 --> 26:15.302
But aren’t there many brothers 
who are successful 


26:15.302 --> 26:17.430
in the world 
and in the truth too? 


26:17.430 --> 26:19.515
How can he say
you cannot do both?


26:19.515 --> 26:22.017
But, Gloria, 
it wasn’t Brother Williams who said 


26:22.017 --> 26:24.270
no one can slave for two masters; 
it was Jesus.


26:24.270 --> 26:25.270
I know. 


26:25.270 --> 26:27.857
But I see Witnesses 
who are very active in the truth 


26:27.857 --> 26:30.150
and also hold down high-paying jobs,


26:30.150 --> 26:31.693
some even pioneer. 


26:31.693 --> 26:35.113
That’s why you
have to exert yourselves.


26:35.113 --> 26:39.118
Gloria, Jesus said ‘to exert yourself 
to get in through the narrow door,’ 


26:39.118 --> 26:41.286
not to serve two masters. 


26:41.287 --> 26:44.707
Evidently, 
Lot’s wife tried to serve both.


26:44.707 --> 26:46.792
But we live in different times though. 


26:46.792 --> 26:49.044
Don’t you think our girls 
need to try as hard as they can?


26:49.043 --> 26:51.296
But think of those
in our own congregation 


26:51.297 --> 26:52.757
who pushed their kids too far. 


26:52.757 --> 26:54.049
They couldn’t do it all. 


26:54.048 --> 26:56.551
They had to “take a break”
from the truth 


26:56.552 --> 26:59.264
so they could pursue
their material goals. 


26:59.263 --> 27:02.140
So far, 
they haven’t returned to Jehovah.


27:02.140 --> 27:04.143
Can you guys walk any faster? 


27:04.143 --> 27:07.000
I don’t want to miss my TV show.


27:13.735 --> 27:14.945
So, Mom, 


27:14.945 --> 27:16.988
how was your baptism?


27:16.988 --> 27:18.365
What baptism?


27:18.365 --> 27:20.158
Didn’t you get baptized
this morning? 


27:20.158 --> 27:21.160
How was it?


27:21.160 --> 27:23.537
Yeah, was it as good as Dad said?


27:23.537 --> 27:25.747
Yeah, I enjoyed it. 


27:25.747 --> 27:28.167
Everyone was so pleasant. 


27:28.167 --> 27:29.169
It’s not what I thought it would be.


27:29.168 --> 27:30.043
Are you serious?


27:30.043 --> 27:31.253
Yes, I’m serious. 


27:31.253 --> 27:34.840
We listened to a sermon 
and looked up a lot of scriptures. 


27:34.840 --> 27:36.717
I couldn’t even keep up!


27:36.717 --> 27:40.095
I didn’t know the Bible
had so many books! 


27:40.095 --> 27:43.890
But you know, now I can see 
why your dad is so interested.


27:43.890 --> 27:44.850
So, what does that mean?


27:44.850 --> 27:47.143
Yeah, like, what happens now? 


27:47.143 --> 27:49.145
Are you like ready to get baptized? 


27:49.145 --> 27:51.273
Shall I baptize thou now?


27:51.273 --> 27:53.441
What’s wrong with you? 
Stop that! 


27:53.442 --> 27:56.070
You know, both of you just get up 
and help me clean this table. 


27:56.070 --> 27:58.000
Let’s go. 


28:03.035 --> 28:05.745
I told them that I would sit in 
the next time they came 


28:05.745 --> 28:07.163
to study with your dad. 


28:07.163 --> 28:08.456
I got to keep my word.


28:08.457 --> 28:09.500
No, you don’t! 


28:09.500 --> 28:11.127
You don’t owe
those people anything!


28:11.127 --> 28:12.502
Yeah, they’ll understand anyways.


28:12.502 --> 28:13.295
Listen, 


28:13.295 --> 28:14.547
that would be rude. 


28:14.547 --> 28:17.007
I’m many things, 
but I’ve never been rude. 


28:17.007 --> 28:19.427
Besides, I’m curious. 


28:19.427 --> 28:22.000
Who knows what I could learn 
from all of this?


28:28.102 --> 28:30.604
Yay! 
Congratulations, guys! 


28:30.603 --> 28:33.481
I know this place will be 
the home of your dreams.


28:33.482 --> 28:36.000
Those men are so funny!


28:37.027 --> 28:39.572
Mom, they’re a gay couple.


28:39.572 --> 28:40.405
So?


28:40.405 --> 28:42.407
A year ago that shocked you.


28:42.407 --> 28:43.450
Things change, 


28:43.450 --> 28:46.120
and we need to get used to it.


28:46.120 --> 28:50.332
I just closed on a huge
housing contract for my client.


28:50.332 --> 28:50.917
You see? 


28:50.917 --> 28:54.044
That’s the only way to survive. 


28:54.043 --> 28:58.465
Your girls need
to get big-money jobs. 


28:58.465 --> 29:00.175
You have no choice. 


29:00.175 --> 29:03.595
Otherwise, 
your sister-in-law and her family 


29:03.595 --> 29:06.473
will look down on them and on you.


29:06.473 --> 29:09.141
Mom, why are you trying 
to even impress them? 


29:09.142 --> 29:11.229
You don’t even like those people.


29:11.228 --> 29:14.000
Never mind.


29:18.235 --> 29:20.000
Mom?


29:21.280 --> 29:24.198
I’m starting school tomorrow.


29:24.198 --> 29:26.243
School? 


29:26.243 --> 29:28.000
You?


29:29.413 --> 29:30.788
What school?


29:30.788 --> 29:33.375
I’m going to take real estate classes 


29:33.375 --> 29:35.668
so that I can earn my own money. 


29:35.668 --> 29:37.755
I want to move to a better apartment. 


29:37.755 --> 29:41.008
Mom, can you please
speak to Uncle for me 


29:41.008 --> 29:42.760
about working
for his real estate company?


29:42.760 --> 29:46.000
Now you talk like a good daughter.


29:51.643 --> 29:54.103
Next time
on Remember the Wife of Lot.


29:54.103 --> 29:55.480
What’s going on? 


29:55.480 --> 29:56.690
Why are you being so serious?


29:56.690 --> 29:58.525
I’m just trying to tell you 
that I love you all, 


29:58.525 --> 30:00.402
and I want what’s best for us.


30:00.402 --> 30:04.114
Gloria’s mother keeps badgering 
her and me to move up.


30:04.113 --> 30:05.906
I’m just trying to make her happy.


30:05.907 --> 30:07.617
If I make this sale today, 


30:07.617 --> 30:09.912
I’ll have enough 
to make the down payment 


30:09.912 --> 30:12.039
on the bigger apartment 
that I told you about, 


30:12.038 --> 30:21.111
the one on the East Side.

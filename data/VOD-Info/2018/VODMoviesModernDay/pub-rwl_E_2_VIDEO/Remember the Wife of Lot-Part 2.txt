00:00 Previously on Remember the Wife of Lot.
00:04 We wanted to invite you, all of you,
00:06 uh, to the hall this Sunday.
00:08 We have a special speaker.
00:09 We’ll have to talk about that.
00:11 Yeah.
00:12 The safest road is to get a good job with a good company.
00:15 Yeah, but should we be pushing Anna and Tina
00:17 to succeed in this system?
00:20 We are living at a time when it is vital that
00:24 we do not look back in a figurative sense.
00:40 Brian, this stock is going so well.
00:43 You’ve got to join us.
00:45 Thanks for thinking of me, Henry, but I can’t accept it.
00:47 Why not?
00:48 This is a good opportunity,
00:49 and you need more income.
00:50 You seem confident, Henry,
00:51 but, uh, I’m sorry, I just can’t accept it.
00:53 You don’t trust my investment strategy.
00:56 That’s it, isn’t it?
00:58 Just say so.
00:59 Look, you already know I think your latest investments are risky.
01:01 And, no, I’m not going to gamble my meager funds,
01:04 but that’s not it.
01:05 Brian, these days we’ve got to risk money to make money.
01:10 Don’t you understand that?
01:11 Even if there weren’t any risk involved,
01:13 I can’t accept a job offer that’s going to take
01:16 so much of my time and money.
01:17 Brian, I don’t get it.
01:20 All you have to do is sacrifice a little time for a couple of years
01:24 and you’d have all the money you need.
01:26 Henry, I hope it works out for you, OK?
01:28 But I can’t accept, all right?
01:30 Just—just say hi to Jennifer for me, OK?
01:32 All right, bye.
01:40 Who was that?
01:41 Your client?
01:42 That was just your brother.
01:43 He wants to get me involved in one of his investment businesses.
01:46 But I don’t have the time or money for that.
01:47 Well, I think we need to invest our money
01:50 into something more secure like real estate.
01:53 And we need to move across town where we can network
01:56 with more influential people.
01:58 Is this your mom’s idea?
02:00 Because we can’t afford this.
02:02 We’re already too much in debt.
02:03 Well, look!
02:04 We can mortgage this place
02:06 and then rent it out.
02:07 We’re not taking full advantage of this opportunity.
02:09 We need to put the Kingdom first.
02:10 I am putting the Kingdom first,
02:12 but this is the time to think about our future.
02:14 How many working years do we have left anyway?
02:17 But if you don’t plan ahead,  we’ll end up living on the street.
02:24 Why are you all dressed up like this?
02:26 Are-are you going out in service?
02:28 I’m going to real estate classes.
02:31 What?  We didn’t talk about this!
02:33 Why?
02:34 If you made more money,  I wouldn’t have to!
02:37 We’ve never gone without.
02:39 Gloria, wait.
02:43 Do you have cash?
02:46 I need it for a taxi.
02:48 Please?
03:36 Hey, boys,  I just heard your dad pull up.
03:40 Start getting ready for dinner.
03:42 Nice.
03:49 Hey, boys.
03:50 Hey, Dad.
03:51 Hey, Babe.
03:52 How is it going?
03:52 Oh, all right.  How are you doing?
03:54 Good.
03:54 What a day.
03:55 Hey, dinner is going to be ready soon,
03:57 so go wash up, OK?
03:58 Oh, all right, yeah.
03:59 Hey, guys, you want to wrap this game up?
04:02 Let’s get ready for dinner.
04:06 Here you go.
04:09 Hey!
04:09 What did I just say?
04:12 Put this furniture back, and get ready for dinner!
04:18 There’s something important we got to talk about tonight.
04:24 So, what did you want to talk about that was so important?
04:29 All right.  OK.
04:31 Look.  I’ve decided something.
04:36 I decided that I want to—
04:38 Well, I—I want us all
04:41 to start studying the Bible together.
04:44 What?
04:45 Do you mean you want me to become a priest?
04:46 Come on, Rick.
04:48 It’s Jehovah’s Witnesses, isn’t it, Dad?
04:50 I borrowed your book.
04:52 I liked it.
04:53 Well, I think it’s a good idea.
04:56 You know, I really like those people,
04:58 and it seems to be helping you, Joe.
05:00 You seem so much happier.
05:02 Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, I am.
05:05 So like I said, that’s what I decided.
05:08 But I really want us all to be in on this together.
05:11 All right?
05:12 So...
05:14 what do you say, boys?
05:15 Sure, Dad.
05:21 Rick?
05:25 Come on, Rick.
06:16 Gloria?  Is that you?
06:18 Yeah, it’s me.
06:26 Gloria, what is all of this?
06:28 Oh, it’s some new things that I picked up today.
06:31 I made my first sale today.
06:33 Aren’t you happy?
06:35 Yeah, that’s-that’s great.
06:37 We need the extra income,  but it looks like you spent it already.
06:41 Yeah, it’s just a few things.
06:42 Uncle told me that I have to look professional to work for him.
06:46 If I’m going to move up and attract the right type of upscale client,
06:49 I have to look the part, you know?
06:52 But, Gloria, I thought you were doing this just to get
06:55 a little extra income for our necessities?
06:58 How much time are you  planning to spend on this?
07:01 As much as it takes.
07:02 You can’t be successful by working less.
07:05 We already have a very full schedule
07:07 with our spiritual routine.
07:08 We have to make sacrifices  for what’s most important in life.
07:11 You know that.
07:12 This new job—I’m worried.
07:14 It may mean sacrificing time
07:15 we should be spending on spiritual things.
07:18 What about your pioneering?
07:19 What about it?
07:20 I can do both.
07:43 All right.  Here you go, Joe, your first door.
07:46 OK.
07:53 Good morning, Sir, how are you?
07:55 Oh, you people again?
07:57 Look, don’t you have real jobs?
07:58 I have a real job, and you keep waking me up.
08:00 OK?
08:01 I’m sorry, Frank.  Forgive us.
08:02 We didn’t mean to upset you, man.
08:03 Joe?
08:04 Yeah, it’s me, Joe.
08:05 I didn’t even recognize you, man.
08:07 How are you doing, Joe, man?
08:08 Hey, how are you doing, Frank?
08:09 I’m sorry.
08:10 I’m good. It’s been a while.
08:11 It has.
08:12 We used to work together back in the day.
08:14 Oh, OK.
08:14 When was the last time we saw each other?
08:15 I think it was that time we were hauling that lumber.
08:17 Oh, when we were loading it, and then it all fell over in the street.
08:20 It fell all over the street.
08:21 It took us forever to clean it up.
08:23 Forever.  It was terrible.
08:24 What you should have seen was how mad this guy got.
08:27 Oh.
08:27 He was so mad, man.
08:28 You could almost see the fumes coming out of his ears.
08:30 Yeah, that was the old Joe, Frank.
08:32 It looks like I got a new Joe here though.
08:34 You’re all dressed up and everything.
08:35 Yeah, yeah.
08:35 What brings you by?
08:36 Well, actually,  we have some good news
08:38 we’d like to share with you.
08:39 Good news, huh?
08:40 OK, I like good news.
08:42 Well, why don’t you come on in?
08:43 And I’ll get some beers,  and we can talk about this good news.
08:44 OK.
08:44 But no thanks on the beers this morning.
08:46 Oh, OK.  Well, come on in anyway.
08:55 Mom,
08:56 this place is so big and fancy.
08:58 I could make so much money  if I close this deal today.
09:01 Uncle would be so proud.
09:04 That’s my little Gloria.
09:06 You make me so proud now.
09:09 I’ll tell all my relatives
09:11 what a big important realtor my daughter is.
09:14 What about Anna?
09:15 Did she accept the internship with your cousin’s business?
09:19 You know how hard I worked to set it up.
09:21 I know, Mom.
09:22 Thank you so much for everything.
09:24 She starts next week.
09:25 You make me so happy.
09:27 There’s something else.
09:28 If I make this sale today,
09:31 I’ll have enough to make the down payment
09:33 on the bigger apartment  that I told you about,
09:35 the one on the East Side.
09:36 The fancy one your uncle’s firm owns?
09:39 Yes.  That one.
09:40 Oh, I’m so excited.
09:43 I know, me too.
09:44 I can’t wait to tell everybody.
09:45 Mom, I think my clients are here.
09:47 I got to go.
09:48 Talk to you later, OK?
09:49 OK.
09:55 Hello, come on in.
09:57 Good to see you guys.
09:59 The color contrast is very nice and flows into this living area.
10:11 Here’s the contract.
10:12 Please sign at the bottom of the page.
10:20 Congratulations.
10:21 Thank you.
10:22 It’s all yours.
10:23 Thank you, Gloria.
10:23 Enjoy it.
10:24 Thank you.
11:20 Joe, Mary.
11:22 Hi, boys.
11:23 Congratulations.
11:24 Thanks, Brother Williams.
11:25 Thanks so much.
11:27 I’m really proud of them all.
11:28 Yeah, so am I.
11:29 Yeah.
11:29 Well, how have you been?
11:30 You know, we’ve been good.
11:31 Um, it’s like Jesus said,
11:33 we always have enough to pay the bills
11:35 and sometimes, even a little extra.
11:37 Ricky, congratulations.
11:39 Aw, thank you.  Thank you so much.
11:40 I’m so happy for you.
11:42 Yeah, but, hey, I know it’s just the beginning.
11:44 Really?  So, what’s next?
11:46 Actually,  I want to learn sign language.
11:47 Wow!
11:48 Maybe join the congregation, hopefully pretty soon.
11:51 That sounds exciting.  Good for you.
11:53 I’ve been teaching myself so far.
11:55 Yeah.
11:55 Um, as far as I’ve gotten is,
11:56 “I’m learning sign language.”
11:59 And that’s all I know.
12:00 That’s very impressive.
12:01 You’ve got to start somewhere.
12:03 Yeah, that’s true.
12:04 Tina.
12:04 Come over here.
12:06 What are you doing?
12:08 I was just congratulating Ricky.
12:09 Hi, Tina.
12:12 Hi, Gloria.
12:13 Hi, Brother Williams.
12:13 How are you?
12:14 Good.
12:14 I would love to talk to you,  but I have an appointment.
12:16 I got to go.
12:17 Oh.
12:18 Talk to you later, OK?
12:19 Oh, OK.
12:21 Brian,
12:22 where is Gloria going?
12:24 Is she OK?
12:25 Oh, yeah, Brother Williams, uh, she-she had to leave.
12:28 Um, Gloria is going to catch  the rest of the assembly next week.
12:31 Um, it’s just been so busy with her real estate job lately.
12:35 We needed the extra money.
12:37 You know,  we moved into a better place
12:38 over on the east side of town,
12:40 well, I’m working a little bit more too.
12:43 I’m just trying to make her happy.
12:48 True happiness, Brian
12:51 —joy—it’s spiritual.
12:54 You can’t satisfy spiritual needs with material things.
13:00 I know, Brother Williams,
13:02 but this extra stress,  it’s just temporary.
13:04 I’ve-I’ve thought it all through.
13:07 We’ve prayed about it, and we’ve asked
13:10 for Jehovah to bless this decision.
13:12 Now you know, Brian,
13:15 Jehovah God cannot bless a decision
13:18 if it is not in harmony with his will.
13:20 Look at yourself.
13:22 You don’t seem happy.
13:26 But what can I do now?
13:28 Do all you can to protect your family spiritually
13:31 and to save your girls.
13:38 I appreciate the encouragement,  Brother Williams.
13:40 You’re welcome.
13:43 You know,  it seems like it’s been a while
13:45 since we’ve been able to talk like this.
13:47 Oh, it has been.
13:50 If you’re not busy, would you be able to come over
13:53 and join us for dinner  tomorrow night?
13:55 You know, I would love to do that.
13:57 Why don’t you text me your new address and the time,
14:00 and I’ll look forward  to seeing you tomorrow.
14:02 That sounds good?
14:03 That sounds great.
14:04 Excellent.
14:05 Thank you, Brother Williams.
14:06 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
14:07 OK.
14:07 OK.  Bye-bye.
14:19 Hey, Mom,  can I help with anything?
14:21 Oh, yeah.
14:22 Can you put the lemons in the water?
14:23 OK.
14:24 Hey, guys, Brother Williams is going to be here any minute, OK?
14:27 OK.
14:31 And Anna and her friend from the North Congregation
14:33 are supposed to come too, right?
14:35 Yep, that’s the plan.
14:40 I’ll get it.
14:40 Thank you, Tina.
14:46 Hey, Brother Williams.
14:48 Hi, Tina.
14:49 Come on in.
14:49 How are you?
14:50 Good.
14:50 It’s good to see you.
14:51 Brother Williams, you made it.
14:53 Thanks for coming over.
14:54 Of course.  Thanks for the invitation.
14:56 Very nice.
14:57 Welcome.
14:58 Hi, Gloria.
14:59 Hi, Brother Williams.
15:01 I think I’d get lost in this big apartment.
15:04 Jehovah blessed  us for our hard work.
15:07 Really, it just means longer hours
15:09 on the job and more work around the house.
15:12 You know,  the other day in field service,
15:15 we passed by your old house.
15:16 I liked that place.
15:18 I remember our nice visits there.
15:19 I do too.
15:21 That was a great place.
15:22 Well, Tina, do you want to show
15:24 Brother Williams around while I finish the coffee?
15:26 OK, come on in.
15:30 Brother Williams likes the old place.
15:33 It seems like he likes it here too.
15:42 It all seems very nice.
15:44 What do you think of this place, Tina?
15:46 Well, honestly,
15:50 I wish we never left the other place.
15:53 Really?
15:53 Why do you feel that way?
15:57 Everything is so different here.
16:00 Everything has to look good
16:01 for you to fit in.
16:03 You have to wear the nicest clothes.
16:05 You have to drive the most expensive car.
16:08 Everything is— It’s just— It’s just different, that’s all.
16:13 Yeah, you know, I understand.
16:15 I was about your age when we moved into a new neighborhood,
16:18 and it can certainly be challenging.
16:21 But you know what might help?
16:23 If you set a new goal.
16:25 OK, like what?
16:26 Well, what do you think?
16:28 What interests you?
16:29 Well, I was thinking of learning a new language.
16:34 Really?
16:35 That’s an excellent goal.
16:38 What do you think of Ricky learning sign language?
16:40 Ah, I think it’s really exciting.
16:42 I do too.
16:43 You know, he is really making the truth his own,
16:46 and if he keeps on applying himself,
16:48 Jehovah God is going to really bless him.
16:51 Yeah.
16:52 I was hoping to see Anna.
16:53 Is Anna here?
16:55 Oh, she is with Kevin.
16:57 Kevin?
16:58 Kevin who?
17:00 Kevin is one of our relatives.
17:01 They work together at a pharmaceutical company.
17:03 He’s a pretty nice guy and from a nice family too.
17:07 Tina, are you OK?
17:10 How do you think Anna is doing?
17:15 Um, she’s—
17:19 she’s going through different things right now.
17:22 We invited her friend over from the other congregation
17:25 to maybe encourage her.
17:26 That’s nice.
17:28 But you know,  I have to commend you
17:31 because you’re doing so well spiritually,
17:35 keeping up with your spiritual routine,
17:37 and you’re thinking about learning a new language so you can help out.
17:40 Keep up the good work.
17:41 Don’t give up.
17:43 But, Tina, we’re not going to give up on your sister.
17:48 She has the potential of being a fine servant of Jehovah.
17:52 And she has a good heart.
17:54 I’m confident that in time,  she’s going to make the right decisions.
17:58 Brother Williams,  here is your coffee.
17:59 Thank you.
18:01 Sorry, Brother Williams, I have to finish getting ready.
18:03 Oh, OK.
18:06 This looks really good, Anna.
18:08 Good job.
18:08 Really?
18:09 Thanks.
18:11 Hey, we’re still behind schedule, though,
18:13 so I’m going to have to ask you to work overtime
18:15 with the rest of the team just until we get caught up.
18:17 OK?
18:18 But I can’t tonight.
18:19 I have a family dinner  I have to go to.
18:21 Dinner?
18:22 Anna, if you want to be successful, work needs to come first.
18:26 Everyone else is doing it.
18:30 Fine.
18:31 I’ll text my mom and tell her I can’t make it.
18:33 Good.
18:34 Don’t worry.  She’ll understand.
18:35 It’s not my mom I’m worried about; it’s my dad.
18:38 He doesn’t want me working late anymore.
18:41 Fine, um, I’ll cover for you.
18:43 We’re all working late anyways, so I’ll give everyone a ride home
18:46 and afterwards  we’ll step in for a few minutes
18:48 and I’ll explain that it’s all my fault.
18:50 OK?
18:52 OK.
18:53 So does this mean
18:54 we’re going to meet those uptight parents of yours?
18:56 They’re not that uptight.
18:58 I’m kidding.
18:58 Lighten up.
18:59 Hey, Anna’s family is pretty conservative,
19:02 so just be careful what you do say.
19:04 This should be interesting.
19:06 Tess, just be nice, OK?
19:11 I had a really good time tonight.
19:13 I’m glad  Brother Williams could make it.
19:16 Yeah, it was very nice.
19:17 Yeah, I think he had a good time too.
19:19 Yeah.
19:21 Oh, Anna is home.
19:23 Hi.
19:24 Hey.
19:26 It’s customary to take our shoes off.
19:27 So—
19:28 Oh, OK.
19:28 Hey, Kevin is here too.
19:30 Come on in, guys.
19:32 Um, I know Kevin, but who are your friends, Anna?
19:36 Oh, yeah.
19:37 Mom, Dad, this is Tess and Eric.
19:40 We’re in the same intern program.
19:41 Nice to meet you all.
19:42 Come on in.  Have a seat.
19:44 Anna, come here.
19:46 Um, would you like something to eat or drink?
19:51 Anna,
19:52 you missed dinner with Brother Williams tonight.
19:54 And your friend from the North Congregation, she came too.
19:56 What happened?
19:58 Dad, I know, but we had to work late.
20:00 I sent Mom a text.
20:02 Anna,
20:02 I was trying to do something spiritually encouraging for the family.
20:07 We’re worried about you, Honey.
20:09 OK, Dad,
20:09 I’m sorry, but it’s no big deal.
20:12 It’s just that the new medication we’re working on,
20:14 it goes to market soon.
20:16 It’s really important.
20:17 It could save people’s lives.
20:19 No big deal?
20:20 Anna, first of all, you know only God’s Kingdom will solve our problems.
20:25 These kids and your work,
20:27 it’s getting in the way of what’s most important.
20:30 Dad, these kids are on my team,
20:32 and they understand what I’m working on, the brothers don’t.
20:35 It’s way over their heads.
20:37 Anna, don’t you see?
20:39 They’re changing you.
20:40 Would you relax?
20:42 Just go talk to them, OK?
20:51 You know,
20:52 I really wanted to apologize to both of you.
20:55 It’s my fault that Anna is late today.
20:57 I asked the entire team to work overtime
20:59 so we could get caught up on the schedule.
21:00 But just to let you know,  she’s doing really good.
21:03 And we really do enjoy having her on the team.
21:05 OK, thank you.
21:06 You know,
21:06 not just that, she’s working with some good people.
21:09 Tess and Eric,  they’re some of the best
21:12 up-and-coming talents  we have in the field.
21:14 Your parents  must be really proud of you.
21:16 Well, my moms are both really proud of me.
21:18 I was raised by two wonderful women,
21:20 you know, life partners.
21:22 Oh, huh.
21:25 Yeah.
21:25 Um, you know,  my assistant, Marty?
21:28 I recently found out that he’s gay.
21:31 You say that like there’s something wrong with it.
21:33 Do you have a problem?
21:34 Tess, don’t do this.
21:36 Why?
21:36 There’s nothing wrong with being gay.
21:38 Tess,
21:39 we live by the Bible’s moral standards,
21:42 but we don’t force our beliefs on other people,
21:45 and we don’t judge anyone either.
21:47 But you do think being gay is wrong.
21:48 Eric, remember where we’re at.
21:52 Well, we believe there are standards of right and wrong
21:55 that we should live by,
21:56 and God’s Word says that
21:57 sex is meant to be between a man and a woman
21:59 who are married to each other.
22:01 Look,
22:02 I don’t mean to be rude, Sir, but the world has changed.
22:05 Honey, maybe we’re being too harsh on gays.
22:08 Some people just seem to be programmed that way.
22:11 Look, I know not everyone agrees with us,
22:13 but we all have free will,
22:15 and God lets us choose to live by his standards or not.
22:18 If we go against his standards,  we end up hurting ourselves.
22:22 He just wants what’s best for us.
22:25 Anna, what about you?
22:28 Do you agree with your father?
22:31 Well—
22:35 You know, we actually have another project due tomorrow.
22:39 It’s probably best that we get going.
22:41 Yeah.
22:41 Wait.
22:42 At least let me walk you guys outside.
22:59 So this is our Anna’s association.
23:02 They’re just kids.
23:04 Kids talk like they know everything.
23:07 Our Anna believes them.
23:17 OK, so I think you have all the invoices, right?
23:20 I gave you all the receipts, right?
23:23 Yep, I just got a couple more steps.
23:31 OK, Joe,
23:33 your books are clean.
23:35 I have no more concerns,
23:36 and amazingly,  you’re out of debt.
23:43 Amazingly.
23:45 I don’t-I don’t think so, man.
23:47 It’s like you’ve always said,
23:49 “If you do things Jehovah’s way,”
23:51 right?
23:52 “He’ll help us.”
23:54 Hey, um, I got to go.
23:57 Um, you’ve got everything that you need.
23:59 I think it looks good.
24:00 So I’m just going to leave, OK?
24:02 Oh, oh, all right, OK.
24:03 Hey-hey, Brian, um, could you stick around for another minute?
24:08 There’s something I need to talk to you about.
24:11 Um, yeah, sure.
24:12 Yeah, thanks.
24:22 Look, Brian, I owe you a huge debt of gratitude, man.
24:25 Um, I was thinking back on when we first started studying.
24:28 Do you remember that?
24:29 I had all sorts of issues with my life,
24:32 my family, my business.
24:34 And my whole life was messed up,
24:36 and one of the things that you always talked to me about was Matthew 6:24.
24:42 Do you remember that?
24:43 ‘No one can serve two masters.
24:45 You cannot slave  for God and for Riches.’
24:48 I’m sorry, Joe,  I’m not getting it.
24:50 What are you trying to say?
24:52 Well, I guess  what I’m trying to say is
24:55 I’m concerned about you.
24:58 About me?
24:59 Yes, yes, about you
25:02 and your family.
25:04 And I’m not talking about financially.
25:06 Brian, I’m talking about spiritually.
25:08 I mean, you’re the one who —who always taught me
25:10 to never cave in to other people’s expectations of me.
25:14 And now it seems like —like you’re the one who’s doing that.
25:17 Man, what are you  talking about, Joe?
25:19 Brian,
25:20 your whole life is changing, man, and not for the better.
25:24 Look,
25:24 it’s written all over your face!
25:27 Listen, you have no idea how much pressure
25:30 Gloria is putting on me.
25:32 You don’t know what it’s like to try to balance two lives
25:35 —two worlds— and try to make it work.
25:38 No, man, you’re right.
25:40 You’re right.  I don’t know what that’s like.
25:41 So don’t tell me
25:42 about not changing for the better.
25:45 Brian,
25:46 all I know is what you taught me.
25:49 And what you taught me  was good, man.
25:51 You made me look at myself,
25:53 my-my family, my whole situation.
25:56 And I had to ask myself: ‘Do-do I really know God?
25:59 Am I truly happy?’
26:02 I mean, what you taught me, Brian,
26:04 it gave me something new —the new world.
26:06 It opened that up to me.
26:07 It gave me and Mary and the kids,
26:09 it gave us all something to live for, Brian.
26:12 But now when I look at you
26:14 —my-my teacher, my brother, my friend—
26:19 all I see is an unhappy man.
26:23 So I thought it’d be a kind thing to help you the way you helped me.
26:28 Brian, I made those changes in my life,
26:30 the repairs that you helped me to make.
26:34 So I just thought you could use a little reminder yourself
26:39 because, frankly, you’re not  the same person that I once knew.
26:46 Man, I got to go.
26:56 Thanks for listening.
27:05 Next time on Remember the Wife of Lot.
27:07 The way you live reflects on me.
27:10 You must learn to keep your religion in its place.
27:13 You could lose all this very easily.
27:16 Do you understand?
27:19 Think of all we taught the girls when they were little
27:22 about putting Jehovah  ahead of everything else.
27:26 This is your copy here.
27:27 OK, thank you.
27:28 OK.
27:29 Director Williams,
27:30 this is a nice surprise.
27:32 I haven’t seen you since you were overseeing our division.
27:34 But I mean,  what brings you here?
27:36 If you have a moment,
27:37 I’d love to tell you about it.

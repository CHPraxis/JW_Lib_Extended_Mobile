00:01.188 --> 00:04.608
Previously on
Remember the Wife of Lot.


00:04.608 --> 00:06.151
I’m going to real estate classes.


00:06.152 --> 00:07.987
What? 
We didn’t talk about this! 


00:07.987 --> 00:09.112
Why?


00:09.112 --> 00:12.115
If you made more money,
I wouldn’t have to!


00:12.115 --> 00:13.158
Gloria, wait.


00:13.158 --> 00:14.535
I’ve decided something.


00:14.535 --> 00:15.660
What is it?


00:15.660 --> 00:17.997
To start studying
the Bible together.


00:17.997 --> 00:19.415
Do you mean you want me
to become a priest?


00:19.415 --> 00:20.290
Come on, Rick.


00:20.290 --> 00:22.292
It’s Jehovah’s Witnesses,
isn’t it, Dad?


00:22.292 --> 00:23.627
What are you trying to say?


00:23.627 --> 00:25.379
All I see is an unhappy man.


00:25.378 --> 00:28.881
You have no idea how much
pressure Gloria is putting on me.


00:28.882 --> 00:31.000
You’re not the same person
that I once knew.


00:43.480 --> 00:44.898
Everybody, squeeze in. 


00:44.898 --> 00:45.000
Smile.


00:47.943 --> 00:48.901
How did it turn out?


00:48.902 --> 00:49.695
Oh, it turned out good.


00:49.695 --> 00:50.695
Oh, it’s nice.


00:50.695 --> 00:51.780
Very nice.


00:51.780 --> 00:52.530
It’s very nice.


00:52.530 --> 00:53.000
Sure.


01:09.632 --> 01:11.009
It was time for something new. 


01:11.008 --> 01:12.843
Actually,
we got many new things.


01:12.843 --> 01:14.636
We even got a new piano for Anna.


01:14.637 --> 01:15.304
Oh, nice.


01:15.303 --> 01:16.000
Yeah. 


01:17.807 --> 01:18.849
Oh, Brian is home. 


01:18.848 --> 01:20.016
Have some dessert, OK?


01:20.017 --> 01:20.892
Thank you.


01:20.892 --> 01:21.000
Hey, Brian.


01:22.102 --> 01:23.020
Hey.


01:23.020 --> 01:25.772
I’ve invited some relatives for dinner.


01:25.772 --> 01:27.984
Yeah, so I see.


01:27.983 --> 01:29.526
Are you hungry? 


01:29.527 --> 01:30.527
Do you want some?


01:30.527 --> 01:32.070
Oh, here are the oranges.


01:32.070 --> 01:33.572
Oh, thank you. 


01:33.572 --> 01:34.740
Hey, let’s go. 


01:34.740 --> 01:35.323
Come on.


01:35.323 --> 01:35.991
Wait a minute. 


01:35.992 --> 01:37.575
Hold—hold on, Gloria. 


01:37.575 --> 01:40.370
Why did you arrange 
this without telling me?


01:40.370 --> 01:43.000
Well, surprise!


02:23.997 --> 02:26.250
Why did you arrange
this without telling me?


02:26.250 --> 02:28.543
I thought it would be nice
to have a family dinner.


02:28.543 --> 02:30.378
But none of them are in the truth.


02:30.378 --> 02:33.000
How else are we
going to witness to them?


02:34.173 --> 02:35.675
They’re only here to socialize. 


02:35.675 --> 02:37.762
They’re not here
to talk about Jehovah.


02:37.762 --> 02:38.470
Come on, Brian. 


02:38.470 --> 02:39.178
They’re family. 


02:39.178 --> 02:40.013
Let’s go and talk.


02:40.013 --> 02:40.680
Oh.


02:40.680 --> 02:42.933
Is your mother OK?


02:42.933 --> 02:44.393
Eh, she’s fine. 


02:44.393 --> 02:45.226
Hey, Henry.


02:45.227 --> 02:45.935
Hey.


02:45.935 --> 02:46.895
I’ll let you guys talk.


02:46.895 --> 02:48.647
Oh, OK.


02:48.647 --> 02:50.232
Hello, Henry, how are you?


02:50.232 --> 02:50.815
OK. 


02:50.815 --> 02:52.860
We haven’t seen much of you lately.


02:52.860 --> 02:54.110
Yeah, well,
we’ve been pretty busy.


02:54.110 --> 02:55.320
Busy? 


02:55.320 --> 02:58.990
Well, I can tell
you spend a lot of time


02:58.990 --> 03:00.950
with your church but not with us. 


03:00.950 --> 03:03.000
We feel really left out.


03:05.497 --> 03:06.499
Hey, guys.


03:06.498 --> 03:06.915
Hey.


03:06.915 --> 03:08.000
How are you guys doing?


03:10.252 --> 03:12.714
We have other relatives 
who are Christians. 


03:12.713 --> 03:16.341
I mean, they really spend time 
with us during holidays.


03:16.342 --> 03:18.927
Henry, as I’ve explained before,


03:18.927 --> 03:20.429
when we became Witnesses, 


03:20.428 --> 03:23.681
there are just certain practices
we don’t want to compromise on. 


03:23.682 --> 03:26.000
Our beliefs are very important to us. 


03:27.685 --> 03:32.565
Between that and—and work, 
we really do have busy schedules.


03:32.565 --> 03:37.278
Well, speaking of work, um,
I’m out of work at this moment.


03:37.278 --> 03:38.863
I’m sorry to hear that, Henry.


03:38.863 --> 03:43.785
So if you hear of any job openings,
I mean, I’ve got a lot of experience.


03:43.785 --> 03:45.120
Would you excuse us for a moment?


03:45.120 --> 03:47.000
Of course.


03:48.748 --> 03:51.710
Gloria, 
recently you have done well. 


03:51.710 --> 03:55.172
I must congratulate you
on your hard work with my company.


03:55.172 --> 03:57.507
Thank you, Uncle.


03:57.507 --> 04:01.554
But do not forget, it’s not just your


04:01.553 --> 04:03.471
hard work that has given you all this.


04:03.472 --> 04:04.432
Yes, Uncle. 


04:04.432 --> 04:05.390
I understand, 


04:05.390 --> 04:07.475
and thank you for everything.


04:07.475 --> 04:11.688
Then you must not let me down.


04:11.688 --> 04:13.731
What do you mean, Uncle?


04:13.732 --> 04:16.000
I am talking about your priorities.


04:17.568 --> 04:19.195
What about them?


04:19.195 --> 04:22.657
You must learn to keep
your religion in its place. 


04:22.657 --> 04:25.000
Of course,
you can have your God, 


04:26.162 --> 04:29.039
but it must not interfere
with what’s most


04:29.038 --> 04:34.711
important in your life
—your relatives and your career. 


04:34.712 --> 04:37.464
Your religion gets in the way
of what’s expected of you.


04:37.463 --> 04:39.466
Well, Uncle, I understand


04:39.467 --> 04:43.512
how important those things are to you
and to all of my relatives,


04:43.512 --> 04:45.972
but as I explained to you before, 


04:45.972 --> 04:48.850
when I became
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


04:48.850 --> 04:52.187
spiritual things also
became very important to me.


04:52.187 --> 04:53.314
Yes. 


04:53.313 --> 04:57.000
And I have never agreed
with your choice, have I?


04:58.318 --> 04:59.903
No.


04:59.903 --> 05:01.738
And yet I’ve given you this job. 


05:01.738 --> 05:04.866
I helped you get
this beautiful apartment 


05:04.867 --> 05:08.000
because the way
you live reflects on me. 


05:09.580 --> 05:12.623
You know that since
your father passed away, 


05:12.623 --> 05:15.210
I’ve taken
the responsibility as family head 


05:15.210 --> 05:19.882
towards you as well as
your mother and your brother. 


05:19.882 --> 05:23.000
Have you forgotten
all I have done for you?


05:25.137 --> 05:26.000
No. 


05:27.013 --> 05:29.933
I do remember.


05:29.933 --> 05:34.000
Then you must serve my company
and work hard for me. 


05:35.772 --> 05:37.774
This is for family, Gloria. 


05:37.773 --> 05:40.401
This must be your priority. 


05:40.402 --> 05:42.000
You must make me proud. 


05:44.197 --> 05:47.952
Remember what I’ve said to you. 


05:47.952 --> 05:51.162
You could lose all this very easily. 


05:51.162 --> 05:54.000
Do you understand?


05:55.833 --> 05:58.000
Yes, I understand.


05:59.922 --> 06:01.000
Good.


06:21.610 --> 06:24.947
Mom, why are you 
reading a medical book?


06:24.947 --> 06:26.574
I’m reading about my problem.


06:26.573 --> 06:27.781
Problem? 


06:27.782 --> 06:28.825
What problem?


06:28.825 --> 06:30.368
The pain in my back.


06:30.368 --> 06:32.661
You didn’t tell me you had any pain.


06:32.662 --> 06:35.457
I called you three times, 
but you didn’t answer.


06:35.457 --> 06:37.750
Mom, I didn’t see any calls from you.


06:37.750 --> 06:40.920
I wouldn’t need to call you
if you would visit me. 


06:40.920 --> 06:43.757
I hardly see you anymore 
since you moved here.


06:43.757 --> 06:46.302
Mom, I came by only three days ago.


06:46.302 --> 06:48.679
One day, you’ll come by


06:48.678 --> 06:51.000
and find me on the floor,
not breathing. 


06:52.807 --> 06:55.000
I want you to take me to the doctor.


06:56.395 --> 06:57.938
Go ahead and laugh.


06:57.938 --> 06:59.856
Are you going to follow
his instructions this time?


06:59.857 --> 07:02.650
At this rate, 
I may not be around


07:02.650 --> 07:04.987
to see my granddaughters get married.


07:04.987 --> 07:05.820
Mom, listen. 


07:05.820 --> 07:08.157
We’re going to see
the doctor tomorrow. 


07:08.157 --> 07:09.909
OK?


07:09.908 --> 07:11.785
Gloria,


07:11.785 --> 07:16.038
when you were little,
my mom used to live with us


07:16.038 --> 07:18.500
and later your father’s mother too. 


07:18.500 --> 07:19.877
Remember that?


07:19.877 --> 07:20.877
Yes.


07:20.877 --> 07:23.797
My apartment is not like this, 


07:23.797 --> 07:26.342
big and warm. 


07:26.342 --> 07:30.000
Mine is cold and drafty, 
you know? 


07:31.178 --> 07:35.975
I think that’s why I have this pain.


07:35.975 --> 07:37.000
Come on, Mom.


07:43.942 --> 07:46.000
“That’s why I have this pain.” 


07:49.698 --> 07:52.000
Oh, she wants to move in with us. 


07:55.078 --> 07:57.000
Oh, man.


08:01.418 --> 08:02.335
Hey.


08:02.335 --> 08:03.000
Hey.


08:08.675 --> 08:11.720
Oh, Brother Williams’ next visit


08:11.720 --> 08:14.388
is the third week of March. 


08:14.388 --> 08:16.600
That’s the same week 
of the Memorial.


08:16.600 --> 08:19.060
So make sure you
put that in your calendar.


08:19.060 --> 08:20.000
OK. 


08:21.228 --> 08:26.610
Oh, I have a big showing
on the same day as the Memorial. 


08:26.610 --> 08:29.612
It—it’s the new property 
that Uncle asked me to handle.


08:29.612 --> 08:32.199
The—the day of the Memorial?


08:32.198 --> 08:34.000
Yeah.


08:35.035 --> 08:36.953
Ah, it’s OK. 


08:36.953 --> 08:39.000
I—I can get Marty to cover
for me once I set up.


08:40.457 --> 08:43.460
OK, you better make sure
that he can handle that.


08:43.460 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, I will.


08:46.963 --> 08:48.000
All right. 


08:51.635 --> 08:55.000
Hey, what were you and Uncle
talking about on the balcony tonight?


08:56.557 --> 08:57.557
It’s nothing. 


08:57.557 --> 08:59.184
We were just talking about business.


08:59.183 --> 09:00.310
Are you sure? 


09:00.310 --> 09:03.000
Because it seemed 
like it bothered you.


09:05.482 --> 09:06.650
Well, 


09:06.650 --> 09:09.000
he’s putting a lot of pressure on me. 


09:10.445 --> 09:11.405
It’s OK. 


09:11.405 --> 09:13.532
I can handle it.


09:13.532 --> 09:15.325
Really? 


09:15.325 --> 09:17.993
I mean, but can we?


09:17.993 --> 09:19.000
What do you mean?


09:21.665 --> 09:24.000
I’m just saying, look at us. 


09:27.545 --> 09:28.422
Actually, 


09:28.422 --> 09:30.674
Joe spoke with me today.


09:30.673 --> 09:32.008
About what?


09:32.008 --> 09:34.510
Well, he’s concerned
about us spiritually. 


09:34.510 --> 09:37.000
He feels we’ve become materialistic.


09:40.225 --> 09:43.687
Joe doesn’t understand our background. 


09:43.687 --> 09:47.107
And is it really wrong 
to try to improve our life?


09:47.107 --> 09:50.444
No, but, not if it
means putting anything 


09:50.443 --> 09:53.070
or anyone ahead of Jehovah.


09:53.070 --> 09:57.617
But don’t you think that we need to make
some sacrifices if we want nice things?


09:57.617 --> 10:01.370
We have made sacrifices, 
all the wrong ones. 


10:01.370 --> 10:03.748
You’ve even had to quit pioneering. 


10:03.748 --> 10:08.000
We’re neglecting
family worship, study, service. 


10:09.503 --> 10:13.425
We’ve even become too busy, 
or maybe too ashamed, 


10:13.425 --> 10:15.343
to even pray together. 


10:15.343 --> 10:20.306
Gloria, we’re drifting
apart from each other.


10:20.307 --> 10:22.559
But look at this place. 


10:22.558 --> 10:25.811
It is so nice. 


10:25.812 --> 10:27.000
I don’t want to give it up.


10:28.565 --> 10:30.858
Gloria, 


10:30.858 --> 10:34.528
we don’t want this place if it takes us


10:34.528 --> 10:37.990
or you away from Jehovah. 


10:37.990 --> 10:41.870
Besides, we haven’t been able
to rent out the old place yet. 


10:41.870 --> 10:44.915
We have two mortgages. 


10:44.915 --> 10:46.958
But more than that, Gloria, 


10:46.958 --> 10:50.461
think of all we taught
the girls when they were little


10:50.462 --> 10:54.000
about putting Jehovah
ahead of everything else. 


10:55.425 --> 10:57.677
Do you remember
Brother Williams’ talk a couple years ago


10:57.677 --> 11:01.599
about not being able
to serve two masters


11:01.598 --> 11:06.476
and how Lot’s wife
put her home ahead of Jehovah? 


11:06.477 --> 11:10.000
Jesus told her story
as a lesson for us. 


11:12.483 --> 11:15.000
We have to
“remember the wife of Lot.” 


11:16.153 --> 11:19.781
It didn’t have to end
that way for her, 


11:19.782 --> 11:22.000
and it doesn’t have 
to end that way for us.


11:25.955 --> 11:28.000
Do you think we are that bad?


11:30.710 --> 11:32.000
Come here.


11:46.350 --> 11:52.000
I want us to get back
to where we were, spiritually.


11:53.400 --> 11:57.000
I want you close 
to me again, remember? 


12:00.948 --> 12:03.618
Let’s say a prayer.


12:03.618 --> 12:04.000
OK.


12:08.498 --> 12:12.251
Jehovah God, our heavenly Father,
we come before you. 


12:12.252 --> 12:14.587
We pray all of this in Jesus’ name. 


12:14.587 --> 12:15.755
Amen.


12:15.755 --> 12:17.000
Amen.


12:21.135 --> 12:23.178
We can turn this around. 


12:23.178 --> 12:25.056
We can do it. 


12:25.057 --> 12:26.850
OK? 


12:26.850 --> 12:28.852
Jehovah will help us. 


12:28.852 --> 12:29.000
OK.


12:30.978 --> 12:33.000
I’m proud of you. 


12:35.733 --> 12:38.278
I’m going to finish cleaning up, OK?


12:38.278 --> 12:39.000
OK.


12:59.007 --> 13:02.000
We have to 
“remember the wife of Lot.” 


13:03.595 --> 13:06.000
It didn’t have to end that way for her,


13:07.765 --> 13:10.000
and it doesn’t
have to end that way for us. 


13:13.228 --> 13:16.000
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


13:32.123 --> 13:35.793
Hey, so I was wondering, tomorrow, 
what time do you think we’ll finish?


13:35.793 --> 13:37.878
Look, Anna,
we’re really behind schedule,


13:37.878 --> 13:40.298
so I need you 
to be a team player on this.


13:40.298 --> 13:41.173
OK. 


13:41.173 --> 13:42.925
When have I not been a team player?


13:42.925 --> 13:45.762
Some people on the team feel
that you’re getting special treatment 


13:45.762 --> 13:47.180
because we’re related, 


13:47.180 --> 13:49.932
and I have to make sure
that everyone gets treated equally.


13:49.932 --> 13:51.894
When have I ever
asked for special treatment?


13:51.893 --> 13:53.226
It’s your church meetings, Anna. 


13:53.227 --> 13:54.520
If we’re all working overtime,


13:54.520 --> 13:57.648
I can’t keep covering for you 
so you can go while everyone else stays.


13:57.648 --> 14:00.193
But you said when I started 
that it wouldn’t be a problem.


14:00.193 --> 14:03.613
Look, I remember what I said,
but things change, Anna. 


14:03.613 --> 14:05.240
And if you want
to be part of this team,


14:05.240 --> 14:06.657
you need to do your part, 


14:06.657 --> 14:08.075
and that’s starting now. 


14:08.075 --> 14:10.703
We’re working overtime every night
this week until we get caught up.


14:10.703 --> 14:12.455
Every night? 
I can’t do that, Kevin. 


14:12.455 --> 14:15.333
Tomorrow is a really
important meeting; it’s the Memorial. 


14:15.333 --> 14:16.793
I told you already.


14:16.793 --> 14:17.418
I remember, 


14:17.418 --> 14:19.378
but I can’t
make an exception for you. 


14:19.378 --> 14:20.130
But who knows? 


14:20.130 --> 14:24.800
Maybe if we work hard enough, 
we’ll get caught up and you could still go.


14:24.800 --> 14:25.000
Fine.


14:26.385 --> 14:28.597
Hey, it’s close to lunch. 


14:28.597 --> 14:30.807
Let’s grab the rest of the team
and get some food, 


14:30.807 --> 14:32.350
and we can talk about this later. 


14:32.350 --> 14:33.000
OK?


14:34.060 --> 14:34.893
Fine.


14:34.893 --> 14:35.978
Nice haircut, by the way.


14:35.978 --> 14:38.648
Thanks, 
my dad doesn’t like it though.


14:38.648 --> 14:40.000
Of course.


14:43.193 --> 14:45.655
It was so gross. 


14:45.655 --> 14:48.198
Hey, look at those 
religious fanatics over there. 


14:48.198 --> 14:50.743
I bet they get along great
with your strict parents.


14:50.743 --> 14:52.000
Hey, Anna!


14:54.205 --> 14:56.000
Did you see that?


14:58.627 --> 15:01.254
These are the
top headlines from BNC News. 


15:01.253 --> 15:03.255
Death tolls continue to rise


15:03.255 --> 15:05.048
in the wake of a massive earthquake 


15:05.048 --> 15:06.760
with a magnitude of 8.1


15:06.760 --> 15:09.678
that struck off the northern coast
of Taiwan on Tuesday


15:09.678 --> 15:12.515
and was felt as far away 
as Tokyo, Japan. 


15:12.515 --> 15:16.727
The resulting tsunami has caused
devastation in the entire region. 


15:16.727 --> 15:20.940
Meanwhile, the global financial 
meltdown continues to plague stocks


15:20.940 --> 15:24.277
as market prices dropped
drastically once again today. 


15:24.277 --> 15:28.000
China’s government suspended 
trading early in fears of a sell off.


15:30.158 --> 15:31.283
Hello?


15:31.283 --> 15:32.868
Gloria. 
Hi. 


15:32.868 --> 15:35.205
I was just catching up
on where we stand. 


15:35.205 --> 15:38.040
I’m really looking forward
to helping out with this new property.


15:38.040 --> 15:41.627
Yes, Marty, remember, 
the showing is on for tomorrow. 


15:41.627 --> 15:45.047
And you can still help me out
when I need to leave, right?


15:45.047 --> 15:47.092
Yes, of course. 
I wouldn’t miss it. 


15:47.092 --> 15:49.302
There’s going to be a ton
of big investors there.


15:49.302 --> 15:51.679
Just be sure you
can be there on time. 


15:51.678 --> 15:53.890
I have to leave once
everything is set up. 


15:53.890 --> 15:56.893
And this is really
important to me, Marty. 


15:56.893 --> 15:58.310
I’m counting on you.


15:58.310 --> 15:59.270
Absolutely, 


15:59.270 --> 16:00.480
anything for you.


16:00.480 --> 16:03.000
Talk to you later, bye.


16:06.945 --> 16:08.947
You made sure
with Marty that he can cover?


16:08.947 --> 16:10.114
Yes, he’ll be there.


16:10.113 --> 16:11.323
Well, why don’t you come over? 


16:11.323 --> 16:13.116
We’re going to start
our Memorial Bible reading.


16:13.117 --> 16:14.000
OK.


16:22.835 --> 16:27.000
OK, so we’re starting with Mark 14:1.


16:33.722 --> 16:34.764
Anna?


16:34.763 --> 16:36.000
I thought you had a big day at work.


16:37.392 --> 16:38.977
I did.


16:38.977 --> 16:41.000
Then why are you home so early?


16:45.148 --> 16:50.000
I just—
I’m just so ashamed of myself.


16:51.990 --> 16:53.032
Ashamed? 


16:53.032 --> 16:56.000
Honey, come over here.


17:04.293 --> 17:05.295
Anna,


17:05.295 --> 17:07.000
what are you talking about?


17:09.465 --> 17:13.678
I saw Mary and Ricky


17:13.678 --> 17:16.000
out in service today. 


17:18.808 --> 17:21.000
I couldn’t even acknowledge them. 


17:23.145 --> 17:26.732
Mom, I don’t know why 
I’m doing this anymore.


17:26.732 --> 17:28.944
The people I’m working with, 


17:28.943 --> 17:31.000
they’re not who I thought they were. 


17:32.280 --> 17:35.992
And this job, 
it’s not making me happy. 


17:35.992 --> 17:38.000
And I know it’s 
not making Jehovah happy.


17:40.705 --> 17:45.000
Anna, you can’t just quit like this. 


17:46.793 --> 17:49.296
I want you
to have a comfortable life


17:49.297 --> 17:52.467
so that you don’t need
to worry about money. 


17:52.467 --> 17:57.097
You have to be successful
with a secure job and it will—


17:57.097 --> 17:59.765
it will help you to pioneer. 


17:59.765 --> 18:00.000
Mom.


18:07.857 --> 18:10.000
I know you care about me, 


18:12.528 --> 18:18.910
but if I keep this job,
I know where it will take me. 


18:18.910 --> 18:21.000
It’s changed me so much already. 


18:22.205 --> 18:25.417
I want to be a success, 


18:25.417 --> 18:28.000
but I want to be a success
in Jehovah’s eyes.


18:33.883 --> 18:38.000
I had no idea you felt that way. 


18:43.643 --> 18:45.000
I am sorry. 


18:50.190 --> 18:54.000
Are you sure that’s
what you want to do?


18:55.363 --> 18:56.000
Yes.


19:02.495 --> 19:03.000
Anna,


19:04.288 --> 19:07.000
I am so proud of you 


19:09.710 --> 19:12.000
because you have the courage to do


19:14.048 --> 19:17.000
what I should have done.


19:19.595 --> 19:20.597
So,


19:20.597 --> 19:22.849
what are we going to do now?


19:22.848 --> 19:26.000
We need to examine
our priorities together. 


19:28.688 --> 19:32.000
But if we make 
the changes that we need to,


19:33.943 --> 19:36.000
we might give up this place. 


19:39.073 --> 19:41.825
Is that all right with everyone?


19:41.825 --> 19:45.997
Finally. 
I never liked this place anyway.


19:45.997 --> 19:47.415
Really? 


19:47.415 --> 19:48.000
Yeah. 


19:49.250 --> 19:52.712
Can we at least
keep the new piano?


19:52.712 --> 19:54.000
Only if we do something
about your hair first.


19:56.548 --> 19:57.000
Good point.


20:04.723 --> 20:05.725
Can I help you?


20:05.725 --> 20:07.268
Hey, good morning, Sir. 
How are you?


20:07.268 --> 20:07.935
Good. 
Thank you.


20:07.935 --> 20:08.268
Good. 


20:08.268 --> 20:09.686
My name is Joe,
and this morning 


20:09.687 --> 20:12.190
we’re leaving this invitation
with your neighbors. 


20:12.190 --> 20:13.440
This is your copy here.


20:13.440 --> 20:14.400
OK, thank you.


20:14.400 --> 20:14.858
OK.


20:14.858 --> 20:16.401
Director Williams,


20:16.402 --> 20:18.237
this is a nice surprise. 


20:18.237 --> 20:20.449
I haven’t seen you since you
were overseeing our division.


20:20.448 --> 20:20.990
Donald,


20:20.990 --> 20:22.867
I didn’t know this was your home.


20:22.867 --> 20:24.744
Yeah, but I mean,
what brings you here?


20:24.743 --> 20:25.870
Well, I’ve changed careers.


20:25.870 --> 20:26.620
Really?


20:26.620 --> 20:27.247
Yes.


20:27.247 --> 20:29.499
You must have gotten
a really good offer.


20:29.498 --> 20:30.331
You know, Donald, 


20:30.332 --> 20:34.670
I finally found a far better career
and something more important.


20:34.670 --> 20:35.212
Really?


20:35.212 --> 20:37.174
If you have a moment,
I’d love to tell you about it.


20:37.173 --> 20:39.091
Yeah, would you guys like to come in
for some coffee or something?


20:39.092 --> 20:39.717
Oh, absolutely.


20:39.717 --> 20:41.219
Yeah, yeah, sure, thanks. 


20:41.218 --> 20:42.000
Thank you.


20:49.727 --> 20:50.562
Morning.


20:50.562 --> 20:51.000
Hello.


20:52.188 --> 20:55.106
OK, uh, what are you
guys going to sell me today?


20:55.107 --> 20:55.984
Nothing, Sir. 


20:55.983 --> 20:57.360
We have an invitation for you. 


20:57.360 --> 20:59.320
It’s, uh, to a special event tonight.


20:59.320 --> 21:00.000
OK, sure, thanks. 


21:01.322 --> 21:03.784
Hey, aren’t you Arthur Gomez? 


21:03.783 --> 21:05.576
Yeah, Joe’s boy,


21:05.577 --> 21:07.620
and you must be his wife, um—


21:07.620 --> 21:08.830
Mary.


21:08.830 --> 21:09.872
Mary, that’s right.


21:09.872 --> 21:12.584
I’m sorry, 
have we met before?


21:12.583 --> 21:13.960
Oh, yeah, sorry. 


21:13.960 --> 21:15.293
You probably
wouldn’t remember me. 


21:15.293 --> 21:16.503
But I used to work with Joe.


21:16.503 --> 21:18.338
Yeah, and he would 
always show us pictures


21:18.338 --> 21:20.925
of the boys and talk
about you guys all the time. 


21:20.925 --> 21:23.302
I could tell he was 
really proud of his family.


21:23.302 --> 21:25.514
That’s really nice of you to say, Sir.


21:25.513 --> 21:28.056
Man, Joe, he changed so much. 


21:28.057 --> 21:29.975
I remember when
I first started working with him,


21:29.975 --> 21:34.522
he had this temper, and he would
just lose it over the smallest thing. 


21:34.522 --> 21:36.857
But then he really started changing. 


21:36.857 --> 21:40.027
I guess he said it was 
what he learned from the Bible, 


21:40.027 --> 21:42.029
well, from you guys, right?


21:42.028 --> 21:44.531
Actually, you’d be surprised. 


21:44.532 --> 21:49.162
It was Joe who first suggested 
that we study the Bible as a family, not us.


21:49.162 --> 21:49.495
Really?


21:49.495 --> 21:50.328
Yeah.


21:50.328 --> 21:52.373
OK, this I’ve got to hear.


21:52.373 --> 21:55.626
Do you ever really regret
your decision you made to uh, 


21:55.627 --> 21:58.170
you know, leave your career
and start pioneering?


21:58.170 --> 21:59.547
Absolutely not. 


21:59.547 --> 22:03.000
My only regret is
that I hadn’t started sooner.


22:24.655 --> 22:26.198
It sounds really nice.


22:26.198 --> 22:28.000
Thanks, Anna.


22:29.202 --> 22:30.579
What? 


22:30.578 --> 22:33.163
Is there something
wrong with my hair? 


22:33.163 --> 22:35.331
Tina helped me fix it yesterday.


22:35.332 --> 22:37.167
It’s fine, Anna. 


22:37.167 --> 22:38.794
You’re beautiful. 


22:38.793 --> 22:39.711
Do you know that?


22:39.712 --> 22:42.799
Why are you 
getting all sentimental?


22:42.798 --> 22:47.803
Well, last night, when
I told you I was proud of you, 


22:47.803 --> 22:49.930
I meant it.


22:49.930 --> 22:51.723
Thank you.


22:51.723 --> 22:54.560
I should have never
pushed you into that internship. 


22:54.560 --> 22:59.815
I was pressuring you the way
my mother tried to pressure me.


22:59.815 --> 23:01.692
It’s OK, Mom. 


23:01.692 --> 23:04.445
I know you just
want what’s best for me.


23:04.445 --> 23:05.613
I do,


23:05.613 --> 23:09.000
but I was setting
a bad example for you. 


23:10.450 --> 23:13.787
You don’t need
a prestigious job to pioneer. 


23:13.787 --> 23:15.414
You just need something 


23:15.413 --> 23:18.000
appropriate to help you make a living. 


23:19.752 --> 23:23.000
But I left out the most important thing.


23:24.465 --> 23:26.000
What’s that?


23:27.552 --> 23:32.000
Remember to rely on Jehovah,
and he will always help us. 


23:33.015 --> 23:36.018
Before this job,
when I was pioneering,


23:36.018 --> 23:39.438
we always had enough. 


23:39.438 --> 23:44.818
If we put Jehovah first, 
he will help us no matter what. 


23:44.818 --> 23:48.446
Anna, everything comes at a cost. 


23:48.447 --> 23:51.992
If you put your career first, 
like I’ve been doing, 


23:51.992 --> 23:54.000
there’s very little left for Jehovah. 


23:55.578 --> 23:57.623
You made the right decision.


23:57.623 --> 23:59.000
Thank you.


24:01.710 --> 24:04.000
Hey, you girls look
like you’re enjoying yourselves.


24:05.213 --> 24:07.090
Did you pick out
your outfits for tonight?


24:07.090 --> 24:07.842
Yep. 


24:07.842 --> 24:11.387
But, Mom, do you really have to go
to that showing tonight?


24:11.387 --> 24:15.557
I don’t want to, 
but I gave my word to Uncle, 


24:15.557 --> 24:18.185
and he’s expecting me
to take care of it. 


24:18.185 --> 24:20.730
I got myself into this,


24:20.730 --> 24:23.000
and now I have to finish it. 


24:24.483 --> 24:26.610
But this is the last time. 


24:26.610 --> 24:27.737
Don’t worry.


24:27.737 --> 24:30.280
OK, so you’re not going
to be late, right?


24:30.280 --> 24:31.823
I won’t be late. 


24:31.823 --> 24:34.785
Marty will be there,
and as soon as everything is set up,


24:34.785 --> 24:35.787
I can leave. 


24:35.787 --> 24:37.539
Nothing will happen.


24:37.538 --> 24:38.538
OK. 


24:38.538 --> 24:41.166
I just want to make sure that
this isn’t going to be a problem.


24:41.167 --> 24:42.419
It won’t be.


24:42.418 --> 24:43.668
Mom, 


24:43.668 --> 24:46.171
promise me you’ll
be at the Memorial.


24:46.172 --> 24:48.424
I promise.


24:48.423 --> 24:49.425
OK.


24:49.425 --> 24:52.000
I have to leave now or I’ll be late.


24:56.515 --> 24:58.517
We’ll see you there.


24:58.517 --> 25:01.000
Yeah, I’ll see you there.


25:24.460 --> 25:25.252
“Hi. 


25:25.252 --> 25:26.462
“You’ve reached Marty. 


25:26.462 --> 25:27.547
“I’m out of the office. 


25:27.547 --> 25:29.215
Please leave me a message.”


25:29.215 --> 25:30.883
Marty, this is Gloria. 


25:30.883 --> 25:32.050
Where are you? 


25:32.050 --> 25:33.635
I’m at the showing now. 


25:33.635 --> 25:36.097
You know I’m counting
on you to be here. 


25:36.097 --> 25:38.515
Just—just call me back right away. 


25:38.515 --> 25:39.000
OK?


25:47.483 --> 25:48.316
Excuse me. 


25:48.317 --> 25:50.402
I need approval on what time
to serve the hors d’oeuvres.


25:50.402 --> 25:52.739
I mean, 
as soon as guests are arriving. 


25:52.738 --> 25:55.031
You know, check with Marty
when he gets here. 


25:55.032 --> 25:58.410
He’s supposed
to be handling all of this. 


25:58.410 --> 26:02.000
Oh, and make sure the wine
is open now so it can breathe, OK?


26:03.623 --> 26:05.083
People are starting to arrive. 


26:05.083 --> 26:06.585
Surely you want me
to serve something.


26:06.585 --> 26:08.045
Serve something now then. 


26:08.045 --> 26:10.000
Go ahead. 
Figure something out. 


26:11.548 --> 26:12.381
Hello, Sir.


26:12.382 --> 26:14.385
Where is the list of property details?


26:14.385 --> 26:15.970
Yes, I can get one for you, Sir. 


26:15.970 --> 26:18.180
Can I ask you, who is
the agent you are working with?


26:18.180 --> 26:19.765
Uh, yes, I’m working with Marty. 


26:19.765 --> 26:21.017
Where is he?


26:21.017 --> 26:23.685
Marty, yes, he’s on his way, Sir. 


26:23.685 --> 26:25.020
He will be here very soon. 


26:25.020 --> 26:27.565
In the meantime, would you
like to have something to drink?


26:27.565 --> 26:28.523
Sure.


26:28.523 --> 26:30.000
Come this way, please.


26:33.612 --> 26:35.447
Girls, you look nice.


26:35.447 --> 26:36.824
Thanks, Dad.


26:36.823 --> 26:38.200
Is Mom on her way to the hall?


26:38.200 --> 26:38.742
You know what? 


26:38.742 --> 26:39.452
Let me check. 


26:39.452 --> 26:42.162
Um, let me send her a quick text.


26:42.162 --> 26:45.457
I mean, think about it
—privacy, outdoor living. 


26:45.457 --> 26:46.917
Where can you
get it in the city, right?


26:46.917 --> 26:48.000
Hmm, it’s true.


26:49.753 --> 26:50.586
Excuse me. 


26:50.587 --> 26:52.255
I have to talk 
to other clients as well.


26:52.255 --> 26:53.007
OK, thank you.


26:53.007 --> 26:54.000
Excuse me. 


26:58.220 --> 26:59.347
How is it going, everyone? 


26:59.347 --> 27:00.764
Are you guys doing OK?


27:00.763 --> 27:02.600
Oh, yes, good. 


27:02.600 --> 27:05.853
When is Marty going to be here? 


27:05.853 --> 27:08.980
He was supposed to show me
 some other offerings in this building.


27:08.980 --> 27:11.525
Yes, 
Marty will be here very soon, Sir. 


27:11.525 --> 27:13.735
Um, would you care
for another glass of wine?


27:13.735 --> 27:15.028
I can’t stay long. 


27:15.028 --> 27:18.000
I have another
important meeting tonight.


27:20.575 --> 27:22.000
Did she text back?


27:23.203 --> 27:25.163
No, I don’t see anything yet.


27:25.163 --> 27:26.873
Dad, why don’t you just call her? 


27:26.873 --> 27:28.458
She probably didn’t see your text.


27:28.458 --> 27:30.418
Or she could be on her
way to the hall already.


27:30.418 --> 27:31.586
Yeah, that’s a good point. 


27:31.587 --> 27:34.000
Let me just give her a quick call.


27:39.303 --> 27:40.303
Hello?


27:40.303 --> 27:41.013
Hey, 


27:41.013 --> 27:42.765
the Memorial is going
to start in less than an hour. 


27:42.765 --> 27:43.765
Did you leave yet?


27:43.765 --> 27:45.100
I can’t leave yet.


27:45.100 --> 27:45.852
What? 


27:45.852 --> 27:48.187
I thought you made arrangements
so that you could leave whenever you want?


27:48.187 --> 27:49.730
I know, I know. 


27:49.730 --> 27:52.148
Marty said he was going to be here,
but I can’t reach him now.


27:52.148 --> 27:53.316
Gloria, what are you going to do?


27:53.317 --> 27:54.277
I’ll figure something out. 


27:54.277 --> 27:56.000
I have to go, OK?


27:57.988 --> 27:58.988
Dad,


27:58.988 --> 28:00.406
where is Mom?


28:00.407 --> 28:01.992
She is coming, right? 


28:01.992 --> 28:03.244
She promised.


28:03.243 --> 28:04.578
Yeah, she said she’d be there.


28:04.578 --> 28:06.371
Yeah, I know, girls. 


28:06.372 --> 28:08.457
Marty is not there yet. 


28:08.457 --> 28:11.000
I don’t know what
your mom is going to do.


28:19.885 --> 28:22.000
Promise me, 
you’ll be at the Memorial.


28:23.597 --> 28:25.000
I promise.


28:31.188 --> 28:32.000
Mom. 


28:33.065 --> 28:34.317
Mom. 


28:34.317 --> 28:36.000
Don’t look back. 


28:37.903 --> 28:39.863
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


28:39.863 --> 28:42.000
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


28:59.633 --> 29:01.260
Gloria, what’s wrong? 


29:01.260 --> 29:01.802
Are you OK?


29:01.802 --> 29:02.970
Marty! 
Finally! 


29:02.970 --> 29:04.597
You’re here! 
Where were you? 


29:04.597 --> 29:06.307
Do you know how 
many times I called you?


29:06.307 --> 29:07.307
I’m so sorry, Gloria. 


29:07.307 --> 29:10.227
My phone died on the way over here,
and the traffic is just terrible!


29:10.227 --> 29:12.145
Well, look, I’ve got everything set up. 


29:12.145 --> 29:14.022
Make sure you
take care of everybody, OK? 


29:14.022 --> 29:15.815
And do not forget the lease details. 


29:15.815 --> 29:19.487
And before I go, I have to introduce
you to really important brokers. 


29:19.487 --> 29:20.279
Go! 
Let’s go! 


29:20.278 --> 29:21.000
Hurry!


29:22.363 --> 29:24.741
The friends are here. 


29:24.742 --> 29:25.659
How are you all? 


29:25.658 --> 29:27.160
Welcome. 
Come on in.


29:27.160 --> 29:27.620
Hey. 


29:27.620 --> 29:28.000
Nice to see you,
my brother.


29:38.130 --> 29:40.132
Gloria!


29:40.132 --> 29:41.050
Oh, Uncle.


29:41.050 --> 29:41.800
Where are you going?


29:41.800 --> 29:44.845
Oh, Uncle, I-I didn’t know
you were coming tonight.


29:44.845 --> 29:47.848
You didn’t think I would give you
such an important building


29:47.848 --> 29:49.975
to sell and not check in on you?


29:49.975 --> 29:53.853
Uncle, we have a really important
religious observance tonight. 


29:53.853 --> 29:56.856
I did everything you asked me
to do for the showing,


29:56.857 --> 29:58.359
but I have to leave now.


29:58.358 --> 29:59.401
That’s nonsense. 


29:59.402 --> 30:00.987
You stay right here


30:00.987 --> 30:02.655
and care for the investors.


30:02.655 --> 30:04.865
But, Uncle, 
I did everything for you.


30:04.865 --> 30:06.575
Will you disgrace me here


30:06.575 --> 30:08.535
in front of everyone?


30:08.535 --> 30:11.247
You have my respect, 
Uncle, but I—


30:11.247 --> 30:12.414
But what?


30:12.413 --> 30:14.541
There is no discussion. 


30:14.542 --> 30:17.002
Remember who
it is you are speaking to.


30:17.002 --> 30:18.670
I have to go, Uncle. 


30:18.670 --> 30:21.215
This is most important to me. 


30:21.215 --> 30:24.258
Jehovah is most important to me. 


30:24.258 --> 30:25.635
Please understand.


30:25.635 --> 30:27.178
If you leave now, 


30:27.178 --> 30:30.000
you will lose everything.


30:36.563 --> 30:40.191
We invite all
to please find their seats. 


30:40.192 --> 30:44.000
Our program will begin
in just a few minutes.


31:14.058 --> 31:17.186
Welcome to the observance
of the Memorial


31:17.187 --> 31:20.315
of our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ. 


31:20.315 --> 31:22.608
To begin our program tonight, 


31:22.608 --> 31:24.486
we ask all to please stand. 


31:24.487 --> 31:27.155
We’ll be singing song number 147,


31:27.155 --> 31:30.000
entitled “A Special Possession.”


31:31.535 --> 31:34.872
That night changed me forever. 


31:34.872 --> 31:37.207
I came so close 
to letting my relationship


31:37.207 --> 31:39.752
with Jehovah
slip through my fingers. 


31:39.752 --> 31:41.920
I almost ended up like a woman


31:41.920 --> 31:45.173
in the Bible I would
never want to imitate. 


31:45.173 --> 31:48.760
Thankfully, 
I was able to change in time


31:48.760 --> 32:03.463
because I
‘remembered the wife of Lot.’

You’re at the Kingdom Hall
about to give a public talk.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the audience listen
to what you have to say?

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much depends on how
you introduce your subject.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:26.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An effective introduction arouses interest,

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identifies your subject,

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:33.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows why the subject
is important to your listeners.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give our brother
an opportunity to introduce his subject.

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the meeting chairman mentioned,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to talk about death

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what it means to you and me.

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read a scripture

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes 9:5.

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did the speaker identify his subject?

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he arouse interest?

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much.

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he show why the subject is important?

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how might he approach
the subject differently?

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch.

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout all of human history,

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one person has escaped death.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lives of some people
are cut short suddenly

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unexpected events or illness.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever lost a loved one in death?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you know how painful that is.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet how can something
that causes so much pain

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be a normal, natural part of life?

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is the key

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understanding why we die,

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we go when we die,

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how death will be reversed.

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider each of those points.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can apply this principle

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any subject when giving a talk.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can you effectively introduce

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a subject in the ministry?

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, of course,
that in most cases

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re a complete stranger
to the householder.

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try not to startle the person.

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Identify yourself early in the conversation.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To determine what
a person might be interested in,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:22.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe his activities or surroundings.

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might begin by asking a question

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or making a brief comment
about those things.

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider one example.

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:36.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, my name is Jill.

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m here to talk
about God’s purpose for the future.

00:02:39.513 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says here—

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, but I don’t have time to talk.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was the introduction effective?

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The householder didn’t want
to continue the conversation,

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so apparently the introduction
didn’t arouse interest.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:00.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might the publisher
have handled the situation better?

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:06.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good morning.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a beautiful garden.

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:12.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must take a lot of work.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sure does!

00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your work is certainly paying off.

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:17.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, my name is Jill,
and this is Tammy.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Emily.

00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emily, you work so hard
to care for the garden you planted.

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that God cares the same way

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this planet that he created?

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the publisher took into account

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the interests of the householder,

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she increased the chances
of starting a conversation

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sharing the Kingdom message.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can also be done in urban areas

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people expect you
to get right to the point.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In such settings, try to include
a thought-provoking statement

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or question in your introduction.

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Effective introductions are the first step

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward productive conversations

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and presentations of the good news.

00:00:10 You’re at the Kingdom Hall about to give a public talk.
00:00:14 Will the audience listen to what you have to say?
00:00:18 Much depends on how you introduce your subject.
00:00:22 An effective introduction arouses interest,
00:00:26 identifies your subject,
00:00:28 and shows why the subject is important to your listeners.
00:00:33 Let’s give our brother an opportunity to introduce his subject.
00:00:39 As the meeting chairman mentioned,
00:00:41 we’re going to talk about death
00:00:43 and what it means to you and me.
00:00:47 Let’s read a scripture
00:00:49 at Ecclesiastes 9:5.
00:00:52 So, what do you think?
00:00:54 Did the speaker identify his subject?
00:00:58 Yes.
00:01:00 Did he arouse interest?
00:01:02 Not so much.
00:01:04 Did he show why the subject is important?
00:01:07 No.
00:01:09 So how might he approach the subject differently?
00:01:12 Let’s watch.
00:01:15 Throughout all of human history,
00:01:17 not one person has escaped death.
00:01:21 The lives of some people are cut short suddenly
00:01:24 by unexpected events or illness.
00:01:28 Have you ever lost a loved one in death?
00:01:31 If so, you know how painful that is.
00:01:34 Yet how can something that causes so much pain
00:01:37 be a normal, natural part of life?
00:01:42 The Bible is the key
00:01:44 to understanding why we die,
00:01:47 where we go when we die,
00:01:49 and how death will be reversed.
00:01:52 Let’s consider each of those points.
00:01:56 You can apply this principle
00:01:58 to any subject when giving a talk.
00:02:01 But how can you effectively introduce
00:02:03 a subject in the ministry?
00:02:05 Remember, of course, that in most cases
00:02:07 you’re a complete stranger to the householder.
00:02:10 Try not to startle the person.
00:02:12 Identify yourself early in the conversation.
00:02:16 To determine what a person might be interested in,
00:02:19 observe his activities or surroundings.
00:02:22 You might begin by asking a question
00:02:24 or making a brief comment about those things.
00:02:28 Let’s consider one example.
00:02:34 Hi, my name is Jill.
00:02:36 I’m here to talk about God’s purpose for the future.
00:02:39 The Bible says here—
00:02:40 Sorry, but I don’t have time to talk.
00:02:46 Was the introduction effective?
00:02:49 The householder didn’t want to continue the conversation,
00:02:52 so apparently the introduction didn’t arouse interest.
00:02:56 How might the publisher have handled the situation better?
00:03:04 Good morning.
00:03:06 You have a beautiful garden.
00:03:09 It must take a lot of work.
00:03:12 It sure does!
00:03:13 Well, your work is certainly paying off.
00:03:16 Thank you.
00:03:17 By the way, my name is Jill, and this is Tammy.
00:03:20 I’m Emily.
00:03:21 Emily, you work so hard to care for the garden you planted.
00:03:26 Do you think that God cares the same way
00:03:29 about this planet that he created?
00:03:34 Because the publisher took into account
00:03:36 the interests of the householder,
00:03:39 she increased the chances of starting a conversation
00:03:42 and sharing the Kingdom message.
00:03:44 This can also be done in urban areas
00:03:46 where people expect you to get right to the point.
00:03:49 In such settings, try to include a thought-provoking statement
00:03:53 or question in your introduction.
00:03:57 Effective introductions are the first step
00:04:00 toward productive conversations
00:04:02 and presentations of the good news.

WEBVTT

00:09.708 --> 00:18.885
Caught up in circles.
I don’t know which way to turn.


00:18.885 --> 00:23.457
My heart rules;
Had my head fooled.


00:23.457 --> 00:29.962
Too late, I’ve fallen in love.
To do what’s right


00:29.962 --> 00:37.104
Is a constant fight.
Don’t want to let my heart decide.


00:37.103 --> 00:50.516
I want God’s Word to be my guide.
It’s so hard to break free.


00:50.517 --> 00:59.525
This desperate heart inside of me
Makes wrong feel right and right feel wrong,


00:59.525 --> 01:08.468
But Jehovah makes me strong.
He says: “Know that I love you. 


01:08.468 --> 01:18.176
“I don’t want to lose you.
Trust in me in all you do.


01:18.177 --> 01:23.000
I’ll be here to help you through.”


01:24.883 --> 01:34.093
Our life is shaped by the choice we make.
We have to realize what’s at stake.


01:34.093 --> 01:38.430
Right from the start, 
it’s a war for our heart,


01:38.430 --> 01:50.000
But it’s ours to give away.
To safeguard it means our life.


01:56.748 --> 02:05.691
Looking back, the choice I made
To do things Jehovah’s way


02:05.692 --> 02:28.515
Seemed so hard, emotion’s strong,
But Jehovah helped me along.

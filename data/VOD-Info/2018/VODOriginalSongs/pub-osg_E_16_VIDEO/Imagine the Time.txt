00:00:13 Life is hard, and it wears us down.
00:00:20 There’s not enough to go around.
00:00:26 I close my eyes, and there I see
00:00:32 That ev’ry hope has come to be.
00:00:39 Imagine the time when there’s no more pain,
00:00:45 When life’s so good and we are young again.
00:00:52 Imagine the time when we wake up and say,
00:00:57 “Thank you, thank you for this new life and this brand new day!”
00:01:08 Not a sound has ever touched my ears,
00:01:14 And eyes grow dim with passing years.
00:01:20 But ears will hear when music plays.
00:01:27 And eyes will see each brand new day.
00:01:33 Imagine the time when there’s no more pain,
00:01:39 When life’s so good and we are young again.
00:01:45 Imagine the time when we wake up and say,
00:01:52 “Thank you, thank you for this new life and this brand new day!”
00:02:14 I might not be the way I want to be.
00:02:21 But one day soon, I’ll be running free!
00:02:28 Imagine the time when there’s no more pain,
00:02:33 When life’s so good and we are young again.
00:02:40 Imagine the time when we’re dancing out the door!
00:02:47 Ev’ry day is better than before.
00:02:53 Imagine the time when there’s no more pain,
00:02:59 When life’s so good and we are young again.
00:03:07 Imagine the time when we wake up and say,
00:03:12 “Thank you, thank you for this brand new day!”

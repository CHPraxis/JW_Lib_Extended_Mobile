‎We heard the words ‘seek and you’ll find’
The very priceless pearl of truth.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was a sea of doubts and questions to God
That the search would take us through.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we carried on with our sails unfurled.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like merchants on a quest, 
we knew that truth was out there.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
To answer all the things,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that we fight to understand:

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, wondering why we need 
God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.528 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Searching hard to find.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:43.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had never known God had a name.
Jehovah is the one to call on.

00:01:43.374 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we were shown, we found a piece
Of what we were searching for.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:02:01.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And we carried on with our sails unfurled,

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Finding truths about where we came from 
and where we’re heading.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
That answered all the things,

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:27.251 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that we fought to understand:

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, a paradise that’s promised 
in God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Search and you will find.

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:49.565 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now we can never hold back 
when others are searching

00:02:49.565 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For the priceless pearl of truth,
Sailing a sea of unanswered questions.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:15.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So we help them to get through,
And we share what we’ve discovered.

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
To answer all the things,

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:50.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that they fight to understand:

00:03:50.167 --> 00:04:04.098 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, living forever
in God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:10.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Search and you will find.

00:23.585 --> 00:32.385
You may be contemplating,
‘Should I make the move?’


00:32.385 --> 00:40.227
Prayerfully meditating,
‘Jehovah, what should I do?’


00:40.227 --> 00:49.487
So let’s just take a moment
And try to help you decide.


00:49.487 --> 00:56.869
‘Cause if you step on over,
You’ll be so happy you tried!


00:56.868 --> 01:05.043
You gotta step on over
And leave your worries behind.


01:05.043 --> 01:14.970
‘Cause when you step on over,
You will be blessed if you try, oh.


01:14.970 --> 01:30.318
Step on over.
Step on over that Macedonia line!


01:30.318 --> 01:39.370
The preaching work is amazing,
With overwhelming success.


01:39.370 --> 01:47.043
You’ll be appreciating
How strangers give you their best.


01:47.043 --> 01:56.220
And you will draw even closer
To Jehovah each day.


01:56.220 --> 02:04.143
‘Cause he will always be there
To help you learn every step of the way.


02:04.143 --> 02:12.861
You gotta step on over
And leave your worries behind.


02:12.862 --> 02:20.494
‘Cause when you step on over,
Oh, the treasures you’ll find.


02:20.493 --> 02:29.961
Maybe you’re thinking it over
And wondering if it’s right, oh.


02:29.962 --> 02:38.929
You gotta step on over.
You will be blessed if you try, oh.


02:38.928 --> 02:45.935
Step on over.
Step on over.


02:45.935 --> 03:11.483
You gotta step on over that Macedonia line!

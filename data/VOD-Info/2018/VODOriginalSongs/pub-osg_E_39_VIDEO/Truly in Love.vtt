00:12.241 --> 00:24.628
There is a gift that comes from above,
A lovely gift called being in love.

00:24.628 --> 00:36.640
When two hearts begin to beat as one,
Then a wonderful time has begun.

00:40.519 --> 00:45.941
It’s simple, so easy. 
And it’s something we know.

00:45.941 --> 00:52.406
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

00:52.406 --> 01:03.375
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

01:03.375 --> 01:15.930
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

01:17.556 --> 01:28.817
Trials will come our way,
But our love will grow stronger each day.

01:28.817 --> 01:40.412
We will build a bond that no one can break.
We will build a love that no one will take.

01:40.412 --> 01:44.708
No, no, no one, no.

01:44.708 --> 01:50.255
It’s simple, so easy. 
And it’s something we know.

01:50.255 --> 01:56.220
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

01:56.220 --> 02:07.356
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

02:07.356 --> 02:19.368
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

02:21.120 --> 02:33.090
Nothing can destroy our love.
This precious gift is from our God up above.

02:33.090 --> 02:38.721
Exclusive devotion​
—‘love’s as strong as death.’

02:38.721 --> 02:44.727
You are “bone of my bones”; 
you are “flesh of my flesh,”

02:44.727 --> 02:58.741
Such an excellent woman in all that you do.
I will spend all my life loving you.

03:00.451 --> 03:11.462
I want you to know how I feel
’Cause my love for you is so very real.

03:11.462 --> 03:23.849
I bless the day you came into my life.
I bless the day I made you my wife.

03:25.434 --> 03:27.561
Yes, I do.

03:27.561 --> 03:33.567
It’s simple, so easy. 
And it’s something we know.

03:33.567 --> 03:39.239
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

03:39.239 --> 03:50.334
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

03:50.334 --> 04:03.972
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

04:03.972 --> 04:26.267
How I love to be truly in love
With someone like you.

00:07.820 --> 00:16.412
You can walk, but please don’t run.
It’s hard to do when you’re having fun.


00:16.412 --> 00:22.459
But there’s a reason we don’t race;
When you’re with the friends,


00:22.458 --> 00:26.505
It’s not the time or place.


00:26.505 --> 00:41.937
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


00:41.937 --> 00:53.949
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


00:53.948 --> 01:03.125
You’ve got things you have to do,
People to serve, who depend on you.


01:03.125 --> 01:09.507
But don’t forget why you’re here;
Learn to love the friends;


01:09.507 --> 01:13.427
Let them know you care.


01:13.427 --> 01:28.025
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


01:28.025 --> 01:40.703
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


01:40.703 --> 01:48.545
You can run to someone’s door.
Is there someone home?


01:48.545 --> 01:54.385
Well, you’re not real sure.
But look around and see everyone,


01:54.385 --> 02:01.058
People walking by. Can you talk to one?


02:01.058 --> 02:16.406
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


02:16.407 --> 02:28.877
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


02:28.877 --> 02:53.465
Oh. Just don’t run fast!

00:08 Been thinking it over— Each day it seems
00:16 My serving Jehovah  Falls into the same routine.
00:24 The things that I’m doing now  I’ve always done.
00:29 So it’s clear that I need to break out— Out of my comfort zone.
00:37 Now I’m making a change starting from today.  I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.
00:44 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction and trusting in you.
01:08 It’s gonna take courage,  But now I see
01:16 How changing my thinking  Renews and refreshes me.
01:23 I’m trying some new things,  and I’m energized.
01:29 There were doors that were opening wide,  But I never realized.
01:36 So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way.  I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.
01:44 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction and trusting in you.
02:08 Back then, I remember when  It seemed it wouldn’t happen.
02:15 Some days, well, I have to say,  I didn’t know why.
02:23 But now I can see just how  My boldness led to blessings.
02:31 I’m sure there’ll be many more  As time goes rolling by.
02:38 Now I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.  I’m making some changes along the way.
02:46 Jehovah, I saw what I had to do,  And you gave me your blessing
02:54 for trusting in you.
03:01 So I’m making a change starting from today.  I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.
03:09 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction.
03:16 So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way.  I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.
03:24 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction
03:31 and trusting in you—
03:40 Trusting in you.

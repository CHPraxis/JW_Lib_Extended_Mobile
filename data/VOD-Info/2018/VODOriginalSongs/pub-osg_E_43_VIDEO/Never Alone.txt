00:16 Abandoned and betrayed,  Forsaken and alone,
00:30 Despair my one companion,  My heart within me like a stone
00:44 With no one here for me,  No kindly word of care,
00:58 Who’ll offer consolation?  My heavy burden, who can share?
01:10 I’m not alone;  I never was.
01:17 I’ll never be,  And all because
01:24 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
01:31 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
01:38 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.
01:55 Whatever I may lose  By sticking close to you,
02:09 No matter who may fail me,  I know you’ll never be untrue.
02:23 You’re close to me, O God,  And never far away.
02:37 My faith, my hope, reliance​—  I know you never will betray.
02:48 I’m not alone;  I never was.
02:55 I’ll never be,  And all because
03:03 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
03:10 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
03:17 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.
03:27 I never was.
03:31 I’ll never be,  And all because
03:38 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
03:45 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
03:52 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.

00:16.203 --> 00:28.507
Abandoned and betrayed, 
Forsaken and alone,

00:30.426 --> 00:43.439
Despair my one companion, 
My heart within me like a stone

00:44.523 --> 00:57.286
With no one here for me, 
No kindly word of care,

00:58.621 --> 01:10.049
Who’ll offer consolation? 
My heavy burden, who can share?

01:10.049 --> 01:17.139
I’m not alone; 
I never was.

01:17.139 --> 01:24.271
I’ll never be, 
And all because

01:24.271 --> 01:31.403
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

01:31.403 --> 01:38.369
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

01:38.369 --> 01:51.382
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

01:55.010 --> 02:06.647
Whatever I may lose 
By sticking close to you,

02:09.358 --> 02:22.204
No matter who may fail me, 
I know you’ll never be untrue.

02:23.330 --> 02:37.302
You’re close to me, O God, 
And never far away.

02:37.302 --> 02:48.897
My faith, my hope, reliance​— 
I know you never will betray.

02:48.897 --> 02:55.946
I’m not alone; 
I never was.

02:55.946 --> 03:03.162
I’ll never be, 
And all because

03:03.162 --> 03:10.002
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

03:10.002 --> 03:17.259
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

03:17.259 --> 03:27.352
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

03:27.352 --> 03:31.899
I never was.

03:31.899 --> 03:38.322
I’ll never be, 
And all because

03:38.322 --> 03:45.537
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

03:45.537 --> 03:52.419
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

03:52.419 --> 04:20.428
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

00:10.322 --> 00:20.082
Now everyone, it seems to me,
Knows just the place he wants to be.


00:20.082 --> 00:29.925
I know what’s right; I know what’s wrong;
And, yes, I know where I belong.


00:29.925 --> 00:39.935
It feels so good, so good to know
Where I should be, where I should go


00:39.935 --> 00:49.778
To find good friends and company
Who build me up and care for me.


00:49.778 --> 00:59.203
Yes, here in my heart 
The feelings are strong.


00:59.203 --> 01:09.381
Jehovah, it’s you 
Who’ll help me get through


01:09.382 --> 01:17.000
And show me where I belong.


01:23.478 --> 01:33.655
My heart is sure, it’s clear to me,
I’m standing where I want to be.


01:33.655 --> 01:43.540
I read God’s Word. I make it live.
It moves my heart. What can I give?


01:43.540 --> 01:53.092
And now I know; yes, now I see
Where real friends are; that’s where I’ll be.


01:53.092 --> 02:02.727
They’re all I want; they’re family;
Jehovah’s gift with love to me.


02:02.727 --> 02:12.319
Yes, here in my heart
The feelings are strong.


02:12.318 --> 02:22.370
Jehovah, it’s you
Who’ll help me get through


02:22.370 --> 02:52.840
And show me where I belong.

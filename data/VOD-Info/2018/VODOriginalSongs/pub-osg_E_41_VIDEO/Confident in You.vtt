00:07.027 --> 00:17.872
Like a tree planted in the ground, 
Your words have sunk deep down 


00:17.872 --> 00:28.007
Into my heart and soothed my mind 
with gentle thoughts of peace. 


00:28.007 --> 00:38.632
’Cause no matter what may come, 
With this wisdom from above, 


00:38.632 --> 00:47.652
I always have these truths 
to keep reminding me to 


00:47.652 --> 00:58.499
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


00:58.498 --> 01:08.630
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


01:08.630 --> 01:21.000
And every day I am more 
confident in you. 


01:24.382 --> 01:35.565
When this world tries to pull me down, 
To give up on what I’ve found, 


01:35.565 --> 01:45.323
I turn to you and know that you 
are always there. 


01:45.323 --> 01:55.970
It takes time to meditate— 
Get the words from off the page 


01:55.970 --> 02:04.732
And in my heart so they can help 
and guide me to 


02:04.732 --> 02:14.849
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


02:14.848 --> 02:26.348
Look beyond any adversity. 
Focus on the things that I can’t see.  


02:26.348 --> 02:36.635
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


02:36.635 --> 02:48.573
And every day I am more 
confident in you— 


02:48.573 --> 02:53.000
In you. 


03:03.882 --> 03:14.315
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


03:14.315 --> 03:25.632
Look beyond any adversity. 
Focus on the things that I can’t see. 


03:25.632 --> 03:35.402
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


03:35.402 --> 03:55.569
And every day I am more 
confident in you.

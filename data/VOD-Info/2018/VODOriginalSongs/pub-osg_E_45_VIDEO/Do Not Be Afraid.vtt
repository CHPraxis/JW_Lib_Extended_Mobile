‎It’s hard to see clear
when challenges appear.

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We get lost inside
the emotions we feel.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When adversity
strikes us down,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No need to stay
on the ground.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look up;
Reach out.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:24.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:36.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone. 

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just pray;
Do not be afraid.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He gives us friends
who stick by our side.

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Their prayers of faith and love
are always right on time.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And each day
when we read His Word,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It gives us
the strength to endure.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:31.505 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we’re down,
We’ll reach out.

00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.475 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:48.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone.
Just pray.

00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when those dark clouds
come rolling in,

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:18.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Hold your head high.
It’ll be all right.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:57.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do not be afraid,
for He is with us,

00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Saving us with His right hand
of righteousness.

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:06.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when it gets
hard sometimes,

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We need to remember
we’re not alone.

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, we’re never alone. 

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Just pray;
Do not be afraid.

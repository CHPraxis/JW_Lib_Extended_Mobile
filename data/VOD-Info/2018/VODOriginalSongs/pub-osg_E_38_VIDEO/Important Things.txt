00:18 Ev’ry day brings decisions,  and we must choose
00:28 How will we spend our time  and live for the truth.
00:36 Now, there’s a time to laugh  and be with our friends,
00:41 But it can’t be all  we’re living for in the end.
00:49 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
00:54 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
00:59 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
01:08 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
01:13 Think about the future  and where we are now.
01:17 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.
01:31 Life sure can weigh us down  with bills to pay.
01:40 It can make us lose sight  and misplace our faith.
01:49 But our fam’ly needs us  back at home.
01:54 And if we want to be there to help  and watch them grow—
02:01 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
02:07 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
02:12 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
02:21 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
02:26 Think about the future  and where we are now.
02:30 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.
02:55 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
03:00 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
03:05 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
03:13 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
03:19 Think about the future  and where we are now.
03:23 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.

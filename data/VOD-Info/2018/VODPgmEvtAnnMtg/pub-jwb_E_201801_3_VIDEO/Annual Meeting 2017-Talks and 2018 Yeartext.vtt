WEBVTT

00:01.650 --> 00:05.000
What is next on our program? 


00:06.488 --> 00:09.725
Well, we have five talks 


00:09.725 --> 00:13.930
that are going to be given 
by five members of the Governing Body. 


00:13.930 --> 00:16.700
Now, as you listen to these talks, 


00:16.700 --> 00:21.000
one of them is going to reveal to us 
some adjusted understanding; 


00:22.405 --> 00:26.000
another is going to tell us 
about the yeartext for next year. 


00:27.543 --> 00:30.413
Other talks are going to motivate us, 


00:30.413 --> 00:32.815
and then another talk 


00:32.815 --> 00:36.000
is going to show 
a change in our ministry. 


00:38.253 --> 00:41.590
Have I got your attention? 


00:41.590 --> 00:45.462
Well, to start off 
this intriguing series of talks, 


00:45.462 --> 00:48.164
we’re going to invite 
Brother David Splane 


00:48.163 --> 00:50.900
to talk to us on this intriguing title, 


00:50.900 --> 00:55.000
“Ezekiel’s Temple Vision and You!”


01:07.650 --> 01:09.652
Well, 


01:09.652 --> 01:14.000
did you enjoy your tour? 


01:15.858 --> 01:21.000
Not your tour of Warwick, 
Wallkill, Patterson, 


01:22.198 --> 01:26.701
but did you enjoy the tour 
that we recently made 


01:26.702 --> 01:30.240
of the temple 
that we’ve been reading about 


01:30.240 --> 01:33.000
in the book of Ezekiel? 


01:34.110 --> 01:37.113
Now, that was quite a tour. 


01:37.113 --> 01:41.616
Could you imagine that we were transported 


01:41.617 --> 01:44.620
onto an extremely high mountain, 


01:44.620 --> 01:46.622
and we were given a vision 


01:46.622 --> 01:51.294
of an imposing temple complex? 


01:51.293 --> 01:53.896
And we had quite a tour guide
—didn’t we?—


01:53.897 --> 01:56.099
an angel 


01:56.098 --> 01:59.801
whose appearance was of copper, 


01:59.802 --> 02:03.205
and he showed us some wonderful things.


02:03.205 --> 02:06.042
Well, it’s all very interesting. 


02:06.042 --> 02:09.000
But what does it mean? 


02:10.413 --> 02:13.048
Now, for many years, 
our publications have stated 


02:13.048 --> 02:16.185
that the temple that Ezekiel saw 


02:16.185 --> 02:20.857
was Jehovah’s great spiritual temple, 


02:20.857 --> 02:24.594
and we came to that conclusion 
because there are, admittedly, 


02:24.593 --> 02:28.296
some similarities between the tabernacle 


02:28.297 --> 02:31.667
that Moses was connected with 


02:31.667 --> 02:33.904
and the temple of Ezekiel. 


02:33.903 --> 02:37.506
And so the thought was 
that the temple of Ezekiel 


02:37.507 --> 02:40.510
and the tabernacle 
represented the same thing. 


02:40.510 --> 02:45.282
We know that the tabernacle 
represents the spiritual temple 


02:45.282 --> 02:47.684
because the apostle Paul said so. 


02:47.683 --> 02:50.886
Well, it’s true that there are similarities 


02:50.887 --> 02:55.259
between the tabernacle and Ezekiel’s temple, 


02:55.258 --> 02:59.828
but there are major differences as well. 


02:59.828 --> 03:02.531
The tabernacle 


03:02.532 --> 03:05.269
really focuses on the high priest 


03:05.268 --> 03:09.371
and the sacrifice that he made 
on the Day of Atonement. 


03:09.372 --> 03:14.010
So we can say that the tabernacle 


03:14.010 --> 03:16.212
is really centered on the future work 


03:16.212 --> 03:20.149
that Jesus was going to do 
as the great High Priest 


03:20.148 --> 03:23.000
and the sacrifice that he was going to make. 


03:24.320 --> 03:29.192
Now, what about the temple that Ezekiel saw? 


03:29.192 --> 03:31.494
Is there a high priest? 


03:31.493 --> 03:33.495
No. 


03:33.495 --> 03:35.498
What about the Day of Atonement? 


03:35.498 --> 03:37.500
Is the Day of Atonement mentioned? 


03:37.500 --> 03:39.735
No, it is not. 


03:39.735 --> 03:43.740
So we can see that there are differences 


03:43.740 --> 03:46.575
between the tabernacle 


03:46.575 --> 03:49.245
and the temple of Ezekiel.


03:49.245 --> 03:52.215
Now, right up front, let’s be clear; 


03:52.215 --> 03:56.352
Ezekiel was not touring 


03:56.352 --> 03:59.422
the spiritual temple. 


03:59.422 --> 04:01.424
Let’s see why not. 


04:01.423 --> 04:06.228
But first, let’s review what Brother Lösch 
told us about the spiritual temple. 


04:06.228 --> 04:07.296
What is it? 


04:07.297 --> 04:10.267
Now, Brother Lösch 
said that it’s an arrangement. 


04:10.267 --> 04:13.469
But he didn’t stop there, did he? 


04:13.468 --> 04:17.606
He said, 
“It’s an arrangement for worship 


04:17.607 --> 04:22.000
based on the sacrifice of Christ.” 


04:23.112 --> 04:25.849
Now, what do we know 
about the sacrifice of Christ? 


04:25.848 --> 04:30.000
Let’s take the Bible 
and turn to Hebrews chapter 9, 


04:34.223 --> 04:36.625
Hebrews chapter 9, 


04:36.625 --> 04:40.530
and we’re going to read verses 11 and 12


04:40.530 --> 04:44.700
—Hebrews 9:11, 12. 


04:44.700 --> 04:46.702
Paul writes: 


04:46.702 --> 04:51.707
“However, 
when Christ came as a high priest 


04:51.707 --> 04:55.979
of the good things 
that have already taken place.” 


04:55.978 --> 04:59.915
So the spiritual temple 
was actually in existence 


04:59.915 --> 05:01.950
in Jesus’ day 


05:01.950 --> 05:04.553
because these things 
had “already taken place.” 


05:04.553 --> 05:07.856
“He passed through the greater 
and more perfect tent 


05:07.857 --> 05:11.260
“not made with hands, 
that is, not of this creation. 


05:11.260 --> 05:13.697
“He entered into the holy place, 


05:13.697 --> 05:17.234
“not [not] with the blood 


05:17.233 --> 05:19.235
“of goats and of young bulls, 


05:19.235 --> 05:21.403
“but with his own blood, 


05:21.403 --> 05:24.906
once for all time.” 


05:24.907 --> 05:26.909
So, what do we learn from this? 


05:26.908 --> 05:29.645
Well, we learn 
that Jesus’ sacrifice was offered 


05:29.645 --> 05:31.780
“once for all time” 


05:31.780 --> 05:36.085
and that the blood of bulls and goats 
doesn’t enter the picture. 


05:36.085 --> 05:39.788
One sacrifice
—and that’s enough. 


05:39.788 --> 05:43.491
After that, 
there are no grain offerings, 


05:43.492 --> 05:45.795
there are no guilt offerings, 


05:45.795 --> 05:49.032
there are no whole burnt offerings, 


05:49.032 --> 05:51.734
and there are no sin offerings, 


05:51.733 --> 05:56.138
because that one sacrifice 
of Christ is enough.


05:56.138 --> 06:01.000
The spiritual temple is centered 
around the sacrifice of Christ. 


06:02.045 --> 06:06.982
Now, what did we see 
when we toured Ezekiel’s temple? 


06:06.982 --> 06:10.787
Grain offerings, sin offerings, 


06:10.787 --> 06:14.990
guilt offerings, 
the blood of bulls and goats, 


06:14.990 --> 06:19.028
and even purification for the priests, 


06:19.028 --> 06:21.696
who don’t at all seem 
to have been declared righteous 


06:21.697 --> 06:25.300
by means of their faith 
in the blood of Christ. 


06:25.300 --> 06:30.072
So we can see that there’s something 
different about Ezekiel’s temple, 


06:30.072 --> 06:34.910
and really, Ezekiel and Paul 
cover different ground. 


06:34.910 --> 06:37.313
So if you’re taking notes, 


06:37.313 --> 06:40.850
this is the time to make a little note. 


06:40.850 --> 06:43.452
From Paul 


06:43.452 --> 06:48.000
we learn about Jehovah’s 
arrangement for worship. 


06:49.892 --> 06:54.464
From Ezekiel we learn about Jehovah’s, 


06:54.463 --> 06:57.266
wait for it, 


06:57.267 --> 07:01.637
Jehovah’s standard for worship. 


07:01.637 --> 07:03.974
From Ezekiel we learn 


07:03.973 --> 07:07.176
about Jehovah’s standard for worship. 


07:07.177 --> 07:09.745
Now, what do we learn 
about Jehovah’s standards 


07:09.745 --> 07:12.515
from those nine chapters of Ezekiel? 


07:12.515 --> 07:15.350
Well, He has high standards; 


07:15.350 --> 07:18.220
He has very high standards.
Now, think about it. 


07:18.220 --> 07:21.357
Where was Ezekiel’s temple located? 


07:21.357 --> 07:24.660
Was it located 
on a mountain of average height, 


07:24.660 --> 07:28.263
Mount Moriah maybe 
or the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem? 


07:28.263 --> 07:30.265
No, 


07:30.265 --> 07:35.000
it was located 
“on a very high mountain.” 


07:36.172 --> 07:39.575
A temple 
“on a very high mountain”


07:39.575 --> 07:43.112
—a house of Jehovah 


07:43.112 --> 07:45.414
“on a very high mountain”


07:45.413 --> 07:50.251
—maybe even above the tops 
of the mountains. 


07:50.252 --> 07:52.889
Where have I heard about that before? 


07:52.888 --> 07:55.991
Didn’t I read something 
about that somewhere in the Bible? 


07:55.992 --> 07:59.329
Yes, Isaiah 2:2. 


07:59.328 --> 08:02.000
Let’s read it


08:07.603 --> 08:10.138
—Isaiah 2:2. 


08:10.138 --> 08:14.943
It says: 
“In the final part of the days.” 


08:14.943 --> 08:18.180
That doesn’t sound like 29 C.E., 
does it? 


08:18.180 --> 08:20.248
“In the final part of the days, 


08:20.248 --> 08:22.285
“the mountain of the house of Jehovah 


08:22.285 --> 08:26.055
“will become firmly established 
above the top of the mountains, 


08:26.055 --> 08:29.558
“and it will be raised up above the hills, 


08:29.558 --> 08:33.761
and to it all the nations will stream.” 


08:33.762 --> 08:37.032
Well, now, that prophecy 
helps us to understand 


08:37.032 --> 08:39.935
when Ezekiel’s temple vision 


08:39.935 --> 08:42.838
finds its major fulfillment


08:42.838 --> 08:45.173
—not in 29 C.E. 


08:45.173 --> 08:49.411
when we first see 
the spiritual temple take shape, 


08:49.412 --> 08:52.782
but “in the final part of the days.”


08:52.782 --> 08:56.685
Now, what is it that is 


08:56.685 --> 08:59.155
“firmly established 
above the top of the mountains”? 


08:59.155 --> 09:01.157
We know the answer to that. 


09:01.157 --> 09:03.192
It’s Jehovah’s worship, isn’t it? 


09:03.192 --> 09:05.962
And so Jehovah’s worship is established 


09:05.962 --> 09:08.797
“above the top of the mountains” 
“in the final part of the days.” 


09:08.797 --> 09:13.102
So Ezekiel’s temple vision must be fulfilled 


09:13.102 --> 09:18.040
“in the final part of the days,” 
not in 29 C.E. 


09:18.040 --> 09:22.612
Now, the mountain that Ezekiel saw 
is not the only thing that’s elevated. 


09:22.612 --> 09:26.149
There are gates leading to the temple area, 


09:26.148 --> 09:30.653
and you know, those gates 
are some 100 feet (30 m) tall. 


09:30.653 --> 09:34.690
And there are guard chambers 
at the entryways 


09:34.690 --> 09:37.927
so that no unclean person can come in. 


09:37.927 --> 09:39.695
Why? 


09:39.695 --> 09:43.933
Because Jehovah’s high standards of morality 


09:43.933 --> 09:46.335
must be respected.


09:46.335 --> 09:50.505
Now, there’s another striking feature 
of Ezekiel’s temple. 


09:50.505 --> 09:54.143
There was a wall around the entire perimeter, 


09:54.143 --> 09:56.178
the entire temple area. 


09:56.178 --> 09:58.913
Now, each side was almost a mile 
(1.6 km) long, 


09:58.913 --> 10:02.851
but the temple itself was only 
about 850 feet (260 m) to a side. 


10:02.852 --> 10:05.622
So you have 
the little temple area, relatively, 


10:05.622 --> 10:08.924
and then you have 
this great expanse all around. 


10:08.923 --> 10:10.693
We have a picture. 


10:10.693 --> 10:12.561
Maybe this will give us an idea. 


10:12.562 --> 10:14.397
Do you see the temple in the middle there 


10:14.397 --> 10:16.499
and then that wide perimeter 


10:16.498 --> 10:18.600
and the wall around the temple? 


10:18.600 --> 10:20.435
Why? 


10:20.435 --> 10:24.073
Jehovah answered at Ezekiel 43:9: 


10:24.073 --> 10:28.576
“Let them put 
their spiritual prostitution . . . 


10:28.577 --> 10:32.382
far away from me.” 


10:32.382 --> 10:34.950
Now, someone who was familiar 


10:34.950 --> 10:37.085
with the layout of ancient Jerusalem


10:37.085 --> 10:39.555
would understand this because, 


10:39.555 --> 10:41.823
really, there was only a wall that separated 


10:41.823 --> 10:45.160
the temple in Jerusalem 
from ordinary housing. 


10:45.160 --> 10:47.997
So as the people began to worship idols 


10:47.997 --> 10:51.134
and they brought immorality 
and all kinds of horrible things 


10:51.133 --> 10:53.168
into their homes, 


10:53.168 --> 10:56.905
they were actually bringing this 
right up against the wall of the temple. 


10:56.905 --> 10:59.108
So Jehovah God is saying: “No more! 


10:59.108 --> 11:00.876
“Enough! 


11:00.877 --> 11:03.000
I want to keep it far away from me.”


11:04.880 --> 11:07.883
Now, Ezekiel’s temple vision has a major 


11:07.883 --> 11:09.885
and a minor fulfillment. 


11:09.885 --> 11:12.788
So we’ll talk 
about the minor fulfillment for a moment. 


11:12.788 --> 11:14.790
In chapter 8, 


11:14.790 --> 11:17.593
Ezekiel described conditions that prevailed 


11:17.593 --> 11:20.161
when the temple of Solomon was functioning: 


11:20.162 --> 11:22.899
Seventy men offering incense 


11:22.898 --> 11:26.435
to “creeping things and loathsome beasts,” 


11:26.435 --> 11:29.305
“25 men . . . bowing down to the sun,” 


11:29.305 --> 11:33.675
‘women weeping for the god Tammuz.’ 


11:33.675 --> 11:35.945
But to his great relief, 


11:35.945 --> 11:40.248
Ezekiel sees none of that 
in his temple vision. 


11:40.248 --> 11:44.186
Instead, he sees pure worship 
being carried on in the way 


11:44.187 --> 11:46.189
that he would have understood 


11:46.188 --> 11:48.723
and that would have had 
Jehovah’s approval back then. 


11:48.723 --> 11:52.661
So after the Jews were released 


11:52.662 --> 11:54.864
from Babylonian captivity, 


11:54.863 --> 11:59.601
they would be able 
to worship Jehovah acceptably. 


11:59.602 --> 12:04.140
After the Jews were released 
from Babylonian captivity, 


12:04.140 --> 12:09.112
they would be able 
to restore pure worship 


12:09.112 --> 12:11.747
in the way that Jehovah approved.


12:11.747 --> 12:13.982
But now, the title of this talk is 


12:13.982 --> 12:17.587
“Ezekiel’s Temple . . . and You!” 


12:17.587 --> 12:20.689
So where do we fit into the picture? 


12:20.688 --> 12:22.691
Well, it’s simple. 


12:22.692 --> 12:27.229
We are living in the time of the fulfillment 


12:27.228 --> 12:30.565
of Ezekiel’s temple vision. 


12:30.565 --> 12:32.602
And in the major fulfillment, 


12:32.602 --> 12:35.337
we find that true worship has been restored. 


12:35.337 --> 12:37.339
Since when? 


12:37.338 --> 12:40.541
Well, since when in particular 
has “the mountain of the house of Jehovah” 


12:40.542 --> 12:43.245
been ‘lifted up above the tops 
of the mountains’? 


12:43.245 --> 12:47.000
Since 1919. 


12:48.017 --> 12:52.889
What a coincidence
—because in 1919, 


12:52.888 --> 12:57.726
Jehovah’s people were also freed 
from captivity to Babylon the Great! 


12:57.727 --> 13:01.297
And so after being freed 
from captivity to Babylon the Great, 


13:01.297 --> 13:04.800
now we see an improvement 
in pure worship


13:04.800 --> 13:07.035
—getting better and better. 


13:07.035 --> 13:11.140
And since that time, 
Jehovah has progressively guided us 


13:11.140 --> 13:14.510
to adopt his high standards. 


13:14.510 --> 13:17.813
Now think about his high moral standards. 


13:17.813 --> 13:20.781
Nobody is admitted 


13:20.782 --> 13:23.852
to a permanent association 
with the organization 


13:23.852 --> 13:26.622
until they have the approval of the elders


13:26.622 --> 13:30.659
—until the elders say, 
“Yes, they are acceptable.” 


13:30.658 --> 13:35.363
Now, I think back 65 years ago 
when I started publishing, 


13:35.363 --> 13:37.500
and I know that many of you 


13:37.500 --> 13:40.435
have been publishers a lot longer than that. 


13:40.435 --> 13:44.807
But I can remember back 
65 years ago when I started to publish, 


13:44.807 --> 13:46.842
and I just turned in a report; 


13:46.842 --> 13:48.877
nobody asked me any questions. 


13:48.877 --> 13:50.980
You didn’t have to be approved. 


13:50.980 --> 13:54.483
When you got baptized, you didn’t go through 
the questions with the elders; 


13:54.483 --> 13:57.853
there were no elders. 


13:57.853 --> 14:00.588
No more, no more. 


14:00.588 --> 14:05.393
We can see how Jehovah 
has progressively raised the standard. 


14:05.393 --> 14:08.130
And what about unrepentant wrongdoers? 


14:08.130 --> 14:10.732
They’re not allowed 
to remain in the congregation


14:10.732 --> 14:13.335
—that wasn’t always the case. 


14:13.335 --> 14:17.405
So we can see how Jehovah God 
has been progressively guiding us, 


14:17.405 --> 14:22.377
leading us, to a better 
and better relationship with him.


14:22.377 --> 14:25.447
Now, he’s also cleansed 
his people spiritually. 


14:25.447 --> 14:28.717
Think about what’s happened since 1919


14:28.717 --> 14:30.752
—how Jehovah’s people have worked hard 


14:30.752 --> 14:35.257
to keep spiritual uncleanness 
far away from pure worship, 


14:35.257 --> 14:38.294
casting off false doctrines and practices 


14:38.293 --> 14:41.596
tainted with idolatry and paganism. 


14:41.597 --> 14:43.599
And what has been the result? 


14:43.598 --> 14:47.168
Jehovah has blessed his people, 


14:47.168 --> 14:50.005
and there is tangible proof of that blessing. 


14:50.005 --> 14:54.108
Nations are streaming 
to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah,” 


14:54.108 --> 14:56.978
and they come because they have heard 


14:56.978 --> 14:59.681
that God is with his people.


14:59.682 --> 15:03.419
So, what have we learned 
from this brief discussion? 


15:03.418 --> 15:05.620
This: 


15:05.620 --> 15:10.558
While the spiritual temple 
is Jehovah’s arrangement for worship, 


15:10.558 --> 15:13.995
Ezekiel’s temple emphasizes 


15:13.995 --> 15:17.298
God’s standards for worship. 


15:17.298 --> 15:19.335
And what else have we learned? 


15:19.335 --> 15:20.702
This: 


15:20.702 --> 15:23.072
We see the arrangement 
of the spiritual temple 


15:23.072 --> 15:25.707
since 29 C.E., 


15:25.707 --> 15:30.345
but we see the fulfillment 
Ezekiel’s temple vision 


15:30.345 --> 15:33.000
since 1919. 


15:35.250 --> 15:39.087
Well, we’re grateful 
to our angelic tour guide 


15:39.087 --> 15:42.859
for the remarkable visit 
that we’ve had to the temple. 


15:42.858 --> 15:45.726
But we’re also more grateful to Jehovah God 


15:45.727 --> 15:47.730
for helping us to see


15:47.730 --> 15:50.598
what that remarkable vision


15:50.598 --> 15:54.000
means for you and for me today.


16:05.680 --> 16:07.917
We want to thank you very much, 
Brother Splane, 


16:07.917 --> 16:10.019
for such a clear explanation. 


16:10.018 --> 16:13.488
And clear as it was, 
we’re all looking forward to the replay


16:13.488 --> 16:17.793
—aren’t we?—
so that we can get all those details, 


16:17.793 --> 16:21.330
because that was a very interesting 
and exciting discussion. 


16:21.330 --> 16:23.332
Well, next on our program, 


16:23.332 --> 16:25.634
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body 


16:25.633 --> 16:28.536
is going to talk to us 
on this interesting theme, 


16:28.537 --> 16:32.000
“Never Ever Lose Hope.”


16:33.908 --> 16:38.080
Hope is absolutely essential 


16:38.080 --> 16:41.417
to our strength as Christians. 


16:41.417 --> 16:46.089
No hope equals no power. 


16:46.088 --> 16:50.191
Proverbs 18:14 says: 


16:50.192 --> 16:52.394
“A person’s spirit 


16:52.393 --> 16:55.096
“can sustain him through illness, 


16:55.097 --> 16:58.700
but who can bear a crushed spirit?” 


16:58.700 --> 17:00.968
Or if you look at the footnote: 


17:00.968 --> 17:04.773
“Who can bear complete despair?” 


17:04.773 --> 17:06.775
What’s the point? 


17:06.775 --> 17:11.147
No hope equals no power. 


17:11.147 --> 17:13.182
But then there’s also 


17:13.182 --> 17:16.752
low hope equals low power. 


17:16.752 --> 17:20.189
Proverbs 24:10 says: 


17:20.188 --> 17:24.191
“If you become discouraged 
in the day of distress, 


17:24.192 --> 17:27.529
your strength will be meager.” 


17:27.528 --> 17:31.200
Low hope equals low power. 


17:31.200 --> 17:33.702
Well, immediately we see 


17:33.702 --> 17:37.339
why it is so important for us as Christians 


17:37.338 --> 17:41.743
that we never ever lose hope. 


17:41.743 --> 17:44.713
Hebrews 6:19 says 


17:44.713 --> 17:48.616
that ‘hope is the anchor of our souls’ 


17:48.617 --> 17:52.654
or, the footnote, ‘the anchor of our lives.’


17:52.653 --> 17:54.790
But now, brothers, what is hope? 


17:54.790 --> 17:58.160
That’s a word we use all the time, 
but what does it really mean? 


17:58.160 --> 18:01.630
The original-language words 
that are used in the Bible 


18:01.630 --> 18:03.665
that are translated “hope” 


18:03.665 --> 18:06.368
mean to wait eagerly 


18:06.368 --> 18:08.803
and to expect good. 


18:08.803 --> 18:11.773
So hope is not simply 


18:11.773 --> 18:14.476
the desire for something good. 


18:14.477 --> 18:17.880
It also includes the basis 


18:17.880 --> 18:21.950
for believing that that good thing 
is going to come. 


18:21.950 --> 18:24.000
Now let’s look at an illustration: 


18:25.120 --> 18:29.123
We might wish that a friend 
would come to our aid 


18:29.123 --> 18:32.193
and help us during a time of trial. 


18:32.193 --> 18:34.663
But now, what if that friend 


18:34.663 --> 18:38.266
had helped us many, many times before? 


18:38.267 --> 18:40.202
Well, now it changes, doesn’t it? 


18:40.202 --> 18:44.574
Now our hope is not simply wishful thinking. 


18:44.573 --> 18:47.943
There is a real reason to believe 


18:47.943 --> 18:50.178
that that friend will help us. 


18:50.178 --> 18:52.380
You see, that is real hope, 


18:52.380 --> 18:55.750
not just the desire for something good, 


18:55.750 --> 19:00.000
but the real basis to believe 
that we can receive it.


19:01.823 --> 19:04.025
Well now, brothers, 
what could cause us 


19:04.025 --> 19:06.395
to begin to lose hope? 


19:06.395 --> 19:09.498
Well, I don’t think I need to tell you this, 


19:09.498 --> 19:13.668
but life in this system 
is certainly not trouble-free. 


19:13.668 --> 19:16.471
Were you aware of that? 


19:16.472 --> 19:18.707
Most of us, we recognize 


19:18.707 --> 19:21.109
that our physical bodies are breaking down. 


19:21.108 --> 19:23.111
If you’re over 50, 


19:23.112 --> 19:26.014
no doubt you’ve had to learn a new alphabet: 


19:26.013 --> 19:29.283
EKG, MRI, 


19:29.283 --> 19:32.286
HDL, LDL, 


19:32.287 --> 19:34.724
and the list goes on and on. 


19:34.723 --> 19:37.125
If you don’t know what that means, 


19:37.125 --> 19:40.662
well, OK, I give up. 


19:40.662 --> 19:42.697
But in addition 


19:42.697 --> 19:45.400
to our own health problems 
and challenges, 


19:45.400 --> 19:48.270
we have to cope 
with the health problems 


19:48.270 --> 19:51.673
of our close relatives
or perhaps our marriage mate,  


19:51.673 --> 19:55.110
our elderly parents, 
or whatever it may be. 


19:55.110 --> 19:57.245
And in addition to that, 


19:57.245 --> 19:59.948
we also have to cope 
with the loss 


19:59.948 --> 20:02.885
of some of our very dear 
loved ones in death. 


20:02.885 --> 20:05.787
What if you live in Venezuela? 


20:05.787 --> 20:08.790
Because of the unrest in that country, 


20:08.790 --> 20:11.460
the reports that we have received 


20:11.460 --> 20:15.930
as of August 10 indicate that 47, 


20:15.930 --> 20:18.600
47 of our brothers and sisters 


20:18.600 --> 20:21.803
have been murdered in that land. 


20:21.803 --> 20:23.805
And many more have been victims 


20:23.805 --> 20:27.208
of other terrible criminal acts. 


20:27.208 --> 20:31.746
Our hearts go out 
to our brothers in Venezuela. 


20:31.747 --> 20:35.717
What if you live in Texas 
or Mexico or the Caribbean? 


20:35.717 --> 20:40.355
Well, you know that they have just had 
devastating natural disasters. 


20:40.355 --> 20:43.858
Some of our brothers have lost their homes, 
their places of worship, 


20:43.858 --> 20:47.828
as well as virtually 
all of their material things. 


20:47.828 --> 20:50.365
What if you live in Russia? 


20:50.365 --> 20:54.803
In that land, 175,000 of our brothers 


20:54.803 --> 20:58.773
can now no longer worship 
Jehovah in freedom.


20:58.773 --> 21:01.041
Well, if we were to continue to focus 


21:01.042 --> 21:03.412
our attention on all 
of these negative things, 


21:03.412 --> 21:07.249
this would not be the Kingdom Hall; 
it would be the Wailing Wall. 


21:07.248 --> 21:09.685
Isn’t that true? 


21:09.685 --> 21:12.553
But I have to tell you, brothers, 


21:12.553 --> 21:16.958
that is not the spirit of Jehovah’s people. 


21:16.958 --> 21:20.228
That is not the spirit in the room right now. 


21:20.228 --> 21:23.031
It is not the spirit of God’s people 


21:23.032 --> 21:26.067
anywhere on the face of this earth. 


21:26.067 --> 21:30.505
Despite all of the challenges 
that we are experiencing, 


21:30.505 --> 21:33.342
we do not give up! 


21:33.342 --> 21:36.000
Do you agree?


21:46.988 --> 21:49.123
Now, why is this the case? 


21:49.123 --> 21:53.095
Isaiah chapter 40 has the answer for us. 


21:53.095 --> 21:57.000
Now let’s begin reading here in verse 26. 


21:58.633 --> 22:00.835
The prophet encourages us to look up. 


22:00.835 --> 22:04.973
It says: 
“Lift up your eyes to heaven and see. 


22:04.973 --> 22:07.375
“Who has created these things? 


22:07.375 --> 22:11.680
“It is the One who brings out 
their army by number; 


22:11.680 --> 22:14.282
“he calls them all by name. 


22:14.282 --> 22:17.552
“Because of his vast dynamic energy 


22:17.552 --> 22:19.955
“and his awe-inspiring power, 


22:19.955 --> 22:22.657
not one of them is missing.” 


22:22.657 --> 22:24.659
Well, what’s the point? 


22:24.658 --> 22:27.428
You see, the Source of our hope, 


22:27.428 --> 22:30.831
the One we put our confidence in
—Jehovah— 


22:30.832 --> 22:33.569
has “vast dynamic energy”;  


22:33.568 --> 22:36.136
he has “awe-inspiring power.” 


22:36.137 --> 22:39.809
Look at verse 28: 
“Do you not know? 


22:39.808 --> 22:41.876
“Have you not heard? 


22:41.877 --> 22:44.645
“Jehovah, 
the Creator of the ends of the earth, 


22:44.645 --> 22:46.615
“is a God for all eternity. 


22:46.615 --> 22:50.185
“He never tires out or grows weary. 


22:50.185 --> 22:53.688
His understanding is unsearchable.” 


22:53.688 --> 22:58.660
Yes, Jehovah is the ultimate 
Power Source in the universe. 


22:58.660 --> 23:02.863
He never grows tired; 
he never grows weary. 


23:02.863 --> 23:05.300
But now, how do we benefit? 


23:05.300 --> 23:08.002
Because we put our hope in him. 


23:08.002 --> 23:10.872
Well, look at what verse 29 says: 


23:10.872 --> 23:14.375
“He gives power to the tired one 


23:14.375 --> 23:18.447
and full might to those lacking strength.” 


23:18.447 --> 23:20.482
Well, now, is this something


23:20.482 --> 23:23.952
that we can connect somehow 
to our physical power? 


23:23.952 --> 23:26.722
In other words, 
that somehow Jehovah 


23:26.722 --> 23:29.224
invigorates our own physical bodies? 


23:29.223 --> 23:32.726
Well, not really, 
because look at verse 30, at what it says: 


23:32.727 --> 23:36.364
“Boys will tire out and grow weary, 


23:36.363 --> 23:39.433
and young men will stumble and fall.” 


23:39.433 --> 23:44.305
So this help from Jehovah 
is not connected to our physical strength. 


23:44.305 --> 23:48.510
It’s not connected to our age 
or our physical power. 


23:48.510 --> 23:50.545
What really, then, 


23:50.545 --> 23:54.917
is the key to our gaining this power 


23:54.917 --> 23:58.820
from this unlimited 
Power Source that is Jehovah? 


23:58.820 --> 24:01.000
Well, verse 31: 


24:02.023 --> 24:05.993
“But those hoping in Jehovah 


24:05.993 --> 24:08.430
will regain power.” 


24:08.430 --> 24:11.767
Well, now, that’s an interesting expression.


24:11.767 --> 24:16.539
Problems, pressures, persecution, 


24:16.538 --> 24:20.541
ban, imprisonment, natural disaster


24:20.542 --> 24:22.710
—the list goes on and on and on. 


24:22.710 --> 24:25.447
If we focus our attention 


24:25.447 --> 24:29.350
on all of these problems and difficulties, 
what happens? 


24:29.350 --> 24:33.322
We just feel our battery 
being completely drained


24:33.322 --> 24:36.424
—we lose all of our power. 


24:36.423 --> 24:40.595
But what happens when we turn our attention 


24:40.595 --> 24:43.498
to our magnificent God, Jehovah? 


24:43.498 --> 24:46.568
What happens when we remember 


24:46.568 --> 24:48.903
how much Jehovah loves us? 


24:48.903 --> 24:50.938
What happens when we remember 


24:50.938 --> 24:54.075
how many times Jehovah has come through 


24:54.075 --> 24:56.377
and given us exactly what we need 


24:56.377 --> 24:58.947
exactly at the right time? 


24:58.947 --> 25:02.150
We immediately, as verse 31 says, 


25:02.150 --> 25:05.720
we immediately begin to “regain power.” 


25:05.720 --> 25:08.723
We feel it coming back into us. 


25:08.723 --> 25:11.560
And although we may have been like a tree 


25:11.560 --> 25:14.930
that has lost its leaves and just looks 
like it’s dead, what happens? 


25:14.930 --> 25:17.698
Well, we put forth new shoots, 


25:17.698 --> 25:20.635
and we begin to come back to life 


25:20.635 --> 25:24.038
because of the power 
that’s coming from Jehovah. 


25:24.038 --> 25:26.975
Well, as a result, 
what does the end of the verse say? 


25:26.975 --> 25:30.712
“They will soar on wings like eagles. 


25:30.712 --> 25:34.349
“They will run and not grow weary; 


25:34.348 --> 25:38.118
they will walk and not tire out.” 


25:38.118 --> 25:40.555
Brothers, what’s the point? 


25:40.555 --> 25:44.125
No hope, no power; 


25:44.125 --> 25:47.995
low hope, low power; 


25:47.995 --> 25:52.567
hope in Jehovah, unlimited power! 


25:52.567 --> 25:55.000
Would you agree? 


26:01.910 --> 26:04.012
When we hope in Jehovah, 


26:04.012 --> 26:06.682
we can walk, we can run, 


26:06.682 --> 26:09.684
we can fly, we can even soar 


26:09.683 --> 26:14.188
if we never ever lose hope in Jehovah.


26:14.188 --> 26:16.725
Now, brothers, I want to tell you, 


26:16.725 --> 26:19.427
this is not pop psychology. 


26:19.427 --> 26:23.499
This is not the power of positive thinking. 


26:23.498 --> 26:26.500
Wherever I go on this beautiful earth 


26:26.500 --> 26:29.703
and I have the opportunity 
to meet Jehovah’s people, 


26:29.703 --> 26:32.906
I have seen with my own eyes 


26:32.907 --> 26:34.944
how Jehovah is renewing 


26:34.943 --> 26:36.978
the power of his people. 


26:36.978 --> 26:39.080
They are never conquered 


26:39.080 --> 26:41.382
by the situations they are facing. 


26:41.382 --> 26:43.419
The power from Jehovah 


26:43.418 --> 26:46.153
is helping them to remain firm.


26:46.153 --> 26:49.090
What about our dear brothers in Venezuela? 


26:49.090 --> 26:52.427
Despite the many problems and pressures


26:52.427 --> 26:54.529
that have come 
upon our brothers in that land 


26:54.528 --> 26:57.231
due to the unrest that’s occurring, 


26:57.232 --> 27:00.302
did you know that in 2014 


27:00.302 --> 27:05.207
there were 26,252 regular pioneers
in that land 


27:05.207 --> 27:09.710
but this year in May of 2017, 


27:09.710 --> 27:13.748
in the midst of all of these problems 
that are occurring in that country, 


27:13.748 --> 27:18.453
they recorded an all-time peak 
in regular pioneers


27:18.453 --> 27:21.723
—34,353, 


27:21.723 --> 27:23.891
an increase of more than 8,000? 


27:23.892 --> 27:26.000
What do you think of that? 


27:35.803 --> 27:39.740
Those dear brothers are not accomplishing 
that in their own strength. 


27:39.740 --> 27:42.010
They’re hoping in Jehovah, 


27:42.010 --> 27:45.680
and they’re renewing 
or regaining their power.


27:45.680 --> 27:48.750
What about those brothers 
in the disaster relief areas? 


27:48.750 --> 27:50.685
Do you remember what Brother Breaux said 


27:50.685 --> 27:53.722
in the report on JW Broadcasting 


27:53.722 --> 27:56.825
about our brothers on the island of Tortola? 


27:56.825 --> 28:00.228
Their Kingdom Hall, 
which they had been using for decades, 


28:00.228 --> 28:04.098
was destroyed, rendered unusable. 


28:04.098 --> 28:06.333
And yet what did the brothers do? 


28:06.333 --> 28:10.538
Every day they went and sat 
in the Kingdom Hall parking lot. 


28:10.538 --> 28:12.206
Do you remember that? 


28:12.207 --> 28:13.642
And why? 


28:13.642 --> 28:16.477
Because they knew, they had confidence, 


28:16.477 --> 28:19.414
that this would be the place where the help 


28:19.413 --> 28:21.581
from Jehovah would originate. 


28:21.582 --> 28:23.952
And they were not disappointed. 


28:23.952 --> 28:28.089
Brother Breaux assures me 
that now arrangements are being made 


28:28.088 --> 28:31.960
so that that Kingdom Hall is going 
to be restored and back up in use 


28:31.960 --> 28:35.297
for the benefit 
of our dear brothers in Tortola.


28:35.297 --> 28:40.069
And what about 
those dear brothers and sisters in Russia? 


28:40.068 --> 28:43.471
Well, what did Jehovah do


28:43.472 --> 28:47.342
to make the spirit 
of those brothers and sisters soar, 


28:47.342 --> 28:51.079
even though they were facing 
a very, very difficult situation? 


28:51.078 --> 28:54.000
Please watch.


29:18.172 --> 29:21.175
From elderly people to small children, 


29:21.175 --> 29:23.243
people in every walk of life 


29:23.243 --> 29:26.646
have all wanted 
to express themselves in some way  


29:26.647 --> 29:29.717
and tell the authorities in Russia 
how they feel 


29:29.717 --> 29:33.187
about this action 
on Jehovah’s people worldwide. 


29:33.187 --> 29:38.000
It has had such 
a unifying effect on our brotherhood.


29:39.993 --> 29:44.265
I have no idea what Mr. Putin 


29:44.265 --> 29:47.502
will do when he opens 
all these letters, 


29:47.502 --> 29:49.504
not just mine. 


29:49.503 --> 29:51.806
Having written these letters 


29:51.807 --> 29:55.009
shows how the whole organization 


29:55.008 --> 30:00.000
is upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty 
in these last days.


30:03.417 --> 30:06.554
I consider participating in this campaign 


30:06.553 --> 30:08.490
a great privilege. 


30:08.490 --> 30:11.358
Even though we are separated 
by language and distance, 


30:11.358 --> 30:15.000
we are united by our love for Jehovah.


30:18.967 --> 30:22.670
Jehovah’s servants may be considered 
as a minority in Russia, 


30:22.670 --> 30:25.673
but we are associated 
with a worldwide brotherhood. 


30:25.673 --> 30:28.543
And as a part 
of the worldwide brotherhood,


30:28.543 --> 30:32.000
I wanted to participate 
this campaign by writing letters.


30:41.957 --> 30:44.592
I wrote to the prime minister 


30:44.592 --> 30:49.000
so that he would let 
my brothers go to the Kingdom Halls.


30:57.238 --> 31:01.275
I am sending this letter 
to ask the Russian government 


31:01.275 --> 31:04.745
to please allow Jehovah’s Witnesses 
and their children 


31:04.745 --> 31:08.000
to worship Jehovah 
because they are good.


31:16.790 --> 31:20.395
“We are hard-pressed in every way, 


31:20.395 --> 31:22.463
“but not cramped beyond movement; 


31:22.463 --> 31:25.165
“we are perplexed, 


31:25.165 --> 31:27.335
“but not absolutely with no way out; 


31:27.335 --> 31:31.405
“we are persecuted, but not abandoned; 


31:31.405 --> 31:33.842
“we are knocked down, 


31:33.842 --> 31:36.000
but not destroyed.”


31:44.952 --> 31:48.022
Brothers and sisters, 
we do not know 


31:48.022 --> 31:51.859
what challenges await us in 2018. 


31:51.858 --> 31:54.428
However, we do know 


31:54.428 --> 31:59.000
that if we never ever lose hope in Jehovah, 


31:59.000 --> 32:01.602
we “will regain power.” 


32:01.602 --> 32:03.605
How appropriate, then, 


32:03.605 --> 32:05.840
that the Governing Body has chosen 


32:05.840 --> 32:09.277
for our 2018 yeartext 


32:09.277 --> 32:13.414
Isaiah 40:31: 


32:13.413 --> 32:18.000
“Those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.” 


32:29.330 --> 32:31.432
Yes, dear brothers and sisters, 


32:31.432 --> 32:34.135
we will always have access 


32:34.135 --> 32:37.738
to the ultimate Power Supply in the universe 


32:37.738 --> 32:41.141
if we never ever lose hope 


32:41.142 --> 32:46.000
in our magnificent, 
our wonderful God, Jehovah.


32:53.087 --> 32:55.790
Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson, 


32:55.790 --> 32:58.158
and we look forward to seeing that yeartext 


32:58.158 --> 33:00.395
continue to remind us of the need of hope. 


33:00.395 --> 33:02.397
Next on our program, 


33:02.397 --> 33:05.132
we have Brother Samuel Herd 
of the Governing Body, 


33:05.132 --> 33:07.569
and we notice his title is 


33:07.568 --> 33:11.000
“Protected by Obedience.”


33:16.643 --> 33:20.246
During this talk 
if you should happen to hear 


33:20.247 --> 33:24.000
a new spiritual gem, 
put it out of your mind. 


33:25.787 --> 33:28.000
I have nothing new to give you.


33:35.195 --> 33:40.000
A mother deer parks 
her baby fawn in tall grass. 


33:40.000 --> 33:44.138
She tells her baby to stay put, 


33:44.138 --> 33:46.140
and it does. 


33:46.140 --> 33:50.177
She leaves and does not return 
for many hours. 


33:50.177 --> 33:54.615
In fact, its protection 
depends on its obedience 


33:54.615 --> 33:57.952
to its mother’s command. 


33:57.952 --> 34:01.655
Now think back 
when you were small children. 


34:01.655 --> 34:04.558
Didn’t your parents 
lay down some commands


34:04.558 --> 34:07.795
for you to follow 
for your protection? 


34:07.795 --> 34:09.730
Let’s take a look at something. 


34:09.730 --> 34:12.000
Let’s go to Ephesians in our Bibles, 


34:13.902 --> 34:17.339
and let’s look at the sixth chapter 


34:17.338 --> 34:19.973
and a couple of the verses. 


34:19.973 --> 34:23.811
It says: 
“Children, be obedient to your parents 


34:23.812 --> 34:27.515
“in union with the Lord, 
for this is righteous. 


34:27.515 --> 34:30.000
“‘Honor your father and your mother’ 


34:32.353 --> 34:35.423
“is the first command with a promise: 


34:35.423 --> 34:37.858
“That it may go well with you 


34:37.858 --> 34:43.998
and you may remain 
a long time on the earth.’”


34:43.998 --> 34:47.835
Now, all of us as adults 


34:47.835 --> 34:50.905
are children 
under our heavenly Father, Jehovah. 


34:50.905 --> 34:54.675
And, of course, we’ll always 
be children under Jehovah. 


34:54.675 --> 34:57.945
He expects us to be obedient children, 


34:57.945 --> 35:01.848
just like you would expect your child, 
if you should have one, 


35:01.848 --> 35:05.820
to be obedient to you 
and your suggestions 


35:05.820 --> 35:09.290
and perhaps some of your commands. 


35:09.290 --> 35:12.760
And when we are subjected 
to Jehovah to this degree, 


35:12.760 --> 35:14.762
we’re protected. 


35:14.762 --> 35:17.365
And just as the scripture
said for the small children,


35:17.365 --> 35:19.367
it applies to us as well: 


35:19.367 --> 35:22.637
“That it may go well with you.” 


35:22.637 --> 35:24.672
And we want it to go well with us. 


35:24.672 --> 35:26.674
That’s what we’re all about. 


35:26.673 --> 35:30.310
We want to serve Jehovah 
loyally and faithfully 


35:30.310 --> 35:32.980
so that we can gain his “well done.” 


35:32.980 --> 35:36.483
And just as a child may ask his dad 


35:36.483 --> 35:38.485
“Why?” 


35:38.485 --> 35:40.488
Have you ever 
had a child do you that way? 


35:40.488 --> 35:42.490
“Why? 


35:42.490 --> 35:44.492
Why do birds sing?” 


35:44.492 --> 35:45.727
“Why? 


35:45.727 --> 35:47.895
Why is the sky blue?” 


35:47.895 --> 35:51.398
There’s no end to his why’s. 


35:51.398 --> 35:55.503
In fact, you may have answered, 


35:55.503 --> 35:58.000
“Do it because I told you to do it.” 


35:59.573 --> 36:02.910
Your answer was blunt; 


36:02.910 --> 36:04.912
there’s no doubt about that. 


36:04.912 --> 36:07.515
Now, why would you 
answer a child bluntly like that? 


36:07.515 --> 36:11.352
Well, it may be because 
of what he asked of you. 


36:11.352 --> 36:13.989
What was behind the why? 


36:13.988 --> 36:17.090
Well, he’s just too young; 
he’s too young for you to go 


36:17.090 --> 36:20.728
and try to explain the why. 


36:20.728 --> 36:25.165
It may be that this example 


36:25.165 --> 36:27.635
could be a reality: 


36:27.635 --> 36:32.038
Your five-year-old little girl asks, 


36:32.038 --> 36:35.576
“Mommy, why does Jehovah 


36:35.577 --> 36:38.812
let babies die from lack of food?” 


36:38.812 --> 36:42.317
See, the little girl 
just heard that on the television set: 


36:42.317 --> 36:44.819
Babies are dying from lack of food. 


36:44.818 --> 36:47.255
Mommy says, “Honey,” 


36:47.255 --> 36:49.723
and puts her arm around her little girl, 


36:49.723 --> 36:54.028
“it has to do with the issue of sovereignty 


36:54.028 --> 36:59.000
that was raised a long time ago.”


37:01.668 --> 37:04.338
Some of you may have wondered 


37:04.338 --> 37:07.441
about that question 


37:07.442 --> 37:09.777
when you were small. 


37:09.777 --> 37:13.647
Even when you became adults 
without a knowledge of the Bible, 


37:13.647 --> 37:16.817
you may have wondered, 
‘Why does God’


37:16.817 --> 37:18.819
—you didn’t know him by Jehovah—


37:18.818 --> 37:21.588
‘Why does God let little children 
starve to death?’ 


37:21.588 --> 37:24.625
You’ve seen pictures 
on television and in the movies 


37:24.625 --> 37:27.728
where a little baby is just 
hanging on to his mother’s breast, 


37:27.728 --> 37:32.366
and there’s not a drop of milk 
in that mommy’s breast—not one. 


37:32.367 --> 37:34.569
And you may have asked yourself 
‘Why?’ 


37:34.568 --> 37:37.738
But now you have the answer to why, 


37:37.738 --> 37:41.308
and you help so many others 
to get the answer to why


37:41.308 --> 37:43.576
—that God is not responsible 


37:43.577 --> 37:46.580
for the deaths of these children, 


37:46.580 --> 37:49.050
but there’s someone else 
who is responsible. 


37:49.050 --> 37:51.118
And why has God delayed? 


37:51.118 --> 37:53.553
Well, we all know it’s because of an issue 


37:53.553 --> 37:56.590
that came on the scene years ago, 


37:56.590 --> 37:59.060
and it has to be settled 
beyond question


37:59.060 --> 38:02.128
—and it’s going to be settled 
beyond question. 


38:02.128 --> 38:04.798
Think back, 
Jehovah told the Israelites 


38:04.798 --> 38:08.801
to impound their source 
of water to keep it clean. 


38:08.802 --> 38:11.405
Why? 
He didn’t say. 


38:11.405 --> 38:14.742
Harmful germs could be present 


38:14.742 --> 38:17.779
but couldn’t be seen by the naked eye. 


38:17.778 --> 38:19.780
There was no microscope. 


38:19.780 --> 38:24.685
It wasn’t invented until the 1590’s. 


38:24.685 --> 38:28.288
They had to trust and obey for protection. 


38:28.288 --> 38:31.025
And we have to trust Jehovah too, 


38:31.025 --> 38:33.893
even today, for our protection. 


38:33.893 --> 38:37.365
And when we listen to Jehovah, 


38:37.365 --> 38:39.367
then we’re blessed. 


38:39.367 --> 38:41.369
And we want to listen to Jehovah. 


38:41.368 --> 38:43.003
Why? 


38:43.003 --> 38:45.571
Well, there’s a number of reasons: 
He’s our Creator; 


38:45.572 --> 38:48.000
he’s our Life-Giver; 
he’s our Life-Sustainer. 


38:49.943 --> 38:55.281
If he did not respond 
in this loving way, 


38:55.282 --> 38:58.352
none of us would be here
—we would expire. 


38:58.352 --> 39:01.589
And we all know that. 
So he’s loving. 


39:01.588 --> 39:04.691
Here’s another reason: 
He’s lived longer than we have. 


39:04.692 --> 39:07.562
And if we live forever, 
we will never catch up 


39:07.562 --> 39:09.597
to how long he has lived. 


39:09.597 --> 39:13.134
He’s been and seen more 


39:13.133 --> 39:16.403
than we have or ever will see. 


39:16.403 --> 39:18.505
He has more experience. 


39:18.505 --> 39:23.377
He has done things 
that we have not done 


39:23.377 --> 39:27.549
and perhaps will never 
ever be able to do.


39:27.548 --> 39:31.485
I’d like to tell you a little story 
about when I was a young boy. 


39:31.485 --> 39:36.323
We had a little house; 
we had a fireplace. 


39:36.323 --> 39:40.393
In wintertime we’d gather 
in the living room near the fireplace 


39:40.393 --> 39:44.498
and put coal in the fireplace, 
some wood. 


39:44.498 --> 39:46.566
And at times 


39:46.567 --> 39:51.639
a piece of the fire would blow out, 


39:51.638 --> 39:53.873
come out, of the fireplace 


39:53.873 --> 39:58.145
and onto the living room carpet or linoleum. 


39:58.145 --> 40:01.215
And my dad would just pick it up in his hands 


40:01.215 --> 40:03.250
and toss it back in. 


40:03.250 --> 40:06.453
And I thought, 
‘Well, my, that’s a grand thing to do.’ 


40:06.453 --> 40:09.256
So the next time it blew out, 


40:09.257 --> 40:12.059
I grabbed ahold of it. 


40:12.058 --> 40:15.161
Never again. 


40:15.162 --> 40:17.465
I learned my lesson. 


40:17.465 --> 40:19.600
Now, my dad’s hands were calloused 


40:19.600 --> 40:22.503
because he was a mule driver, 


40:22.503 --> 40:25.840
and he held on to the reins 


40:25.840 --> 40:30.812
day in and day out 
for years upon years. 


40:30.812 --> 40:33.880
And his hands were just like leather,


40:33.880 --> 40:36.150
and so he knew 
that he could hold that coal 


40:36.150 --> 40:40.020
for a short while and get rid of it, 
and it would not burn him. 


40:40.020 --> 40:42.222
I did not have that knowledge. 


40:42.222 --> 40:45.325
I had not lived long enough 


40:45.325 --> 40:49.363
to gain that knowledge, 
but my dad had. 


40:49.363 --> 40:54.066
You see, my dad was 
56 years old when I was born. 


40:54.067 --> 40:59.274
And today, 
if he would be here, 


40:59.273 --> 41:02.000
why, then he would be 
138 years old. 


41:03.510 --> 41:07.147
So my dad never 
was a young dad for me, 


41:07.147 --> 41:09.184
but he was a good dad. 


41:09.183 --> 41:12.820
And, of course, he was a strong man.


41:12.820 --> 41:15.288
Jehovah created the sun. 


41:15.288 --> 41:17.290
How hot is the sun? 


41:17.290 --> 41:20.360
Well, they tell us at its surface 


41:20.360 --> 41:22.997
it’s 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 


41:22.997 --> 41:25.867
or 5,600 degrees Celsius. 


41:25.867 --> 41:28.302
At its core, or center, 


41:28.302 --> 41:31.505
it’s 27 million degrees Fahrenheit, 


41:31.505 --> 41:35.000
or 15 million degrees Celsius. 


41:36.577 --> 41:38.612
A cremation oven 


41:38.612 --> 41:43.350
is only 1,400 degrees 
to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (760°-982°C)


41:43.350 --> 41:48.355
in order to turn a body to ashes. 


41:48.355 --> 41:53.260
Now, just for the sake of impressing us 
with Jehovah’s greatness— 


41:53.260 --> 41:56.163
Don’t add any real truth to this 


41:56.163 --> 41:59.900
because we do not know; 
we only know that he created the sun. 


41:59.900 --> 42:02.970
But just to impress us 
with Jehovah’s greatness, 


42:02.970 --> 42:07.000
we can say that he could juggle 
the sun in his hands. 


42:09.710 --> 42:12.178
That’s our God, Jehovah. 


42:12.178 --> 42:15.381
New Jerusalem will not need 
the sun for light. 


42:15.382 --> 42:18.119
The Bible tells us 
“the glory of God illuminate[s] it.”


42:18.118 --> 42:20.486
—Revelation 21:23.


42:20.487 --> 42:24.124
When we obey 
the direction Jehovah gives, 


42:24.123 --> 42:26.993
we are totally protected. 


42:26.993 --> 42:31.165
That’s why we are not worried 
about the great tribulation. 


42:31.165 --> 42:35.168
What we have to worry about 
is what comes up 


42:35.168 --> 42:37.203
before the great tribulation, 


42:37.203 --> 42:40.240
and the Devil is going 
to do all that he can 


42:40.240 --> 42:42.375
to destroy our relationship with God. 


42:42.375 --> 42:44.378
Now, you can bet on that. 


42:44.378 --> 42:48.048
And he’s going to start with all of us. 


42:48.048 --> 42:51.318
He’s not going to select just individuals, 


42:51.318 --> 42:53.353
but he wants every one of us 


42:53.353 --> 42:56.056
to come over to his side of the issue. 


42:56.057 --> 42:59.894
And so he’s not going 
to leave you without test. 


42:59.893 --> 43:01.895
So we’re going to be tested. 


43:01.895 --> 43:04.265
Now, some of you 
may have already been tested to the limit. 


43:04.265 --> 43:06.267
We don’t know, 
but Jehovah does. 


43:06.267 --> 43:10.170
If you have, well, then you 
will not be tested to any other limit. 


43:10.170 --> 43:12.438
You may have a test, 
but you’ve proven 


43:12.438 --> 43:16.610
that you will be able to survive that test. 


43:16.610 --> 43:19.178
But right now we need to learn 


43:19.178 --> 43:21.781
to follow the rules that Jehovah lays out.


43:21.782 --> 43:25.954
The Bible mentions only two roads 
for mankind to follow. 


43:25.953 --> 43:27.955
Here they are. 


43:27.955 --> 43:31.058
Matthew 7:13, 14 says: 


43:31.058 --> 43:34.226
“Go in through the narrow gate, 
because broad is the gate 


43:34.227 --> 43:37.999
“and spacious is the road 
leading off into destruction, 


43:37.998 --> 43:40.200
“and many are going in through it; 


43:40.200 --> 43:44.805
“whereas narrow is the gate 
and cramped the road leading off into life, 


43:44.805 --> 43:47.540
and few are finding it.” 


43:47.540 --> 43:50.877
Now, you’re not 
on the spacious road, 


43:50.877 --> 43:54.415
not at all; 
disobedient travelers are on it


43:54.415 --> 43:57.317
—those permitted 
to do their own thing. 


43:57.317 --> 44:00.487
Innumerable people “dance” 


44:00.487 --> 44:03.424
along this wicked highway. 


44:03.423 --> 44:07.728
But you have chosen the cramped road,


44:07.728 --> 44:09.730
and that’s the road that Jehovah 


44:09.730 --> 44:12.098
has pointed out for each and every one of us. 


44:12.098 --> 44:15.068
And he’s drawn us to him


44:15.068 --> 44:18.638
—all because of what he sees in the heart. 


44:18.638 --> 44:22.508
Now, we may not be able to see 
what Jehovah sees in the heart, 


44:22.508 --> 44:26.713
and that can work against us 
if we’re not careful. 


44:26.713 --> 44:31.651
We can start talking about a brother 
because of what we do see. 


44:31.652 --> 44:36.424
But Jehovah overlooks that, 
he lets the blood of Jesus cover that. 


44:36.423 --> 44:38.658
And He looks for the good, 
and He sees the good. 


44:38.658 --> 44:40.660
And He wants that person to gain life. 


44:40.660 --> 44:43.963
And He’s going to help that person, 
even though we can’t see  


44:43.963 --> 44:47.500
the good that Jehovah God sees. 


44:47.500 --> 44:51.000
Now, perhaps in the near future, 


44:52.372 --> 44:56.844
our obedience will be put 
to the test as never before. 


44:56.843 --> 44:59.078
Let’s not depend on the strength 


44:59.078 --> 45:02.648
that we have demonstrated in our past tests. 


45:02.648 --> 45:06.120
Neither should we conclude 
that we are too spiritual 


45:06.120 --> 45:10.423
or too holy to cower under pressure. 


45:10.423 --> 45:14.026
Now is the time to make obedience a habit; 


45:14.027 --> 45:17.497
don’t wait till the test comes.


45:17.497 --> 45:21.635
Peter—one of the strongest 
of Jesus apostles—


45:21.635 --> 45:25.222
and the other apostles 
ran for their lives  


45:25.222 --> 45:27.240
the night Jesus was arrested. 


45:27.240 --> 45:29.677
But we find that Peter crept back, 


45:29.677 --> 45:32.379
but he stayed at a distance, 
a good distance. 


45:32.378 --> 45:35.981
But when questioned, 
he began to curse and swear, 


45:35.982 --> 45:40.420
saying: “I do not know 
this man of whom you speak!” 


45:40.420 --> 45:43.323
That’s Mark 14:71. 


45:43.323 --> 45:45.325
Now, that’s Peter. 


45:45.325 --> 45:47.327
Are you as strong as Peter? 


45:47.327 --> 45:49.329
Maybe, 


45:49.328 --> 45:51.331
maybe not. 


45:51.332 --> 45:55.235
And it’s that maybe not that we care about. 


45:55.235 --> 45:59.305
So let’s not depend 
on how long we’ve been in the truth; 


45:59.305 --> 46:01.308
let’s stay in the truth. 


46:01.308 --> 46:04.645
And the only way we’re going 
to do that is to stay with Jehovah. 


46:04.645 --> 46:09.583
He’s helped us 
to get his spiritual balance, 


46:09.583 --> 46:12.651
and we want to capture it 


46:12.652 --> 46:15.189
with every ounce of energy 
that we possibly can 


46:15.188 --> 46:20.160
so that we do not falter 
in any way and fall.


46:20.160 --> 46:23.863
So thanks to Jehovah and Jesus, 
we are here, 


46:23.863 --> 46:26.166
but let’s trust Jehovah 100 percent. 


46:26.167 --> 46:27.969
The Bible tells us: 


46:27.968 --> 46:30.470
“The one trusting in Jehovah 
will be protected,” 


46:30.470 --> 46:33.773
and that’s what this talk is all about


46:33.773 --> 46:35.808
—obedience 


46:35.808 --> 46:38.278
and praying for protection. 


46:38.278 --> 46:41.548
We need help to stay awake spiritually. 


46:41.548 --> 46:44.250
Help comes from our brothers and sisters. 


46:44.250 --> 46:46.253
The Bible says: 


46:46.253 --> 46:50.356
“Consider one another so as 
to incite to love and fine works,


46:50.357 --> 46:55.329
“not forsaking our meeting together, 
as some have the custom, 


46:55.328 --> 46:57.496
“but encouraging one another, 


46:57.497 --> 47:00.967
and all the more so 
as you see the day drawing near.”


47:00.967 --> 47:03.170
Now, here’s an example: 


47:03.170 --> 47:06.273
You’re driving a car at night, 
and it’s raining. 


47:06.273 --> 47:10.510
You can hear the rain hitting 
against the top of the car, 


47:10.510 --> 47:15.282
and you can hear windshield wipers 
slapping against the side of the windshield. 


47:15.282 --> 47:19.587
The lights from oncoming cars 
are somewhat blinding. 


47:19.587 --> 47:22.122
All these things are sleep-inducing. 


47:22.122 --> 47:25.525
You begin to nod; 
you’re about to fall asleep. 


47:25.525 --> 47:28.562
Your wife slaps you! 


47:28.562 --> 47:31.000
She’s sitting in the passenger seat. 


47:32.598 --> 47:35.201
She slaps you. 


47:35.202 --> 47:38.139
You regain control of yourself. 


47:38.138 --> 47:41.000
Aren’t you grateful for the slap? 


47:42.508 --> 47:45.000
She is. 


47:47.080 --> 47:49.717
Every meeting we attend is a slap 


47:49.717 --> 47:53.587
from Someone who loves us 
to keep us awake spiritually. 


47:53.587 --> 47:58.325
So be obedient; 
be there; be protected. 


47:58.325 --> 48:01.000
Your life depends on it.


48:12.772 --> 48:15.075
Thank you very much, Brother Herd. 


48:15.075 --> 48:18.545
Now, I don’t know about you, but I got 
at least two new points out of that.


48:18.545 --> 48:20.547
I wrote them down


48:20.547 --> 48:25.219
—don’t be thin-skinned, 
and be willing to be slapped. 


48:25.218 --> 48:28.821
Do you know
—I love that talk. 


48:28.822 --> 48:31.000
I used to give talks 
like that once too, 


48:34.360 --> 48:38.000
and then they made me the chairman. 


48:41.402 --> 48:57.335
I’m sorry, Brother Herd, 
I had to wait 12 months to say that.

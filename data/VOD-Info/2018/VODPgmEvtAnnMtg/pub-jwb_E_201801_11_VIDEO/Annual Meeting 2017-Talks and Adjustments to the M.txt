00:01 Well, now we look forward  to the next speaker.
00:04 This is Brother Stephen Lett,
00:06 also of the Governing Body.
00:07 He gives us the theme here:
00:10 “Never Give Up Much for Little.”
00:22 Jesus gave a parable about a young man
00:27 who exchanged peace and prosperity
00:30 in his father’s household
00:32 for a debauched, miserable, desperate life.
00:37 Foolishly
00:39 he exchanged much for little.
00:43 It’s the story of the prodigal son,  Luke chapter 15.
00:47 In contrast, in Matthew chapter 13,
00:50 Jesus gave a story about a traveling merchant
00:54 who sold everything he had
00:57 to buy one pearl of high value.
01:01 When we understand  the meaning of that parable,
01:04 in actuality
01:06 he exchanged a little for much.
01:09 Now, obviously you brothers and sisters
01:12 do not want to imitate the prodigal son.
01:15 You want to imitate the traveling merchant,
01:18 and Jehovah doesn’t want you
01:22 to give away much for little.
01:25 He wants you to give away little for much.
01:28 And Jehovah is anxious to give you this much.
01:32 That’s why he’s recorded parables
01:35 such as the two we just mentioned
01:37 and also real life stories in his Word
01:41 that depict both scenarios  so that we can be wise.
01:46 In fact, let’s briefly discuss
01:49 four Bible examples
01:51 of ones who foolishly  gave up much for little,
01:55 and then we’ll talk  about four Bible examples
01:58 of ones  who gave up little for much.
02:01 Our first example: Satan.
02:04 Now, Satan gave up a priceless,
02:07 honored position of trust  in Jehovah’s service
02:11 that he may have enjoyed
02:13 for aeons of time.
02:16 And what did he receive for what he gave up?
02:20 A relatively short,
02:22 miserable life of independence from Jehovah,
02:25 and ultimately  he will have earned for himself
02:29 the “lake of fire.”
02:31 We know right now  that Satan cannot be happy at all.
02:34 Jehovah is described as a “happy God”  (1 Timothy 1:11);
02:41 Jesus, the happy Potentate  (1 Timothy 6:15);
02:46 “happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah”  (Psalm 33:12),
02:52 but Satan is never described  as anything close to happy, is he?
02:56 He’s described as an enraged roaring lion,
03:00 an accuser who accuses day and night,
03:05 one who has great anger  because he knows his time is short.
03:08 Does that sound like a happy person?
03:11 But what caused Satan
03:14 to give up so much for so little?
03:17 Pride.
03:19 Pride actually caused him to think
03:21 that he was smarter than Jehovah.
03:24 Can you imagine that the clay  was smarter than the potter?
03:27 Pride caused him to think
03:30 that life without Jehovah  would actually be a better life.
03:34 Well, may we never pridefully feel
03:37 that we know better than Jehovah in any area
03:41 —for example,  how to treat disfellowshipped ones,
03:44 the need to avoid bad association,
03:47 marrying only in the Lord are a few examples.
03:50 May we never pridefully feel
03:53 that the so-called freedom  from Jehovah that the world offers
03:58 will bring happiness.
04:00 Let’s learn from Satan.
04:02 Never allow pride to cause you
04:05 to give up much for little.
04:09 Now our second example: Adam and Eve.
04:11 Satan offered them  opportunity to be like God,
04:15 his own aspiration.
04:17 And stupidly
04:20 —I mean stupidly—
04:22 they bought into his hoax.
04:26 They selfishly
04:29 gave up their invaluable family ties
04:32 with the best Father they could ever have.
04:35 They gave up their Paradise home,
04:37 perfect everlasting life,
04:39 their children’s future welfare.
04:42 All for what?
04:44 A relatively short,
04:46 miserable life of independence from Jehovah
04:49 and finally nonexistence
04:52 —a total loss.
04:54 What an outstanding example  of giving up much for little!
04:58 So may we learn from Adam and Eve.
05:01 Never allow Satan’s lies
05:04 to cause you to give up much for little
05:09 —lies such as  “Material things will make you happy”
05:13 or “Immorality will make you happy.”
05:16 Unlike Adam and Eve,
05:18 let’s refuse to allow Satan’s lies
05:21 to cause us to give up much for little.
05:24 Esau, our third example,
05:27 knew the history of Satan and Adam and Eve.
05:31 But did he learn from them?
05:33 No, he too lacked appreciation  for sacred things.
05:38 Esau was Isaac’s firstborn son,
05:41 and in Bible times,  this had great value,
05:43 but he thought only  of his immediate physical cravings.
05:48 Genesis 25:32 says
05:51 that he became very hungry and cried out:
05:53 “I am about to die!”
05:57 Was he really?
06:00 Should he not have endured  a little bit longer
06:04 rather than sell his birthright?
06:06 Now pretty quick, he realized his mistake.
06:09 He sold something with real value.
06:11 For what?
06:13 What did he receive?
06:15 Some bread and lentil stew.
06:17 Apparently, this stew  didn’t even have any meat in it.
06:24 We Bethelites,
06:27 we can get bread, lentils, and meat
06:30 for free in the Bethel pantry.
06:37 What is a lesson that we can learn from Esau?
06:40 Well, open up  to Hebrews chapter 12, please.
06:44 And here’s a very interesting lesson
06:46 Jehovah teaches us about Esau.
06:50 Hebrews 12:16:
06:52 “And watch that among you
06:55 “there is no one who is sexually immoral
07:00 “nor anyone who does not appreciate  sacred things,
07:04 “like Esau,
07:07 “who gave up his rights as firstborn
07:09 in exchange for one meal.”
07:13 But, you know, interestingly,
07:15 Jehovah compares a person  who commits sexual immorality
07:18 to what Esau did.
07:20 And if you think about it,  both lack self-control
07:24 and give in to fleshly desires.
07:26 That’s what Esau did.
07:27 That’s what a person  who commits sexual immorality does.
07:31 Well, may none of us allow immorality
07:34 to cause us to sell  our figurative birthright,
07:38 our inheritance in Jehovah’s new world.
07:40 And think about this:
07:42 How long did that bread  and lentil stew
07:45 last Esau?
07:47 How long did it benefit him?
07:49 A few hours?
07:51 Soon he would have been hungry again.
07:53 Well, similarly,  how long does
07:55 the so-called pleasure  of an immoral person last?
07:59 Only a short time  followed by horrible consequences,
08:03 including a bad conscience.
08:07 Now our fourth example:
08:09 the rich young ruler in Jesus’ day.
08:12 He held a high position  and had many possessions.
08:16 Jesus even felt love for him.
08:18 But was he prepared to give up his wealth
08:22 for something infinitely  more valuable and permanent,
08:26 the treasure of following Jesus?
08:28 No.
08:30 When Jesus invited him, the Bible says:
08:33 “He went away grieved.”
08:36 He couldn’t bring himself  to give up his many possessions.
08:40 Instead, he gave up a wonderful future.
08:43 Obviously, he gave up  the wrong thing, didn’t he?
08:46 Where are those who did follow Jesus now?
08:49 Immortal kings and priests
08:52 with Christ in heaven in Jehovah’s presence.
08:55 But unless that young ruler  later changed his ways,
08:59 he and all that was his are now dust.
09:05 What a classic example  of giving up so much for so little!
09:10 May we never allow
09:12 any of the material attractions of this world
09:17 to cause us to give up  our wonderful future
09:20 in Jehovah’s new world.
09:22 Well, we’ve considered  our four negative examples,
09:25 but now let’s move  to our four positive examples
09:29 —ones who gave up little for much.
09:31 First: Abraham.
09:33 At Jehovah’s invitation,
09:35 Abraham gave up a comfortable life
09:39 in upscale Ur.
09:42 At Jehovah’s invitation,
09:45 he took his family  on a long, dangerous trek
09:48 to the land of promise,
09:50 and there he willingly  lived the rest of his life in tents.
09:54 But what did Abraham  receive for what he gave up?
09:58 He gained a permanent place  in Jehovah’s heart.
10:02 Jehovah himself called him “my friend.”
10:06 Because of his faith, Jehovah swore
10:09 that through one of his descendants
10:12 all nations would be blessed
10:15 and that descendant —the Messiah, Jesus—
10:18 will soon resurrect Abraham
10:21 to enjoy the real life.
10:24 But now, are we willing
10:27 to give up material possessions and comforts
10:30 in order, for example,  to enter the full-time ministry?
10:33 Or maybe be able to move  and serve where the need is greater
10:36 in order to secure
10:38 a permanent place in Jehovah’s heart?
10:42 Like Abraham,
10:44 are we willing to give up little for much?
10:47 Our second example: Moses.
10:50 Centuries after Abraham,
10:53 Moses also gave up the right things.
10:56 Raised as royalty
10:59 in Pharaoh’s palace,
11:02 he was groomed for greatness  in the world of his day.
11:05 He knew all about Egypt’s  advanced civilization and culture.
11:10 But the Bible doesn’t elaborate on anything
11:14 that Moses accomplished in Egypt.
11:17 Why?
11:19 Because anything he may have achieved there
11:21 was utterly insignificant
11:24 compared to what he did  in Jehovah’s service.
11:27 Moses received the Law
11:29 that led Israel to the Messiah.
11:33 No other prophet knew Jehovah
11:36 “face-to-face.”
11:38 He did well in giving up life in Egypt
11:42 in order to carry out God’s commission.
11:45 As for the wealth and grandeur  of ancient Egypt,
11:48 we can see crumbling remnants of it
11:51 in museums.
11:53 But Moses gained God’s favor.
11:56 He gained the real life.
11:58 He gained a permanent place  in our spiritual heritage
12:03 and a permanent place  in all of our hearts.
12:07 Well, let’s go  to our third example: Jesus
12:11 —the best example  of gaining a lot more than he gave up.
12:14 Like Abraham and Moses,
12:17 he willingly gave up a comfortable life
12:20 —now in his case,  life in heaven alongside Jehovah.
12:24 But he emptied himself,  became a human,
12:27 ministered to other humans,
12:30 even gave his life
12:33 trusting that Jehovah  would give life back to him.
12:37 He gained the great joy
12:40 of fulfilling his Father’s righteous purpose
12:44 and redeeming those  he was especially fond of
12:47 —humans.
12:49 If you think about it,  apparently, Jesus didn’t really realize
12:53 how much he would receive  for what he gave up.
12:57 Because remember at John 17:5,
12:59 he said: “Father, glorify me . . .
13:02 “with the glory that I had alongside you
13:05 before the world was.”
13:07 In other words: ‘Father, please  give me back what I had before.’
13:12 But Jehovah gave him a lot more, didn’t he?
13:15 And that’s always true of Jehovah,  really, if you think about it.
13:18 You can’t outgive Jehovah.
13:20 Jehovah gave him a name  more excellent
13:24 than the angels.
13:27 Jehovah gave him all authority
13:30 in heaven and earth.
13:32 He even gave him immortality
13:36 and incorruption.
13:39 And we know that means  an indestructible life,
13:43 an indestructible organism, or body.
13:48 Now a fourth example:
13:50 Jesus’ apostles.
13:53 Peter, Andrew, James, and John
13:57 abandoned their fishing businesses, didn’t they?
14:00 All the other apostles,  the Bible says, “left all things.”
14:03 And remember, Peter asked: “Look!
14:06 “We have left all things and followed you;
14:09 what, then, will there be for us?”
14:12 Well, Jesus assured him
14:14 that anyone who gives up material things
14:17 or even family relationships
14:20 for him or for the sake  of the good news
14:22 would receive a hundredfold even now.
14:26 If you think about that,  that’s a 10,000 percent return.
14:31 Plus, he will get everlasting life.
14:35 In fact, think about it.
14:37 Where are these apostles now?
14:39 Like Jesus—immortal,  incorruptible spirit creatures.
14:43 Open up to Revelation chapter 20,
14:46 and notice what is said about these ones.
14:49 Revelation chapter 20, please,
14:52 and notice verse 6.
14:55 It says: “Happy [notice that word happy]
14:59 “and holy is anyone having part
15:03 “in the first resurrection;
15:05 “over these the second death  has no authority,
15:09 “but they will be priests  of God and of the Christ,
15:12 and they will rule as kings  with him for the 1,000 years.”
15:16 So they’re going to be happy  in their assignment.
15:19 This is assured in this scripture.
15:22 Why are they going to be so happy?
15:24 Acts 20:35: “There is more happiness  in giving than . . . receiving.”
15:29 And what an occasion  the thousand years will be for giving!
15:33 Can you imagine assisting humans
15:35 to transform the entire planet
15:39 into its originally intended condition?
15:41 Imagine working closely  with the Christ to empty the grave
15:46 and gradually helping humans
15:49 to come to perfection
15:51 and then,  after the thousand years,
15:54 being able to share in the final crushing
15:56 of evil Satan and his wicked demons.
15:59 What happifying work all of this will be!
16:03 But what will be  their main source of happiness?
16:06 Well, being part of the main instrument,  the Kingdom,
16:10 that Jehovah will use
16:12 to sanctify and vindicate his holy name.
16:30 I thought I’d go ahead and put to work
16:32 that new understanding  Brother Jackson revealed earlier.
16:36 But it’s true
16:38 to vindicate  Jehovah’s name, his reputation,
16:42 that will bring  the greatest happiness to them.
16:45 You can be sure
16:47 that when the apostles  gave up their little fishing businesses
16:50 and the other apostles  their worldly pursuits,
16:54 they had no idea
16:57 how much  they would receive in return.
17:00 Well, now we’ve discussed  Abraham, Moses, Jesus, the apostles.
17:05 And there’s no doubt about it,
17:07 they would all wholeheartedly agree  that what they gave up
17:10 was very small compared to what they gained.
17:14 Well, what about us?
17:16 We all give up things, don’t we,  great and small for Jehovah?
17:21 We may give up time,  energy, money, possessions.
17:24 We may have to give up a little face,  prestige in this world.
17:29 But we will experience
17:31 what all those good Bible examples did.
17:35 What we get back  always far outweighs any loss.
17:41 In fact, most of us would probably say
17:43 that we feel like  we haven’t given up anything.
17:46 We’re receiving, like those men of old,
17:49 a hundred times more now.
17:53 And we are sure to gain life,
17:57 the real life,
17:59 if we never give up much for little.
18:17 I’m sure we all totally enjoyed  that encouragement.
18:21 Well now, at this point,  you’re probably thinking that we said
18:24 there was an adjusted understanding:  got that one;
18:29 a lot of encouragement,  yes;
18:32 then there was the one  about the yeartext, yes.
18:35 What was the other one?
18:37 Well, we’ve come to the final talk.
18:39 If we don’t get it now,  it’s not going to come.
18:43 Remember, we said an adjustment  to the way we do our ministry.
18:48 So with eager anticipation,  we look forward to hearing
18:51 from Brother Anthony Morris
18:53 who will talk to us about  “Making Our Blows Count.”
19:09 We are involved  in the greatest preaching campaign
19:13 in all history.
19:16 We publish quality literature
19:21 in 240 lands.
19:23 It’s amazing.
19:25 However, we’re not about seeking praise
19:28 for the quality of our magazines
19:31 or the hundreds of languages
19:33 that we’re translating in.
19:36 What’s our focus?
19:38 Well, we want to imitate
19:41 what the apostle Paul wrote about himself.
19:44 And the Governing Body  really wants this message
19:48 to be clear to all of God’s people
19:51 who are preachers  and teachers of the Kingdom.
19:54 So find what I’m referring to
19:57 in 1 Corinthians chapter 9.
20:06 And you’ll remember
20:09 he’s describing  his pursuit of the prize.
20:13 And it’s quite profound  when you reflect on it.
20:17 And you’ll see where it fits everyone of us
20:19 that are dedicated to the true God.
20:21 Verse 26:
20:24 “Therefore,
20:26 “the way I am running is not aimlessly;
20:29 “the way I am aiming my blows
20:33 is so as not to be striking the air.”
20:38 So you can picture running aimlessly.
20:42 It’s a waste of time and energy
20:45 —striking the air,
20:48 a waste of time and energy.
20:53 So the time left is reduced.
20:57 The end is so close.
21:00 Like I’ve told folks, if you look around
21:04 and you don’t see how different it is and how close it is,
21:07 you must be in a coma.
21:09 And that’s OK.
21:11 God can bring you out of a coma
21:14 if you were all right before that.
21:17 But the Governing Body is concerned
21:20 that with the limited time  we have left
21:23 that we make our blows count.
21:27 So to truly make our blows count,
21:31 what should be the focus of our work?
21:35 We’re not left without knowing  how Jehovah thinks.
21:39 It’s been here all along.
21:42 But sometimes we can individually
21:45 and even organizationally get distracted.
21:48 Turn to Acts chapter 13
21:55 —Acts chapter 13.
21:58 And they were preaching  there in the first century,
22:00 and we get some results,
22:02 but we also get God’s thinking on the matter
22:06 and what he wants us to focus on.
22:10 Acts 13:48:
22:13 “When those of the nations  heard this [this message],
22:17 they began to rejoice  and to glorify the word of Jehovah.”
22:21 Now notice:
22:23 “All those who were rightly disposed
22:26 for everlasting life became believers.”
22:33 There it is.
22:35 That’s the focus of our work:
22:39 searching for those  “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
22:44 It’s not complicated.
22:46 And to try to help somebody  who’s not rightly disposed,
22:51 frankly, is a waste of time.
22:53 Now, we don’t read hearts.
22:55 We understand that people can change,  and we continue with that.
22:59 But overall, Jehovah wants us to understand:
23:02 Let’s search out
23:05 for those who are rightly disposed  for everlasting life
23:09 because no one comes to the truth,  remember, as Jesus taught us,
23:13 unless Jehovah draws him.
23:16 We don’t want to get  to thinking that our personality
23:20 draws people to the truth.
23:22 You might be likable.
23:24 That’s wonderful.
23:26 However, Jehovah draws  those rightly disposed.
23:30 And you become friends and such
23:32 if you have the privilege  to study with people.
23:35 But that’s what it’s about:
23:37 searching for those rightly disposed ones.
23:39 That’s who he draws.
23:41 Those who are righteously— He reads the heart.
23:46 And so we’re in this search work,
23:48 but we’re looking to focus  on those rightly disposed.
23:53 So with that clear,
23:56 the Governing Body  has identified two problems.
24:00 And this is what we want to pass on,
24:03 and it can adversely affect  our effectiveness in the ministry.
24:09 This is what we’re about:
24:11 a preaching and teaching organization.
24:13 This is who we are.
24:15 So for many years,  and we acknowledge it,
24:19 there was a focus on placing magazines,
24:23 developing magazine routes.
24:27 That helped some come  into the truth, no denying it,
24:31 because our literature  is the best on the earth.
24:34 Others have accepted our magazines
24:37 for many years,
24:41 many years,
24:43 and they’ve never  done a thing about the truth.
24:47 But they’re still going back.
24:50 You know, coming back  from a day of service,
24:53 “How many magazines did you place?”
24:56 Now, they mean well.  God loves us.
24:58 But excuse me,  that’s not the focus of our work.
25:04 It has to refocus on what we’re all about.
25:08 And just think about it,  Jesus commanded:
25:12 “Go, therefore, and make disciples  of people of all the nations.”
25:17 We don’t have the authority to change
25:20 what the head of the congregation has said
25:23 and go along the lines of,
25:25 ‘Go, therefore,  and place a lot of literature’;
25:29 that’s not our focus,
25:31 even though it’s the best on the planet.
25:34 We’re about searching  for the rightly disposed
25:38 so they can become disciples of Christ.
25:40 And you know, these ones
25:42 who have taken our literature for years
25:45 (and you know, as we said,  individuals might change)
25:49 they remind us of  what happened in Ezekiel’s day.
25:52 And some of you are Bible readers
25:56 —scholars, if you will—
25:58 but let’s read it anyway in Ezekiel 33
26:01 and find what he faced.
26:05 And we face this.  It’s a reality.
26:07 So given the limited time,
26:11 we have to make sure  that Jehovah’s spirit
26:14 is moving us this way,
26:16 and that we accept that this is the way it is
26:19 in our day as well.
26:22 Now notice verse 31  of Ezekiel 33:31, 32:
26:29 “They will crowd in  to sit before you as my people;
26:33 “and they will hear your words,  but they will not do them.
26:37 “For with their mouth they flatter you,
26:39 “but their heart  is greedy for dishonest gain.
26:42 “Look!
26:44 “You are to them like a romantic love song,
26:46 “sung with a beautiful voice
26:49 “and skillfully played  on a stringed instrument.
26:52 “They will hear your words,
26:55 but no one will act on them.”
26:59 That’s every territory.
27:03 And as you’ve worked it for many years,
27:05 you can have faces  come to mind just like that,
27:09 come to occasional meetings and such.
27:12 Well, time is running out.
27:15 God is making that very clear to us.
27:18 We need to help people come into the truth.
27:21 We don’t need the flattery and such
27:25 —that kind of experience.
27:27 This is a time for decision.
27:30 We’re looking for people  who will act on what they learn.
27:34 That’s where our blows  are going to be effective.
27:38 People have to act on it.
27:40 And if you’re not seeing that,
27:42 just get searching
27:44 and let the angels  and Jehovah’s spirit
27:47 take you to the rightly disposed ones.
27:50 And something that we forget,  our work is twofold.
27:54 We can forget that sometimes.
27:57 We’re searching and bringing in  the rightly disposed,
28:02 and the other is we’re praising  and honoring Jehovah,
28:06 like Brother Lösch mentioned,
28:08 because they’re hearing  about Jehovah’s judgment day.
28:11 So it’s twofold.  It’s a warning work.
28:13 You could go a whole morning
28:15 and not have what you thought  was an effective day
28:18 —no literature— but you praised God
28:21 because they’re still thinking  about Jehovah’s Witnesses
28:24 and your efforts to preach in that territory.
28:28 So we have to keep that in mind.
28:31 So that’s the one problem.
28:33 Here is problem two that we want to address.
28:39 We have so many tools  to use in the ministry;
28:43 it can be overwhelming and confusing
28:46 even to the best minds.
28:48 So you older ones, don’t feel:
28:51 ‘I’m slipping here.  I’m confused.’
28:54 No, the young ones are trying too,
28:57 often overwhelmed and confused.
29:00 So our Teaching Toolbox
29:02 that we emphasized in recent years,
29:05 what happened is  that it became a huge toolshed.
29:12 A lot of you are nodding your heads.
29:14 That’s OK.  That’s not disloyal.
29:16 It’s true.
29:18 It’s become a huge toolshed.
29:21 Now, we appreciate the sample presentations at the midweek meeting,
29:25 but frankly,  many of us are so busy
29:27 we can’t keep up with  all the latest presentations
29:31 no matter how good they are.
29:32 ‘Well, that was good.’
29:34 And then Saturday morning or Sunday:
29:36 ‘OK, what am I doing today?
29:39 ‘We had three of them  at our midweek meeting.
29:42 I don’t know,  what am I supposed to do here?’
29:45 And then if you get a critic nearby,
29:48 you know, ‘Oh, Lord.’
29:50 You know?
29:53 Plus many struggle to keep up
29:56 with reading all the magazines.
29:59 You’re not a bad person.
30:01 Jehovah loves you.
30:04 We understand.
30:07 So in view of this,
30:11 the Governing Body is adjusting
30:13 the focus of our ministry.
30:15 You’re getting the message;
30:17 we are addressing these two problems.
30:19 And we are 100 percent  with this, unanimous.
30:23 Everybody in the departments  connected are with it.
30:27 They can sense Jehovah’s spirit moving,
30:29 and this is what Jehovah’s doing.
30:31 It’s his chariot.  He’s the driver.
30:35 So here are the adjustments.
30:38 Starting January 2018,
30:41 there will only be  three public editions of The Watchtower.
30:52 For those who are tied in,
30:55 I heard some expressions down in front here.
30:58 I couldn’t help it.
31:00 Only three public editions of The Watchtower
31:03 and three of the Awake! magazines
31:06 —the whole year.
31:08 Yeah.
31:10 I’m excited too.
31:14 I really am.
31:16 Now—
31:18 And what’s beautiful about this,
31:20 they’re going to cover one subject  in the whole magazine
31:24 —start to finish—
31:26 one subject.
31:29 Now, I have here a hard copy
31:33 of the first one.
31:36 So I’m excited about it.
31:37 And mind you, these are special.
31:40 This one is special.  It’s the first one.
31:43 And Jehovah is moving it toward
31:45 those rightly disposed for everlasting life
31:48 because he knows his day and hour.
31:51 And this one
31:53 is quite easy  to start a conversation with,
31:56 and once you have a question,  you’re in a conversation already.
32:00 So whether it’s  “Get off my porch”
32:02 or they want to get involved  in the answering of that question,
32:07 it’s effective.
32:09 And the rightly disposed  are going to be intrigued.
32:12 The first one, this question here:
32:14 “Is the Bible Still Relevant Today?”
32:20 Certain territories, maybe not,
32:24 but there may be  righteously disposed ones there.
32:27 You have a nice cover picture
32:29 —a woman in the back reading her Bible  as the train is going by,
32:33 people distracted with their watches,  their phones, etcetera.
32:38 And then, on the inside
32:40 —and you’re going to become  familiar with this.
32:42 You got plenty of time to use it—
32:44 this tool, over and over.
32:46 Oh, yeah.  You’ll know right where to go.
32:49 You might decide, well,
32:51 I’ll go where it comments
32:53 “Outdated or Ahead of Its Time?”
32:56 depending on what  the person may have said.
32:58 You have that freedom.
33:00 So appropriate:  “Help to Avoid Problems,”
33:04 “Help to Resolve Problems,”
33:06 “Help to Cope With Problems.”
33:09 Boy, do people need that.
33:11 And those that are
33:13 rightly disposed for everlasting life
33:16 know they have problems.
33:18 They’re honest about it.
33:20 And so this will touch their heart,  and Jehovah will draw them.
33:24 Now, what’s nice about it
33:26 is that you’re going to be able  to get very familiar with it, use it,
33:30 and it’ll become part  of our permanent Teaching Toolbox.
33:36 And it’ll go in the Teaching Toolbox.
33:39 Even like these skilled craftsmen —they have their toolbox.
33:43 Why are they so good  at what they do in many cases?
33:46 Because they keep using these tools.
33:49 It’s not rocket science.
33:51 These are craftsmen with these tools.
33:54 “I need this; I need that,”
33:56 to accomplish what they need here.
33:58 So we only need so many tools in the box
34:01 —the ones that we can get  very good at using.
34:05 And what’s nice,
34:07 when it’s in a permanent  Teaching Toolbox there,
34:11 you’re not changing all the time.
34:14 And was all that sincere?
34:17 Yes, but I could tell you stories,
34:21 but time is running out,
34:23 of some of the things  I’ve heard out in the ministry.
34:25 And I could tell they never read that.
34:31 But they’re out there.  God love them.
34:34 They were knocking on doors with me.
34:36 You get familiar with the tool.
34:39 Now, what we’ll do is  we’ll evaluate after two years.
34:43 And it might be, we’ll see  what the Governing Body decides,
34:47 that we think we’ve got sufficient subjects
34:50 in the magazines for the toolbox,
34:53 and then we’ll just reprint
34:56 what’s already been written.
34:59 So you’ve got your tools.
35:02 Now, you’re going to get more details
35:04 on the Teaching Toolbox soon.
35:07 And you’ll also be pleased to know this
35:11 that (the brothers  have been working hard on this)
35:13 there’s going to be an update on the box
35:15 —Teaching Toolbox— and the JW Library.
35:18 And we love the JW Library.
35:21 It’ll be on the home page there.
35:23 It’ll be happening in the near future.
35:26 And this question will arise now  because territories are different.
35:30 We understand that.
35:32 What if you find that the Teaching Toolbox
35:35 doesn’t contain a tool that you have found effective in your territory,
35:39 like a video that you think is
35:42 and you’ve experienced effectiveness with it?
35:45 It’s OK.
35:47 Put it in your “Favorites” section.
35:49 That’s all.
35:51 Don’t write in and say,
35:53 “I think that should be  in the Teaching Toolbox.”
35:56 We’ve gone through  all of this at headquarters.
35:59 It’s OK.
36:01 But you go ahead and put it  in your “Favorites” section and use it.
36:05 Not a problem.
36:07 Not a problem.
36:09 Now, so that’s covered,
36:11 those with the preaching  and the focus of our ministry.
36:15 And there’s another adjustment
36:18 that I’ve been asked to announce here.
36:22 We all enjoy the latest reports  on the worldwide work
36:27 that we have on jw.org  and JW Broadcasting.
36:31 We love it.
36:33 And I know recently someone  told me they didn’t know about Venezuela.
36:38 It was on jw.org, but you don’t want  to try and make him feel bad.
36:43 But there’s so much we’re getting  all throughout the year,
36:47 and it’s timely and a blessing.
36:49 So with this in mind,  the Governing Body has decided
36:53 that with all of the information
36:55 on jw.org and JW Broadcasting,
36:59 that as of 2018,  we will no longer produce
37:03 the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
37:06 Especially if you’ve been  in the truth a long time,
37:08 yes, the 2017 is your last one.
37:12 So that’s historic.
37:14 But come on,
37:20 try to convince me  you’ve seen everything we’ve put
37:23 on jw.org and JW Broadcasting.
37:28 God is watching.
37:31 You’re well-fed.
37:33 You’ve got plenty there.
37:38 These latest developments  are indeed exciting.
37:42 And as the end fast approaches,
37:44 let’s honor Jehovah and make our blows count.
37:48 Let’s go forth and make disciples
37:51 of people that are righteously disposed
37:54 for everlasting life.
38:09 What an exciting announcement!
38:12 I don’t know about you,  I’m really excited about this
38:14 because we can see the end is so close.
38:18 And really, isn’t the main thing  that we should be thinking about
38:22 is helping people to know Jehovah?
38:24 That’s the prime goal.
38:26 So the Governing Body is helping us  to see how to have this toolbox.
38:30 We’re all looking forward  to seeing what’s in the toolbox.
38:33 In addition to that,
38:35 we’ve got a few  other announcements to make.
38:37 We’d like to inform you  of some changes
38:40 that are planned with regard  to the study edition of The Watchtower.
38:44 Now, since 2011,  in English we’ve been producing
38:49 two different versions  of the study edition.
38:52 We’ve had the standard edition  and the simplified.
38:56 And each of those  has filled a vital need.
38:59 However, in recent months  the Governing Body
39:03 has asked the Writing Committee  to investigate ways
39:06 to simplify the style  of the standard edition.
39:10 Additionally, the Governing Body  has approved a new design
39:15 for the standard edition,
39:17 which allows for a larger font style
39:20 and also has certain features  that are only in the simplified edition,
39:25 such as “Some Expressions Explained.”
39:28 So with this in mind,  the Governing Body has decided
39:32 as of January 1, 2019,
39:36 they are going to combine  both versions of the magazines.
39:39 This will not only simplify our work  but it will also be less confusing,
39:44 and we all will have  the same magazine that we’re using.
39:47 Now, you’ll be interested to note
39:49 that many of the larger languages
39:52 that were producing two editions
39:54 —languages such as Spanish,  Portuguese, French, and Italian—
39:58 have recently already  combined their editions,
40:01 trying to simplify the language  used in their standard edition.
40:05 And this has been very successful.
40:08 We will continue to produce  an electronic version
40:11 of the English simplified magazine,
40:14 and that will be used mainly by translators
40:17 to help them to make sure their translation
40:20 is still clear and understandable.
40:22 Now, in addition,
40:24 we’d like to let you know  that early next year
40:28 we’ll be receiving a new publication,
40:31 and it will be one of the ones
40:33 that we use in the toolbox.
40:36 It is called How to Remain in God’s Love.
40:41 And you see it here on the screen.
40:43 It’s 256 pages,
40:46 and it uses the same simplified style
40:49 as the Teach Us book.
40:51 So it’s going to replace
40:54 the current “God’s Love” book.
40:56 These two publications,
40:58 that is, How to Remain in God’s Love
41:00 and the Teach Us books
41:02 will be used in the toolbox
41:05 for helping students to become disciples.
41:08 Now, you look forward to getting that.
41:18 Well, I know we’ll be going away from here,
41:21 our minds and hearts spinning around
41:23 thinking of all the interesting changes  and developments.

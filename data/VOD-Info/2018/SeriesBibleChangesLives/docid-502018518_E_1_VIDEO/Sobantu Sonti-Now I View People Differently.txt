00:00:07 ‎My name is Sobantu Sonti.
00:00:14 ‎I grew up in Guguletu, Cape Town,
00:00:16 ‎where I serve as a congregation elder.
00:00:22 ‎I love the people I associate with now,
00:00:25 ‎but I wasn’t always like this.
00:00:31 ‎I had no love for people.
00:00:33 ‎I viewed them only as a way to get rich,
00:00:35 ‎by stealing their possessions.
00:00:40 ‎I was a violent person,  always on the edge of anger.
00:00:44 ‎I used drugs, and I belonged to a gang.
00:00:50 ‎We were violent thugs.
00:00:58 ‎We lived a very destructive life.
00:01:03 ‎In 1989,
00:01:05 ‎my mother started associating  with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:09 ‎I noticed her making changes in her life.
00:01:13 ‎Previously, she sold alcohol  in the community illegally,
00:01:17 ‎but then she stopped.
00:01:20 ‎So one Thursday,  I followed her to see where she was going.
00:01:25 ‎I was touched to see a boy there  who read the Bible really well.
00:01:31 ‎I wanted to be able to do that too.
00:01:34 ‎So after the meeting,  I approached a brother,
00:01:37 ‎and he said  that I first needed to study the Bible.
00:01:40 ‎And that’s how we started the Bible study.
00:01:44 ‎I continued studying,  but I struggled to make changes.
00:01:51 ‎I was still involved in a lot of bad things,
00:01:54 ‎and this caused me to stop the study
00:01:57 ‎because I knew I had to clean up my life first.
00:02:10 ‎During the years that I did not study,
00:02:13 ‎I never stopped thinking about the Bible.
00:02:19 ‎Isaiah 40:8 has very touching words that say:
00:02:24 ‎“The green grass dries up, the blossom withers,
00:02:27 ‎but the word of our God endures forever.”
00:02:31 ‎That scripture resonated with me.
00:02:34 ‎It helped me to trust in the Bible  and made me want to read it.
00:02:40 ‎The book that helped me  to make spiritual progress
00:02:43 ‎was the Revelation Climax book,
00:02:45 ‎which Jehovah’s Witnesses  were studying back then.
00:02:48 ‎It thoroughly explained
00:02:51 ‎the Bible book of Revelation, and that convinced me
00:02:54 ‎that whoever wrote this book could not have done it on their own,
00:02:58 ‎but they must have been influenced  by God in order to explain it so well.
00:03:03 ‎That book helped me to change my life
00:03:06 ‎and to be sure that this was the truth.
00:03:09 ‎Four years had passed  since I stopped studying.
00:03:13 ‎But in January 1995, I made a decision.
00:03:17 ‎One Sunday, I woke up,
00:03:19 ‎I got ready, and I went to the meeting.
00:03:22 ‎I made rapid progress
00:03:25 ‎and was baptized in September, 1995.
00:03:28 ‎And six months later,
00:03:30 ‎I was appointed  as a full-time teacher of the Bible.
00:03:34 ‎Now I view people differently.
00:03:37 ‎I see them as people  who deserve a better life.
00:03:41 ‎Even if a person  appears unable to change,
00:03:45 ‎the Bible can teach a person dignity  and change his life for the better.
00:03:52 ‎Now I view people  as those who could be
00:03:55 ‎my spiritual friends —my brothers.

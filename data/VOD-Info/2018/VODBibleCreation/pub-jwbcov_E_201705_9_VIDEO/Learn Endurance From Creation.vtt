00:03.720 --> 00:05.722
How does a camel survive 


00:05.722 --> 00:08.817
in this harsh environment? 


00:08.817 --> 00:11.219
Jehovah has uniquely equipped 


00:11.218 --> 00:14.733
the camel for desert life. 


00:14.733 --> 00:19.000
What is inside the camel’s famous hump? 


00:19.000 --> 00:22.605
It’s mostly fat. 


00:22.605 --> 00:25.642
A healthy camel’s hump 
can weigh 36 kilograms, 


00:25.642 --> 00:28.529
or 80 pounds. 


00:28.528 --> 00:32.000
It can draw on this fat reserve 
when food is limited.


00:33.898 --> 00:37.268
When given an opportunity, 
a thirsty camel 


00:37.268 --> 00:41.083
can drink up to 95 liters, 
or 25 gallons, of water 


00:41.083 --> 00:43.091
in just a few minutes. 


00:43.092 --> 00:46.129
Yet, their bodies lose little moisture, 


00:46.128 --> 00:48.898
even in extreme heat. 


00:48.898 --> 00:51.600
As a result, they can go weeks 


00:51.600 --> 00:55.798
or even months without drinking water. 


00:55.798 --> 00:58.201
The camel’s impressive ability 


00:58.202 --> 01:01.204
to absorb and conserve 
nourishment and water 


01:01.203 --> 01:06.000
enables it to endure. 


01:09.885 --> 01:12.355
High in the mountains of North America, 


01:12.355 --> 01:16.000
living conditions 
are unfavorable for most plants. 


01:17.527 --> 01:19.695
Yet, the bristlecone pine 


01:19.695 --> 01:23.833
not only survives 
but can thrive at some 3,000 meters, 


01:23.833 --> 01:26.000
or 10,000 feet, above sea level. 


01:27.748 --> 01:31.000
These remarkable trees 
can live for thousands of years.


01:33.932 --> 01:37.000
One key to their survival 
lies in their roots. 


01:39.448 --> 01:43.185
Shallow branching roots 
spread out and gather up 


01:43.185 --> 01:46.582
as much water as possible. 


01:46.582 --> 01:49.152
Large, strong roots 


01:49.152 --> 01:53.000
firmly anchor the trees 
against intense winds. 


01:54.898 --> 01:57.501
These remarkable trees are designed 


01:57.502 --> 02:01.000
to make the most 
of a challenging environment. 


02:03.732 --> 02:05.734
As a result, 


02:05.733 --> 02:07.735
they are among the oldest living organisms 


02:07.735 --> 02:10.000
on the planet.


02:20.067 --> 02:24.332
Butterflies play 
a vital role in pollinating flowers.


02:24.332 --> 02:29.282
They also accomplish 
amazing feats of endurance.


02:29.282 --> 02:31.815
Each year in North America, 


02:31.815 --> 02:34.752
as many as 300 million monarch butterflies 


02:34.752 --> 02:38.055
complete a migration 
of some 4,000 kilometers, 


02:38.055 --> 02:40.323
or 2,500 miles, 


02:40.323 --> 02:42.325
from as far north as Canada 


02:42.325 --> 02:45.432
to a forest in Mexico. 


02:45.432 --> 02:49.000
Butterflies are also surprisingly resilient. 


02:50.982 --> 02:54.352
Some butterflies 
have been observed feeding and flying 


02:54.352 --> 02:58.000
with up to 70 percent 
of their wing surfaces missing. 


03:00.015 --> 03:04.000
Butterflies may appear 
to be delicate and fragile, 


03:05.220 --> 03:10.000
but these small creatures 
display remarkable endurance. 


03:21.265 --> 03:24.835
As its name suggests, 
most arctic terns 


03:24.835 --> 03:28.840
breed in the earth’s far northern regions, 
where they take advantage 


03:28.840 --> 03:31.000
of the short Arctic summer 
to feed and raise chicks. 


03:35.048 --> 03:37.316
But as winter approaches, 


03:37.317 --> 03:40.154
they fly south 
to the Antarctic region, where they greet 


03:40.153 --> 03:43.000
the arrival of summer 
in the Southern Hemisphere.


03:44.898 --> 03:48.745
When summer ends, 
they return to the Arctic, 


03:48.745 --> 03:53.000
completing the longest-known 
annual migration of any animal.


03:54.983 --> 03:58.988
What guides the arctic tern 
to reach its destination? 


03:58.988 --> 04:01.723
Scientists believe that the arctic terns 


04:01.723 --> 04:03.948
can sense the earth’s magnetic field 


04:03.948 --> 04:05.945
and use it for orientation. 


04:05.945 --> 04:09.482
But how they do this still remains a mystery. 


04:09.482 --> 04:13.552
Jehovah has given the arctic tern 
an accurate means of guidance 


04:13.552 --> 04:18.000
to complete its long journey. 


04:22.748 --> 04:27.283
The blacksmith lapwing, or plover, 
is found in Africa. 


04:27.283 --> 04:32.198
It nests on the ground, often near water. 


04:32.198 --> 04:34.600
Its choice of nest location 


04:34.600 --> 04:38.982
can bring it in contact 
with much larger animals. 


04:38.982 --> 04:40.984
When its nest is threatened, 


04:40.983 --> 04:43.000
the lapwing sounds the alarm. 


04:46.535 --> 04:49.038
Sometimes a lapwing will attempt 


04:49.038 --> 04:52.215
to draw an intruder away from its nest. 


04:52.215 --> 04:56.718
At other times, 
the bird will courageously stand its ground, 


04:56.718 --> 05:00.448
spreading its wings and crying harshly. 


05:00.448 --> 05:03.798
Lapwings have been known to attack humans 


05:03.798 --> 05:06.968
and square off against elephants and buffalo, 


05:06.968 --> 05:08.970
at times giving the larger animal 


05:08.970 --> 05:12.613
a sharp strike with its beak. 


05:12.613 --> 05:16.701
Jehovah gave the lapwing 
the instinctive courage 


05:16.702 --> 05:22.000
to protect its young, 
enabling it to survive. 


05:26.075 --> 05:30.000
Very little rain falls 
in the arid wilderness of Sinai. 


05:31.432 --> 05:33.567
One of the few types of trees 


05:33.567 --> 05:36.000
to grow here is the acacia. 


05:37.953 --> 05:40.556
The wood of the acacia tree is dense, 


05:40.557 --> 05:44.282
hard, and resistant to insects. 


05:44.282 --> 05:48.965
Some types of acacia trees 
are protected by thick bark 


05:48.965 --> 05:52.682
and long, sharp thorns.


05:52.682 --> 05:56.705
Acacia trees often grow closely together. 


05:56.705 --> 06:00.008
The branches of some acacias 
interlock together, 


06:00.008 --> 06:02.211
forming dense canopies. 


06:02.212 --> 06:05.765
Other acacias grow in tangled thickets. 


06:05.765 --> 06:08.267
These natural defenses 


06:08.267 --> 06:16.042
help the acacia tree to endure.

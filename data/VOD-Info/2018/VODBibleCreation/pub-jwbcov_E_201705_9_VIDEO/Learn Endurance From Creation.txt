00:03 How does a camel survive
00:05 in this harsh environment?
00:08 Jehovah has uniquely equipped
00:11 the camel for desert life.
00:14 What is inside the camel’s famous hump?
00:19 It’s mostly fat.
00:22 A healthy camel’s hump  can weigh 36 kilograms,
00:25 or 80 pounds.
00:28 It can draw on this fat reserve  when food is limited.
00:33 When given an opportunity,  a thirsty camel
00:37 can drink up to 95 liters,  or 25 gallons, of water
00:41 in just a few minutes.
00:43 Yet, their bodies lose little moisture,
00:46 even in extreme heat.
00:48 As a result, they can go weeks
00:51 or even months without drinking water.
00:55 The camel’s impressive ability
00:58 to absorb and conserve  nourishment and water
01:01 enables it to endure.
01:09 High in the mountains of North America,
01:12 living conditions  are unfavorable for most plants.
01:17 Yet, the bristlecone pine
01:19 not only survives  but can thrive at some 3,000 meters,
01:23 or 10,000 feet, above sea level.
01:27 These remarkable trees  can live for thousands of years.
01:33 One key to their survival  lies in their roots.
01:39 Shallow branching roots  spread out and gather up
01:43 as much water as possible.
01:46 Large, strong roots
01:49 firmly anchor the trees  against intense winds.
01:54 These remarkable trees are designed
01:57 to make the most  of a challenging environment.
02:03 As a result,
02:05 they are among the oldest living organisms
02:07 on the planet.
02:20 Butterflies play  a vital role in pollinating flowers.
02:24 They also accomplish  amazing feats of endurance.
02:29 Each year in North America,
02:31 as many as 300 million monarch butterflies
02:34 complete a migration  of some 4,000 kilometers,
02:38 or 2,500 miles,
02:40 from as far north as Canada
02:42 to a forest in Mexico.
02:45 Butterflies are also surprisingly resilient.
02:50 Some butterflies  have been observed feeding and flying
02:54 with up to 70 percent  of their wing surfaces missing.
03:00 Butterflies may appear  to be delicate and fragile,
03:05 but these small creatures  display remarkable endurance.
03:21 As its name suggests,  most arctic terns
03:24 breed in the earth’s far northern regions,  where they take advantage
03:28 of the short Arctic summer  to feed and raise chicks.
03:35 But as winter approaches,
03:37 they fly south  to the Antarctic region, where they greet
03:40 the arrival of summer  in the Southern Hemisphere.
03:44 When summer ends,  they return to the Arctic,
03:48 completing the longest-known  annual migration of any animal.
03:54 What guides the arctic tern  to reach its destination?
03:58 Scientists believe that the arctic terns
04:01 can sense the earth’s magnetic field
04:03 and use it for orientation.
04:05 But how they do this still remains a mystery.
04:09 Jehovah has given the arctic tern  an accurate means of guidance
04:13 to complete its long journey.
04:22 The blacksmith lapwing, or plover,  is found in Africa.
04:27 It nests on the ground, often near water.
04:32 Its choice of nest location
04:34 can bring it in contact  with much larger animals.
04:38 When its nest is threatened,
04:40 the lapwing sounds the alarm.
04:46 Sometimes a lapwing will attempt
04:49 to draw an intruder away from its nest.
04:52 At other times,  the bird will courageously stand its ground,
04:56 spreading its wings and crying harshly.
05:00 Lapwings have been known to attack humans
05:03 and square off against elephants and buffalo,
05:06 at times giving the larger animal
05:08 a sharp strike with its beak.
05:12 Jehovah gave the lapwing  the instinctive courage
05:16 to protect its young,  enabling it to survive.
05:26 Very little rain falls  in the arid wilderness of Sinai.
05:31 One of the few types of trees
05:33 to grow here is the acacia.
05:37 The wood of the acacia tree is dense,
05:40 hard, and resistant to insects.
05:44 Some types of acacia trees  are protected by thick bark
05:48 and long, sharp thorns.
05:52 Acacia trees often grow closely together.
05:56 The branches of some acacias  interlock together,
06:00 forming dense canopies.
06:02 Other acacias grow in tangled thickets.
06:05 These natural defenses
06:08 help the acacia tree to endure.

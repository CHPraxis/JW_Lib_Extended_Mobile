00:06 In 1946, the first missionaries  arrived in Peru,
00:11 and the good news spread quickly  in the Spanish field.
00:15 However, centuries of mistreatment  caused many Quechua-speaking people
00:20 to regard outsiders  with reservation and mistrust.
00:24 Over the decades,
00:27 interested ones had to study in Spanish  in order to learn the truth,
00:30 even if it wasn’t their first language.
00:33 It’s true that many Quechua speakers  also understand Spanish;
00:38 it’s the language commonly used  in business and taught in school.
00:43 However, it was noted that although  they understood the words we were teaching,
00:48 the Bible’s message  didn’t easily reach the heart.
00:53 The good news still had to be preached
00:55 not only in every nation
00:57 but to all “tribes and peoples and tongues.”
01:01 In 1992, the branch office  in Peru received permission
01:06 to translate literature into Quechua
01:08 and to start a preaching initiative  to test the response in the field.
01:13 When Quechua speakers were approached
01:15 with a warm greeting and presentation
01:17 in their own language,
01:18 it made a remarkable difference.
01:29 People started responding favorably  to the message,
01:32 and many Bible studies were started.
01:50 Gradually, translators realized  that it was necessary
01:54 to translate into other Quechua languages.
01:57 Just as there are a variety  of cultures within Peru,
02:00 there are also a variety  of Quechua languages spoken.
02:04 Translation teams were established  where three of these languages are spoken
02:07 —in Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Huaraz.
02:15 In 2013, permission was granted to build
02:19 two new remote translation offices
02:21 —one in Cuzco and another in Ayacucho.
02:24 Many local and international brothers
02:27 volunteered to help on the building projects.
02:30 Whether rain or shine,
02:32 they worked together with a joyful spirit.
02:45 By early 2016,  the new offices were ready to operate.
02:51 On May 1, 2016,
02:54 Brother Geoffrey Jackson  of the Governing Body
02:57 delivered the dedication talk  of these new facilities
03:00 to a delighted audience
03:02 from around the country.
03:04 We promise to use  these buildings exclusively
03:08 for Jehovah’s praise and glory.
03:12 Do you accept our resolution?
03:26 These facilities are like gifts from Jehovah.
03:32 Not only are the new offices  clean and beautiful
03:36 but they are specifically designed  for the translation work.
03:41 One of the most important features  of the new offices, therefore,
03:45 is the audio recording studio,
03:47 equipped with a special soundproof room
03:52 where high-quality recordings are produced.
04:11 Children and older ones alike
04:13 are captivated  by videos of Juancito and Anita,
04:18 the Quechua version of Caleb and Sophia.
04:22 Just as when a tree grows and flourishes
04:25 when provided with an ample supply of water,
04:28 congregations  have been growing and being fortified
04:32 by an increasing flow of spiritual food
04:34 in their own language.
04:38 This great ingathering of the Quechua people
04:41 to Jehovah’s organization
04:44 truly contributes to the fulfillment  of the prophecy at Revelation 7:9:
04:49 “Look! A great crowd, . . .  out of all nations
04:52 “and tribes and peoples and tongues,
04:54 “standing before the throne
04:57 and before the Lamb.”

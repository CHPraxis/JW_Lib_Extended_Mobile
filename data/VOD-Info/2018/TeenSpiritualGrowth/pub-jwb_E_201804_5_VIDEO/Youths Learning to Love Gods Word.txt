00:03 I often put it off until later.
00:06 So I come home in the evening tired,
00:08 and I like to relax.
00:09 Well, very often,
00:10 I was tired for many different reasons,
00:12 and that is why I didn’t have the motivation
00:14 even to start Bible reading  in the first place.
00:16 I also had many phases
00:18 where it was really tough
00:20 to stick it out with Bible reading.
00:22 Especially in the age of social media,
00:25 there are many other things  you can fill your day with.
00:28 One hobby that mainly got in the way
00:31 was watching movies.
00:33 I really spent a lot of time on that.
00:35 This often steals precious time  you could have made better use of.
00:39 So something that moved me
00:42 was the thought that through Bible reading,
00:44 you’re actually talking with Jehovah.
00:46 You pray to him, and he  is then answering you through the Bible.
00:50 As Jehovah promised, he can give us  both the power and the desire to act.
00:54 I just pray to Jehovah, please,  to first give me the power to read
00:58 and then the desire follows.
01:01 Then I decided  to simply start and stick with it.
01:05 I started with reading my favorite book,
01:07 and that way it was easier for me.
01:10 Well, I started with Genesis  just to get through the whole Bible.
01:15 My favorite Bible book is Esther.
01:18 And because I think  she was a very special person,
01:21 it was especially then that I could imagine
01:23 what her situation was like  and what kind of a person she was
01:27 and I could see myself in the account.
01:31 The weekly Bible reading program  has been such a guideline.
01:35 It’s motivating since we discuss  this content at the meetings,
01:38 and I could use the study aids  in our workbook too.
01:41 You can better relate  to the brothers’ and sisters’ comments
01:43 because you’ve read the material yourself,  and I can comment too.
01:48 When I’m reading the Bible  in the JW Library app on my phone,
01:52 there is, of course,  the risk that it vibrates,
01:54 and I get a message.
01:56 And then, of course, you have the urge  to check to see who just wrote me.
01:59 For me personally, then, it’s really helpful
02:02 when I put my phone in airplane mode
02:04 so that I can really focus  on what I’m reading
02:07 and nothing can distract me.
02:11 I like reading at home,  but I also like to do it outdoors
02:15 because I think that’s  where you’re closest to Jehovah.
02:18 I never just read about the events  that are described in the Bible,
02:22 but I ask myself questions like:
02:24 ‘Why did Jehovah have this written down?
02:26 What is in there for me personally?’
02:28 This helps me to stay focused  and not just scratch the surface;
02:32 otherwise, my mind  would immediately start wandering.
02:36 At a convention,  I learned something that helps me
02:38 to really take in the things I read.
02:40 The point discussed  was to remember to look
02:42 in four different directions  when meditating, so to speak.
02:46 First, look upwards  to find out exactly what I am learning
02:51 from the text about Jehovah;
02:53 then downwards to find out  what it teaches me about his purpose,
02:58 about what he wants for the earth;
03:00 then look at myself,  how I can personally benefit now;
03:05 and eventually towards others,
03:07 thinking about how I can help other people
03:09 with this particular Bible text.
03:13 In the JW Library app, there are  four different colors for highlighting text,
03:18 so I simply use a different color  for each of the four directions
03:22 and highlight them  on my tablet or smartphone.
03:27 For example, one of my hobbies is drawing.
03:30 I decided, one time,  that I was going to draw
03:33 the spiritual suit of armor,  all of its different parts
03:35 and their symbolic meanings.
03:37 And this especially helped me  to actually see the benefit of it,
03:41 to see how many wonderful resources  Jehovah provides us with
03:44 and that he never leaves us alone.
03:47 Another thing  I like very much is the category
03:50 “Bible Study Activities”  where you can directly pick a topic
03:53 that you personally find interesting
03:55 and then read that.
03:56 It’s Jehovah’s Word.
03:58 I love him and also want  to please him, of course.
04:00 That’s why it’s very important  to understand his Word.
04:04 It feels really good when you’ve understood
04:06 a difficult phrase by doing it this way.
04:08 It actually makes you feel  like you’ve achieved something,
04:11 and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah.
04:14 It happens often that you don’t even know  what you should pray about
04:19 or what you could thank Jehovah for.
04:22 My personal Bible reading  has helped me with this a lot
04:25 because now I know exactly  what I want to tell Jehovah.
04:27 Daily Bible reading is very important to me
04:31 as it gives me some sort  of inner balance when I face situations
04:34 that may be unfamiliar or shake me up.
04:38 I know that no matter what the problem is,
04:40 Jehovah always has the right answer prepared.
04:44 At the beginning, it is really hard.
04:46 You have to fight to keep it up,  and you definitely need discipline.
04:50 But after a while,  you truly start to enjoy it
04:53 and it gets easier and easier
04:55 and you’re happy  that you started in the first place.
04:57 I really think that when Jehovah sees  how much effort you put into it,
05:02 he is genuinely proud of you,
05:04 and that’s the best thing  that can happen to you.

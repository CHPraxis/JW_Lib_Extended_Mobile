00:03.982 --> 00:06.235
I often put it off until later. 


00:06.235 --> 00:08.403
So I come home in the evening tired, 


00:08.403 --> 00:09.488
and I like to relax. 


00:09.488 --> 00:10.738
Well, very often, 


00:10.738 --> 00:12.406
I was tired for many different reasons, 


00:12.407 --> 00:14.494
and that is why I didn’t have the motivation 


00:14.493 --> 00:16.495
even to start Bible reading 
in the first place. 


00:16.495 --> 00:18.955
I also had many phases 


00:18.955 --> 00:20.457
where it was really tough 


00:20.457 --> 00:22.765
to stick it out with Bible reading. 


00:22.765 --> 00:25.003
Especially in the age of social media, 


00:25.003 --> 00:28.090
there are many other things 
you can fill your day with. 


00:28.090 --> 00:31.385
One hobby that mainly got in the way 


00:31.385 --> 00:33.387
was watching movies. 


00:33.387 --> 00:35.847
I really spent a lot of time on that. 


00:35.847 --> 00:39.852
This often steals precious time 
you could have made better use of. 


00:39.852 --> 00:42.104
So something that moved me 


00:42.103 --> 00:44.188
was the thought that through Bible reading, 


00:44.188 --> 00:46.191
you’re actually talking with Jehovah. 


00:46.192 --> 00:50.570
You pray to him, and he 
is then answering you through the Bible. 


00:50.570 --> 00:54.908
As Jehovah promised, he can give us 
both the power and the desire to act. 


00:54.908 --> 00:58.120
I just pray to Jehovah, please, 
to first give me the power to read 


00:58.120 --> 01:01.498
and then the desire follows. 


01:01.498 --> 01:05.001
Then I decided 
to simply start and stick with it. 


01:05.002 --> 01:07.129
I started with reading my favorite book, 


01:07.128 --> 01:10.340
and that way it was easier for me. 


01:10.340 --> 01:15.428
Well, I started with Genesis 
just to get through the whole Bible. 


01:15.428 --> 01:18.431
My favorite Bible book is Esther. 


01:18.432 --> 01:21.602
And because I think 
she was a very special person, 


01:21.602 --> 01:23.979
it was especially then that I could imagine 


01:23.978 --> 01:27.691
what her situation was like 
and what kind of a person she was 


01:27.692 --> 01:31.945
and I could see myself in the account. 


01:31.945 --> 01:35.032
The weekly Bible reading program 
has been such a guideline. 


01:35.032 --> 01:38.369
It’s motivating since we discuss 
this content at the meetings, 


01:38.368 --> 01:41.288
and I could use the study aids 
in our workbook too. 


01:41.288 --> 01:43.956
You can better relate 
to the brothers’ and sisters’ comments 


01:43.957 --> 01:47.000
because you’ve read the material yourself, 
and I can comment too. 


01:48.462 --> 01:52.257
When I’m reading the Bible 
in the JW Library app on my phone, 


01:52.257 --> 01:54.552
there is, of course, 
the risk that it vibrates, 


01:54.552 --> 01:56.554
and I get a message. 


01:56.553 --> 01:59.931
And then, of course, you have the urge 
to check to see who just wrote me. 


01:59.932 --> 02:02.810
For me personally, then, it’s really helpful 


02:02.810 --> 02:04.853
when I put my phone in airplane mode 


02:04.853 --> 02:07.105
so that I can really focus 
on what I’m reading 


02:07.105 --> 02:11.152
and nothing can distract me. 


02:11.152 --> 02:15.072
I like reading at home, 
but I also like to do it outdoors 


02:15.072 --> 02:18.534
because I think that’s 
where you’re closest to Jehovah. 


02:18.533 --> 02:22.286
I never just read about the events 
that are described in the Bible, 


02:22.287 --> 02:24.289
but I ask myself questions like: 


02:24.288 --> 02:26.416
‘Why did Jehovah have this written down? 


02:26.417 --> 02:28.544
What is in there for me personally?’ 


02:28.543 --> 02:32.255
This helps me to stay focused 
and not just scratch the surface; 


02:32.255 --> 02:35.000
otherwise, my mind 
would immediately start wandering. 


02:36.052 --> 02:38.595
At a convention, 
I learned something that helps me 


02:38.595 --> 02:40.805
to really take in the things I read. 


02:40.805 --> 02:42.850
The point discussed 
was to remember to look 


02:42.850 --> 02:46.853
in four different directions 
when meditating, so to speak. 


02:46.853 --> 02:51.275
First, look upwards 
to find out exactly what I am learning 


02:51.275 --> 02:53.443
from the text about Jehovah; 


02:53.443 --> 02:58.406
then downwards to find out 
what it teaches me about his purpose, 


02:58.407 --> 03:00.909
about what he wants for the earth; 


03:00.908 --> 03:05.496
then look at myself, 
how I can personally benefit now; 


03:05.497 --> 03:07.792
and eventually towards others, 


03:07.792 --> 03:09.960
thinking about how I can help other people 


03:09.960 --> 03:13.380
with this particular Bible text. 


03:13.380 --> 03:18.385
In the JW Library app, there are 
four different colors for highlighting text, 


03:18.385 --> 03:22.555
so I simply use a different color 
for each of the four directions 


03:22.555 --> 03:27.102
and highlight them 
on my tablet or smartphone. 


03:27.102 --> 03:30.564
For example, one of my hobbies is drawing. 


03:30.563 --> 03:33.316
I decided, one time, 
that I was going to draw 


03:33.317 --> 03:35.902
the spiritual suit of armor, 
all of its different parts 


03:35.902 --> 03:37.905
and their symbolic meanings. 


03:37.905 --> 03:41.117
And this especially helped me 
to actually see the benefit of it, 


03:41.117 --> 03:44.829
to see how many wonderful resources 
Jehovah provides us with 


03:44.828 --> 03:47.496
and that he never leaves us alone. 


03:47.497 --> 03:50.375
Another thing 
I like very much is the category 


03:50.375 --> 03:53.045
“Bible Study Activities” 
where you can directly pick a topic 


03:53.045 --> 03:55.047
that you personally find interesting 


03:55.047 --> 03:56.882
and then read that. 


03:56.882 --> 03:58.342
It’s Jehovah’s Word. 


03:58.342 --> 04:00.594
I love him and also want 
to please him, of course. 


04:00.593 --> 04:04.346
That’s why it’s very important 
to understand his Word. 


04:04.347 --> 04:06.559
It feels really good when you’ve understood 


04:06.558 --> 04:08.893
a difficult phrase by doing it this way. 


04:08.893 --> 04:11.771
It actually makes you feel 
like you’ve achieved something, 


04:11.772 --> 04:14.274
and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah. 


04:14.273 --> 04:19.236
It happens often that you don’t even know 
what you should pray about 


04:19.237 --> 04:22.699
or what you could thank Jehovah for. 


04:22.698 --> 04:25.076
My personal Bible reading 
has helped me with this a lot 


04:25.077 --> 04:27.955
because now I know exactly 
what I want to tell Jehovah. 


04:27.955 --> 04:31.708
Daily Bible reading is very important to me 


04:31.708 --> 04:34.670
as it gives me some sort 
of inner balance when I face situations 


04:34.670 --> 04:38.173
that may be unfamiliar or shake me up. 


04:38.173 --> 04:40.425
I know that no matter what the problem is,


04:40.425 --> 04:44.345
Jehovah always has the right answer prepared.


04:44.345 --> 04:46.765
At the beginning, it is really hard. 


04:46.765 --> 04:50.393
You have to fight to keep it up, 
and you definitely need discipline. 


04:50.393 --> 04:53.480
But after a while, 
you truly start to enjoy it 


04:53.480 --> 04:55.482
and it gets easier and easier 


04:55.482 --> 04:57.819
and you’re happy 
that you started in the first place. 


04:57.818 --> 05:02.488
I really think that when Jehovah sees 
how much effort you put into it, 


05:02.488 --> 05:04.825
he is genuinely proud of you, 


05:04.825 --> 05:33.458
and that’s the best thing 
that can happen to you.

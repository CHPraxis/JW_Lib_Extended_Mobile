00:00:15 In my professional career, I thank Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:20 They made a traditional doctor like myself
00:00:23 consider the possibility and importance of reducing the use of blood.
00:00:28 I believe that you —not you as people but as a clinical set-up—
00:00:33 have greatly changed my attitude
00:00:36 and thereby also that of my collaborators.
00:00:44 I have lengthy clinical experience of over 30 years.
00:00:47 And in my clinical experience,
00:00:49 I have never had any such cases
00:00:52 —neither in my experience as a medical examiner
00:00:54 nor have my colleagues ever had them.
00:00:57 I don’t think it is correct to say
00:00:59 that someone will die because they didn’t accept blood.
00:01:02 It’s an exceedingly complex situation and should be considered
00:01:05 on a case-by-case basis.
00:01:07 Blood, anyway, has risks,
00:01:10 so even a transfusion carries a high level of risk to the patient.
00:01:13 We have to evaluate risks versus benefits.
00:01:16 As a doctor, I believe that a patient who comes well-prepared
00:01:20 for a surgical operation or to give birth has a minimal risk.
00:01:24 We can’t exclude it.
00:01:26 But then again, we can’t exclude a death following a transfusion.

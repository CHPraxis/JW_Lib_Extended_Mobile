00:01 This is the January 2018 edition  of JW Broadcasting.
00:05 Welcome, one and all.
00:27 As Mark Noumair explained last month,
00:29 the Governing Body
00:30 has approved the annual meeting
00:31 of the Pennsylvania Corporation
00:33 to be broadcast each year
00:35 as a monthly JW Broadcasting program.
00:39 In this way,  more translation teams around the world
00:42 will have the resources  to make this program available
00:45 to viewers in many more languages.
00:48 This annual meeting was indeed special.
00:51 It was held on October 7, 2017.
00:55 Since it also included the dedication  of many United States branch buildings
01:00 and the dedication  of the world headquarters complex,
01:03 it was presented from the Bethel auditorium
01:05 in Warwick, New York.
01:08 Brother Geoffrey Jackson  of the Governing Body was the chairman.
01:12 The monthly program you’re about to see
01:14 consists of the dedication-related aspects  of the event.
01:18 I’m sure you will enjoy the program.
01:22 We’re going to start off  by asking you a question.
01:25 In fact,  the Governing Body has directed me
01:27 to ask the English-speaking brothers  this question: What if?
01:32 What if during Brother Smalley’s prayer,
01:36 he said,
01:38 ‘And we pray  for the vindication of your name?’
01:41 How would you have reacted?
01:43 ‘Oh, no!  I feel sorry for Gene.’
01:49 Well, it’s true  that in English over the years,
01:51 we have tended to be very careful,  haven’t we,
01:54 about saying  the sanctification of Jehovah’s name
01:59 and the vindication of his sovereignty?
02:02 But is it necessarily wrong for us to say
02:06 that Jehovah’s name could be vindicated?
02:09 Well, back in 1965, the Awake! magazine  answered that yes, it would be wrong.
02:13 Then in 1995, The Watchtower made the point
02:17 —it reemphasized— it said no one is questioning Jehovah’s name,
02:22 so there’s no need to vindicate that name.
02:26 But the more we look at this subject,
02:28 the more we see a need  to adjust our understanding,
02:31 particularly in English.
02:33 So let’s think about the words  associated with this problem.
02:37 First of all, “sanctify” —what does “sanctify” mean?
02:41 Well, it means “to make holy,”  or to treat something as holy.
02:45 And it’s very appropriate, isn’t it,
02:47 that we pray  for the sanctification of Jehovah’s name?
02:50 That’s exactly what Jesus told us to do:
02:52 “Let your name be sanctified.”
02:54 So you can relax.
02:55 There’s no change with regard to that.
02:58 But what about the word “vindicate”?
03:01 Well, “vindicate”  usually indicates exonerating or proving
03:05 that someone is correct  in something they’ve done.
03:08 Perhaps they’re being criticized,
03:10 and then they’re proved  to be true, or correct.
03:14 And what about the word “name”?
03:17 Does it just refer  to an identification or a label?
03:22 Well, that’s usually not  the case in the Bible, is it?
03:25 It often times  refers to the reputation of the person,
03:29 not just their identifying name or label.
03:33 For example,  at Proverbs 22:1, it tells us:
03:37 “A good name is to be chosen  rather than great wealth.”
03:41 Now in that case,
03:43 “name” is referring to the reputation  of the person.
03:47 So let’s think for a few minutes.
03:50 What really has Satan criticized  down through time?
03:55 Well, first of all,  he has criticized Jehovah’s reputation
04:00 —his name.
04:02 And secondly, he has criticized  the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty or,
04:07 in other words, his way of ruling.
04:10 So, really, both of these things,
04:13 Jehovah’s reputation and his way of ruling,
04:17 need to be vindicated.
04:19 Satan has tried to besmirch  the holy name of Jehovah in many ways.
04:24 One way is by painting him  as a vengeful, harsh God.
04:29 Or in the churches of Christendom,
04:32 believing that he is a God  that burns people in a fiery hell.
04:37 Or in the Scriptures,  we see him implying that Jehovah is a liar
04:41 who holds back  good things from his creatures.
04:45 Well, in that case, we can see  that Jehovah’s name, or reputation,
04:49 does need to be exonerated or,  in other words, vindicated.
04:54 So in summary,
04:56 Jehovah’s sovereignty  certainly needs to be vindicated
05:00 as we’ve always said,
05:02 but also his name as a loving God
05:05 —his reputation— needs to be vindicated.
05:08 So it’s not wrong for us to say
05:11 that these actions  of vindicating Jehovah’s sovereignty
05:15 and vindicating his name
05:17 lead to the sanctification of his name.
05:21 Now at this point, you’re trying to think:  ‘What does that mean?’
05:24 Simply put,  it’s not wrong to say
05:28 that we pray  for the vindication of Jehovah’s name
05:32 because his reputation  certainly needs to be exonerated.
05:36 And what a privilege  we have to be a part of that.
05:40 Well, what a way to start  the annual meeting right off the block
05:44 —a new understanding.
05:46 So this is how we’re going to start,  with the chairman saying a few words.
05:50 What else is on the program?
05:52 Well, we are looking forward  to seeing what we can enjoy.
05:57 Well, when we think of this matter  of the dedication program,
06:01 I’m sure you  do appreciate that it’s impossible
06:05 for us to tell every story  of every experience
06:10 of how our brothers and sisters  have seen Jehovah’s hand help them,
06:15 either in their personal lives  or in the actual construction work.
06:19 In just a few moments time,  we’re going to have an opportunity
06:23 to see a specially prepared video  that will tell us some of those stories.
06:28 But this video  is mainly designed to tell us
06:32 about what happened  with the construction here at Warwick.
06:36 But before we start to watch the video,
06:39 the Governing Body asked me
06:41 to express appreciation on their behalf
06:44 for a very special group  of brothers and sisters.
06:49 Who are we talking about?
06:51 Well, those thousands  of brothers and sisters
06:54 who were working  on all the other projects
06:57 that were being either built or renovated
07:01 at the same time as the Warwick project.
07:03 So sometimes we focus on Warwick,
07:05 but all these other brothers and sisters
07:08 were likewise making similar sacrifices,
07:11 and some of those projects were huge.
07:14 For example, Wallkill:
07:16 Over 1.1 million square feet (102,193 sq m)  of facilities
07:20 were either built or renovated  or remodeled at Wallkill,
07:25 and 302 residence rooms were added.
07:29 This required 25,000 sheets  of drywall to be hung
07:34 and over 451,000 feet (137,465 m)
07:38 of electrical wire cables to be installed.
07:41 Additionally, new office space  was made for 240 people.
07:46 Now, when they added up  how many brothers and sisters
07:49 actually helped  with just the Wallkill project,
07:52 they came up with a figure  of over 6,000 different individuals.
07:57 Then the brothers, at one stage,
07:59 started a Saturday work program
08:02 that was designed to give  extra help to the project.
08:06 And the Bethelites,  who have other assignments
08:09 and who in their spare time
08:11 offered to give  this extra help on a Saturday,
08:14 numbered 1,544
08:17 —and they put in  over 10,000 hours of work.
08:21 Then we had 937 outside volunteers
08:24 from 20 different states  here in the United States
08:28 who contributed some 18,000 hours.
08:31 So a lot of work went into renovating  and building there at Wallkill.
08:36 But what about the quality of the work there?
08:39 Was it any less?
08:41 No.
08:42 In fact, the F Residence  and the Wallkill Office Building
08:46 received the highest award  of Four Green Globes
08:49 from the Green Building Initiative  —that’s the GBI.
08:54 That was back in 2015.
08:58 Now at that time,  a project manager of GBI said:
09:01 “Of the 23 buildings in the United States
09:04 “that have been certified  with Four Green Globes since 2006,
09:09 “the Watchtower Wallkill Office Building
09:12 achieved the highest point score  with 94 percent.”
09:17 Now, of course, since 2015,
09:19 other buildings have also received
09:22 these Four Green Globes.
09:25 But remember,  also among those buildings
09:28 that have received it  are all seven buildings here at Warwick.
09:33 Well, we could go on and on  about Jehovah’s blessings
09:36 with regard to the Wallkill project.
09:38 But let’s just take one example:
09:40 the Wallkill chiller project  that started in December of 2010.
09:46 It was critical, the brothers tell us,
09:48 to get the new chillers operational
09:50 no later than the first week  of the following July.
09:54 But there was a problem  because they wanted to make sure
09:57 the presses would continue to operate.
10:00 This is how one of the brothers  expressed what happened, he said:
10:04 “By mid-June,”  now remember by July
10:07 they had to have  the chillers up and running,
10:09 “things started to get critical  because of the lack of response
10:13 “from the specialists  from the chiller fabricator.
10:17 “The Purchasing Department called repeatedly
10:20 “but were unable to get a commitment
10:23 from the fabricator to meet our deadlines.”
10:25 So, what did the brothers do?
10:27 Well, they made it a matter  of fervent and urgent prayer.
10:31 What happened?
10:33 The brother continues:
10:34 “A few days later,
10:35 “I received a phone call telling me
10:37 “that there was a man  from the chiller fabricator
10:40 “waiting for me in the main lobby.
10:42 “He wanted to quickly see  our start-up schedule and our installations,
10:47 “and then give us a list  of things we needed to complete.
10:50 “We explained that everything was ready,
10:53 “and we needed to begin  the start-up in two weeks.
10:57 “Well, he went for a visit.
10:59 “As he walked through the factory,  he was amazed.
11:03 “He said that he  has never seen an installation
11:06 “in all the 20 years  that he has been doing this
11:08 that was ready to start on the first visit.”
11:12 Then, as he was continuing to be amazed,
11:15 he said to the brother:
11:17 “Let me know who your insulators are.
11:20 I want to hire them.”
11:24 Well, the brother said  —very wisely—
11:26 that he didn’t tell him until later
11:28 that most of the work was done by sisters,
11:31 many of whom had no experience at all.
11:35 We didn’t tell him that  because we didn’t want him
11:38 to steal them away to other projects.
11:40 The brother then goes on to say
11:42 that eventually he got  enough courage to ask him,
11:44 “Well, what caused you  to actually come to the lobby that day?”
11:49 Well, the man said  that he’d received an urgent trouble call
11:53 from another customer  in a nearby town,
11:56 so he decided  he’d just stop by Watchtower on the way.
12:00 He then said,
12:01 “The trouble call  turned out to be a false alarm.”
12:05 Well, the chiller started on schedule
12:07 and everything  was operating according to plan.
12:10 So that’s just one of many.
12:12 Now believe me,
12:14 they sent me reams  of papers of experiences
12:18 and those that I didn’t use,  please forgive me.
12:22 But over and over again,
12:24 we see the brothers expressing  how they appreciated the opportunity
12:29 to work on the Wallkill project  as well as the other projects,
12:32 and how they saw  Jehovah’s hand blessing them
12:35 —as many of them sold homes,  simplified their lives,
12:39 or put their lives on hold  so that they could be here with us.
12:43 So to all those brothers and sisters
12:45 who were working  on all the peripheral projects,
12:49 we want to say to you:  “Thank you.
12:51 Thank you  from the bottom of our hearts.”
13:09 But now we have  an opportunity to watch a video
13:12 that’s going to have  an interview with the CPC.
13:15 Who are the CPC?
13:17 The Construction Project Committee  who organized the work here at Warwick.
13:26 Isaiah 40:12 gives us a glimpse
13:29 into the power and the breadth  of Jehovah’s hand.
13:33 Remember, that’s where  it says that Jehovah holds
13:35 all “the waters  in the hollow of his hand.”
13:37 He can measure the universe  “with a span of his hand.”
13:41 And while this is figurative,  it helps us to appreciate
13:44 what Jehovah can accomplish to make sure his will takes place.
13:48 Well, when we look  at the beautiful Warwick project,
13:51 we truly see that Jehovah’s hand  was involved in what took place there.
13:56 Now, last year, you remember  at the annual meeting,
13:58 we had the interview  of the five brothers
14:00 who made up  the Construction Project Committee.
14:03 And those brothers  were the ones who oversaw
14:06 and coordinated  the work of that project,
14:08 and they explained how  the Warwick project took place.
14:12 Well, this year  at this special dedication program,
14:15 we are again going to interview  these dear brothers,
14:18 and this time they’re going  to tell us their experiences
14:22 and other experiences  that they had that convince them
14:24 that Jehovah’s hand was in this project.
14:27 Well, we’ve got some  really touching experiences
14:29 to relate about ones who really sacrificed
14:32 in order to volunteer on the project
14:34 and how their families supported them.
14:36 They’re really going to be beautiful.
14:38 And we also have some  good experiences in regards
14:40 to how the work was accomplished  and seeing Jehovah’s hand in it.
14:45 And lastly, we’re going to see  how Jehovah’s hand
14:47 was really shown even in nonbelievers
14:50 and what they experienced  and how the work was accomplished.
14:53 Let’s get started with the aspect of how
14:55 those who came to work  on the project saw Jehovah’s hand.
14:58 And I think, Rich, you had  an overarching comment
15:01 that really convinced you of this.
15:03 Despite challenging weather, long commutes,
15:06 difficult living situations, and hard jobs,
15:10 our brothers manifested  the fruitage of the spirit.
15:12 You could see that at work,  and you knew Jehovah was working with them
15:16 and motivating their work, and it really made  the project something very special.
15:20 One couple had decided
15:23 that with their circumstances  and their finances,
15:26 that for a maximum,  they could come and work
15:28 for three weeks on the project —which they did.
15:31 But during the third week,  they were asked
15:33 if they could possibly extend  to a fourth week.
15:36 So they prayed to Jehovah:  “Please just give us joy;
15:39 “help us not to have anxiety about this.
15:41 “Even though our finances will be at zero,
15:44 we want to stay the fourth week.”
15:47 They did.
15:48 They went on their way home,  back to the airport,
15:50 and at the departure gate,
15:52 there was an announcement  that the flight was overbooked.
15:55 They were looking for volunteers  to take a later flight,
15:57 and in compensation the airline
16:00 would give a very significant amount of cash.
16:03 Well, they took the cash —no longer had their finances at zero.
16:07 But that’s not where  they felt Jehovah’s hand.
16:09 They felt it that last week  —the joy while they were working
16:13 and not having the anxiety  over what the final outcome might be.
16:17 I’ll never forget the night  that Troy called our room
16:20 and said that one of our volunteers  that was going to be arriving—
16:25 They were fixing a tire alongside  the road back at their home,
16:29 and the brother’s young wife  was holding the flashlight.
16:34 A car veered off the road, hit her,  and killed her right in front of him.
16:37 Yeah, he’d already been invited  and already scheduled to come.
16:40 But when this happened,  we didn’t expect him to come,
16:43 and we reassured him that it’s OK  to stay back and handle matters.
16:46 But he was determined to come.
16:48 What was amazing was to see how  Jehovah helped him during that time.
16:51 His overseers that were assigned  to care for him
16:54 and the department he worked with,  they rallied to him.
16:57 And in the end, he says he felt  that this experience
17:00 helped him to recover  emotionally, spiritually,
17:04 and he saw Jehovah’s blessings in it.
17:06 And it gave him pure evidence  that Jehovah’s promises will come true.
17:13 A brother came for a week,  but his wife was back home
17:17 with very serious health problems.
17:19 The wife told her husband:
17:21 “You must go.
17:23 “You must go.
17:25 This is the way I can make  a sacrifice to the project.”
17:29 So seeing Jehovah’s hand on sisters like that
17:33 and their self-sacrificing spirit,
17:36 it made us feel like those sisters  were right there working on the project.
17:40 As we got into the project,  as it became evident
17:43 that this project  really was only going to get done
17:45 as a result of Jehovah’s spirit,
17:47 we saw our brothers transform themselves.
17:51 They recognized that we were,  first and foremost, spiritual men.
17:56 We needed Jehovah’s blessing.
17:58 So before a meeting started,
18:00 the brothers would get together  and say a prayer.
18:03 It was clear to everyone
18:04 that it was only going to be  as a result of Jehovah’s spirit
18:07 that this project  was going to get done.
18:09 These overseers  quickly became known,
18:12 not for their trade skills,  but for being shepherds.
18:16 They looked out for the brothers and sisters;  they cared about them.
18:20 So as a committee, we assigned  shepherding calls to ourselves
18:23 —three to four a month—
18:25 and along with other shepherding  within our departments.
18:29 But you would see these  dear brothers and sisters
18:31 come in at the end of the day
18:33 for a shepherding call  —dirt or grease from head to toe, cold,
18:38 gloves on, ear warmers,
18:41 huge smiles.
18:43 You could just feel  that Jehovah was just lifting us up
18:46 and moving us along for another day.
18:48 It was quite an experience.
18:49 It was as if Jehovah was telling us,  ‘Spirituality is more important
18:54 —and each other— than accomplishing the work.’
18:57 And that really helped us to see  where our priorities should be.
19:00 We found that as long as we  looked out for the friends
19:03 —spiritually and emotionally— as best we could,
19:05 they did far and above anything  we could have ever hoped for.
19:09 It really was a wonderful example
19:11 —how they responded  to a spiritual atmosphere.
19:13 Troy,  how about the local brothers and sisters?
19:15 They had a good share too.
19:17 Yeah, the local brothers and sisters  in the congregations
19:20 surrounding the project  were tremendous.
19:23 Quite a few would come  early in the morning
19:24 to help guide the buses  to their parking spots,
19:28 to provide safe walkways,  to direct traffic and parking.
19:32 And they would get up very early —freezing cold temperatures.
19:36 They would work, have breakfast,  and then they would have to go off
19:39 to their secular work  and take care of their daily lives.
19:42 It was really a good example  of self-sacrifice.
19:44 Another thing that they did,  which was just outstanding,
19:48 is that we had up to 700 trips
19:51 to the airport on a given weekend
19:54 —volunteers coming, volunteers going.
19:56 And it was constant for years at a time,
19:59 and yet most of those airport runs were done
20:03 by our local friends,  even using their own vehicles.
20:06 Now, you brothers  poured yourselves out on the project.
20:09 You personally saw  Jehovah’s hand
20:11 helping you just when  you needed it the most.
20:13 Could you share a few of those experiences?
20:15 I remember an instance  where we were meeting
20:18 with a Governing Body member  on something else.
20:22 And in the conversation,  it just lent itself to the question,
20:27 ‘Just what was it that made him  or the rest of the Governing Body
20:32 so convinced that this project  was going to get done on time?’
20:36 And he explained
20:39 that during the acquisition of the property,
20:41 they had established terms in the acquisition
20:44 that for them was sort of a coal test.
20:47 And Jehovah fulfilled the test
20:50 exactly as they expected.
20:53 And from that point on,  he mentioned that he himself
20:57 and every one of the members  of the Governing Body
21:01 were firmly convinced
21:03 that it was Jehovah’s will  to move from Brooklyn to Warwick.
21:06 I needed to transmit that confidence
21:09 to the brothers on the project as well.
21:11 We were getting ready  to step off the bridge, so to speak,
21:15 on some big decisions that we  weren’t going to be able to retract;
21:19 big dollars  that were going to be spent
21:21 for product that we  weren’t going to be able to send back.
21:24 We needed more faith.
21:27 I can remember two instances in particular
21:29 where I personally was discouraged,  and you could kind of see it in our family.
21:34 In both those times, a Governing Body  member showed up unscheduled
21:38 and visited and made  personal expressions to us
21:42 —expressions to the family—
21:43 and it was just what we  needed to keep us going.
21:46 But now,  let’s change thought a little bit.
21:48 We also talked  about how you saw Jehovah’s hand
21:51 in how the work was accomplished.
21:53 Jehovah caused our brothers to become
21:57 not only good tradesmen
21:59 but world-class, expert tradesmen.
22:02 It was very common to see them  take off their hard hats
22:05 and say a group prayer.
22:07 They realized it was a part of their worship
22:10 and it facilitated Jehovah’s hand
22:12 to be expressed through their work as well.
22:14 Didn’t you notice, Rick,
22:16 they felt a real need to have
22:18 Jehovah’s spirit to be able to do  what they needed to do.
22:20 So they would look for an opportunity to pray
22:24 before they tried to accomplish something.
22:27 That feeling that they really cared
22:29 and that it was part of their  worship was even reflected
22:32 in the prayerful attitude  with which they went about the work.
22:36 We would often inform  the family of a difficult challenge
22:39 or problem that we were facing,  either as a committee or as a project.
22:43 We would ask them to pray about it.
22:45 And they would come back and tell us,  “I’ve been praying about this.”
22:49 And then we would hear that their families  back home were praying about it.
22:53 And we would regularly get cards and letters
22:57 from the field, family worship projects
23:00 —the kids would draw pictures  and send them to us.
23:02 And they put care packages  —hundreds of them—together.
23:06 We even got cards and letters  from all over the world
23:09 —Japan, Australia, and Europe.
23:12 One sister from Europe sent  about 65 pounds (30 kg)
23:16 of Swiss chocolate  for the family to enjoy.
23:18 And Rick, do you remember  our infamous Friday afternoon
23:22 design, coordination,  and construction meeting?
23:25 Every time after prayer,  we’d start the same way:
23:28 “We don’t have what we need, brothers,  to work next week.
23:32 We don’t have sufficient enough drawings.”
23:36 Rick would be there working;  he’d be back and forth
23:39 e-mailing with other ones;  he’d be getting stuff sent in.
23:42 We would conclude that meeting  at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday
23:45 every time with:  “You know what?
23:48 We have enough  to work until next Friday.”
23:51 And there, poor Rick,  we’d go again
23:53 the following Friday,  and we’d start back up again.
23:55 But Jehovah would give us  what we needed as if he was telling us:
23:59 ‘Don’t worry.  I’ve got this.
24:01 I’ve got it under control.  Just keep working.’
24:04 You also mentioned  some comments regarding the use
24:07 of the construction groups  and how that came about.
24:10 We had the most qualified people
24:13 you could ever find there  —ready to go to work.
24:17 We simply didn’t have enough of them.
24:19 It was a matter of numbers.
24:21 And so the committee charged a couple of us
24:26 to look in and see what we could do
24:29 to mobilize the nation in an organized way.
24:32 All we had was a Saturday afternoon.
24:35 And I thought, ‘This isn’t enough time;  you can’t organize this effort.’
24:38 We sat down at 1:30 p.m.
24:40 By 3:00 p.m.,
24:42 what would become known  as the Warwick Construction Group effort
24:46 —Jehovah built it!
24:48 He laid it out in front of us  how each building would be cared for.
24:51 Yeah, did we adjust a few things  as we went along?
24:53 Absolutely!  But that was the framework.
24:56 We divided the country up  into 11 different areas.
24:58 We appointed three brothers in each area  that would help to identify
25:01 the volunteers and bring them  —reach out to the volunteers,
25:04 tell them we need them,  explain the work ahead of time.
25:06 And it really was an amazing arrangement.
25:09 Of the 27,000 volunteers that we had on-site,
25:14 21,000 were organized and sent to Warwick
25:17 by these 11 construction groups.
25:19 So they would do any initial training
25:22 that they needed to do and get organized
25:24 so that they could come to Warwick  and hit the ground running.
25:27 Do you remember when we had  the challenge with pipe insulation?
25:31 How many miles of pipes do we have?
25:35 Hundreds of miles of pipes to insulate.
25:38 That was a trade that really didn’t exist  among the brotherhood in the United States
25:42 —at least not nearly  the number we would need.
25:45 And so our construction group brothers said:
25:47 “Well, how hard can it be?
25:50 We’ll put on training programs.”
25:52 And so one or two, I think, came to Bethel;  saw how it was done.
25:56 The group started putting on training  in the field
25:59 at a Kingdom Hall or at a brother’s home.
26:02 And they trained about 2,000 volunteers
26:05 on how to do pipe insulation —mostly sisters.
26:08 And they did all of that work,
26:11 and they did a really professional job at it.
26:15 I think that also speaks
26:17 of the role  the sisters played on our project.
26:19 The ones that were assigned there.
26:21 The ones in the field that were coming in.
26:22 They played a tremendous role.
26:24 We saw Jehovah’s spirit on them  in helping us resolve problems,
26:28 in accomplishing the work,  and so forth.
26:29 So with our training programs  and orientation,
26:32 the brothers quickly understood
26:35 that safety and spirituality  is a personal expression
26:39 between them and Jehovah, first.
26:41 Safety is a spiritual value.
26:43 It’s something that we owe  our brothers and sisters;
26:46 we owe our families;  we owe to Jehovah, who is the Source of life.
26:50 We had many nonbelievers  involved on this project.
26:53 How did they even get to see  Jehovah’s hand in this?
26:56 We were meeting with different officials  on a particular aspect of the project,
27:00 and we had a bit of a difference  of opinion as to what would be needed.
27:06 But we really were not able
27:08 to reach an agreement with the officials.
27:11 At that point,  we realized that taking the secular,
27:15 technical approach wasn’t going to work.
27:18 We pushed the plans aside,  said a silent prayer,
27:23 and then just asked the officials:
27:25 “What can we do to address your concerns?
27:28 What would you like to see us do?”
27:31 That changed the tone of the discussion.
27:33 It changed  from a technical-based discussion
27:36 to “We’re here  to work together as neighbors,
27:40 to come to a common accord.”
27:42 And we eventually worked out  a compromise that met their concerns.
27:45 A few weeks later,
27:46 we were back in front of the same officials
27:49 but on a totally different subject.
27:51 But before we could even present  what we were there to talk about,
27:54 they stopped us  and they just wanted to commend us
27:57 for how good  the last meeting we had went.
28:00 And we were looking at each other  because we didn’t think it went that well.
28:03 But they pointed out how
28:05 they felt that they were dignified
28:08 and they really appreciated  the way we worked with them.
28:12 And so it became clear  to us that this project
28:15 wasn’t entirely  about technical issues,
28:18 but really about manifesting  Jehovah’s hand
28:21 through the fruitage of the spirit  as we dealt with the officials.
28:26 We had a fuel truck that was  in a local shop getting repaired.
28:31 And a fuel truck is critical for our project
28:34 because at four o’clock in the morning,
4:30 a.m., our brothers are out there to fuel
28:37 the equipment so we can get  the work done that day.
28:39 They called to go pick it up  and the gentleman told them:
28:42 “Sorry, we’re closed.  Well, what project are you on?”
28:44 We said, “Well,  we’re with the Warwick project here
28:46 with Jehovah’s Witnesses,  with Watchtower.”
28:48 He goes: “Oh, Watchtower.  Oh, no problem.
28:50 “I’m going to leave the gate open;  I’m going to show you where the keys are;
28:53 I’ll have it there for you,  and you can take the vehicle.”
28:56 He said, “I trust you people.”
28:58 One of the bus drivers,  he showed up late one morning,
29:00 and then he explained  why he was late.
29:03 He had been assigned  the wrong bus that morning,
29:05 and his dispatcher made him  come back and switch buses.
29:08 He said:  “I was so mad at him.
29:10 “I told him:  ‘These people are working for God.
29:13 “‘They’re not getting paid;
29:14 they have to get to work on time;  they have to do this work.’”
29:17 He then told the friends, he said:
29:18 “I know I’m going to be  one of Jehovah’s Witnesses one day.
29:21 I’m going to serve my God, Jehovah.”
29:24 And then he sat down,  and he drove the friends to work.
29:26 A brother was out in the ministry.
29:27 He knocks on a gentleman’s door.
29:29 The gentleman comes to the door,  and he starts his presentation,
29:31 and the gentleman interrupts him  and says, “Have you been to Warwick?”
29:34 And the brother steps back:  “Well, no. No one’s allowed at Warwick.
29:36 It’s under construction.”
29:38 He goes:  “No, I’ve been there.
29:40 “I worked there,  and it was very clean, organized,
29:42 “and the people were  the friendliest people I have ever seen.
29:45 It was the best experience of my life  to work on that project.”
29:49 One of the jobs  was to pull in this main feeder,
29:53 this main electrical line into the complex —very technical piece.
29:57 And so we had that scheduled  for December 24,
30:01 and there was a little bit of an aversion  on the part of the contractors
30:04 that wanted to be able to monitor  when this was going in.
30:07 And we said: “No, I’m sorry,  this is the date we need to do this.
30:10 We’re on a day-to-day schedule  that we need to accomplish.”
30:13 “Well, who’s going to do it?”
30:14 “Well, as you know,  we use women a lot on this site,
30:17 and this is a crew of sisters.”
30:18 “Well, I can’t believe that.
30:20 “That’s a heavy line,  and that can’t be striking the ground.
30:23 It’s fragile until it gets into the conduit.”
30:24 And he said:  “Well, I wasn’t working tomorrow.
30:27 I’m going to call my wife,  and I’m going to come in tomorrow anyway.”
30:30 Sure enough, he came in  and spent a couple of hours there.
30:33 Our sisters, as usual, did phenomenal work —pulled the line in, got it done.
30:37 Do you remember how long  it took them to do the work?
30:39 Two hours!  They had it pulled in.
30:41 Two hours, yeah, it was just phenomenal.
30:44 He just shook his head and went home.
30:46 We hired the largest contractor  in that part of New York State
30:49 to perform a significant amount  of work on-site.
30:52 And toward the end of the project,  the head of that company told us, he said:
30:56 “When you first came to us and you described
30:59 “what you were going to build  and the size of it,
31:01 “and then you told us the schedule  that you were hoping to meet,
31:05 and then you told us you  were going to do it with volunteers,”
31:07 he said, “we were happy  to take your money.
31:10 “But when you left,  we were literally laughing at you.
31:13 “We knew there was  no way you could ever do
31:16 “this much construction  in that short of a time
31:19 “—let alone with volunteers— and that this was going to be a disaster.
31:22 We’re not laughing anymore.”
31:24 So they could see Jehovah’s hand  on that project.
31:27 Well, we thank all of you for those very,  very encouraging experiences.
31:31 It makes us think of Isaiah 59:1
31:35 which reminds us that Jehovah’s hand  is not too short to accomplish his will,
31:39 and this is truly evident on this project.
31:42 And I know you brothers would,  as well as all of us,
31:45 like to thank all who had a share in this
31:47 —all those who physically  came here to volunteer,
31:50 the local brothers and sisters  who supported us,
31:52 all those from home,  and everybody with their prayers.
31:56 We truly appreciate that.
31:58 And we’d also like to thank you  five brothers for the sacrifices
32:01 that you and your wives  made during this project.
32:04 And another evidence for me
32:06 that Jehovah’s hand was in this project is:
32:09 You five brothers are all friends.
32:11 And just interacting with one another  and being with you,
32:14 you can see that that’s evidence  of Jehovah’s spirit.
32:17 But, ultimately, our thanks goes  to Jehovah for what took place,
32:21 because we know he ultimately  was behind the success of this project.
32:26 And we’re very thankful  that all of us had a chance to witness
32:29 Jehovah’s hand in action in what took place.
32:39 Well, that certainly was  a beautiful experience, wasn’t it?
32:43 And for those of us that are visiting here,
32:46 if you meet someone  who worked on the project,
32:49 make sure to ask them,
32:51 “How did you see Jehovah’s hand
32:53 in helping you personally  and in the project?”
32:55 And you may be surprised at what stories  you learn by asking that question.
33:01 Well, at this point, what we’re going to do  is something a little different,
33:04 an interactive exam, or test,
33:07 to see who qualifies  to remain in the auditorium.
33:11 Now, what we’d like  you to do is first of all,
33:14 you have to answer the question:
33:16 How many facilities  are being dedicated today?
33:20 Then list them in alphabetical order.
33:23 Well, you know  we’re not going to do that to you.
33:26 But that little worry  that you felt will be allayed
33:29 when you watch the next video
33:31 which tells you about the facilities  that are going to be dedicated.
33:40 To support the Kingdom work,  expansion has recently
33:43 been underway  within the United States.
33:46 This involves the construction  of the new world headquarters
33:50 at Warwick along with
15 other buildings being dedicated
33:54 at the 2017 annual meeting.
33:57 Let’s visit each site
34:00 and see how these buildings
34:02 affect us in our Kingdom service
34:05 and ultimately bring praise to Jehovah.
34:09 Videos have become  an important tool in our worship,
34:13 and so the need  to produce them faster
34:16 and in greater quantity  has risen dramatically.
34:20 Five years ago,  the department produced
34:23 one feature film each year  along with a handful of smaller videos.
34:28 During 2016, that number grew
34:31 to more than 350 productions.
34:38 The existing facilities in Patterson
34:41 consisted of three smaller studios.
34:44 To produce more content simultaneously,
34:47 a larger production space  with multiple stages was needed.
34:52 In early 2015, on Mount Ebo Road,
34:56 a large building less than five miles away
34:59 from Patterson was acquired.
35:01 Originally built  as a pharmaceutical warehouse,
35:04 the building had more than
70,000 square feet (6,503 sq m)
35:08 of open space.
35:10 Work began to convert the warehouse
35:12 into one large soundstage  and two smaller stages.
35:17 Renovations were completed  in December 2016.
35:21 The request for videos is certainly  not slowing down; it’s increasing.
35:25 So we have scheduled for 2017
35:29 around 420 videos that will be used
35:32 in various aspects of the organization.
35:35 So we have seen the need  to have increased personnel
35:40 and increased facilities  to accommodate all these requests.
35:44 So we can see  that Jehovah has raised up
35:47 brothers and sisters,  or “gifts in men” and women,
35:51 that have been able to help produce  the beautiful music we have
35:54 and the videos that are touching  minds and hearts.
35:58 Just one mile away from Mount Ebo,
36:00 a 12,000-square-foot (1,114 sq m) building
36:02 was purchased and converted  into a carpentry shop
36:05 for building props and sets.
36:09 The Mountain View Apartments  were also purchased and renovated,
36:13 providing housing  for 100 Bethel family members.
36:18 From the oversight of congregations  and meeting arrangements
36:22 to territory assignments  and other aspects of the preaching work,
36:27 Kingdom activities are overseen  by the Branch Committee
36:30 with direction provided  by the Service Department.
36:36 In the United States branch,  there was a need for expanded facilities
36:41 to house these departments at Wallkill.
36:45 The work for the Wallkill expansion project
36:48 was basically completed  in November of 2015.
36:52 It involved new construction  for residence buildings,
36:55 the new F Garage,  and the new office building.
36:59 So between the new  and the renovated facilities,
37:03 it was over
1,118,000 square feet (103,865 sq m).
37:07 You have to remember, too,  that at the same time
37:09 all the departments  were still running, you know.
37:12 Meanwhile, all these buildings  were going up around us.
37:15 I’m sure it didn’t appear  this way to the workers,
37:17 but to us it was like it was  on a high-speed video
37:20 at the rate that it went up.
37:22 It was incredible!
37:25 It wasn’t just their skills  and expertise that they brought.
37:28 It was their zeal;  it was their joy;
37:31 it was their positive attitude  that they were able to maintain
37:34 —even despite the heavy workload.
37:36 And that engenders appreciation
37:39 and zeal among all of those  who’ve come in contact with them.
37:43 Many are taking advantage of tools
37:46 such as JW Library and the JW Language app
37:50 to read, study, and teach the Bible.
37:57 The increased use of technologies like these
38:00 has created the need  for more computer engineers
38:03 and other personnel to design,  develop, and test this software.
38:09 Work space and housing  for these volunteers is now being provided
38:12 at the Rivercrest apartment complex  in Fishkill.
38:17 Another important concern  of the United States branch
38:20 involves caring for senior members  of the Bethel family.
38:25 To meet that need, work was completed
38:28 in 2016 on Congregate North and South.
38:32 Congregate living is really home care.
38:35 Home care for the most precious ones  among our Bethel family.
38:39 We’re surrounded by  many wonderful brothers and sisters
38:42 who are very hard working  and care so much about us.
38:45 And this has touched my heart.
38:48 The blessings are being able to be
38:49 with friends that we’ve known for years.
38:51 It’s like a reunion that doesn’t stop.
38:54 Jehovah has really taken good care  of all of them.
38:57 The care that our dear older ones  receive is outstanding.
39:01 And it’s true that we have people who care.
39:04 But there’s a reason:  It reflects Jehovah’s view of older ones.
39:08 He says at Isaiah 46:4:
39:10 “Until you grow old . . .
39:12 I will carry you.”
39:15 And that’s how those who have been trained
39:18 by Jehovah treat the older ones.
39:20 So it’s really a loving atmosphere  that they are in.
39:28 To receive and store building materials,
39:30 a 220,000-square-foot (20,438 sq m)  warehouse
39:33 was purchased in 2014  in Montgomery, New York.
39:38 At the Montgomery Warehouse,  materials were staged
39:41 and residential bathrooms  for Warwick were prefabricated
39:44 —speeding up construction on-site.
39:47 The warehouse continues to be used  as a storage facility
39:51 for both the U.S. branch  and the world headquarters.
39:55 In 2014, two hotels were purchased:
39:58 Newburgh Center A and Newburgh Center B.
40:02 Being centrally located  between all three sites,
40:05 these hotels have been ideal  for housing temporary workers
40:08 and hosting guests visiting  the Bethel facilities.
40:12 These hotels were a great help  for the workers.
40:15 They were going to be closer now  to the project.
40:17 Before, with that long commute  from Brooklyn on the bus,
40:21 it was tiring by the time they got to work.
40:23 But now they were closer,  so they could get a little more rest
40:26 in the evenings and the mornings  and be more productive.
40:29 These workers are lovable.  You have to love them.
40:33 You think about all the sacrifices.
40:35 They left homes, sold homes, and left jobs,
40:38 businesses, family, friends, their pets.
40:41 You thank them, but they thank you.
40:43 They thank you for the privilege of coming,
40:46 even though they’re the ones  that made so many sacrifices.
40:48 So they’re an encouragement  to the rest of us.
40:53 The plan to relocate  the world headquarters to Warwick
40:57 goes back more than eight years
40:59 when we first purchased  this 253-acre (102 ha) property
41:03 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Brooklyn.
41:06 Some of the reasons that Brooklyn  was so advantageous
41:09 no longer have such a key role for us.
41:11 And then, just the fact of living in a city
41:14 that continues to get bigger and bigger
41:17 created more and more complications  and more costs.
41:20 But I often think, even so,
41:22 the real reason we moved out of Brooklyn
41:25 is what the Governing Body  has said from the beginning
41:28 —that they are convinced  Jehovah’s spirit directed them
41:32 to move out of Brooklyn  and to come up here to Warwick, New York.
41:36 And we’re looking forward to—  At some point in time,
41:38 we’re going to look back and we’re going  to see what all the other reasons are
41:40 why Jehovah directed that to take place.
41:43 The Warwick property included a number of abandoned buildings
41:48 that needed to be demolished and removed.
41:51 Once the site was cleared  and plans were approved,
41:54 construction began on July 29, 2013,
41:58 and moved at a remarkable pace.
42:02 About 4,000 a day were coming to the site.
42:05 Over 27,000 of our brothers  and sisters worked here.
42:08 Then you had everybody in Bethel  —from the Governing Body
42:10 all the way down to departments— everybody was united
42:14 in making this project a success.
42:16 And there were challenges,
42:18 but they would be settled in peace and love
42:21 and all the qualities of Jehovah’s spirit.
42:24 That is a modern-day miracle.
42:26 Especially when you think  about the world we are living in
42:28 that is so fragmented and the lack of unity.
42:31 And so you look at that,  and it just makes you so proud
42:34 to be part of this organization.
42:35 I remember the first time  visiting Warwick after the completion.
42:40 I call it a happy/sad moment:
42:42 happy because now the buildings were going  to be used for the intended purpose
42:47 but sad because you didn’t see  the high-vis vests anymore.
42:50 It was a beautiful scene
42:52 with all those colorful vests,  and now you didn’t see them,
42:54 so it was sad.
42:55 You get choked up.
42:57 You realize that behind every vest
42:59 there was a beautiful Kingdom story,
43:01 and you miss them.
43:04 The environment here at Warwick  is just beautiful.
43:07 It’s quiet; it’s refreshing.
43:09 And it makes me really appreciate
43:11 Jehovah’s creation around us.
43:13 It’s beautiful to be here,  and I thank Jehovah for the privilege.
43:17 Warwick is a complex of eight buildings
43:20 —more than a million and a half  square feet (139,354 sq m) of construction.
43:24 Bethel housing is provided  in four residence buildings
43:28 with 569 rooms along with another residence
43:32 in nearby Sterling Forest  with another 21 rooms.
43:36 And just a short distance away  is the Tuxedo facility.
43:40 Computer Department Engineering
43:42 and the Broadcasting studio are located here,
43:45 where the monthly broadcast  is produced and now made available
43:49 in over 130 languages.
43:53 The Office/Services Building
43:55 primarily serves as the hub  for most world headquarters functions.
44:01 The building also includes three exhibits,
44:04 where visitors can take self-guided tours:
44:08 “The Bible and the Divine Name,”
44:11 which features rare Bibles  and highlights how God’s name
44:15 has been preserved in the Scriptures;
44:18 the exhibit “A People for Jehovah’s Name,”
44:22 a visual history of Jehovah’s Witnesses;
44:25 and “World Headquarters—Faith in Action,”
44:29 which explains how Witnesses are organized
44:31 to study, teach, and live  by what we learn in the Bible.
44:39 When you travel anywhere  in the United States branch
44:42 or internationally, for that matter,
44:44 there’s someone who has worked on Warwick.
44:47 And the feeling that you get is
44:50 that Warwick  is not the world headquarters;
44:53 it’s our world headquarters.
44:55 I’ve heard a number say  that when they go back home,
44:58 they’re never going to be the same.
44:59 Some have simplified, so they’ve moved  from a big house to an apartment.
45:03 Others have started pioneering,  so that’s what they’re going to do.
45:06 It’s really been a witness to the Witnesses.
45:08 Jehovah looks for opportunities  to bless his people.
45:11 That makes him happy.
45:13 And now you turn it around,
45:15 and you look at all the work  that’s gone into this
45:17 —when he sees all those who volunteered  to come on the project,
45:21 all of our brothers and sisters  around the world who made donations,
45:24 those who included it in their prayers,  those who helped others to come—
45:28 how proud that must make Jehovah!
45:30 And he’s just looking to bless them for that.
45:34 I sometimes try to imagine  the conversations in heaven
45:38 between the angels and the kings in heaven
45:41 and how they’re so proud  of all these workers down here.
45:44 And no doubt many of them  were involved in the project.
45:46 We think of the workers here on earth,  but how about the workers in heaven?
45:50 They may have been involved  more than a few times
45:53 with safety issues and with legal matters.
45:55 So Jehovah was proud of everyone —his universal family—
45:59 both in heaven and on earth  with these projects.
46:03 I feel that it’s going  to build up the spirituality
46:06 of our brothers and sisters as they come.
46:08 And as we know, they’re coming  from all over the world,
46:11 and that’s only going  to further advance the work.
46:15 These buildings are beautiful,  and it’s a beautiful setting.
46:19 That brings praise to Jehovah.
46:21 But what will bring the greatest praise  is how these buildings,
46:24 these tools, will be used
46:26 —to honor his name,  to bring attention to his Kingdom,
46:31 to spearhead the preaching work.
46:33 What these buildings will help  the Governing Body accomplish
46:37 will bring the greatest praise to Jehovah.
46:48 So now we will be passing out those tests.
46:50 No.
46:52 No, now is the time  for an interactive part of our program
46:55 where we have an opportunity  to raise our voices in praise to Jehovah.
47:00 So if you’d like to stand, if you’re able,
47:02 we’re going to sing  our new dedication song at this time.
47:06 And remember that’s entitled
47:08 “A Place That Will Bring You Praise.”
50:22 What a beautiful song  —sung beautifully.
50:25 If you’d like to take your seats,
50:27 we’ve now arrived at the time
50:29 for a highlight of our program —the dedication talk.
50:33 And this is going to be given to us  by the longest-serving member
50:37 of the current Governing Body,  Brother Gerrit Lösch.
50:40 And the title of his talk is  “Expansion That Glorifies Jehovah.”
50:50 Modern-day worship of Jehovah  began in a small way.
50:54 It calls to mind the scripture that says,
50:57 according to Zechariah 4:10:
51:00 “Who has despised  the day of small beginnings?”
51:04 What is the context of the scripture?
51:07 In the year 537 before our Common Era,
51:11 Jehovah moved Persian King Cyrus —who had conquered Babylon—
51:16 to release the Israelites  that were held captive there for 70 years,
51:21 opening the way for them  to return to Jerusalem and Judah.
51:25 They were to restore true worship
51:27 and rebuild the temple  that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed.
51:32 How many exiles returned  to Jerusalem from Babylon
51:36 in 537 B.C.E.?
51:39 According to Ezra 2:64,  about 50,000.
51:44 The footnote in the sixth edition  of Isaac Leeser’s translation of the Bible
51:49 suggests that including women and children,
51:53 the number amounted to about 200,000.
51:58 In the seventh month of the year 537 B.C.E.,
52:01 the altar was set up.
52:03 And in the following year, 536 B.C.E.,
52:06 the foundation of the new temple was laid.
52:09 But after laying the foundation,
52:11 they neglected to rebuild  the temple on that foundation.
52:15 Enemies round about also  discouraged them from doing so.
52:20 The enemies succeeded  to place a ban on the work
52:24 about 15 years later
52:26 in 522 before our Common Era.
52:32 Two years after that, in 520 B.C.E.
52:34 —stirred up by the prophets  Haggai and Zechariah—
52:37 Governor Zerubbabel  and Joshua the high priest
52:40 courageously resumed the construction  of the temple despite the ban.
52:45 Jehovah proclaimed that:
52:47 “The hands of Zerubbabel  have laid the foundation of this house,
52:51 “and his own hands will finish it.
52:54 . . . For who has despised  the day of small beginnings?”
52:59 —Zechariah 4:9, 10.
53:02 The rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple  at Jerusalem had a modest beginning,
53:06 yes, but it was not to be despised.
53:09 After all,  it involved true worship
53:12 —pure worship of Jehovah.
53:16 The year 520 B.C.E.  saw this “day of small beginnings,”
53:20 but in 515 B.C.E.,
53:22 22 years after the return from Babylon
53:26 and 5 years  after the construction project was resumed,
53:29 the temple was completed.
53:32 The former exiles held the inauguration,
53:35 or we could say dedication  of this house with joy
53:39 —Ezra 6:13-16—
53:43 and this resulted in Jehovah’s praise.
53:47 He was glorified by the rebuilt temple.
53:52 There were also small beginnings  for the Christian congregation
53:55 at Pentecost 33 of our Common Era.
54:00 And Jesus related this illustration
54:04 at Matthew 13:31, 32:
54:17 “The Kingdom of the heavens  is like a mustard grain
54:20 “that a man took  and planted in his field.
54:23 “It is, in fact,  the tiniest of all the seeds,
54:26 “but when it has grown,
54:28 “it is the largest of the vegetable plants  and becomes a tree,
54:32 so that the birds of heaven come  and find lodging among its branches.”
54:38 What’s the meaning  of Jesus’ illustration of the mustard grain?
54:43 The grain itself represents  the Kingdom message
54:46 as well as what results  from the preaching of that message
54:49 —the Christian congregation.
54:52 Like the mustard grain  that is “the tiniest of all the seeds,”
54:56 the Christian congregation  had small beginnings
54:59 in 33 of our Common Era.
55:01 However, within a few decades,  the congregation grew rapidly.
55:06 It expanded beyond all expectations.
55:09 Jesus tells us that “the birds of heaven”
55:12 were able to “find lodging  among its branches.”
55:16 These figurative birds  picture righthearted individuals
55:21 who find spiritual food, shade, and shelter
55:24 within the Christian congregation.
55:27 There were also small beginnings  in modern times.
55:31 Consider our first headquarters.
55:34 In modern times,  Bible Students, as we were called,
55:38 had headquarters offices first  at 101 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh,
55:43 and thereafter at 44 Federal Street,
55:47 Allegheny, Pennsylvania.
55:50 By the late 1880’s,  they built their own structure.
55:54 Completed in 1889 at Arch Street,
55:58 it was known as the Bible House.
56:03 Because of continued expansion,
56:05 headquarters was transferred  to Brooklyn, New York,
56:09 in the years 1908-1909.
56:13 In 1908, the old “Plymouth Bethel,”
56:17 13-17 Hicks Street, Brooklyn,  was purchased.
56:21 It belonged  to the Plymouth Congregational Church.
56:25 Also, 124 Columbia Heights, close by,
56:28 was purchased from the Plymouth Church.
56:30 It soon became the new home
56:33 of our headquarters staff  of —at that time— 30 persons,
56:37 and they called it Bethel,  meaning “House of God.”
56:41 “Bethel” was the name the Plymouth Church
56:44 had given to their building on Hicks Street.
56:48 The remodeled Hicks Street building
56:50 then became known  as the Brooklyn Tabernacle.
56:53 It housed offices and an auditorium.
56:56 On January 31, 1909,
56:59 350 persons were present
57:01 for the dedication  of the new headquarters.
57:06 But there were also small beginnings  in a different sense
57:10 in 1919 of our Common Era.
57:14 The statement at Zechariah 4:10  about “small beginnings”
57:19 applied after the Israelites  had returned from Babylon.
57:23 Was there a parallel in modern times?
57:26 Yes.
57:27 In our century,  for Jehovah’s anointed Christians,
57:31 it was a “day of small beginnings” in 1919,
57:35 when they were completely freed
57:37 from domination by Babylon the Great
57:40 —the world conglomerate of false religion—
57:43 in order to restore true worship.
57:47 Already in the years before,
57:49 they had progressively cleansed  themselves from Babylon the Great.
57:54 From 1914 to 1919,
57:57 the brothers lived  through a number of crises and tests,
58:01 but this came to an end in 1919.
58:04 The Memorial of Christ’s death
58:06 was celebrated on Sunday, April 13, 1919,
58:09 with 17,961 attending in many lands.
58:14 This was, of course,  a lot less than the number of returnees
58:18 from literal Babylon.
58:21 And of these 18,000,
58:24 about 4,000 also reported field service.
58:29 Many looked down on the brothers.
58:31 Yes, there were again small beginnings,  but still they were approved by Jehovah,
58:36 and therefore he caused expansion ever since.
58:40 There is expansion in the material sense.
58:44 In order to meet together in worship,
58:46 last year about 1,000 properties  were purchased
58:50 and new Kingdom Halls  constructed on them.
58:54 In addition, there were many more
58:57 where major or minor renovations were done.
59:03 Branch offices are being expanded
59:05 and also newly built  remote translation offices,
59:09 Bible school facilities, and Assembly Halls.
59:13 In the United States,  we now have 47 active Assembly Halls.
59:19 Also, there is expansion in numbers.
59:23 In the Democratic Republic of Congo,
59:25 there were almost 1.2 million
59:28 who attended the Memorial this year.
59:31 In Mexico, without Central America,
59:34 there were about 2.2 million who attended.
59:38 Worldwide, about 20 million
59:41 attended the Memorial  of Christ’s death last year.
59:46 Each weekend,  an average of 5,300 new ones
59:51 are getting baptized  and becoming our brothers and sisters.
59:55 Our worldwide family and brotherhood grows.
1:00:00 But our numerical expansion in itself  is not proof that we have the truth.
1:00:05 Other religions have many more members  and some grow quickly.
1:00:09 There are about 1.5 billion Muslims  in the world,
1:00:13 second only to the number  of named Christians.
1:00:16 But numbers alone prove nothing.
1:00:19 Truth is not measured in numbers.
1:00:21 But the combination  of true teaching, true love,
1:00:25 high moral standards, neutrality,
1:00:28 carrying and sanctifying God’s holy name
1:00:31 —together with the increase—
1:00:33 that does prove beyond a doubt  that Jehovah has chosen us as his people.
1:00:40 At Isaiah 60:22,
1:00:44 there’s this prophecy that was foretold,
1:00:48 and it says:
1:00:52 “The little one will become a thousand
1:00:55 “and the small one a mighty nation.
1:00:58 I myself, Jehovah,  will speed it up in its own time.”
1:01:02 Who is that “mighty nation”?
1:01:05 It’s the great crowd  and the anointed together.
1:01:10 They constitute  a combined “mighty nation,”
1:01:15 although they  are relatively few when compared
1:01:17 to the present total world population
1:01:19 of more than 7.5 billion,
1:01:22 as of March of this year.
1:01:27 Many who visit us at Warwick,  Wallkill, or Patterson say,
1:01:31 “Oh, you live here like in a paradise.”
1:01:34 And those saying this may have in mind
1:01:36 the loving fellowship that we enjoy
1:01:39 and also the beautiful surroundings.
1:01:42 And the fact is that we do live in a paradise
1:01:46 —a spiritual paradise.
1:01:49 But what about you visitors  and all those who are watching this program
1:01:53 by streaming and otherwise?
1:01:56 The good news is that you  are also in the spiritual paradise.
1:02:01 All of our worldwide brotherhood
1:02:04 live in this spiritual paradise.
1:02:08 Now, what is the spiritual paradise?
1:02:11 It involves our relationship with Jehovah.
1:02:14 It involves the spiritual food  that we enjoy served by the faithful slave.
1:02:19 It also involves  the loving relationship with our brothers
1:02:22 in the congregation  and our worldwide brotherhood.
1:02:26 It includes personal blessings from Jehovah
1:02:29 that he bestows upon us in everyday life.
1:02:32 The spiritual paradise
1:02:34 is the spiritually secure,  prosperous environment
1:02:39 or realm of activity  in which we worship Jehovah.
1:02:43 No matter where we live on earth,
1:02:45 we are in this paradise  as long as we actively support
1:02:50 the worship of Jehovah  and endeavor to display the new personality.
1:02:55 The spiritual paradise began in a limited way
1:03:00 in 33 of our Common Era at Pentecost.
1:03:04 It underwent changes during the centuries
1:03:06 but was restored in 1919.
1:03:10 The spiritual paradise relates  to the divine approval of the anointed
1:03:15 that became evident that year in 1919.
1:03:19 In comparison with the first century,
1:03:21 the anointed enjoy  increased spiritual prosperity
1:03:26 since that time.
1:03:28 And since the 1930’s,
1:03:32 those with an earthly hope  also enter the spiritual paradise.
1:03:37 And ultimately, the spiritual paradise  will be in full existence,
1:03:41 in perfection,  in the new world.
1:03:45 Do we appreciate that spiritual paradise?
1:03:59 Satan will try to destroy  our spiritual paradise.
1:04:03 He thinks he can succeed  because we seem vulnerable.
1:04:06 He may try to disrupt  the flow of spiritual food
1:04:11 or break up our unity  or stop us from zealously preaching
1:04:15 —all elements of the spiritual paradise.
1:04:18 Through political governments,
1:04:20 he will try to efface true worshippers  and true worship from the earth,
1:04:25 but he will not succeed.
1:04:28 He will be thrown  into an abyss for a thousand years,
1:04:32 and after that  he will be crushed out of existence.
1:04:35 What about the governments  that he controls now?
1:04:39 They will already be crushed at Armageddon —forever.
1:04:44 The Messianic Kingdom  will take control of the earth,
1:04:48 which eventually will become  a perfect, literal paradise,
1:04:53 and then the spiritual paradise
1:04:55 and the physical paradise  will exist concurrently.
1:05:02 The expansion  of the spiritual paradise since 1919
1:05:05 was paralleled by material expansion.
1:05:09 Let me take you back on history lane.
1:05:11 First, let’s talk about our printing efforts.
1:05:16 In 1920, we started with a rotary press  at Myrtle Avenue, New York.
1:05:21 In 1922,  the printery was relocated
1:05:24 to 18 Concord Street.
1:05:27 From 1927 to 1986,
1:05:32 additional printery buildings were bought
1:05:34 and erected on Adams Street.
1:05:38 But what about residence  and office expansion?
1:05:42 On October 10, 1960,
1:05:44 there was the dedication of a new residence
1:05:48 and office building at 107 Columbia Heights;
1:05:52 630 brothers attended  in the ground-floor Kingdom Hall.
1:05:57 The new building,  Brother Franz said,
1:06:01 reminds us of the psalmist’s words:
1:06:03 that everyone in Jehovah’s temple  would speak his glory.
1:06:10 In 1969,  the 119 Columbia Heights residence was built
1:06:15 and dedicated on May 2.
1:06:18 In the same year,  the complex was bought
1:06:20 from Squibb Pharmaceuticals,
1:06:23 and it served as world headquarters  until we moved here to Warwick.
1:06:28 The address was 25-30 Columbia Heights,
1:06:32 and it was dedicated on March 15, 1982.
1:06:37 Later, buildings number 48 and 50
1:06:41 were also joined to the number 30 building.
1:06:46 Close by is the 85 Jay Street lot,
1:06:50 a whole city block that was used for parking.
1:06:54 Then, September 18, 1995,
1:06:57 there was another  important dedication program.
1:07:01 Seventeen residences had been added
1:07:04 since the previous dedication  of the Bethel residence
1:07:09 on May 2, 1969.
1:07:12 Among the added residences
1:07:14 there was the Towers Hotel  that we bought in 1975,
1:07:18 the Bossert Hotel,  Standish Hotel, Sliver building,
1:07:22 the 108 Joralemon Street building,
1:07:26 the 30-story Sands Street building,
1:07:29 and the 97 Columbia Heights building
1:07:32 —formerly there was  the Margaret Hotel on that property.
1:07:38 The 360 Furman Street building,
1:07:40 which housed our shipping department  and some other departments,
1:07:44 was purchased by us on March 15, 1983,
1:07:49 and was totally renovated.
1:07:52 It had a million square feet (93,000 sq m)  of floor space.
1:07:58 As of this date, most of our properties —almost all of them—
1:08:03 have already been sold,
1:08:06 and this more than covered the expenses
1:08:08 needed to build headquarters here.
1:08:17 Well, what about expansion at Wallkill?
1:08:21 In 1963,
1:08:23 the farm at Wallkill  was purchased from brothers.
1:08:26 It is 75 miles or 120 kilometers  away from New York City.
1:08:31 New residence buildings were completed
1:08:33 in 1968, 1971, and 1973.
1:08:37 The large printery  was eventually built in 1973
1:08:40 and expanded in 1975.
1:08:44 In 2004, printing in New York was discontinued,
1:08:47 and all printing  was consolidated at Wallkill.
1:08:51 On May 15, 2005,
1:08:53 there was the dedication program
1:08:56 for the expanded Wallkill complex  and facilities.
1:09:02 Today, we also dedicate a new residence,
1:09:06 a new parking garage,  a new office building at Wallkill,
1:09:10 as well as the Montgomery Warehouse,
1:09:13 and two nearby hotels and a diner  that you saw before in the video.
1:09:19 Wallkill has become the national headquarters
1:09:23 for the United States branch,
1:09:25 and most of the Branch Committee members  live at Wallkill.
1:09:30 Warwick is the worldwide headquarters  —so that’s the difference.
1:09:35 But there was also  a complex built at Patterson
1:09:39 in the mid-1990’s  with offices, residences,
1:09:43 and theocratic schools.
1:09:46 And on May 19, 1999,
1:09:51 was the dedication program.
1:09:55 Recently,  the Mount Ebo video studios on Route 22,
1:09:59 close to Patterson, were added  and also another building.
1:10:04 Now, Patterson is also considered  as part of world headquarters.
1:10:11 Also, the Tuxedo building  that we bought from the paper company
1:10:15 and where our broadcasting studio is now,
1:10:18 is part of world headquarters.
1:10:20 It’s situated just about 10 minutes  from here on the same country road.
1:10:26 Finally, we also dedicate  the Rivercrest complex
1:10:30 that was bought in Fishkill,
1:10:32 where several hundred Bethelites live.
1:10:36 Today, we will focus on the dedication
1:10:38 of our beautiful world headquarters complex  at Warwick.
1:10:43 Now, why was it built here?
1:10:45 Well, we trust that it was Jehovah
1:10:49 that wanted us to build it here.
1:10:53 Well, what we learn from ancient times
1:10:55 is that according to 2 Kings 23:27,
1:11:00 Jehovah was the one who chose  Jerusalem as a center of worship.
1:11:06 And in our time,
1:11:08 our world headquarters is a center  that promotes true worship worldwide,
1:11:13 and we believe it was chosen by Jehovah.
1:11:18 All the expansion  that we talked about glorifies Jehovah.
1:11:22 The apostle Paul had the right attitude.
1:11:24 He wrote at 1 Thessalonians 2:6:
1:11:26 “Nor have we been seeking glory from men.”
1:11:29 Yes, we seek Jehovah’s glory,  not our own glory.
1:11:35 He is the one that caused and blessed  the construction of our complexes.
1:11:39 I’m sure you agree.
1:11:42 Jehovah is the one who blessed  the rebuilding of the physical temple
1:11:46 in the times of Zerubbabel.
1:11:48 And Jehovah said back then,  according to Isaiah 60:7:
1:11:53 “I will beautify my glorious house.”
1:11:58 Now, the prophecy about the “glorious house”  in our time refers,
1:12:02 not to the literal structures  of world headquarters,
1:12:07 but to our spiritual temple.
1:12:11 Many would come,  according to prophecy,
1:12:14 and worship in that spiritual temple.
1:12:18 It is a figurative ‘house of prayer  for all the nations,’
1:12:23 according to Isaiah 56:7.
1:12:27 Revelation 7:9 prophesies
1:12:29 about ‘a great crowd out of all the nations.’
1:12:33 Now, what is their role and position?
1:12:36 Well, let’s look at it in the Bible
1:12:40 in Revelation chapter 7.
1:12:51 And in verse 9, it says:
1:12:54 “After this I saw, and look! a great crowd,
1:12:58 “which no man was able to number,
1:13:00 “out of all nations and tribes  and peoples and tongues,
1:13:04 “standing before the throne  and before the Lamb,
1:13:07 “dressed in white robes;
1:13:09 and there were palm branches  in their hands.”
1:13:14 It says that they  ‘stand before the throne of God.’
1:13:18 Does this mean that they go to heaven?
1:13:22 No.
1:13:23 The earth is called God’s “footstool”
1:13:26 —Isaiah 66:1.
1:13:29 So even on earth,
1:13:31 the great crowd stands  before the throne of Jehovah.
1:13:35 The great crowd consists of Christians
1:13:37 with the hope to live forever  in Paradise on earth.
1:13:40 Revelation 7:15 says about them:
1:13:43 “They are rendering him  sacred service day and night.”
1:13:47 Where?
1:13:48 In front of the temple?
1:13:50 No, it says:  “In his temple.”
1:13:55 Where, exactly,  is the great crowd serving?
1:13:59 Yes, all of us,  no matter what hope we have,
1:14:02 serve Jehovah  in the spiritual temple
1:14:05 because we all worship Jehovah  based on Jesus’ sacrifice.
1:14:10 So, what is the spiritual temple?
1:14:13 True or false?
1:14:15 It’s the same as the spiritual paradise.
1:14:18 False.
1:14:20 Or it refers to anointed Christians.
1:14:23 False, again.
1:14:25 The temples in Bible times  constituted a provision
1:14:30 or arrangement for worshipping Jehovah.
1:14:33 So the spiritual temple  is also an arrangement of worship
1:14:38 based on Jesus’ perfect ransom sacrifice,
1:14:41 and all who worship Jehovah  based on his sacrifice
1:14:45 are in the spiritual temple.
1:14:48 Now, the spiritual paradise,  on the other hand,
1:14:52 refers to a condition
1:14:55 that allows us to serve Jehovah
1:14:58 with his approval  and in peace with our brothers.
1:15:03 We can enhance the beauty  of the spiritual paradise
1:15:06 and extend its borders  by making disciples
1:15:09 and also by displaying  the Christian personality.
1:15:13 All in the spiritual paradise  sing Jehovah’s praise without letup.
1:15:17 It is as if they preach day and night.
1:15:19 Isaiah 62:6 goes on to say:
1:15:22 “Continuously,  all day long and all night long,
1:15:25 “they should not be silent.
1:15:27 You who make mention of Jehovah,  do not rest.”
1:15:33 Yes, we are determined not to be silent,
1:15:36 not to rest mentioning Jehovah.
1:15:41 At chapter 60, verse 6,  in Isaiah, we read:
1:15:45 “They will proclaim the praises of Jehovah.”
1:15:49 By preaching the good news  and by our expressions in Kingdom Halls,
1:15:52 we all contribute to Jehovah’s praise.
1:15:56 Praising Jehovah is one  of the primary objectives
1:15:59 of our meeting attendance  and our preaching activity.
1:16:03 We understand that we  do not primarily preach
1:16:06 to save people’s lives.
1:16:08 Jehovah’s praise is more important  than the salvation of people.
1:16:13 Why?
1:16:14 Because Jehovah  is more important than people.
1:16:17 At Hebrews 13:15, it says:
1:16:21 “Through him [Christ]  let us always offer to God
1:16:25 “a sacrifice of praise,
1:16:29 “that is, the fruit of our lips
1:16:31 that make public declaration to his name.”
1:16:36 Nobody can stop the expansion.
1:16:39 Even dictatorial governments,  including communist governments,
1:16:42 could not stop  the expansion of God’s organization.
1:16:46 Hitler could not; Stalin could not;
1:16:49 Trujillo in the Dominican Republic could not;
1:16:53 Mussolini in Italy could not;
1:16:56 Ceausescu of Romania could not;
1:16:59 Mao Tse-tung could not;
1:17:01 Enver Hoxha,  dictator of communist Albania, could not.
1:17:05 Nobody can because Jehovah is with us.
1:17:11 What about the former Soviet Union
1:17:13 that included Ukraine,  Moldova, Belarus, and Russia?
1:17:19 In 1991,  there were less than 50,000 publishers
1:17:24 in the former Soviet Union.
1:17:26 Now they are approaching 400,000 publishers.
1:17:32 Imagine that increase, or expansion.
1:17:36 Within the period from 1991 to 1998,
1:17:41 a total of 220,492 were baptized
1:17:46 in the former Soviet Union.
1:17:48 In 1990,  in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine,
1:17:52 there was just one congregation.
1:17:54 Now there are about 75.
1:17:58 And 1993 saw the largest baptism  of true Christians ever.
1:18:03 It happened also in Kiev, Ukraine,  at the convention
1:18:07 —7,402 were baptized.
1:18:13 Restrictions cannot stop the work.
1:18:15 Jehovah promised:
1:18:17 “I will oppose those who oppose you,
1:18:20 and I will save your own sons.”
1:18:23 —Isaiah 49:25.
1:18:28 Shortly before Armageddon,  prophecy shows
1:18:31 that we will be attacked  by a coalition of nations
1:18:34 or governments directed  by Satan and the demons.
1:18:39 We do not need to fear, though.
1:18:41 Jehovah will protect his people  during the great tribulation,
1:18:45 and it stands to reason  that he will also protect
1:18:49 the physical headquarters.
1:18:51 At Zechariah 2:8, he says:
1:18:54 “Whoever touches you  touches the pupil of my eye.”
1:18:59 Zechariah 2:5:
1:19:01 “‘And I will become to her,’  declares Jehovah,
1:19:04 “‘a wall of fire all around [in protection],
1:19:07 and I will become the glory in her midst.’”
1:19:13 Yes, our headquarters  bring glory to Jehovah.
1:19:18 These headquarters facilities  and related buildings
1:19:21 were built to glorify  and praise Jehovah.
1:19:24 Isaiah 43:21 says:
1:19:28 “The people whom I formed for myself  [What for?]
1:19:33 so that they might declare my praise.”
1:19:38 Isaiah 43:21 —good to remember that text.
1:19:43 It shows that the purpose  why Jehovah has formed us as his people
1:19:48 is to glorify and praise him.
1:19:52 And so, what is the purpose  of the Christian congregation in general?
1:19:57 Well, again, to bring praise to Jehovah.
1:20:00 What’s the purpose of Warwick headquarters?
1:20:03 To praise Jehovah.
1:20:05 Ephesians 1:12 encourages us
1:20:07 to “serve for the praise of his glory.”
1:20:12 May this new complex  and the other buildings
1:20:15 that we dedicate today
1:20:18 glorify and praise  our dear heavenly Father, Jehovah.
1:20:22 It is now appropriate  that we say a dedication prayer
1:20:26 to dedicate all the buildings  that have not been dedicated yet.
1:20:30 And Brother Leon Weaver,
1:20:32 who serves  on the Branch Committee in the United States,
1:20:35 will now represent us in prayer.
1:20:47 With this prayer and your consent,
1:20:49 I now declare all of our new buildings  as dedicated to Jehovah.
1:20:55 And we thank all of you  for your contributions in various ways
1:20:59 —manual labor,  financial contributions, and prayers.
1:21:05 Now, what is the opposite  of “the day of small beginnings”?
1:21:10 The day of a big finish?
1:21:13 Well, is the dedication of our headquarters
1:21:16 the big finish, or ending?
1:21:19 No ending is in sight.
1:21:21 It is all relative.
1:21:23 In the new world, we might even consider  the dedication of Warwick
1:21:27 as a small beginning
1:21:30 in comparison with the huge work  that will be accomplished
1:21:33 in Paradise to teach billions,
1:21:37 because billions will be resurrected.
1:21:41 Isaiah 11:9 says:
1:21:43 “The earth will certainly be filled  with the knowledge of Jehovah
1:21:46 as the waters cover the sea.”
1:21:51 Yes, we have a glorious God,
1:21:54 and Jehovah has a glorious name.
1:21:57 We have the glorious good news,
1:21:59 and we have a glorious hope for the future.
1:22:02 When Solomon inaugurated the temple,
1:22:06 the glory of Jehovah filled the house.
1:22:08 Today, the spiritual temple
1:22:11 in which millions of us find ourselves in
1:22:16 is also filled with Jehovah’s glory.
1:22:19 At Isaiah 26:12,
1:22:24 it says:
1:22:29 “O Jehovah, you will grant us peace,
1:22:33 “because everything we have done
1:22:37 you have accomplished for us.”
1:22:41 Yes, we want to give credit  and praise to Jehovah God.
1:22:45 Even opposers come to realize
1:22:48 that Jehovah’s blessing  was involved in the construction,
1:22:52 as was the case  in the days of Nehemiah.
1:22:56 Nehemiah 6:16 says:
1:22:58 “They realized [the opposers]  that it was with our God’s help
1:23:03 that this work had been done.”
1:23:07 And this is in line with 1 Peter 4:11:
1:23:10 “So that in all things
1:23:12 “God may be glorified  through Jesus Christ.
1:23:16 “The glory and the might  are his forever and ever.
1:23:21 Amen.”
1:23:22 Revelation 5:13 agrees with this, saying:
1:23:26 “To the One sitting on the throne  and to the Lamb
1:23:30 “be the blessing and the honor
1:23:32 and the glory and the might  forever and ever.”
1:23:37 Hallelujah!
1:23:50 Thank you very much, Brother Lösch,
1:23:52 for helping us to focus on the real meaning
1:23:55 of the dedication of these facilities.
1:24:00 The thousands that attended in person  or were tied in for that event
1:24:04 thoroughly enjoyed the dedication program.
1:24:07 And now millions more of you  have been able to enjoy the same experience.
1:24:12 I know, I know,
1:24:14 you can’t wait to see  the rest of the program.
1:24:16 So I’m happy to inform you  that the spiritual portion
1:24:19 of the annual meeting program
1:24:21 will be posted later this month  in two installments
1:24:24 in the Video On Demand section of our site.
1:24:27 Part 2 will be posted  on Monday, January 15.
1:24:31 Part 3 is to be posted  on Monday, January 29.
1:24:35 So by the end of the month,  you will have heard talks
1:24:37 from five members  of the Governing Body.
1:24:41 We are well-fed spiritually,  that is for sure.
1:24:45 Well, that’s all for now.
1:24:47 This program  is from the studio of JW Broadcasting
1:24:51 at the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

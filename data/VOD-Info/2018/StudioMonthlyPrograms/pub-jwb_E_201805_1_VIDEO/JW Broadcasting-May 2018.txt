00:01 Welcome to this month’s edition  of JW Broadcasting.
00:04 Here are just a few highlights  that we have in store for you.
00:08 Do you feel that you’ve missed  past opportunities
00:11 to do more for Jehovah?
00:13 Or do you feel that your age  or present circumstances
00:16 keep you from reaching out?
00:18 We’ll see how one couple learned
00:20 that there may be doors of activity available
00:23 to those with a willing spirit.
00:27 Have you ever received an assignment  that you felt was overwhelming?
00:31 Brother and Sister Halme,  serving in West Africa,
00:34 will share what helped them  accept such an assignment
00:37 and remain spiritually strong  through difficult times.
00:41 And if you’re a regular pioneer,
00:44 what role do you have  in strengthening the congregation?
00:48 You’ll find this dramatization  very insightful.
00:51 Our focus is on our ministry
00:54 in this May 2018 edition  of JW Broadcasting!
01:18 To set the stage  for the experiences in our program,
01:21 I’d like to talk to you  for a few minutes on the theme
01:24 “Invigorate Your Ministry—How?”
01:28 You dear brothers and sisters are having
01:31 a regular share in the preaching work,
01:33 and just think of the results.
01:35 Each year,
01:36 about two billion hours  are spent in the ministry.
01:40 Millions of Bible studies are conducted,
01:43 and those being baptized  number into the hundreds of thousands.
01:47 If you are a Kingdom publisher,
01:50 you have had a share  in those thrilling statistics.
01:53 But there’s a potential danger.
01:57 With so much to do in our life
01:59 —not just in the ministry  but also with secular work,
02:03 family responsibilities,  for some, even health issues—
02:07 we can get into a rut.
02:10 It’s not always easy to detect at first,
02:13 because in this age of technology
02:15 we always feel busy.
02:18 But what consumes our day?
02:21 Watch this one-minute video,
02:23 and try to detect what’s going on  in the life of one brother.
02:27 His life is in a rut.
02:29 Try to figure out why.
03:46 Would you say  that this brother’s life is in a rut?
03:49 Oh, he’s active all day
03:51 —he always has something to do.
03:54 But it’s as if his mind  has been kidnapped by his devices.
03:59 Have you ever had  the experience of reading an e-mail
04:02 while someone  is trying to tell you something?
04:05 It can be embarrassing
04:07 when you realize  that they’ve asked you a question,
04:10 and they’re waiting for an answer,
04:12 but you have no idea what they asked.
04:14 It’s embarrassing, right?
04:16 But what if the person  who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah?
04:22 Even though we aren’t doing anything wrong,
04:24 our daily routine  can occupy our attention so much
04:29 that we are not able to hear  the refreshing words of Jehovah.
04:34 That can happen to any one of us.
04:37 Even our spiritual activity  can get into a rut.
04:41 One Christian sister described it this way:
04:44 “I would go out in service,
04:46 “go to meetings, study, pray
04:50 “—but I did it all on automatic control,
04:53 never feeling anything.”
04:56 Have you ever felt that way?
04:59 Do you see  all the happy servants of Jehovah
05:02 whose experiences  appear on JW Broadcasting,
05:05 and you say to yourself:
05:07 ‘Why can’t I find that joy?
05:09 Why is my ministry in a rut?’
05:12 Perhaps you feel  like a remote-control train
05:15 that goes around and around on a track,
05:18 working the same territory,  with the same partner,
05:22 saying the same thing at each door.
05:24 Of course, there’s nothing wrong  with being in a good routine.
05:28 But being in a rut can sap our energy
05:32 and take the joy out of our service.
05:35 We could even come to view  our ministry as boring.
05:40 Of course, we feel invigorated  when we get good results:
05:44 We meet an interested person  when going from door to door
05:47 —we’re invigorated!
05:49 An inactive person approaches the cart
05:51 and wants to get in touch  with the local congregation
05:53 —we’re even more invigorated!
05:55 We start a Bible study  —we’re on top of the world!
05:59 I’m sure you’ll agree,
06:01 all those outcomes  are good reasons for joy.
06:05 The problem is  that we’re not always in control
06:08 of getting those outcomes.
06:10 In real life,  we may spend an entire morning
06:14 in the door-to-door work  without meeting an interested person.
06:17 We may spend months
06:19 making return visits  without starting a study.
06:23 And once again,  our ministry can get into a rut.
06:27 Now, don’t misunderstand.
06:29 It’s not that we’re doing anything wrong,
06:32 but we’re not getting  the full joy out of doing what’s right.
06:36 Of course, Satan would love it
06:39 if our service to Jehovah  were to fall into a rut.
06:42 He would love it if we lost our joy.
06:45 If we lose our joy, we lose hope,
06:49 we lose strength,
06:51 and we might even begin  to feel like giving up.
06:55 The point is this, brothers and sisters:
06:57 If you feel that your ministry  has fallen into a rut,
07:02 don’t be discouraged and don’t give up.
07:05 There are ways  that we can invigorate our ministry
07:08 and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.
07:11 To illustrate that:
07:13 Maybe you’ve had
07:14 the frustrating experience  of locking yourself
07:17 out of your house or apartment.
07:21 Of course, with a key,  opening the door is simple.
07:23 A locked door  might seem like an obstacle,
07:27 but it isn’t if you have the key.
07:30 And the same is true  with invigorating our ministry.
07:33 If we’ve fallen into a rut
07:36 and if we’ve lost  that feeling of joy in our service,
07:40 there are a number of keys  that can help us unlock the door.
07:45 Let’s look at one.
07:47 Open your Bible  to 1 Corinthians 16:8, 9.
07:52 Now, in these verses,
07:55 the apostle Paul was presented  with a key of opportunity,
07:59 and he used it to open a door.
08:02 First Corinthians 16:8, 9 says:
08:06 “But I am remaining in Ephesus
08:09 “until the Festival of Pentecost,
08:11 “because a large door that leads to activity
08:15 has been opened to me.”
08:18 Here, the apostle Paul found a key,
08:21 and it didn’t require  moving to another location.
08:24 In this case,  the key was to stay where he was
08:28 and to take full advantage  of an opportunity right before him.
08:33 Sometimes, the key  to getting out of a rut in our ministry
08:38 is to take advantage of opportunities  we have right where we are.
08:43 For example,  have you considered auxiliary pioneering
08:47 or regular pioneering?
08:49 What about learning a foreign language
08:51 with the goal of helping  a nearby group or congregation?
08:56 Opening one door often leads  to other doors of opportunity.
09:01 For example,  a brother named Jacob wrote this:
09:05 “When I was seven,  many of my classmates were Vietnamese.
09:10 “I wanted to tell them about Jehovah,
09:12 “so after a while  I made plans to learn their language.
09:16 “For the most part,
09:18 “I learned by comparing  the English and Vietnamese editions
09:21 “of The Watchtower.
09:23 “I also made friends in a nearby  Vietnamese-language congregation.
09:27 “When I was 18, I started pioneering.
09:30 “Later, I attended  the Bible School for Single Brothers.
09:34 “This helped me  with my present pioneer assignment,
09:37 “where I am the only elder  in a Vietnamese-language group.
09:41 “Many Vietnamese people are amazed  that I have learned their language.
09:46 “They invite me in,  and often I can study the Bible with them.
09:50 Some have progressed to baptism.”
09:54 The point is,  our ministry is what we make it.
09:59 If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut,
10:01 it will be boring.
10:03 If we use our keys  and if we take advantage
10:06 of opportunities that present themselves,
10:09 we will invigorate our ministry  and give it new meaning.
10:13 This doesn’t always involve  putting in more time in the ministry.
10:18 It could mean that we  simply ‘make the best use of our time’
10:22 as Ephesians 5:16 says.
10:26 In fact, there’s a saying:
10:28 “Don’t work harder; work smarter.”
10:32 The key to working smarter
10:34 could be as simple  as switching things up a bit.
10:37 For example:
10:39 Could we work with different publishers  instead of the same one all the time?
10:43 Could we try a different approach  to our presentation,
10:46 perhaps making better use  of the Bible or our videos?
10:50 Could we engage  in other aspects of the ministry,
10:53 such as cart witnessing  or phone witnessing?
10:57 Could we use our time  more effectively to reach people
11:01 when they’re most likely to be home?
11:04 Here’s something else  we could do to unlock a door
11:07 and invigorate our ministry.
11:09 Open your Bible to Acts 16:9, 10.
11:17 Now, here the apostle Paul found
11:19 a unique way to unlock  a door to greater joy.
11:23 Acts 16:9, 10 says:
11:26 “And during the night  a vision appeared to Paul
11:30 “—a Macedonian man  was standing there urging him and saying:
11:34 “‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’
11:38 “As soon as he had seen the vision,
11:40 “we tried to go into Macedonia,
11:43 “drawing the conclusion  that God had summoned us
11:46 to declare the good news to them.”
11:50 Notice, Paul didn’t think of all the reasons
11:54 he couldn’t step into Macedonia.
11:56 No, he took action
11:58 as soon as he was presented  with the opportunity.
12:01 Paul unlocked the door  to invigorate his ministry.
12:06 Sometimes we think  that only those who are young
12:10 can reach out to pioneer  or to serve where the need is greater.
12:14 But that’s not always the case.
12:18 You parents may be able to unlock  a door of opportunity for yourselves,
12:23 and think of the example  you set for your children when you do so.
12:28 That’s what a mother named Tara discovered:
12:33 “I started pioneering  when my youngest daughter
12:36 was in elementary school,” she says.
12:39 “It was important to me
12:41 “that my children see me serving Jehovah
12:44 to the best of my ability  as I encouraged them to reach out.”
12:50 Tara’s husband, Anthony,
12:52 saw the effect  that his wife’s pioneering had
12:54 and, in time,  he too joined the ranks.
12:58 This is what he said:
13:00 “When Tara became a pioneer,
13:02 “it made an immediate impact
13:04 “on daughters number one and number two,
13:07 “and they became pioneers.
13:09 “When I became a pioneer,
13:11 “daughters number three  and number four followed.
13:14 “I wish I had pursued  full-time service sooner,
13:18 as it made a huge impact  on the spirituality of the family.”
13:24 I can relate to this experience
13:26 because of the good example of my parents.
13:30 My mother was baptized in Canada
13:32 in 1940 when she was 16.
13:36 Jehovah’s Witnesses  had just been banned in Canada.
13:40 Her father had already died,
13:42 and her mother was opposed at that time.
13:45 The brothers had very little money,
13:48 but they encouraged  my mother to pursue spiritual goals.
13:51 With that encouragement,
13:53 she started pioneering in 1942
13:56 while the ban was still on in Canada.
14:00 In 1947, she was invited  to become a special pioneer
14:04 in the province of Quebec.
14:07 At that time,  special pioneers were required
14:10 to spend 200 hours  each month in the ministry.
14:14 With basically no money  and no family support,
14:18 she accepted that assignment.
14:20 This picture was taken  when she and her pioneer partner
14:24 were boarding the train to Quebec.
14:27 Whenever I see this picture,
14:29 it reminds me  of the intrepid spirit that my mother had
14:33 —not being afraid  to take on a challenging assignment,
14:37 but putting complete trust in Jehovah.
14:41 That spirit encourages me even to this day.
14:45 My father has that same spirit.
14:47 In the summer of 1976,  when I was 11 years old,
14:52 a new arrangement was announced  at our district convention
14:56 —auxiliary pioneering.
14:58 You could be an auxiliary pioneer
15:00 if you could devote 60 hours  in one month to the ministry.
15:05 The month of October 1976  had five weekends.
15:09 My father encouraged  our whole congregation
15:12 to try auxiliary pioneering that month.
15:15 So many brothers and sisters, including me,
15:19 decided to get a taste of pioneering.
15:22 It was a wonderful experience
15:24 that I will never forget.
15:27 Parents, your good example  will help your children
15:31 to have a living ministry  of their own that they will love.
15:36 Brothers and sisters,  if you find yourself in a rut,
15:40 there is no reason to stay there.
15:42 We’ve discussed several ways  to reinvigorate our ministry,
15:47 and with Jehovah’s help  we will be successful.
15:52 Now let’s meet a few brothers and sisters
15:55 who’ve expanded  and invigorated their ministry.
15:58 We’re sure you’ll appreciate their stories.
16:01 Our first experience comes from Brazil,
16:04 in South America.
16:06 Cristiano and Joana Souza
16:09 found the key to invigorating their ministry
16:12 in a congregation letter  encouraging individuals
16:16 to apply for the School  for Kingdom Evangelizers.
16:20 What new blessings  did they experience by reaching out?
16:32 We had our own house,
16:34 a certain amount of comfort.
16:37 My husband had a stable job,
16:39 and I was doing a lot where we were.
16:41 I had Bible studies.
16:43 I was already a regular pioneer, so I thought I was doing enough.
16:46 It was fine to stay there.
16:51 We’d often see the younger ones
16:53 going to Bethel, going to serve as special pioneers.
16:58 And once we reached our 40’s, I thought that since we’re getting older,
17:01 we won’t be able to reach out and do more for Jehovah.
17:04 But after a letter was read to the congregations,
17:07 well, that was really  the starting point for us to see
17:09 that we could do more for Jehovah.
17:12 When I heard that there was a school for couples up to 65 years old,
17:16 I said, “Cristiano, it’s now or never.”
17:19 So immediately at the first convention that held a meeting for interested couples,
17:23 we attended the meeting and realized that out of the requirements
17:27 there was one that my husband didn’t meet yet,
17:29 which was two years as a regular pioneer.
17:33 So I thought, ‘Why not?’
17:36 After the convention, I applied to be a regular pioneer.
17:39 So we made plans to attend the school.
17:42 But we didn’t want to stay there waiting to be accepted,
17:46 as there were no guarantees of being accepted
17:48 in the same year in which we applied.
17:50 We sold our house.
17:52 And two weeks later, we had sold all the furniture.
17:54 So we made arrangements to serve where the need was greater.
18:01 We took only what was necessary in our car.
18:03 But “what is necessary” is always too much.
18:06 When you get to the territory, you realize you didn’t even need everything you took.
18:10 We were really excited because we knew  the brothers were expecting us.
18:14 There was a gas station that belonged to a brother,
18:16 and when we arrived, the whole congregation
18:18 was waiting for us there  to welcome us.
18:21 Nine people!
18:22 And that had a great impact on us,
18:23 because you could see  the expression on their faces;
18:26 it was as if they were asking for help.
18:31 They helped us a lot.
18:34 I can honestly say  that they helped us more
18:38 than we helped them.
18:43 Now they would be able to have regular meetings
18:45 —a public talk every week.
18:47 You know, we were in São Paulo and we had all the meetings.
18:51 But in these remote areas, they need spiritual food from Jehovah so much.
18:55 But there needs to be people  willing to go and help.
19:02 Then one day, we had a wonderful surprise.
19:05 A brother called me and said, “Cristiano, have you checked your e-mails?”
19:09 We’d received a letter inviting us to the school.
19:14 The school really is a gift from Jehovah.
19:17 I’ve encouraged others that I know to attend the school
19:19 because you really feel how Jehovah cares for his organization.
19:25 And a small thing we can do is simply give our best,
19:29 and the school helps us do just that
19:32 —find out what is our best.
19:35 We were assigned to a congregation called Itiruçu.
19:39 The brothers are very loving, and we’re really happy in our assignment.
19:47 I do miss my house.
19:50 It’s nice to have your own house
19:52 and not to have to worry about paying rent.
19:54 I miss my hairdresser.
19:57 But nothing compares to the blessings and the joy
20:00 that comes from serving  where there’s a need.
20:03 This joy helps us to combat  any homesickness we feel
20:07 and stops us from developing any desire to go back home.
20:12 In the big city, everything’s very rushed.
20:15 I would only see my wife when I got home from work.
20:17 I’d be tired, and then also have to care for congregational matters.
20:20 So there wasn’t much time for us to be together.
20:23 Now it’s completely different.
20:25 We have much more time —during the ministry,
20:28 in the congregation,  being together at home.
20:30 So for us as a family, it has been very positive, very good.
20:36 We’re not tired. We’re not old in the sense—
20:38 No we’re not.
20:39 —of saying that we’ve got no more to give.
20:41 We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.
20:43 And we want to do more for Jehovah.
20:46 The school is proof that he wants us to do more.
20:50 We want to use our life to the full to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.
20:54 We are willing to go.
20:56 We feel it’s the only way to say a big “thank you”
20:59 to Jehovah for everything he’s done for us
21:02 —the territory, school,  the brothers, and Bible students.
21:07 What better way to thank Jehovah.
21:20 Do you feel the way  that Brother and Sister Souza felt
21:23 —that you’ve missed the chance  to do more for Jehovah?
21:27 They learned there were  doors of opportunity accessible to them
21:31 if they were willing to reach out.
21:33 Their choice to make themselves available
21:35 resulted in rich blessings.
21:38 But did you notice  when those blessings started?
21:42 Before the school,
21:44 they chose to serve  where the need was greater.
21:47 This had a profound effect on them,
21:49 deepening their appreciation  for spiritual provisions.
21:54 If you desire to enliven your ministry
21:57 by means of theocratic education,
22:00 consider ways you can prepare  your heart before you attend.
22:05 The Souzas’ example proves
22:07 that even the road  to expanding our ministry
22:10 can be deeply satisfying.
22:14 When we’re faced  with challenging assignments,
22:18 reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.
22:22 In what ways can we show that reliance?
22:26 I have the pleasure of introducing you  to a friend of mine,
22:29 Shane Brady, who is presently serving  along with his wife, Iolanda,
22:34 at the branch in Finland.
22:36 Brother Shane Brady and I  previously worked together
22:39 at the Canada branch.
22:41 Shane has been involved  in legally defending our brothers
22:44 for the past 22 years in many countries,
22:48 including Armenia, Kazakhstan,  and Kyrgyzstan.
22:53 Shane, it’s good to see you.  How are you doing?
22:57 I’m doing very well.  It’s great to see you too, Mark.
22:59 Shane, we want to ask you,
23:01 What have been some of the challenges
23:03 that you’ve faced  in accepting these assignments
23:06 in various countries in the world?
23:08 Well, there certainly have been  a few challenges.
23:11 One is frequent travel.
23:13 Another is language;
23:15 each country that we assist  has its own language.
23:18 Some court cases are very stressful,
23:22 and at times, we’ve faced firsthand
23:25 the hatred of our opposers.
23:29 Yes. And you know, Shane,  in spite of all that,
23:31 you and your wife have always been willing  to go on these assignments.
23:35 We appreciate your spirit so much.
23:37 Is there an experience  that you can share with us
23:41 that would give us a taste  of the kinds of situations
23:44 that you’ve had to deal with  in these countries?
23:46 Well, there have been many experiences.
23:48 But one experience comes to mind.
23:50 A few months ago,  there was a special pioneer,
23:54 and a case was started against him.
23:56 And if the decision was negative,  it could have had very serious consequences
24:00 for our work in that country.
24:02 So we did our best  to present a strong defense.
24:05 But as the trial progressed,
24:07 things didn’t seem to be going so well.
24:10 But on the last day of the trial,  everything changed.
24:14 We presented a motion,
24:16 and we asked the judge  to terminate the case against the brother.
24:19 Personally, I didn’t think  it would actually work.
24:22 But one older brother who we’ve worked with
24:24 over the years always told us,
24:26 “We need to give Jehovah something to bless.”
24:28 And so we did, and the results  were quite unexpected.
24:33 When we made the motion, the judge turned  to the prosecutor and asked,
24:36 “Well, what’s your opinion?”
24:38 And to our surprise,  the prosecutor agreed with our request,
24:41 and he even went beyond what we asked.
24:43 He said to the judge  that the government official
24:46 that started the case  against our brother should be punished.
24:49 Well, the judge agreed;  the case was terminated.
24:53 When we were walking out of the courtroom,
24:56 I looked at the other brothers with me  and we all said the same thing,
24:59 “What happened?”
25:00 It was obvious —Jehovah had intervened.
25:03 That’s wonderful, Shane.
25:05 I wish we had more time  to hear many more experiences.
25:08 But could you just share  at least one more with us?
25:10 Sure.
25:12 In another land where our work  is not recognized,
25:16 on the night of the Memorial, a number of the brothers were arrested
25:19 for so-called illegal religious activity.
25:23 They were all convicted at trial.
25:25 So arrangements were made  to appeal each of those cases,
25:28 and they were heard  before a different appeal court judge.
25:31 What at first seemed quite negative,  the loss at trial,
25:36 turned out to be an amazing result.
25:38 Let me give you just one example.
25:41 In one of the appeals,  as we were presenting the appeal,
25:44 not long into the case,  the appeal court judge stopped us,
25:48 and he began to ask us  many questions about the Bible
25:52 and about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.
25:54 So for quite some time,  we answered these Biblical questions,
25:57 and then the case continued.
25:59 And then after some minutes,  the judge stopped us again.
26:02 And this time the judge said,  “I remember reading in the Bible”—
26:06 The judge said this,  “I remember reading in the Bible
26:09 “that Jesus said:  ‘If they have persecuted me,
26:12 they will persecute you also.’”
26:14 So we said to the judge:  “Yes, indeed. Jesus said that.”
26:18 The judge asked,  “Do you think that’s the reason why
26:21 Jehovah’s Witnesses  are having problems in this region?”
26:25 Well, what could we say  but agree with the judge.
26:28 But that wasn’t the end of it.
26:30 As the case continued a few minutes more,  the judge stopped us again.
26:34 And this time the judge said:  “You know, I’m not sure if Jesus said this.
26:38 “It’s in the Bible where he said:
26:40 “‘Where there are two or three  gathered together,
26:43 there I am in your midst.’”
26:45 And we assured the judge,  “Indeed, those are Jesus’ words.”
26:48 The judge looked out at this old courtroom,
26:51 which was filled  with our brothers and sisters, and he said,
26:53 “Well, Jesus must be in our midst today.”
26:57 We felt like breaking into applause.
27:00 At the end of the court hearing,
27:02 the judge ruled in our favor  and acquitted the brother,
27:04 and the judges in all of the other cases  also acquitted our brothers.
27:08 It was just a thrilling experience!
27:10 Oh, that’s wonderful;  that’s wonderful, Shane.
27:12 Thank you so much  for sharing those experiences.
27:15 You know, despite the challenges  that you’ve had to face,
27:18 how do you feel about the way  you and Iolanda have benefited
27:22 from being involved in accepting  these challenging assignments
27:25 in various parts of the world?
27:27 Well, we have benefited  in so many ways, Mark.
27:31 Our relationship with Jehovah has deepened.
27:34 Certainly, our trust in Jehovah
27:36 has been strengthened.
27:39 And we’ve experienced firsthand the love
27:41 of the amazing worldwide brotherhood.
27:44 Could I just share one experience about that?
27:46 Please, please do.
27:48 Two years ago, we were involved in a case
27:51 where police had raided  a congregation meeting in one country.
27:54 They had brutally beaten the brothers  and threatened the sisters.
27:58 It was just terrible!
28:00 Some weeks later in the court case
28:02 that started against the brothers
28:04 (that the police brought  against the brothers),
28:06 during that court case,  the police repeatedly tried
28:09 to arrest me and another brother  I was working with.
28:11 Over two days they were trying to arrest us.
28:14 Even in the courthouse,  they tried to detain and arrest us.
28:18 And all through this, my wife, Iolanda,  was watching what was happening.
28:22 But do you know what was so remarkable?
28:25 It was that despite the brutal treatment
28:27 our brothers and sisters  had endured just a few weeks earlier
28:30 at the hands  of these very same police officers,
28:33 those dear brothers and sisters  came to our aid.
28:36 They were like a wall  of protection around us,
28:39 and they would not leave our side  until the ordeal was done.
28:43 It was love in action.
28:46 So to answer your question,  we have benefited in so many ways.
28:49 We don’t regret for a moment  accepting this thrilling assignment.
28:54 Well, thank you so much, Shane.
28:57 Please give our love to Iolanda as well.
28:59 We appreciate the tremendous work  that you’re accomplishing,
29:02 and may Jehovah’s spirit  continue to be with you.
29:05 It’s our privilege.
29:06 We look forward to continuing  to work with you, Mark.
29:10 Well, now,  what if getting yourself out of a rut
29:13 takes longer than expected?
29:16 We’re going to meet a couple from Italy
29:18 who had the goal to participate  in a special preaching campaign.
29:22 These campaigns  can be a life-changing experience
29:26 for the publishers involved,
29:28 pushing them, sometimes,  far out of their comfort zone.
29:32 However, the Di Giacintos  faced trying circumstances
29:36 that prevented them from participating,
29:39 but they did not stop knocking  on this door of opportunity.
29:46 We live in a beautiful,  quiet town in central Italy,
29:50 between the sea and the mountains.
29:53 We have many friends,  some of whom are good cooks.
29:59 We have been serving for some years  in a Romanian-language congregation,
30:03 and we preach to people who have moved  to Italy to seek a better life.
30:09 When we heard the announcement  about the special campaign,
30:11 we looked at each other  and said, “Let’s go!”
30:17 ‘A large door of activity’  was opening up to us.
30:25 But there was a problem—my job.
30:27 I would need a month’s leave of absence,
30:30 and that would be difficult.
30:32 We prayed, and we did research.
30:35 And during family worship,  we decided that in order to participate,
30:38 I would ask for a one-month leave from work.
30:41 But Jehovah had something else in mind
30:44 that would create  the right circumstances for us.
30:50 When I arrived at work the next day,  I found an unexpected situation.
30:54 Because of the failing economy,
30:56 my boss gave me and some other employees
30:58 a letter of dismissal.
31:00 I was not at all worried.
31:02 I trusted in Jehovah,
31:04 and I knew that this new situation
31:06 would allow me  to participate in the campaign.
31:12 Participating in this campaign  is a dream come true.
31:17 We wanted to participate in 2013,
31:20 but unfortunately things in life  do not always go as we would like.
31:30 We received some truly shocking news.
31:34 My father had been diagnosed  with pancreatic cancer.
31:39 Emotionally, it was not easy.
31:42 The tranquillity  we had dreamed and hoped for
31:45 was almost gone.
31:49 The only thing that could help me  at that moment was
31:52 the hope for what Jehovah promises us.
31:56 In addition to my father’s death,
31:58 I began to experience panic attacks.
32:01 I was afraid of something that didn’t exist
32:08 —afraid of not being able to move on.
32:13 It’s the kind of emotion  that leaves a lump in your throat,
32:15 and you can’t even breathe.
32:17 I realized that only Jehovah
32:20 could help me fill the void that I felt.
32:24 After a family worship,
32:27 Fabio and I decided to turn in  our regular pioneer applications.
32:32 I felt Jehovah at my side,
32:34 embracing and supporting me.
32:37 In the end, they turned out to be  the three most beautiful years of our lives,
32:41 which also allowed us  to participate in this beautiful campaign.
32:48 In Romania, there are  many isolated territories
32:51 that local brothers cannot work  because of the great distances to be covered.
33:00 It is really exciting to reach many people
33:03 by traveling on dirt roads  that are often muddy.
33:16 The people are generous,  hospitable, and genuine.
33:28 They almost always invite us into their homes
33:30 and are willing to talk to us.
33:38 Talking to people who do not know Jehovah
33:41 and who are still very much interested  in doctrinal topics is really exciting.
33:51 Experiencing firsthand  a culture different from ours,
33:55 seeing people who live a more simple life,
33:58 and trying to understand their needs
34:00 is an experience that we will take with us.
34:03 And it will help us  to preach more effectively
34:06 in our assigned  congregation’s territory in Italy.
34:17 Now we are stronger than when we left home.
34:20 This experience has made us  love the ministry even more.
34:27 We look forward to returning  to our home territory with renewed zeal.
34:36 We are certain that Jehovah will guide us  to further service opportunities
34:40 in order to help others know  his wonderful purposes.
34:47 What blessings did this couple experience
34:50 by staying focused on their goal?
34:53 It brought them the joy of full-time service.
34:56 Not even the threat of unemployment
34:58 caused them to waver  in their determination to participate.
35:02 After the campaign,  they returned to their home territory
35:06 with a renewed energy and zeal.
35:10 When we stay focused on Jehovah,
35:12 even in the most trying of circumstances,
35:15 it will strengthen our resolve  to serve him faithfully.
35:21 Juuso and Pauliina Halme,  a couple from Finland,
35:25 now serving in Sierra Leone,  in West Africa,
35:28 were invited to accept an assignment
35:31 that seemed overwhelming.
35:33 What happened when some  of their worst fears came true?
35:38 How did Jehovah provide  “the power beyond what is normal”
35:42 to help them to endure?
35:46 Worrying doesn’t help us.
35:49 There is no need, really,  to worry about what could happen.
35:52 Even if it happens, let Jehovah show
35:55 how he can handle the situation.
35:57 He can actually do it in ways  you could never expect.
36:02 We are Juuso and Pauliina Halme.
36:05 We loved our assignment  in the Finland branch.
36:07 We had wonderful friends.
36:10 Our families, they were very close.
36:13 We had time to be with them often.
36:16 In 2014, we got the Yearbook
36:19 and that had an account of Sierra Leone.
36:23 And I was reading that account,
36:25 and I remember saying  a couple of times to Pauliina,
36:27 “This would be a tough place.”
36:29 After coming back from Gilead,  I couldn’t believe it;
36:32 we got a letter saying
36:35 that we had been reassigned  to Sierra Leone branch.
36:39 And it was a huge change for us.
36:42 Then what we did  is we Googled Sierra Leone
36:45 and what we saw was only about a civil war
36:49 that took place years ago.
36:51 An Ebola outbreak  was starting in West Africa.
36:55 Some of our relatives  were worried about that.
36:58 That was our impression,  first impression, about the country.
37:02 We were terrified, and we couldn’t sleep.
37:05 We just prayed the whole night.
37:07 And really, with the reassignment,  our greatest fear was my father.
37:11 He had been terminally ill  for about two years,
37:15 and we knew that at some point  it would get worse.
37:18 He would need more help  and also Juuso’s mother.
37:22 So were we able to travel back to Finland?
37:25 It’s so expensive,  and we didn’t have savings.
37:28 Although we had all those fears,
37:31 after praying about it a lot,
37:34 we just realized  that we could not say no.
37:37 And we realized  that this assignment was from Jehovah.
37:40 Let’s go there.
37:42 Let’s get to work.  Let’s give our best to it.
37:47 Then actually in three months,  our greatest fear came true.
37:52 It really happened
37:54 that Juuso’s mom  called us and she told us
37:57 that Juuso’s father’s situation had changed.
38:01 So we immediately started to check flights.
38:04 And then the next call was
38:07 that he had passed away.
38:11 We were able to get flights, fly back home,
38:15 support my mother,  and help with the funeral.
38:18 We were so happy  when we finally got back to Sierra Leone.
38:22 And now we thought that we could focus
38:24 on our assignment and on our work at Bethel.
38:29 Then one day, we got another  Skype call from my father.
38:32 And then he told us  that he was diagnosed
38:35 with an extremely aggressive cancer,
38:37 and he’s in hospital now,  and he asked us
38:41 to come back to Finland for a visit.
38:46 We had a beautiful ten days  together with my father.
38:49 Then, finally, he passed away.
38:52 Yeah, that was really  the lowest point in our life.
38:55 That came out of the blue;  we were not expecting it.
38:59 We had two widows to take care of.
39:02 So we were really wondering
39:04 if we could continue  in our assignment in Sierra Leone.
39:09 At that time,  one of our favorite scriptures was
39:12 Isaiah 30:15
39:14 that “your strength will be  in keeping calm and showing trust.”
39:19 And when we poured our hearts  to Jehovah in prayer,
39:23 we could see so well how Jehovah  helped us to stay calm
39:28 and have peace.
39:31 And we got some good advice here  from mature brothers
39:34 not to make any quick decisions.
39:36 So we put our trust in Jehovah,  and we could just see
39:40 that it was Jehovah’s will that we continue  in our assignment in Sierra Leone.
39:45 The fact is that, really,  the blessings always
39:49 surpass any of the challenges.
39:52 And we have come to love  our assignment in Sierra Leone.
39:56 Our brothers and sisters,  they are so faithful in Sierra Leone
39:59 despite their problems and challenges.
40:02 They give beautiful examples for us.
40:05 Being in a country where there is a lot  of potential, a lot of work, . . .
40:09 . . . you can have as many Bible studies  as you can conduct,
40:13 so it’s just a preaching paradise.
40:16 Going through these experiences,
40:19 we are so happy that Jehovah  is the Writer of our story.
40:22 And, for sure,  there’s a happy end.
40:25 If he wants to take you there, go there;
40:28 see what Jehovah  has in mind for you.
40:30 And then you can really  “taste and see that Jehovah is good.”
40:37 Despite heartbreaking challenges,
40:40 the Halmes saw Jehovah’s loving support
40:43 and they did not give up!
40:46 When we extend ourselves for Jehovah,
40:49 we can be confident  that he will help us in good times
40:53 and in difficult times.
40:55 We learn that we are safe  with Jehovah, come what may.
41:00 What quality do you need  to serve in a foreign land,
41:04 like Brother and Sister Di Giacinto,
41:07 or to face the fear of the unknown,  like Brother and Sister Halme?
41:12 We need courage.
41:14 As was announced last year,
41:17 courage is  this year’s regional convention theme.
41:21 The drama presentation  will focus on a Bible character
41:25 that needed great courage  to accomplish his ministry.
41:29 It’s our pleasure  to present a preview of the drama
41:34 The Story of Jonah  —A Lesson in Courage and Mercy.
41:44 Papa says you are a prophet.
41:46 I was a prophet.
41:50 I tried to run away from Jehovah.
41:53 But when has Jehovah ever asked a prophet
41:55 to go to a foreign land
41:57 to preach judgment against it?
42:01 What about the people?
42:03 They worship gods of war.
42:05 What do you think they’re like?
42:14 So, what will you do now?
42:19 You need to go back inside, Joanna.
42:21 No! We can talk to Father!
42:23 Joanna!
42:24 I can’t go to Nineveh.
42:25 I just can’t do it.
42:26 You’re Jehovah’s prophet.
42:28 Not anymore.
42:30 Go home, Joanna.
42:49 O Jehovah,
42:52 out of the depths of the Grave,
42:54 I cry to you for help.
43:01 What will become of me?
43:09 No doubt you eagerly anticipate  this year’s regional convention program
43:14 held around the world starting this month.
43:18 Many of the segments on our program thus far
43:21 have featured some aspect  of preaching in a foreign land.
43:25 If current circumstances  don’t permit you to serve in this capacity,
43:29 be assured that there’s much you can do
43:32 in your home territory  to revive your ministry.
43:35 For example—
43:37 Out of the over 100,000 publishers  in South Korea,
43:42 there are more than
40,000 zealous regular pioneers.
43:46 What efforts have they made
43:48 to reach more people  in frequently worked territory?
43:52 Let’s find out.
43:55 I started pioneering  less than a year after I got baptized,
43:59 so I was eager to sharpen
44:01 my preaching skills.
44:02 I really wanted to share my hope with others.
44:05 But it’s so hard to meet people
44:07 at their homes during the day.
44:08 And even if we do meet them,
44:10 it’s not easy to start a conversation.
44:14 Our congregation organized  convenience store witnessing
44:16 from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.,
44:19 so I thought this might be  a good way to reach people
44:22 and have meaningful conversations.
44:25 But the thing is that I’m not  a morning person,
44:27 so getting up early was not easy.
44:31 So I had to make some adjustments.
44:33 I tried not to make plans
44:35 or to stay up late the night before.
44:40 The sample presentations  from our meetings were also very helpful.
44:45 In the past, I hardly got the chance  to open the Bible while I was preaching,
44:50 but now I have a few Bible studies.
44:55 Even the time we spend traveling  from one convenience store to the next
44:58 is very uplifting spiritually  because we use that time
45:02 to share our preaching skills  and build each other up.
45:05 Having a regular share  in convenience store witnessing
45:08 has allowed me to be  more productive in the ministry.
45:12 I feel like I’m progressing spiritually
45:14 and becoming a better minister  of the good news.
45:18 On weekdays, I work to support my family.
45:22 So I would usually go out in field service
45:25 on the weekends.
45:27 But it wasn’t easy  to find people at their homes
45:30 because they usually make plans and go out.
45:33 And you know,
45:35 it’s hard to get excited  about the preaching work
45:37 when you’re not meeting many people.
45:40 I wanted to set  a good example for my family,
45:43 but I found it a real challenge  to maintain my zeal for the ministry.
45:49 So I began to regularly participate  in evening witnessing
45:52 on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.
45:57 I usually get off work around 5:00 p.m.
46:00 After a long day at work,
46:02 it’s not always easy to get dressed
46:04 to go out in the field ministry.
46:07 But I kept up with my return visits
46:10 and had some really encouraging experiences.
46:13 A young man I had been visiting
46:16 accepted a Bible study,  and he’s making fine progress.
46:19 My children are able to see  how much joy I get from the ministry,
46:23 and so now they too  are able to give a bold witness
46:27 in their own words,  even in the face of opposition.
46:31 I am very proud of my children.
46:34 Training and teaching them how to make
46:36 effective return visits and Bible studies
46:39 brings me great joy.
46:41 We serve in a small rural town
46:44 where many leave home  early in the morning to work in the field,
46:46 and they return late at night.
46:48 So it’s not easy
46:50 to find people at home during the daytime.
46:52 And even if we do find them at their doors,
46:55 it’s not easy to develop  a meaningful Bible-based conversation,
46:57 let alone make return visits  and conduct Bible studies with them.
47:02 After returning home  from preaching at night,
47:05 I would ask myself,
47:07 ‘Did I have a meaningful share  in the ministry today?’
47:10 It’s a small rural town.
47:12 So many people are concerned  about what their neighbors
47:14 would think if they talked with us.
47:17 So even those who were interested  in learning more about the Bible
47:21 were reluctant to have  Bible discussions with us.
47:25 It was really unfortunate.
47:29 We tried to figure out  the right time to call on people,
47:33 and we found out  that many householders are more relaxed
47:37 and willing to talk about the Bible
47:39 if we visit them  around nine or ten o’clock in the evening.
47:45 I gave much thought  on how I could help my Bible students
47:48 have a regular intake of spiritual food.
47:51 One of my students  worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
47:55 so I asked her if we could arrange
47:58 to study early in the morning.
48:00 She agreed.
48:02 I often tell my Bible students,
48:04 ‘Just call me whenever you have  a little time to talk.’
48:08 When I get those calls,  no matter what time it is,
48:12 it’s time to rush out that door.
48:17 There was one elderly lady  who was in her early 80’s
48:20 who had attended church all her life.
48:24 To accommodate her needs,
48:26 I visited her  around nine or ten o’clock in the evening
48:30 for our Bible studies.
48:34 I would come home  feeling tired and hungry,
48:37 but the satisfaction of knowing
48:39 that I’ve helped her learn  more about the truth
48:41 enables me to maintain my joy.
48:47 Now I am able to conduct  about 12 Bible studies.
48:50 I try to “become all things  to people of all sorts”
48:55 in order to look after their needs.
48:57 And it brings me great satisfaction and joy
49:00 to see my studies make progress
49:02 because that’s really how Jehovah wants us
49:04 to be carrying out our ministry.
49:10 You might feel that you’ve worked  every corner of your home territory.
49:15 But just like a literal fisherman  adapts to the time when the fish are biting,
49:19 we need to work when people can be found.
49:23 Cast your nets into productive waters!
49:27 Our sister arranged her schedule  to call on her Bible student
49:31 at nine or ten in the evening.
49:34 Of course, we want to use good judgment
49:36 to call at times that are both practical  and safe for our territory.
49:41 But by being adaptable in when, where,
49:45 or how we preach the good news,
49:47 we may yield good results like those  of our fellow Witnesses in South Korea.
49:53 This will help us to have  a meaningful share in the all-important work
49:57 of finding those who  are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”
50:04 Regular pioneers work in a powerful way
50:07 to help their brothers and sisters  get the most out of their ministry.
50:11 But does that mean  that they’re impervious to being in a rut,
50:15 as mentioned earlier?
50:18 In the following dramatization,
50:20 see how one pioneer sister comes to realize
50:23 the need to adjust her approach  to the field ministry.
50:42 It was really nice of Maria  to invite me in service.
50:49 But I already have plans with Sarah.
51:00 We have similar service schedules,
51:02 and we really enjoy working together.
51:14 I try to get most of my time  during the week, . . .
51:21 Anyone made plans to work together?
51:23 . . . though I do meet with the group  sometimes on Saturday.
51:26 Sister Martin,  can you work with Rachel today?
51:32 Thanks, everyone.
51:34 Anyone made plans to work together?
51:38 OK.  Joanna, you can work with Sarah.
51:48 Anyone made plans to work together?
51:50 Sarah, do you want to go with me  to a Bible study?
51:52 Could I work with Alisha?
51:53 Uh-huh.
51:54 OK, let’s work together.
51:55 Joanna, could you two work together, please?
51:57 Um, I’d love to.
51:59 But I’ve just arranged to work with Sarah.
52:01 I’m so sorry.
52:02 Uh-huh.  No problem.
52:06 Maria, could you work with this sister?
52:29 While doing my Bible reading that night,
52:31 I was really affected
52:33 by the words found  at 2 Corinthians 6:12, 13:
52:38 “You are restricted  in your own tender affections . . .
52:42 Open your hearts wide.”
52:50 It struck me that some in the congregation
52:52 missed out on a beautiful blessing
52:55 by drawing away from the apostle Paul.
53:01 I realized I was limiting my joy as well
53:06 by not working with more in the ministry.
53:10 I was going through the motions  of pioneering,
53:13 but I was stuck in the same routine.
53:16 How are you, Maria?
53:18 Good. And you?
53:19 Let me ask you something.
53:20 Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?
53:23 Oh, I’d love that! Uh-huh.
53:24 That’s great.
53:24 So later we’ll make the arrangements. OK?
53:26 The meeting is starting.
53:27 We’d like to invite everyone  to take your seats
53:29 because our meeting is about to begin.
53:36 My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.
53:41 I really learned a lot from them.
53:50 I started going out regularly  on the weekends . . .
53:55 Anyone made plans to work together?
53:57 . . . and working with different ones  in the ministry.
54:04 And I learned more about Sister Martin
54:06 after one day in the ministry
54:09 than I had in years  of seeing her at meetings.
54:14 Sarah and I still enjoy working together.
54:18 But I’ve found that by working  with a variety of friends,
54:21 my own joy has increased.
54:37 I’m so glad I ‘opened my heart wide.’
54:48 Joanna came to realize  that her privilege of full-time service
54:52 was more than just hours and a schedule.
54:55 By working with a variety  of sisters in the ministry
54:59 and supporting her field service group,
55:01 she could strengthen and encourage others.
55:04 It was within her power to help.
55:07 But with what result?
55:09 It rejuvenated her ministry!
55:12 We truly appreciate  the love and sacrifice of our pioneers.
55:18 Have you been inspired  to make a change in your ministry?
55:22 Whether big or small,  at home or abroad,
55:26 we can find the satisfaction that comes
55:29 from reinvigorating our ministry.
55:32 That’s the theme featured  in the music video entitled
55:35 I’m Making a Change.
55:45 Been thinking it over— Each day it seems
55:53 My serving Jehovah  Falls into the same routine.
56:01 The things that I’m doing now  I’ve always done.
56:06 So it’s clear that I need to break out— Out of my comfort zone.
56:14 Now I’m making a change starting from today.  I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.
56:21 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction and trusting in you.
56:45 It’s gonna take courage,  But now I see
56:53 How changing my thinking  Renews and refreshes me.
57:00 I’m trying some new things,  and I’m energized.
57:06 There were doors that were opening wide,  But I never realized.
57:13 So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way.  I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.
57:21 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction and trusting in you.
57:45 Back then, I remember when  It seemed it wouldn’t happen.
57:52 Some days, well, I have to say,  I didn’t know why.
58:00 But now I can see just how  My boldness led to blessings.
58:08 I’m sure there’ll be many more  As time goes rolling by.
58:15 Now I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.  I’m making some changes along the way.
58:23 Jehovah, I saw what I had to do,  And you gave me your blessing
58:31 for trusting in you.
58:38 So I’m making a change starting from today.  I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.
58:46 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction.
58:53 So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way.  I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.
59:01 Jehovah, I see what I need to do.  I’m changing direction
59:08 and trusting in you—
59:17 Trusting in you.
59:43 The Governing Body deeply appreciates  the work of each Kingdom publisher.
59:48 You dear brothers and sisters
59:51 are having a regular share  in the preaching work,
59:54 and we commend you for that.
59:56 You can be sure  that “God is not unrighteous
1:00:00 so as to forget your work  and the love you showed for his name,”
1:00:05 as the Bible says at Hebrews 6:10.
1:00:09 Just knowing that can help us  to take a fresh look at our ministry
1:00:14 and can invigorate us  to participate to the fullest extent.
1:00:19 To conclude,
1:00:20 we bring you greetings
1:00:22 from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
1:00:26 This mountainous region has a rich history
1:00:29 as a traditional meeting place
1:00:31 between eastern and western cultures;
1:00:33 it dates from the Middle Ages.
1:00:36 Because of the diverse religious beliefs  within the country,
1:00:40 the 1,160 publishers
1:00:43 must adapt their preaching methods
1:00:46 to appeal to the hearts of those who listen.
1:00:49 This is the city of Mostar,
1:00:51 which sits on the Neretva River.
1:00:54 The Neretva River
1:00:55 flows for nearly 230 kilometers,
1:00:58 or almost 143 miles.
1:01:02 Mostar was a former front line  during the wars of the 1990’s,
1:01:07 and many buildings still bear the marks
1:01:09 of the intense fighting that took place.
1:01:12 Likewise, the aftermath  left many people in this region
1:01:17 with emotional and mental scars.
1:01:19 Our brothers and sisters are working hard
1:01:22 to bring the hope of something good
1:01:24 to those in need.
1:01:28 In the 1930’s,  a pioneer brother named Alfred Tuček
1:01:33 spearheaded the preaching work  in the city of Mostar.
1:01:37 He was actually one of the first  in the former Yugoslavia to pioneer.
1:01:41 Today, the congregation in Mostar  has about 60 publishers,
1:01:47 including nine pioneers  and four field missionaries.
1:01:51 They bring their warm love and greetings
1:01:54 to all of us around the world!

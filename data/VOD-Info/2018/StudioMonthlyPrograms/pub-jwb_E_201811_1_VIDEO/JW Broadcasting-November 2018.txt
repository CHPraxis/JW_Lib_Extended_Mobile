00:00:01 ‎Welcome to the program!
00:00:04 ‎We have many spiritual gems  ‎to share with you.
00:00:07 ‎For example,
00:00:09 ‎how can we build a good relationship
00:00:12 ‎with Jehovah despite a difficult upbringing?
00:00:17 ‎The story of Dimitris and Agis
00:00:19 ‎is very encouraging.
00:00:22 ‎And how can we continue  ‎to honor our marriage mate,
00:00:26 ‎even if he or she is an unbeliever?
00:00:29 ‎Notice how Emma has learned
00:00:31 ‎to do just that  ‎with her husband, Thomas,
00:00:34 ‎despite their differences.
00:00:37 ‎And this month’s music video highlights
00:00:40 ‎who really is a true friend.
00:00:43 ‎This is the November 2018 program
00:00:47 ‎of JW Broadcasting!
00:01:09 ‎Our adversary, Satan the Devil,
00:01:12 ‎will do all he can to break our integrity
00:01:15 ‎and destroy our friendship with Jehovah.
00:01:18 ‎Meet Brother Viktor Winter.
00:01:21 ‎He is a Russian brother  ‎who lives in Germany.
00:01:25 ‎In 1958, at the age of 21,
00:01:29 ‎Brother Winter was sent  ‎to a Siberian labor camp
00:01:33 ‎simply for practicing his faith in Jehovah.
00:01:36 ‎In total, he spent 13 years
00:01:40 ‎in multiple Soviet prison camps
00:01:42 ‎and 5 years in exile.
00:01:45 ‎Despite the persecution,
00:01:47 ‎he maintained his Christian qualities.
00:01:57 ‎On July 24, 1958,
00:02:00 ‎I got baptized;  ‎and on November 5, 1958,
00:02:05 ‎I already got arrested  ‎for refusal to do military service.
00:02:10 ‎The second time I was convicted was again
00:02:14 ‎for refusal to do military service.
00:02:17 ‎The next court trial took place in 1963.
00:02:21 ‎I got seven years ‎​—⁠and five years exile.
00:02:25 ‎They added three years
00:02:27 ‎that I did not serve  ‎for refusal to go to the army.
00:02:33 ‎I was taken to Mordovia.
00:02:37 ‎This was the first camp  ‎where all believers were put,
00:02:40 ‎amongst them 360 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:44 ‎The detentions were very strict
00:02:47 ‎because around this time the governments
00:02:49 ‎and party politics changed.
00:02:51 ‎They decided that prisoners must suffer hunger.
00:02:58 ‎The food rations were cut.
00:03:01 ‎This was very difficult, very difficult, I must say.
00:03:07 ‎And the winters can be cold.
00:03:09 ‎Even in March, it could get as cold
00:03:11 ‎as 35 degrees Celsius ‎​—⁠minus 35 (-31°F).
00:03:18 ‎Spiritual things were for all of us
00:03:21 ‎​—⁠the brothers in this camp​— ‎⁠top priority.
00:03:25 ‎First of all, all 360 people
00:03:28 ‎were divided into four congregations,
00:03:31 ‎and every congregation was divided into groups.
00:03:34 ‎Every congregation  ‎had responsible brothers as overseers
00:03:37 ‎and so had every group.
00:03:40 ‎We conducted the study not just once a week,
00:03:43 ‎but we conducted the study every day,
00:03:46 ‎every day.
00:03:48 ‎And brothers took this very seriously.
00:03:50 ‎We had no time for any worldly thoughts.
00:03:55 ‎Every Saturday and Sunday,
00:03:57 ‎we had a very powerful choir​ ‎—⁠men’s voices.
00:04:01 ‎When we were singing,  ‎we stationed guards
00:04:05 ‎near the oversight house  ‎where supervisors were on duty.
00:04:09 ‎And if one of them came out,  ‎it was signaled
00:04:13 ‎from one brother to the next  ‎so that if he or they came closer,
00:04:18 ‎we would already be gone.
00:04:20 ‎But the most interesting thing
00:04:23 ‎was that we were singing in the zone.
00:04:26 ‎We were the prisoners,
00:04:28 ‎but our listeners were outside.
00:04:31 ‎They were sitting up in the trees
00:04:33 ‎​—⁠the children of the supervisors,
00:04:36 ‎officers, and guards.
00:04:38 ‎And they were listening to our choir.
00:04:42 ‎All together during that time,
00:04:45 ‎I was in seven prison camps.
00:04:48 ‎I spent about 13 years there
00:04:51 ‎and another 5 years in exile in Siberia.
00:04:56 ‎But when I was convicted the last time,
00:05:00 ‎the head of the interrogation department  ‎came into my cell and said,
00:05:03 ‎“Viktor, when you finish all your prison terms,
00:05:07 ‎you will have nothing at all​ ‎—⁠no family, no children.”
00:05:10 ‎I smiled at him and asked:
00:05:13 ‎“How do you know this,  ‎Citizen Lieutenant Colonel?
00:05:16 ‎I don’t know it either,  ‎but I do trust in Jehovah.”
00:05:22 ‎Today, I do have a family
00:05:24 ‎and do have my wife and my children.
00:05:28 ‎We continue to serve Jehovah.
00:05:31 ‎And my greatest joy
00:05:33 ‎is when my six-year-old granddaughter
00:05:36 ‎stands next to me in the Kingdom Hall
00:05:39 ‎and sings songs that praise Jehovah.
00:05:45 ‎Well, to make it simple,  ‎I would put it this way:
00:05:48 ‎Preserve your love  ‎for Jehovah and for your brothers.
00:05:52 ‎Joy in Jehovah’s service ‎​—⁠never lose it!
00:05:57 ‎We will not fear anything bad
00:06:00 ‎​—⁠neither cold nor hunger​—⁠
00:06:03 ‎nothing.
00:06:07 ‎Did you notice the evil words
00:06:09 ‎of the head  ‎of the interrogation department?
00:06:12 ‎“You will have nothing at all
00:06:15 ‎—no family, no children.”
00:06:18 ‎Today, Brother Winter  ‎is over 80 years old.
00:06:23 ‎What a blessing, as you can see,
00:06:26 ‎that he is now surrounded by a big family!
00:06:30 ‎By maintaining his theocratic routine
00:06:33 ‎even under persecution,
00:06:35 ‎Brother Winter  ‎avoided developing bitter feelings
00:06:38 ‎toward his persecutors.
00:06:40 ‎In this way,
00:06:42 ‎he maintained  ‎his relationship with Jehovah
00:06:45 ‎and he conquered  ‎the evil with the good.
00:06:51 ‎And that is also the theme  ‎for this month’s program:
00:06:55 ‎“Keep Conquering the Evil With the Good.”
00:06:59 ‎This challenging exhortation
00:07:02 ‎was written by the apostle Paul  ‎at Romans 12:21.
00:07:06 ‎It’s challenging  ‎because we live in a world
00:07:10 ‎that is alienated  ‎from God and the truth,
00:07:12 ‎a world that tries  ‎to squeeze everyone into its mold.
00:07:18 ‎Isaiah 5:20 shows how the world
00:07:21 ‎has changed God-given standards.
00:07:24 ‎It reads:
00:07:26 ‎“Woe to those who say  ‎that good is bad
00:07:30 ‎“and bad is good,
00:07:33 ‎“those who substitute darkness for light
00:07:36 ‎“and light for darkness,
00:07:38 ‎“those who put bitter for sweet
00:07:41 ‎and sweet for bitter!”
00:07:43 ‎By adhering to the standard
00:07:46 ‎“of healthful words” in the Scriptures
00:07:48 ‎and to the examples  ‎of faithful servants of the past,
00:07:52 ‎we can ‘conquer the evil with the good.’
00:07:57 ‎The faithful man Enoch was born
00:07:59 ‎when Adam  ‎was about 600 years old,
00:08:02 ‎which means  ‎that Enoch and Adam
00:08:04 ‎were contemporaries  ‎for about 300 years.
00:08:08 ‎However, there is no record
00:08:11 ‎of any contact between them  ‎during that period of time.
00:08:15 ‎The Scriptures indicate  ‎that violence and hate for God
00:08:19 ‎were widespread  ‎in that pre-Flood world.
00:08:23 ‎Many centuries later,
00:08:25 ‎the disciple Jude described  ‎the fear-inspiring prophecy
00:08:29 ‎that God gave to Enoch
00:08:31 ‎about Jehovah coming  ‎with his holy myriads,
00:08:34 ‎legions of mighty angels in battle array,
00:08:38 ‎to bring destruction to all the ungodly.
00:08:42 ‎Enoch fearlessly went about declaring
00:08:45 ‎the coming judgment and destruction and,
00:08:48 ‎what is more, he did it alone!
00:08:51 ‎The prophecy was fulfilled ‎in the global Deluge,
00:08:56 ‎and it set the pattern
00:08:58 ‎of a greater destruction yet to come.
00:09:02 ‎No wonder that Genesis 5:24 tells us
00:09:06 ‎that “Enoch kept walking  ‎with the true God.”
00:09:11 ‎Enoch’s example gives us courage
00:09:13 ‎to remain firm for true worship
00:09:16 ‎even if family and friends ‎stand apart from us.
00:09:20 ‎Enoch did not try to fit in ‎with the evil crowd
00:09:24 ‎of the pre-Flood world,
00:09:26 ‎and we don’t want to fit in
00:09:28 ‎with the present dying world ‎and its evil ways.
00:09:32 ‎We may feel alone at times,
00:09:34 ‎but we are reminded  ‎that Jehovah never abandoned Enoch,
00:09:39 ‎and neither will He abandon ‎His faithful servants today.
00:09:45 ‎We imitate Enoch
00:09:47 ‎by not allowing  ‎the evil surrounding us
00:09:50 ‎to undermine our faith in Jehovah.
00:09:54 ‎Like Enoch, we can  ‎‘conquer the evil with the good’
00:09:58 ‎by avoiding bad associations,
00:10:01 ‎sticking close to Jehovah God
00:10:03 ‎and the earthly part of his organization,
00:10:06 ‎and boldly proclaiming the good news.
00:10:11 ‎Elisha the prophet
00:10:13 ‎refused to engage in ‘paying evil for evil,’
00:10:17 ‎even when it seemed justified.
00:10:19 ‎The account is found
00:10:21 ‎at 2 Kings 6:14-23.
00:10:28 ‎Syria was at war with Israel.
00:10:30 ‎The king of Syria was enraged
00:10:33 ‎because Elisha  ‎was able to foresee wherever it was
00:10:37 ‎that Syria was planning  ‎to ambush the Israelites.
00:10:41 ‎Elisha would warn  ‎the king of Israel, and he, in turn,
00:10:45 ‎would keep his troops away ‎from the place of ambush.
00:10:50 ‎The king of Syria became exasperated
00:10:53 ‎and wanted desperately  ‎to take the prophet Elisha captive
00:10:57 ‎to stop him  ‎from warning the king of Israel.
00:11:01 ‎It came about  ‎that the king of Syria learned
00:11:05 ‎that Elisha was in the city of Dothan,
00:11:08 ‎so the king sent horses,
00:11:10 ‎war chariots, as well as a large army
00:11:13 ‎to surround Dothan by night
00:11:15 ‎in order to take Elisha captive.
00:11:19 ‎The following morning,
00:11:21 ‎Jehovah listened to Elisha
00:11:23 ‎and did something amazing.
00:11:26 ‎He struck the Syrian troops
00:11:29 ‎with a temporary form of blindness,
00:11:32 ‎and Elisha guided all those troops,
00:11:34 ‎not back to Syria, but to Samaria,
00:11:38 ‎where the king of Israel resided.
00:11:41 ‎The king of Israel was anxious
00:11:43 ‎to strike down and kill the Syrian troops,
00:11:46 ‎but Elisha said to him,
00:11:48 ‎as recorded in verses 22 and 23
00:11:51 ‎of 2 Kings chapter 6:
00:11:54 ‎“‘You must not strike them down.
00:11:57 ‎“‘Do you strike down  ‎those whom you have taken captive
00:12:01 ‎“‘with your sword and with your bow?
00:12:03 ‎“‘Give them bread and water  ‎so they may eat and drink
00:12:07 ‎“and return to their lord.’
00:12:10 ‎“So he spread a great feast for them,
00:12:12 ‎“and they ate and drank,
00:12:15 ‎after which he sent them away ‎to return to their lord.”
00:12:20 ‎What a shock this must have been  ‎to the Syrian soldiers,
00:12:23 ‎who likely thought  ‎that they were as good as dead!
00:12:27 ‎This astounding turn of events
00:12:30 ‎was far better than ‘paying evil for evil.’
00:12:33 ‎How do we know it was better?
00:12:36 ‎The latter part of verse 23 says:
00:12:40 ‎“And not once did the marauder bands
00:12:43 ‎of the Syrians come again ‎into the land of Israel.”
00:12:47 ‎Can you imagine  ‎the men of the Syrian army
00:12:50 ‎relating to their king  ‎what had taken place?
00:12:53 ‎They went out to take Elisha captive.
00:12:56 ‎However, Elisha,  ‎with the help of Jehovah’s spirit,
00:13:00 ‎had taken  ‎the Syrians captive without a battle.
00:13:04 ‎The Syrian king  ‎must have been dumbfounded
00:13:07 ‎when he heard the report.
00:13:09 ‎And you can be sure  ‎that the soldiers
00:13:11 ‎of the Syrian army  ‎were not only grateful
00:13:14 ‎but they acquired  ‎a very respectful fear of Jehovah
00:13:18 ‎and of his prophet Elisha.
00:13:21 ‎The good done to the Syrians
00:13:24 ‎would not be soon forgotten.
00:13:27 ‎Like Elisha,
00:13:29 ‎we want to do  ‎what is good for people,
00:13:32 ‎including those  ‎who do not view us favorably.
00:13:36 ‎When tragedies such as fires, floods,
00:13:39 ‎earthquakes, and hurricanes strike,
00:13:41 ‎we go out of our way
00:13:43 ‎to comfort people with the Scriptures.
00:13:46 ‎Also, Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:13:48 ‎serving as relief workers are well-known
00:13:51 ‎for the practical assistance they render
00:13:53 ‎to fellow believers and to others.
00:13:56 ‎As a result, many people  ‎have changed their view of us
00:14:01 ‎and have come to appreciate  ‎that in these last days,
00:14:04 ‎Jehovah does indeed have ‎“a people for his name” on the earth.
00:14:10 ‎At 2 Timothy 2:23-25,
00:14:15 ‎the apostle Paul encourages us
00:14:18 ‎to display qualities  ‎that make us different from the world.
00:14:21 ‎He says:
00:14:23 ‎“Further, reject foolish  ‎and ignorant debates,
00:14:28 ‎“knowing that they produce fights.
00:14:30 ‎“For a slave of the Lord  ‎does not need to fight,
00:14:34 ‎“but needs to be gentle toward all,
00:14:37 ‎“qualified to teach,  ‎showing restraint when wronged,
00:14:42 ‎instructing with mildness  ‎those not favorably disposed.”
00:14:47 ‎And then Paul explains the desired result:
00:14:51 ‎“Perhaps God may give them repentance
00:14:54 ‎leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.”
00:14:58 ‎Paul was “gentle toward all”
00:15:01 ‎and “qualified to teach.”
00:15:03 ‎He ‘showed restraint’  ‎when he was imprisoned
00:15:06 ‎by the Roman authorities ‎around 60 or 61 C.E.
00:15:10 ‎He spent about two years  ‎under house arrest in Rome,
00:15:14 ‎perhaps even being chained to a guard.
00:15:17 ‎He had done nothing  ‎to merit imprisonment.
00:15:21 ‎However, he did not dwell ‎on the evil done to him,
00:15:25 ‎and he did not allow it ‎to make him bitter
00:15:29 ‎and resentful of Roman authorities.
00:15:32 ‎Rather, at Philippians 1:12-14,
00:15:37 ‎Paul wrote:
00:15:39 ‎“Now I want you to know, brothers,
00:15:43 ‎“that my situation has actually turned out
00:15:46 ‎“for the advancement of the good news,
00:15:48 ‎“so that my prison bonds  ‎for the sake of Christ
00:15:51 ‎“have become public knowledge
00:15:53 ‎“among all the Praetorian Guard  ‎and all the rest.
00:15:56 ‎“Now most of the brothers in the Lord ‎have gained confidence
00:16:00 ‎“because of my prison bonds,
00:16:02 ‎“and they are showing all the more courage
00:16:04 ‎to speak the word of God fearlessly.”
00:16:08 ‎In his letter to Titus
00:16:10 ‎in chapter 3, verses 1 and 2,
00:16:13 ‎Paul gives reminders  ‎on how Christians today
00:16:16 ‎can ‘conquer the evil with the good’
00:16:18 ‎by showing proper respect
00:16:21 ‎for governmental authorities ‎wherever we may live.
00:16:25 ‎He writes:
00:16:26 ‎“Continue reminding them  ‎[fellow Christians]
00:16:31 ‎“to be in subjection and to be obedient
00:16:34 ‎“to governments and authorities,
00:16:37 ‎“to be ready for every good work,
00:16:40 ‎“to speak injuriously of no one,
00:16:44 ‎“not to be quarrelsome,
00:16:46 ‎“but to be reasonable,
00:16:48 ‎displaying all mildness toward all men.”
00:16:53 ‎Paul followed his own advice.
00:16:56 ‎While in custody in Rome,
00:16:58 ‎Paul wrote inspired letters
00:17:00 ‎to Christian congregations ‎in Greece and Asia Minor,
00:17:04 ‎and we today benefit  ‎from the counsel in those letters.
00:17:08 ‎Never do we read in his letters
00:17:11 ‎criticism aimed at human rulers
00:17:14 ‎or encouragement for Christians
00:17:16 ‎to favor one political figure ‎or party over another.
00:17:20 ‎He was “no part of the world,”
00:17:23 ‎and he knew that man’s only hope
00:17:27 ‎was the Kingdom of God.
00:17:30 ‎Paul was a spiritual man,
00:17:33 ‎and he ‘conquered the evil with the good’
00:17:36 ‎by following  ‎Jesus’ instructions at Mark 12:17
00:17:40 ‎of giving “Caesar’s things to Caesar,
00:17:43 ‎but God’s things to God,”
00:17:46 ‎all the while displaying  ‎“a mildness that belongs to wisdom.”
00:17:53 ‎At 1 Peter 2:21,
00:17:56 ‎we receive further direction
00:17:58 ‎about the course that we are to follow.
00:18:01 ‎Peter writes:
00:18:03 ‎“In fact, ‎to this course you were called,
00:18:07 ‎“because even Christ suffered for you,
00:18:10 ‎leaving a model for you  ‎to follow his steps closely.”
00:18:15 ‎Some of Christ’s steps  ‎are enumerated
00:18:18 ‎in verses 22 and 23, ‎where it reads:
00:18:21 ‎“He [Jesus] committed no sin,
00:18:25 ‎“nor was deception found in his mouth.
00:18:29 ‎“When he was being insulted,
00:18:31 ‎“he did not insult in return.
00:18:33 ‎“When he was suffering, ‎he did not threaten,
00:18:37 ‎“but he entrusted himself
00:18:40 ‎to the One who judges righteously.”
00:18:43 ‎Jehovah is  ‎“the One who judges righteously.”
00:18:47 ‎However, the Jewish religious leaders
00:18:50 ‎did not judge the Christ righteously.
00:18:53 ‎They insulted Jesus frequently
00:18:56 ‎and even accused him of having a demon.
00:18:59 ‎Jesus did not stoop
00:19:01 ‎to “return evil for evil,”
00:19:04 ‎hurling insults or threatening people.
00:19:08 ‎Insults and threats  ‎do not open hearts
00:19:12 ‎to accept the good news.
00:19:15 ‎When Jesus was on trial,
00:19:17 ‎the Jewish religious leaders ‎spurred the crowd on
00:19:20 ‎to cry out for his execution.
00:19:23 ‎The Roman authorities  ‎had Jesus nailed to a torture stake
00:19:26 ‎to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.
00:19:30 ‎While suffering on the torture stake,
00:19:33 ‎what did Jesus speak about?
00:19:36 ‎Did he curse the Roman soldiers
00:19:38 ‎who had mistreated him  ‎and were now executing him?
00:19:41 ‎To the contrary,
00:19:43 ‎he ‘conquered the evil with the good.’
00:19:47 ‎Among Jesus’ last words
00:19:50 ‎are those recorded at Luke 23:34:
00:19:54 ‎“Father, forgive them,
00:19:56 ‎for they do not know  ‎what they are doing.”
00:20:00 ‎Jesus knew  ‎that the Roman soldiers
00:20:03 ‎were ignorant ‎of who he really was
00:20:05 ‎and did not know  ‎what they were doing.
00:20:08 ‎He could forgive them with the hope
00:20:10 ‎that they would eventually respond
00:20:12 ‎to the truth and become his disciples.
00:20:16 ‎In every respect,
00:20:18 ‎Jesus ‘conquered the evil with the good,’
00:20:21 ‎and he always displayed  ‎complete confidence
00:20:25 ‎in “the One who judges righteously,”
00:20:28 ‎Jehovah God.
00:20:30 ‎We want to demonstrate the same kind
00:20:33 ‎of confidence in Jehovah and in his Word
00:20:36 ‎that Jesus displayed.
00:20:39 ‎We do our best to imitate the Christ
00:20:42 ‎by applying the spirit-inspired counsel
00:20:44 ‎at Romans 12:17, 18:
00:20:49 ‎“Return evil for evil to no one.
00:20:54 ‎“Take into consideration
00:20:56 ‎“what is fine  ‎from the viewpoint of all men.
00:21:00 ‎“If possible, as far as it depends on you,
00:21:03 ‎be peaceable with all men.”
00:21:07 ‎Heeding this counsel  ‎is particularly important
00:21:10 ‎in homes that are religiously divided.
00:21:13 ‎The Christian mate resists the temptation
00:21:17 ‎to repay an unkind word or act
00:21:19 ‎with another unkindness.
00:21:22 ‎Really, no good comes  ‎from ‘returning evil for evil.’
00:21:27 ‎On the contrary, such an attitude
00:21:30 ‎can only aggravate the situation.
00:21:32 ‎In the domestic setting,
00:21:34 ‎a wife who shows genuine kindness ‎to her husband
00:21:38 ‎after he makes unpleasant comments ‎about her beliefs
00:21:42 ‎may well diffuse ‎a potentially explosive situation.
00:21:48 ‎At Proverbs 31:12,  ‎we are told how a capable, God-fearing wife
00:21:53 ‎deals with her husband:
00:21:55 ‎“She rewards him with good,
00:21:59 ‎not bad, all the days of her life.”
00:22:02 ‎Additionally, by taking “into consideration
00:22:05 ‎what is fine from the viewpoint of all men,”
00:22:08 ‎Jehovah’s people  ‎have often overcome prejudice
00:22:11 ‎by providing practical assistance
00:22:14 ‎to their neighbors as opportunity affords,
00:22:16 ‎and particularly when a disaster strikes.
00:22:20 ‎We conscientiously adhere
00:22:23 ‎to Romans 12:19, which states:
00:22:27 ‎“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,
00:22:30 ‎“but yield place to the wrath; ‎for it is written:
00:22:35 ‎“‘“Vengeance is mine;
00:22:37 ‎I will repay,” says Jehovah.’”
00:22:41 ‎The footnote on verse 19 shows
00:22:44 ‎that Paul is telling us  ‎to yield to “God’s wrath,” or anger.
00:22:48 ‎Jehovah is the one  ‎who will set matters straight,
00:22:52 ‎and he will do it  ‎much better than we ever could.
00:22:56 ‎As James 1:20 states:
00:22:59 ‎“Man’s anger  ‎does not bring about God’s righteousness.”
00:23:05 ‎The theme of this discussion
00:23:07 ‎is summarized exquisitely
00:23:09 ‎at Romans 12:20, 21
00:23:13 ‎with this direction  ‎to all of Jehovah’s people:
00:23:17 ‎“But ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him;
00:23:22 ‎“‘if he is thirsty,  ‎give him something to drink;
00:23:27 ‎“for by doing this  ‎you will heap fiery coals on his head.’
00:23:32 ‎“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,
00:23:36 ‎but keep conquering the evil with the good.”
00:23:42 ‎Let’s now turn  ‎to a modern-day example
00:23:45 ‎of conquering evil with good.
00:23:49 ‎In South Korea,
00:23:51 ‎19,000 of our brothers  ‎have at some point
00:23:54 ‎been imprisoned  ‎for their Christian neutrality.
00:23:57 ‎But inside the prison walls,
00:24:00 ‎our brothers have the support  ‎of their fellow Christians.
00:24:04 ‎We met a group  ‎of brothers who still cherish
00:24:08 ‎the friendships  ‎they developed while imprisoned,
00:24:11 ‎although it’s been about 40 years
00:24:14 ‎since their release.
00:24:25 ‎When I was 21 years old,
00:24:27 ‎I was sent to prison
00:24:29 ‎in the Nonsan military training center
00:24:32 ‎because I refused to serve in the military.
00:24:36 ‎The soldier working  ‎in the military prison came
00:24:39 ‎and started to beat me,  ‎and he beat me relentlessly.
00:24:45 ‎It was late December 1975.
00:24:49 ‎Four of the brothers were put
00:24:51 ‎into standing solitary confinement cells
00:24:53 ‎called dokgeochang.
00:24:57 ‎It literally feels like you are in a coffin.
00:25:02 ‎The outside temperature dropped
00:25:04 ‎to minus 13 degrees Celsius (8°F),
00:25:07 ‎and cold air seeped out from the wet walls.
00:25:13 ‎The brothers couldn’t lay down to sleep, ‎so they had to crouch,
00:25:17 ‎and I could hear them groaning all night.
00:25:23 ‎I extended my hand through the iron bars
00:25:26 ‎to the brother in the cell next to mine,  ‎and he did the same.
00:25:29 ‎We held hands
00:25:32 ‎and encouraged each other to stay strong.
00:25:38 ‎My health condition wasn’t really good
00:25:41 ‎while serving my prison sentence.
00:25:43 ‎I weighed about 47 kilograms (103 lbs),
00:25:46 ‎and without my family’s support,
00:25:49 ‎I was mentally and physically weak.
00:25:53 ‎Under these extremely difficult circumstances,
00:25:56 ‎there were times I wasn’t able to eat at all.
00:25:59 ‎During those times,  ‎the brothers provided me
00:26:02 ‎with porridge ‎—which was easy to digest—
00:26:05 ‎warm clothing,  ‎and a sleeping bag for the winter.
00:26:10 ‎I could really feel their love.
00:26:14 ‎Having been sent to prison three times,
00:26:17 ‎I truly feel that Jehovah showed interest in me
00:26:21 ‎and took care of me  ‎just as he promised at 1 Peter 5:7.
00:26:26 ‎He especially supported me through my brothers
00:26:29 ‎when I was facing difficulties.
00:26:33 ‎A day in the prison started
00:26:35 ‎with us eating breakfast
00:26:36 ‎and then moving 300 bricks.
00:26:39 ‎After lunch, we would have ‎to carry another 300 bricks.
00:26:44 ‎Because I usually finished my work early,
00:26:47 ‎I had a 20-minute break ‎before going back in.
00:26:51 ‎However, this brother named Park Byung-Man
00:26:54 ‎who was much stronger ‎and bigger than I was
00:26:58 ‎carried bricks all day long.
00:27:00 ‎I found out later that Park Byung-Man
00:27:04 ‎was carrying Choi Sung-Kyu’s share
00:27:06 ‎of bricks because of his frail health.
00:27:09 ‎This kind of brotherly love really moved me
00:27:14 ‎to start studying the Bible.
00:27:16 ‎I got baptized a year later
00:27:18 ‎in April of 1977 in the Anyang Prison.
00:27:22 ‎After getting baptized,
00:27:25 ‎my mother passed away,
00:27:27 ‎and two months before being released,
00:27:30 ‎my father passed away as well.
00:27:32 ‎So that time was especially difficult for me.
00:27:36 ‎But the brothers encouraged me
00:27:39 ‎with their warm words and kind gestures.
00:27:41 ‎Their encouragement really touched me
00:27:44 ‎and helped me to endure until I was released.
00:27:53 ‎One time, I had a severe stomachache.
00:27:56 ‎The symptoms were not getting any better
00:28:00 ‎with the medication I was given,
00:28:02 ‎so I was having a very difficult time.
00:28:06 ‎One day, we were served some vegetables
00:28:09 ‎as a side dish
00:28:12 ‎and one brother crushed
00:28:14 ‎and squeezed the vegetables ‎to make juice for me.
00:28:18 ‎He cared for me that way for several days.
00:28:22 ‎I really would like to see that self-sacrificing
00:28:26 ‎and loving brother once again.
00:28:29 ‎At the time, none of our publications
00:28:31 ‎other than the Bible were allowed into the prison.
00:28:35 ‎Of course, that included our songbook.
00:28:39 ‎The brothers memorized
00:28:41 ‎the lyrics from the songbook,
00:28:43 ‎and they would write them down.
00:28:45 ‎Also, there were some songs
00:28:48 ‎that were sung at the regional convention.
00:28:50 ‎Songs like . . .
00:29:07 ‎or
00:29:20 ‎We sang them silently together ‎even in this isolated place.
00:29:25 ‎It was a great source of encouragement
00:29:28 ‎to share the love among our fellow brothers.
00:29:30 ‎I remember this encouraging scripture
00:29:33 ‎from 1 Corinthians 10:13.
00:29:37 ‎It says that Jehovah  ‎‘does not let us be tempted
00:29:40 ‎‘beyond what we can bear ‎and will make the way out
00:29:43 ‎so we may endure it.’
00:29:46 ‎Although there were many challenges,  ‎I was convinced
00:29:49 ‎that Jehovah would always
00:29:51 ‎make a way out through our fellow brothers.
00:29:54 ‎Even though 40 years have passed,
00:29:56 ‎when we look back at those days, ‎the memories are still fresh
00:30:00 ‎and we are moved to tears at times.
00:30:04 ‎So to make a meaningful trip
00:30:06 ‎out of our 40 years of friendship,
00:30:08 ‎all the friends who went through the same trials
00:30:11 ‎decided to visit the headquarters  ‎in the United States together.
00:30:18 ‎It’s really refreshing to be here  ‎with everyone again today.
00:30:24 ‎It feels like I’m taking a field trip.
00:30:34 ‎I was especially moved to tears
00:30:37 ‎when I saw our old prison uniforms
00:30:39 ‎there in the museum
00:30:41 ‎at world headquarters ‎displayed in the neutrality section.
00:30:48 ‎While on the tour, the brothers sat
00:30:51 ‎and lay down on the floor ‎inside the dokgeochang
00:30:56 ‎and we were able to reflect on the times
00:30:57 ‎we spent together in prison.
00:31:03 ‎Our gratitude to Jehovah
00:31:05 ‎for giving us such loyal friends was renewed.
00:31:13 ‎Yes, through their brotherly love
00:31:16 ‎and the power and strength
00:31:18 ‎given to them by holy spirit,
00:31:20 ‎our Korean brothers were able
00:31:22 ‎to conquer the evil with the good.
00:31:26 ‎Although we may not be imprisoned,
00:31:29 ‎having true friends  ‎can help us through many trials.
00:31:33 ‎But what is a true friend?
00:31:37 ‎Where can we find them,
00:31:39 ‎and why are they so important?
00:31:43 ‎Our music video will answer these questions.
00:31:46 ‎It is entitled True Friends.
00:32:09 ‎Life can be hard  ‎if we walk it alone,
00:32:14 ‎living  ‎in these last days.
00:32:18 ‎Jehovah knows  ‎that we need friends
00:32:21 ‎to help us  ‎along the way.
00:32:26 ‎But where do we go?
00:32:28 ‎Where do we turn  ‎to find those true companions?
00:32:35 ‎Well, remember what ‎we learn in his Word.
00:32:43 ‎True friends ‎Love you when you’re down,
00:32:47 ‎Happy when you’re up, ‎Right by your side when trials come,
00:32:53 ‎Speak up if you’re wrong, ‎Commend you when you’re right,
00:32:57 ‎Keep you on track  ‎in the race for life,
00:33:01 ‎Help you keep  ‎Jehovah first right to the end.
00:33:07 ‎Yeah,  ‎that’s a true friend.
00:33:17 ‎A true friend  ‎shows love at all times.
00:33:21 ‎That’s in His Word, ‎we know.
00:33:25 ‎So if troubles appear, ‎don’t give in or fight.
00:33:29 ‎Say a prayer; ‎let it go.
00:33:33 ‎Whether we’re older  ‎or whether we’re young,
00:33:38 ‎we all  ‎got to stick together,
00:33:42 ‎And one day soon  ‎we’ll be in Paradise.
00:33:50 ‎True friends ‎Love you when you’re down,
00:33:54 ‎Happy when you’re up, ‎Right by your side when trials come,
00:34:00 ‎Speak up if you’re wrong, ‎Commend you when you’re right,
00:34:04 ‎Keep you on track  ‎in the race for life,
00:34:09 ‎Help you keep Jehovah ‎first right to the end.
00:34:14 ‎Yeah,  ‎that’s a true friend.
00:34:20 ‎Someone you trust,
00:34:22 ‎Someone who cares  ‎about you serving Jehovah,
00:34:28 ‎A shoulder to lean on  ‎and the right words to help you mend—
00:34:36 ‎Yeah,  ‎that’s a true friend.
00:34:53 ‎True friends ‎Love you when you’re down,
00:34:58 ‎Happy when you’re up, ‎Right by your side when trials come,
00:35:03 ‎Speak up if you’re wrong, ‎Commend you when you’re right,
00:35:08 ‎Keep you on track  ‎in the race for life,
00:35:12 ‎Help you keep Jehovah ‎first right to the end.
00:35:19 ‎True friends ‎Love you when you’re down,
00:35:23 ‎Happy when you’re up, ‎Right by your side when trials come,
00:35:29 ‎Speak up if you’re wrong, ‎Commend you when you’re right,
00:35:33 ‎Keep you on track  ‎in the race for life,
00:35:37 ‎Help you keep Jehovah ‎first right to the end.
00:35:44 ‎Yeah,  ‎that’s a true friend.
00:35:47 ‎That’s a true friend.
00:35:51 ‎Oh,  ‎that’s a true friend.
00:35:59 ‎What a blessing it is to have true friends
00:36:02 ‎around us in the Christian congregation!
00:36:06 ‎But at times,
00:36:08 ‎our imperfection may create roadblocks
00:36:11 ‎between us and our dear friends,
00:36:14 ‎and we may start developing
00:36:16 ‎negative feelings about them.
00:36:19 ‎In this Bethel morning worship,
00:36:22 ‎pay attention to how Brother Geoffrey Jackson  ‎of the Governing Body
00:36:26 ‎helps us deal with such thinking.
00:36:30 ‎Well, perhaps we could take our Bibles
00:36:33 ‎and turn to Colossians 3:​13.
00:36:37 ‎And let’s analyze this verse together
00:36:39 ‎and see what it is that Jehovah expects of us.
00:36:43 ‎So in Colossians 3:​13,
00:36:46 ‎it says:  ‎“Continue putting up with one another
00:36:49 ‎“and forgiving one another freely
00:36:52 ‎“even if anyone has a cause  ‎for complaint against another.
00:36:55 ‎“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,
00:36:58 ‎you must also do the same.”
00:37:01 ‎Well, certainly this verse
00:37:03 ‎gives us plenty of food for thought ‎​—doesn’t it?​—
00:37:06 ‎areas in which, perhaps,  ‎we can work on and improve in.
00:37:10 ‎But what two things stand out
00:37:12 ‎as being required of us?
00:37:15 ‎Well, looking back,  ‎you notice the first one,
00:37:17 ‎“continue putting up with one another,”
00:37:20 ‎and then the second point,
00:37:22 ‎“forgiving one another freely.”
00:37:25 ‎Well, let’s look at that first expression:
00:37:28 ‎“Continue putting up with one another.”
00:37:30 ‎Well, what’s the difference  ‎between these two expressions?
00:37:34 ‎Well, we’re told that this first expression
00:37:37 ‎doesn’t refer to serious sins  ‎but perhaps talks about things
00:37:41 ‎that are irritating, annoying,
00:37:44 ‎things that we may not necessarily
00:37:47 ‎have a cause for complaint concerning,
00:37:49 ‎but they still get us very upset anyway
00:37:52 ‎​—these minor things.
00:37:55 ‎What are some of the things that annoy you?
00:37:57 ‎Let’s be honest.
00:38:00 ‎Are you annoyed when someone is always late?
00:38:05 ‎Are you annoyed when they’re always early?
00:38:09 ‎Are you annoyed when someone is outspoken?
00:38:13 ‎Does it annoy you when someone is too quiet?
00:38:17 ‎It’s amazing​ ‎—isn’t it?​—
00:38:19 ‎what the things that annoy us are.
00:38:21 ‎I remember back in the ’70’s,  ‎Brother Knorr gave an outstanding talk
00:38:25 ‎where he alluded to the fact  ‎that maybe there’s a sister in the congregation,
00:38:30 ‎and she’s hearing  ‎this other sister, new in the truth,
00:38:33 ‎answering up time after time,
00:38:35 ‎and in her heart, she’s thinking,
00:38:37 ‎‘Why doesn’t she just keep quiet?’
00:38:40 ‎Well, maybe we’ve all  ‎experienced those feelings.
00:38:43 ‎And if we’re judged on them, ‎perhaps we’ll agree:
00:38:47 ‎‘Well, it’s not justified;  ‎I don’t really have a cause,
00:38:50 ‎but it still irritates me.’
00:38:53 ‎It’s true—isn’t it?​— ‎the expression
00:38:55 ‎“Sometimes it’s not the mountains ‎ahead of us that cause problems,
00:38:59 ‎it’s the pebble in the shoe.”
00:39:01 ‎And it’s sometimes the small things
00:39:04 ‎that irritate us the most.
00:39:06 ‎I remember when I was serving
00:39:08 ‎in Western Samoa  ‎many years ago at the branch,
00:39:11 ‎we had quite a number of brothers  ‎from overseas working on construction.
00:39:15 ‎And there was one brother who had ‎the habit of first thing in the morning
00:39:19 ‎as he arrived before breakfast,
00:39:22 ‎saying, “Good morning!” to everyone.
00:39:26 ‎Some found that annoying.
00:39:30 ‎Maybe you can relate to that.
00:39:32 ‎And, no doubt, you feel  ‎very happy when you read the scripture
00:39:35 ‎at Proverbs 27:14,  ‎where it says in one translation:
00:39:39 ‎‘A loud and cheerful greeting ‎early in the morning
00:39:42 ‎is taken as a curse.’
00:39:45 ‎You may be thinking, ‘Amen to that.’
00:39:49 ‎And that brother ceased his habit ‎after he read that scripture​
00:39:52 ‎—or at least it was read to him.
00:39:56 ‎But we may not always be able ‎to find a scripture
00:39:59 ‎that backs up this irritation that we feel.
00:40:03 ‎So, what do we do?
00:40:04 ‎Well, what does it say?
00:40:06 ‎“Continue putting up with one another.”
00:40:09 ‎“Continue”​—it’s something  ‎that we just have to keep on doing.
00:40:13 ‎Now, that brings us  ‎to the second part of our verse,
00:40:17 ‎“forgiving one another freely.”
00:40:20 ‎It’s interesting, when we look  ‎at other translations of this verse,
00:40:24 ‎most follow the King James Version
00:40:27 ‎and just say “forgive.”
00:40:30 ‎The New World Translation says ‘forgive freely.’
00:40:34 ‎The reason is that this isn’t your normal
00:40:37 ‎Greek word for “forgiveness.”
00:40:39 ‎It denotes generosity,
00:40:42 ‎a willingness to go beyond what’s required.
00:40:46 ‎It’s interesting  ‎that The Watchtower even back in 1882
00:40:51 ‎was using that expression,  ‎to ‘forgive one another freely,’
00:40:55 ‎well before the time  ‎of the New World Translation.
00:40:58 ‎So this gives us something to think about
00:41:01 ‎because it’s not just a matter of forgiving,
00:41:04 ‎but we need to be generous about forgiving.
00:41:07 ‎We have to be willing to,   ‎as it were, bestow a pardon
00:41:12 ‎on someone  ‎who really doesn’t deserve that pardon.
00:41:16 ‎Now, why should we be interested
00:41:18 ‎in developing  ‎and working on these two aspects:
00:41:21 ‎“putting up with one another” ‎and ‘forgiving freely’?
00:41:25 ‎Well, we’ve heard  ‎the reasons many times before, haven’t we?
00:41:29 ‎The first one, of course,  ‎is that Jehovah has forgiven us.
00:41:33 ‎If we turn back just one chapter,
00:41:35 ‎chapter 2 of Colossians and verse 13,
00:41:39 ‎this point is highlighted for us.
00:41:42 ‎It says in chapter 2, verse 13:
00:41:45 ‎“Furthermore, though you  ‎were dead in your trespasses
00:41:48 ‎“and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh,
00:41:51 ‎“God made you alive together with him.
00:41:54 ‎“He kindly forgave us
00:41:59 ‎all our trespasses.”
00:42:01 ‎So this is the model  ‎that Jehovah has given us.
00:42:04 ‎It’s true,  ‎we sometimes can find some reason
00:42:09 ‎why we feel  ‎we don’t have to forgive someone else.
00:42:12 ‎But remember the illustration Jesus gave
00:42:15 ‎of the slave who had the huge debt.
00:42:17 ‎If you calculated it in denarius,
00:42:20 ‎there were 60 million denarii that he owed;
00:42:24 ‎he was forgiven that.
00:42:26 ‎Then he went after the other man
00:42:28 ‎who owed him just a small amount.
00:42:30 ‎But have you ever thought  ‎that if you asked that slave,
00:42:33 ‎maybe he would say: “Well, it’s true.
00:42:35 ‎“I really appreciate having everything forgiven, ‎but I still don’t have any money.
00:42:39 ‎“I need some money,  ‎so that’s why I wanted to get
00:42:42 ‎the other slave to give me the money.”
00:42:45 ‎Well, there’s always a reason ‎​—isn’t there?​—
00:42:47 ‎⁠even if it’s a distorted reason
00:42:49 ‎as to why we don’t follow Jehovah’s example.
00:42:52 ‎But looking back at Colossians 3:​13, ‎what does it say?
00:42:57 ‎“If anyone has a cause  ‎for complaint against another.”
00:43:01 ‎So that gives us a good idea, doesn’t it?
00:43:04 ‎The second reason, of course, is that
00:43:07 ‎we do need others to forgive us.
00:43:10 ‎The very things that annoy us
00:43:14 ‎and irritate us in others are sometimes
00:43:18 ‎the same things that we do to others.
00:43:20 ‎Have you ever noticed that?
00:43:22 ‎And how annoying it is  ‎when someone points that out to you:
00:43:24 ‎“You’re annoyed with that person?
00:43:26 ‎Don’t you realize what you do?”
00:43:29 ‎Well, that’s something good for us to remember​ ‎—isn’t it?​—
00:43:32 ‎the fact that we do need  ‎to have others forgive us.
00:43:35 ‎And then another reason
00:43:37 ‎is that it maintains the peace  ‎within the Christian congregation.
00:43:41 ‎The Watchtower made a comment on this.
00:43:43 ‎It said that in countries  ‎where our work is restricted or under ban,
00:43:48 ‎many of our brothers  ‎have to meet together in smaller groups.
00:43:53 ‎And when you do that, you get to know
00:43:55 ‎everyone’s weaknesses and idiosyncrasies.
00:43:58 ‎It’s so much easier to be annoyed by others
00:44:01 ‎when you’re dealing  ‎with small groups of persons.
00:44:05 ‎The Watchtower then made the comment
00:44:07 ‎what good training it is for us now
00:44:09 ‎to learn how to put up with one another
00:44:12 ‎when we’re in larger groups,
00:44:14 ‎because later we may need  ‎to worship Jehovah in smaller groups.
00:44:18 ‎So it’s good training for us  ‎as we keep peace in the congregation.
00:44:23 ‎And what can help us?
00:44:24 ‎Well, there are many different things ‎that can help us in this regard.
00:44:28 ‎The one point in the marginal reference
00:44:30 ‎you see there is at 1 Peter 4:​8,
00:44:33 ‎and that’s where it tells us we need
00:44:35 ‎to “have intense love for one another”​
00:44:39 ‎—not just love but “intense love.”
00:44:42 ‎And this word “intense” means “full strength.”
00:44:45 ‎Literally, it means “to stretch out our love.”
00:44:49 ‎So as we come across these things ‎that irritate us, annoy us, in life
00:44:54 ‎or if we come across persons  ‎who actually do sin against us,
00:44:58 ‎what should we keep in mind?
00:45:00 ‎“Continue putting up with one another.”
00:45:03 ‎‘Continue freely forgiving one another.’
00:45:07 ‎That sound advice  ‎also applies strongly in marriage,
00:45:12 ‎when two people decide  ‎to share their lives together.
00:45:16 ‎Perhaps your mate is an unbeliever.
00:45:19 ‎Differences in belief
00:45:21 ‎can cause a level of friction,
00:45:23 ‎but how one handles,  ‎or conquers, the situation
00:45:28 ‎can bring you peace  ‎and even be a great witness.
00:45:51 ‎How did 15 years go by so fast?
00:45:57 ‎We were so young when we got married
00:46:01 ‎—maybe too young.
00:46:04 ‎We had so little in common.
00:46:20 ‎When I started studying the Bible,
00:46:23 ‎I thought Thomas would be as excited ‎as I was to learn the truth.
00:46:40 ‎But every conversation we had on the subject
00:46:43 ‎seemed to turn into an argument.
00:46:52 ‎Looking back,  ‎I really wish I’d handled it better.
00:46:59 ‎As the years went by,
00:47:01 ‎he did become more open to discussion.
00:47:21 ‎But it’s been hard worshipping God alone.
00:47:24 ‎Others in the congregation  ‎are able to serve Jehovah together
00:47:28 ‎and even reach out for theocratic goals
00:47:31 ‎like the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:47:34 ‎something I would love to do.
00:47:36 ‎Why can’t I have a husband  ‎who loves Jehovah like I do?
00:47:41 ‎Abigail probably felt the same way
00:47:44 ‎but with more reason.
00:47:51 ‎Her husband was a bully and a drunkard
00:47:54 ‎and was despised by his entire household.
00:48:17 ‎At that time,  ‎many marriages were arranged,
00:48:20 ‎so Abigail had very little control ‎over her circumstances.
00:48:26 ‎But her words and actions
00:48:28 ‎showed that she was a spiritual woman
00:48:30 ‎who didn’t focus  ‎on what she could not control
00:48:32 ‎but on what she could.
00:48:35 ‎I determined to do the same.
00:48:38 ‎I meditated on Jesus’ words ‎at Matthew 19:6:
00:48:42 ‎“What God has yoked together, ‎let no man put apart.”
00:48:48 ‎To Jehovah, marriage is permanent
00:48:51 ‎—even my marriage to an unbeliever.
00:48:54 ‎So instead of dwelling on changing ‎my husband or my marriage,
00:48:58 ‎I focused on changing myself.
00:49:01 ‎Thomas does not love Jehovah,
00:49:03 ‎but he’s not a “Nabal” either.
00:49:06 ‎He is loyal, and he loves me.
00:49:09 ‎He is entitled to the respect that the Bible  ‎commands wives to show to their husbands.
00:49:13 ‎So I’m making an effort  ‎to be more respectful and loving to him.
00:49:17 ‎Thomas hasn’t developed an interest ‎in the truth or started studying.
00:49:22 ‎But I have the satisfaction of knowing ‎my God is pleased with me,
00:49:27 ‎and I have the same view ‎of marriage that he does.
00:49:53 ‎How exciting!
00:49:55 ‎Is Thomas slowly noticing ‎the benefits of the truth?
00:50:00 ‎No doubt,  ‎Emma’s faithful and respectful conduct
00:50:03 ‎has had a deep impact  ‎on how he views Jehovah.
00:50:08 ‎And the truth can really change a person.
00:50:12 ‎Getting to know Jehovah can help someone
00:50:15 ‎to get their life back on track.
00:50:18 ‎Two fleshly brothers,
00:50:20 ‎Dimitris and Agis Sotiropoulos,
00:50:23 ‎are good examples of how  ‎the good can conquer the evil
00:50:27 ‎despite a challenging upbringing.
00:50:36 ‎My father was a self-made factory owner.
00:50:39 ‎He started a business working ‎with rubber and plastics,
00:50:43 ‎and we led a financially comfortable way of life.
00:50:48 ‎But in the middle of the 1970’s,
00:50:52 ‎things started going badly with his work.
00:50:54 ‎For this reason,
00:50:56 ‎he fell into a depression,  ‎and he committed suicide.
00:50:59 ‎This was a great shock.
00:51:04 ‎I went to the wall and wrote the words
00:51:06 ‎“He lives.”
00:51:08 ‎I didn’t want to believe that from that day on,
00:51:12 ‎I wouldn’t see my father again.
00:51:18 ‎At the age of about ten, I began to develop
00:51:20 ‎strong antireligious tendencies.
00:51:23 ‎And later, at the age of 17,
00:51:26 ‎I also expressed them by participating
00:51:29 ‎in the most important incident
00:51:31 ‎of the student movement  ‎against the military junta
00:51:35 ‎that was prevailing in Greece ‎and ruling the country.
00:51:39 ‎I became a member of the Communist Party.
00:51:44 ‎I went to Santorini and started a business.
00:51:46 ‎I opened a bar.
00:51:49 ‎Of course, all this included unsavory things
00:51:52 ‎like immorality, drugs,
00:51:55 ‎and plenty of alcohol.
00:51:58 ‎A few months later,  ‎I left to study in Germany.
00:52:02 ‎It was the first time I met  ‎a brother engaging in street work.
00:52:05 ‎People would approach him,
00:52:07 ‎and some would swear; ‎some even spat at him.
00:52:09 ‎It impressed me immensely
00:52:12 ‎how he stood calmly  ‎and accepted this treatment.
00:52:15 ‎We had interesting conversations.
00:52:18 ‎My studies ended, and I returned to Greece
00:52:21 ‎to take on the responsibility of the factory.
00:52:24 ‎When I finished my studies in Germany,
00:52:27 ‎I left with a sense of deep respect
00:52:30 ‎for Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:52:33 ‎The influence of my friends
00:52:36 ‎led me to go into the military,
00:52:39 ‎and there I saw a huge amount of corruption.
00:52:42 ‎The hope I had that we humans
00:52:45 ‎would be able to succeed ‎without external help
00:52:48 ‎—without God— ‎began to collapse,
00:52:50 ‎and then the things I had heard
00:52:52 ‎from Jehovah’s Witnesses ‎suddenly came to my mind.
00:52:57 ‎The same afternoon,  ‎I sought out a family friend,
00:53:01 ‎the mother of a childhood friend, named Lily.
00:53:04 ‎I said to her, “Please give me a Bible
00:53:07 ‎and some Bible study publications ‎because I want to study them.”
00:53:11 ‎I read everywhere,
00:53:13 ‎and anything that I didn’t understand,
00:53:15 ‎I wrote down in a notebook.
00:53:17 ‎I got to the point, in just a few days,
00:53:20 ‎where I had written down 80 to 90 questions.
00:53:23 ‎Harry impressed me
00:53:25 ‎because every time I asked him a question,
00:53:28 ‎he gave me the answer from the Bible.
00:53:31 ‎That convinced me that I’d found the truth.
00:53:34 ‎So in that moment,
00:53:36 ‎I decided to leave the military  ‎and to quit smoking.
00:53:41 ‎A few months passed by,
00:53:43 ‎where I was occupied mostly with the factory,
00:53:46 ‎until I recognized
00:53:48 ‎that for me to make progress in the truth,
00:53:52 ‎I had to sell my shares in the factory.
00:53:55 ‎And on July 7, 1984, I was baptized.
00:53:59 ‎The authorities ‎—the police, the mayor,
00:54:02 ‎the health inspectors— ‎began to demand money
00:54:05 ‎so that I could keep the bar open.
00:54:11 ‎I refused all the things they asked of me,
00:54:13 ‎and so the war became harder
00:54:17 ‎until one night when I went  ‎to open the door to enter my home;
00:54:22 ‎I heard a tramping from behind,
00:54:24 ‎I tried to turn and see, ‎and as I turned,
00:54:27 ‎I was hit in the face.
00:54:29 ‎During that time,
00:54:31 ‎when all of this was happening, ‎my brother Dimitris arrived.
00:54:39 ‎As brothers,  ‎we never really had a relationship.
00:54:42 ‎When he came to Santorini ‎and began to talk to me
00:54:45 ‎and help me understand  ‎what was happening to me,
00:54:48 ‎I realized that this was a different Dimitris.
00:54:53 ‎I said to him, “I want us  ‎to start studying the Bible together.”
00:54:56 ‎I had the Bible with me  ‎almost everywhere I went
00:54:59 ‎so that I could read it.
00:55:01 ‎I realized that Jehovah was helping me  ‎to understand what I was living for.
00:55:06 ‎He was helping me to understand
00:55:08 ‎that I could have a real goal, a purpose,
00:55:11 ‎and a hope.
00:55:14 ‎On the day of my baptism, ‎I felt that I was drawing closer to Jehovah.
00:55:19 ‎I felt like my smile went from ear to ear.
00:55:24 ‎And now with Lydia,
00:55:26 ‎I have the great joy of serving
00:55:28 ‎in the Romany territory.
00:55:31 ‎We enjoy very nice Bible studies.
00:55:34 ‎It is truly something
00:55:36 ‎that shows you Jehovah’s love,
00:55:39 ‎interest, and affection
00:55:42 ‎—things that I had felt
00:55:44 ‎many years ago  ‎when I studied with my brother.
00:55:46 ‎Today, my brother and I  ‎love each other very much.
00:55:50 ‎It is a relationship characterized
00:55:53 ‎by brotherly love
00:55:56 ‎as it is expressed in the Bible.
00:55:59 ‎We are very close to each other.
00:56:01 ‎This is really a change.
00:56:04 ‎Now we are truly brothers!
00:56:10 ‎Today, both Dimitris  ‎and Agis serve as elders
00:56:15 ‎and have spent many years ‎in the full-time ministry.
00:56:18 ‎Have you noticed the many ways
00:56:20 ‎we have seen the good conquer  ‎the evil in this month’s broadcast?
00:56:24 ‎Our brothers in Korea
00:56:26 ‎were able to endure unjust imprisonment
00:56:29 ‎with the support of their fellow believers.
00:56:33 ‎Viktor Winter,  ‎who was also imprisoned,
00:56:36 ‎conquered the evil
00:56:38 ‎by maintaining a theocratic routine.
00:56:41 ‎Our music video helped us appreciate
00:56:44 ‎the value of our true friends ‎in the congregation,
00:56:46 ‎who will help us fulfill our ministry ‎in this wicked world.
00:56:51 ‎Also, Brother Jackson
00:56:54 ‎shared principles to help us ‎overcome negative feelings
00:56:57 ‎we may have about others ‎as a result of our imperfection.
00:57:02 ‎Over time,  ‎Emma learned to apply those principles
00:57:06 ‎in dealing  ‎with her unbelieving husband, Thomas.
00:57:09 ‎And finally,  ‎the truth conquered the evil
00:57:12 ‎when the Sotiropoulos brothers ‎were able to clean up their lives.
00:57:17 ‎Before we conclude, ‎we have an announcement to make.
00:57:21 ‎You will be happy to know
00:57:23 ‎that the next installment  ‎of the video series Was it Designed?
00:57:27 ‎entitled The Seahorse’s Tail
00:57:30 ‎is available on Video on Demand
00:57:32 ‎and jw.org starting this month.
00:57:37 ‎Perhaps you can watch it  ‎during your next Family Worship evening.
00:57:41 ‎Let’s also briefly visit  ‎our brothers and sisters in Portugal.
00:57:46 ‎As the most western country ‎in continental Europe,
00:57:49 ‎Portugal is known  ‎as the place where the land ends
00:57:52 ‎and the sea begins.
00:57:55 ‎Mainland Portugal  ‎has over 800 kilometers,
00:57:58 ‎or over 500 miles, of Atlantic Coast.
00:58:03 ‎In the southern part of the country,
00:58:05 ‎they have over 3,000 hours ‎of sunshine per year.
00:58:10 ‎Portugal became world renowned
00:58:12 ‎as a seafaring nation  ‎with colonies around the world.
00:58:18 ‎In the 15th century, ‎navigators and explorers
00:58:20 ‎from Portugal ‎traveled to distant places
00:58:23 ‎such as Brazil, India,  ‎and many parts of Africa.
00:58:28 ‎The good news reached Portugal in 1925,
00:58:32 ‎but the work was either restricted
00:58:34 ‎or under ban from 1926 to 1974.
00:58:41 ‎However, the brothers  ‎and sisters were good examples
00:58:43 ‎of “conquering the evil with the good.”
00:58:47 ‎Despite the restrictions and persecution,
00:58:50 ‎they continued to preach
00:58:52 ‎and gather together to worship Jehovah.
00:58:56 ‎When the Witnesses  ‎gained legal recognition in 1974,
00:59:01 ‎the country reported ‎about 13,500 publishers
00:59:06 ‎and almost 40,000 attended ‎the first public meeting.
00:59:10 ‎Today, the country reports ‎some 49,500 publishers
00:59:15 ‎and a ratio of 1 publisher  ‎to about 200 people
00:59:20 ‎—one of the lowest ratios in Europe.
00:59:24 ‎The ratio is even lower in Almada,
00:59:26 ‎which is across the Tagus River ‎from the capital city, Lisbon.
00:59:30 ‎In Almada, there are 16 congregations
00:59:33 ‎with almost 1,400 publishers in total
00:59:36 ‎with a ratio of 1 publisher ‎to about 100 residents.
00:59:41 ‎Many of the brothers and sisters ‎in Almada are older
00:59:45 ‎and endured faithfully during the ban,
00:59:48 ‎setting an example to the younger ones.
00:59:52 ‎In addition to theocratic activities,
00:59:54 ‎our brothers in Almada  ‎regularly come together to associate,
00:59:58 ‎which can include  ‎a game of soccer or singing songs.
01:00:10 ‎They all send their love and greetings
01:00:13 ‎to the worldwide brotherhood.
01:00:16 ‎This is JW Broadcasting
01:00:19 ‎from the world headquarters ‎of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

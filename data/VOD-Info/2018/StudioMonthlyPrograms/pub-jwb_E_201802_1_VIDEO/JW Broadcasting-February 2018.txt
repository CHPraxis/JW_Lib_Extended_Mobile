00:00 Welcome to this month’s broadcast.
00:03 Here are just a few highlights  of what we will enjoy:
00:07 Has anyone ever angrily confronted  you about your beliefs
00:10 and you found yourself  struggling to respond?
00:14 You are not alone.
00:16 In this dramatization, we will learn  how Grayson faces this same challenge.
00:22 With the right circumstances,  some have enjoyed full-time service
00:25 while successfully raising a family.
00:28 What did they do to make that possible?
00:30 The Schiller’s life story  will help answer that question.
00:35 We will see the excitement and benefits  that come from attending pioneer school.
00:40 But these students are not pioneers;
00:42 they are all in Bethel service.
00:45 And we will learn ways  to manage our time
00:47 so that we can do  “the more important things.”
00:50 All this and more  on this edition of JW Broadcasting!
01:14 Many have found public witnessing
01:16 to be an incredibly productive way  to share the good news in their territory.
01:20 Often, when we think  of this kind of ministry,
01:23 we might imagine being on a busy street  or in some other urban area.
01:28 Let’s see what it’s like  when public witnessing
01:30 is done in a very different location.
01:34 In the book of Romans,  the first chapter, verse 20,
01:36 it talks about how you  can perceive Jehovah’s creative power
01:40 by what we see in creation around us.
01:43 When you’re in a national park  and you see the beauty of these parks,
01:47 you immediately think of that scripture.
01:50 We have individuals driving
01:52 from an hour and a half
01:53 to over three hours one-way
01:55 to share in this form of witnessing.
01:59 National parks generally have
02:01 what is called a freeness of speech area.
02:03 So that allows us  to be able to get permission
02:06 to go into the parks  to set up our carts there.
02:09 It’s just a nice place to come and relax,
02:12 and when people are relaxed,  they’re wanting to talk.
02:16 They already kind of have  a sense of closeness with God;
02:19 it kind of gets them thinking  about their spirituality,
02:22 and then when they see our cart  displayed so nicely about that,
02:25 it kind of draws them toward that.
02:28 You will find visitors  from all parts of the world.
02:32 Many cultures are represented.
02:35 And quite often,  we will have literature in their language.
02:39 There are many that benefit  from our work at the carts.
02:43 But especially noteworthy are those
02:46 who do not have access to Bible literature.
02:50 A Chinese couple came up, and they said,
02:52 “Thank you for giving us  the Bible in our language.”
02:57 That made our day.
02:58 It was fabulous!
03:00 They may not stop.
03:01 They may not talk to us.
03:02 But they see it,  and that registers in their mind
03:04 —that they’ve seen this  at an airport or in their city.
03:07 And now they’re going to look into it  or go to the website and wonder:
03:10 ‘What was that all about?  What were those people doing there?’
03:13 We sit here sometimes
03:16 thinking we need to pinch ourselves
03:18 because it’s so beautiful  that we’ve been given the privilege
03:20 of doing the cart work  in a location like this.
03:25 Very soon,  these national parks will not just be
03:28 isolated places that we have to travel to
03:30 —the entire world will be that national park.
03:34 And what a joy it will be
03:35 when every single person alive
03:37 can enjoy that beautiful painting  that our Creator has made for us!
03:43 Jehovah’s qualities  can certainly be perceived
03:46 just by taking  the time to study creation.
03:50 So we can see the power  of giving a witness in a beautiful location
03:54 that naturally draws attention  to what Jehovah has made.
03:58 Of course,  permission from park authorities
04:00 is often needed in advance,
04:02 but this idea of buying out  time to appreciate something
04:07 takes us nicely  into our discussion for this month.
04:11 I would like to talk about a valuable asset
04:13 that every one of us possesses
04:15 —time.
04:17 It certainly is something  that is on our minds
04:19 as we go about our day’s activities.
04:22 Just think of how often  you look at a clock, your watch,
04:26 or your cell phone to check the time.
04:28 Why do we do that?
04:30 Probably to see  if we are ahead of time, on time,
04:34 behind time, or out of time!
04:36 But what exactly is time?
04:39 One dictionary says  it is “a nonspatial continuum.”
04:44 Another says  it is “the thing that is measured
04:48 as seconds, minutes,  hours, days, and years.”
04:53 To explain exactly what time is  in simple terms is nearly impossible,
04:58 and the Bible does not define it,
05:01 which may suggest that Jehovah knows
05:03 it is beyond our ability to understand fully.
05:07 But the Bible does discuss time.
05:10 It shows that Jehovah is very time conscious.
05:13 It speaks of time  as something that we should use wisely.
05:17 And it gives us  the amazing hope of living into infinity
05:21 —that is, endless time.
05:24 We do know this about time:
05:26 Every human has exactly the same number
05:29 of hours and minutes in each day.
05:32 Rich people cannot buy more hours,
05:34 and scientists cannot invent new minutes.
05:37 We can never recoup  the time we have wasted;
05:41 neither can we save it  to spend on another day.
05:44 Just think, we have exactly  the same number of hours
05:48 to use each day that Jesus Christ  had when he was on the earth!
05:52 And we can be sure  that no human used his time more wisely
05:57 than did God’s Son.
06:00 It has been said that time
06:02 is the most valuable thing  a human can spend.
06:05 And so it is up to us  how we will use the time
06:09 that is at our disposal.
06:11 In this regard, there is a Bible principle  that gives us good direction,
06:16 a principle that was shared  with us by the apostle Paul
06:19 at Philippians 1:9, 10.
06:23 He wrote in verse 9:
06:25 “And this is what I continue praying,”
06:28 and in verse 10,
06:30 “that you may make sure  of the more important things.”
06:34 Therefore, the theme of this month’s program
06:36 is “Make Time for  ‘the More Important Things.’”
06:42 This presents us with a two-fold challenge.
06:44 First, we have to determine
06:47 what are the more important things of life.
06:51 In the scripture we just read,  some Bible translations say
06:54 “have a sense of what is vital.”
06:57 So we must distinguish  between activities that are merely trivial
07:02 and those that really matter.
07:05 In addition to the obligation  to work to support one’s family,
07:09 to care for necessary household chores,
07:12 and to look after one’s children  or aging parents,
07:15 we have many important things  of a spiritual nature
07:19 that deserve our full attention:
07:22 reading and meditating on God’s Word,
07:25 studying the Bible personally  and in family worship,
07:28 preparing for and attending  congregation meetings,
07:32 caring for any responsibilities  that we have in the congregation,
07:36 and participating in the Christian ministry.
07:40 Besides all of that,  who does not want some time to rest,
07:44 to exercise, to work in the garden,
07:47 to enjoy some recreation,
07:50 or to visit with family and friends?
07:53 Have you ever felt that you did not have  enough time to do all those things
07:58 —that you have difficulty  fitting all the spiritual activities
08:02 into your busy life?
08:04 As much as we might like to,  we cannot add an extra hour to our day
08:09 or another day to our week  to accomplish more things.
08:13 So we have to be selective
08:16 about how we spend  the time that we have.
08:20 We will get the most accomplished
08:22 if we prioritize  the things that really matter.
08:27 And what does that mean?
08:29 To prioritize means to decide
08:32 which tasks are more important  and to do them first.
08:36 In other words,  decide what must be given attention
08:39 prior to other things.
08:43 There is a Bible proverb  that nicely illustrates
08:46 the importance  of prioritizing life’s activities.
08:50 Proverbs 12:11 states:
08:53 “The one who cultivates his land
08:56 “will be satisfied with food,
08:59 “but the one pursuing worthless things
09:01 is lacking good sense.”
09:04 What a clear warning that is for a farmer
09:07 not to fill up his day  with worthless endeavors
09:10 and waste the precious time that he  should be spending working in his field!
09:16 Likewise, a Christian  who diligently cultivates his spirituality
09:20 can be confident of Jehovah’s blessing,
09:23 whereas a person  who is distracted by worthless activities
09:27 puts his relationship with God in danger.
09:31 How can we avoid that?
09:33 By not taking valuable time  away from spiritual pursuits
09:37 to spend on the things that distract us
09:40 from serving Jehovah whole-souled.
09:44 For example, when it comes  to communicating with others,
09:48 what should take priority?
09:50 Starting our day  by giving Jehovah praise and thanks
09:54 in prayer for another day of life
09:56 or telephoning an old friend to catch up
09:59 on the latest news in his or her life?
10:02 There’s nothing wrong  with talking to a friend.
10:05 But we need to make sure we take the time
10:07 to talk to our very best Friend, Jehovah.
10:10 Obviously, it is more important  to communicate with our heavenly Father,
10:14 so praying to him should be a priority.
10:19 The apostle Paul had more  to say about time management.
10:23 At Ephesians 5:15-17, he wrote:
10:28 “So keep strict watch that how you walk
10:31 “is not as unwise but as wise persons,
10:34 “making the best use of your time,
10:37 “because the days are wicked.
10:39 “On this account stop being unreasonable,
10:42 “but keep perceiving what
10:44 the will of Jehovah is.”
10:47 Now we can address  the second part of our challenge:
10:50 to make ample time to care
10:53 for the more important things of life.
10:55 What does Paul’s counsel
10:57 to ‘make the best use of your time’  actually mean?
11:02 Literally, in Greek,  it means to ‘buy out the appointed time.’
11:07 That implies buying time  at the expense of something else.
11:12 So it helps to analyze  how our time is actually being spent
11:16 and to see what adjustments are needed
11:19 so that we can buy out, or make,  time for the more important things.
11:25 If we ‘perceive what the will of Jehovah is,’
11:28 then we certainly will want  to use as much time as possible
11:32 to forge an ever stronger  relationship with him
11:35 and to share fully in sacred service.
11:39 Do you have definite periods set aside  for the spiritual activities of life?
11:45 For congregation meetings,  the schedule is set for us.
11:48 We know exactly when  our congregation meets
11:51 for its midweek  and weekend meetings.
11:53 We just have to be sure  that we do not let
11:56 anything else get  in the way of our attending
11:59 because the meetings are a priority.
12:02 Hebrews 10:25 says ‘not to forsake’ them.
12:06 For everything else
12:08 —reading the Bible,  preparing for meetings,
12:11 family worship,  field service activity—
12:15 we have to set our own schedule
12:18 and stick to it as part  of a good spiritual routine.
12:23 As an example,  what does your family do
12:27 most Saturday mornings?
12:29 Many families have the routine  of going in field service every Saturday.
12:34 Rarely is anything allowed  to get in the way of that routine.
12:38 For them,  Saturday morning is not the time
12:41 for music lessons,  dance classes, cooking courses,
12:45 working out at the gym,  or anything else
12:47 —it is their time for field service.
12:51 Having a routine like that  makes life easier for everyone in the family.
12:55 No one has to wonder Friday night
12:58 what is going to happen Saturday morning.
13:00 The decision has already been made
13:03 to go out in the ministry that day.
13:06 Otherwise,  if we leave it up to chance every week,
13:09 then it means  that 52 times during the year
13:12 we have to decide  whether to go in service on Saturday.
13:15 How much simpler it is  to make the decision once and for all
13:20 that we will use  that time slot for the ministry,
13:23 barring any serious,  unforeseen circumstances.
13:28 Of course,  given your family’s situation,
13:30 another day of the week may work better.
13:32 But you get the point.
13:34 Sharing regularly in the Christian ministry  cannot be left up to chance.
13:39 At Mark 13:10,
13:41 Jesus prioritized the ministry when he said:
13:44 “The good news has to be preached first.”
13:48 So if spiritual matters are going  to take precedence in our lives,
13:53 we first have to make them priorities,
13:56 and second,
13:58 make ample time  to care for those priorities.
14:03 That means setting aside  definite periods of time
14:07 to build up our spirituality
14:09 and to stay fully involved  in our worship and service.
14:14 Ecclesiastes 3:1 reinforces this thought.
14:19 It states:
14:20 “There is an appointed time for everything,
14:24 a time for every activity under the heavens.”
14:28 We have to decide  when that “appointed time” is
14:31 for each of our spiritual activities.
14:34 If we are having difficulty with this,
14:37 can we shorten the time  we spend on hobbies, recreation,
14:42 sports, social networking
14:45 and devote that time  to our Bible reading, family worship,
14:49 meeting preparation, or field ministry?
14:52 If we can, we will find it  to be spiritually refreshing
14:56 and invigorating.
14:58 This was the experience  of a family man that I know
15:01 who began preparing better  so as to participate each week
15:05 in the “Digging for Spiritual Gems” portion  of the midweek meeting.
15:10 He made time on Sunday evenings for this.
15:13 All in his family  and congregation have benefited
15:16 from the excellent points he has learned
15:19 as he does research  on the assigned Bible reading,
15:22 and he feels good because of it.
15:25 One married couple decided to eliminate
15:28 some of their hobbies and personal projects.
15:31 They even packed them up  and put them out of sight.
15:33 Why?
15:35 So as not to be distracted by those things.
15:38 They were nonessential activities  that they decided they could do without.
15:44 Likely, we could all benefit  from taking inventory of our lives
15:49 and limiting any unnecessary activities
15:52 that may be interfering  with our spiritual routine.
15:55 Imagine how rewarding that would be!
15:58 Just think, if we could buy out
30 minutes each day
16:02 from doing something  that is not essential,
16:04 that is about how much time it would take
16:06 to read the entire Bible in one year.
16:10 Or if we could buy out  an extra hour or two
16:13 each week for the field ministry,
16:15 think of how much more  we could accomplish
16:17 and how happy  that would make God and Christ,
16:21 as they see us making time  for the more important things!
16:27 Now, why have we felt  the need to spend this time
16:30 discussing how to manage time?
16:32 It is because of something else  that the Bible tells us.
16:36 First Corinthians 7:29 says
16:39 that “the time left is reduced.”
16:42 That certainly is true of the time
16:44 that is left between now  and the great tribulation!
16:47 This is not the time to neglect
16:50 the most important activity of all
16:53 —our worship of Jehovah.
16:57 Making time for what matters most in life
16:59 is something we all need to do
17:01 —even our young ones.
17:03 And that’s the focus  of this month’s music video
17:06 about the important things.
17:27 Ev’ry day brings decisions,  and we must choose
17:36 How will we spend our time  and live for the truth.
17:45 Now, there’s a time to laugh  and be with our friends,
17:50 But it can’t be all  we’re living for in the end.
17:57 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
18:03 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
18:08 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
18:17 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
18:21 Think about the future  and where we are now.
18:26 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.
18:40 Life sure can weigh us down  with bills to pay.
18:48 It can make us lose sight  and misplace our faith.
18:58 But our fam’ly needs us  back at home.
19:02 And if we want to be there to help  and watch them grow—
19:10 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
19:16 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
19:20 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
19:29 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
19:34 Think about the future  and where we are now.
19:38 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.
20:03 We need to set time aside  for what’s most important—
20:09 Prayer, study,  and godly devotion.
20:14 Make Jehovah real,  ’cause that’s really what matters.
20:22 Throw off those things  pulling us down.
20:27 Think about the future  and where we are now.
20:32 Let nothing take the place  of more important things.
20:54 What a delightful song,
20:57 and what precious children  we saw in that music video!
21:00 Well, today we invited  two young people to join us in our studio.
21:04 This is Logan, and this is Aiden.
21:06 Thank you for coming.
21:07 Thanks for inviting us.
21:08 What did you think of that video?
21:10 I liked it  and that it showed a lot of families
21:14 doing stuff that involves Jehovah.
21:18 Good.
21:19 The one thing I noticed was  that they were all in a relaxed setting.
21:22 It was not like in a busy city.
21:24 They were at, like, the shore
21:27 where they were talking about the Bible,
21:30 and it was nice family time  that they were having.
21:33 Good observations, Fellas.
21:35 Now, three times in the chorus it said:
21:38 ‘We need to set time aside  for the most important things.’
21:42 Then it mentioned three important things.
21:45 What were they?
21:46 Prayer.
21:47 Study.
21:48 Godly—
21:48 —devotion.
21:49 That’s it, very good.
21:51 Good things for all of us to remember,  wouldn’t you say?
21:53 Well now, my wife and I  are in the same congregation
21:56 with Logan and Aiden  and their families.
21:59 So I know  what excellent meeting attenders they are.
22:01 And what I really appreciate  is that you participate in the meetings
22:05 and you comment in your own words.
22:06 That’s very good and sets a nice example.
22:08 Keep it up.
22:10 Speaking of the meetings,  how do you like the midweek meetings
22:13 with all the videos that we see?
22:14 It gives a diversity.
22:17 It’s not always talks.
22:18 It gives, like, a break in the meeting.
22:20 Yes.
22:21 The videos are always great,
22:26 and they go with every talk  that the videos are for.
22:30 And you know, sometimes  we even show Caleb and Sophia videos
22:34 from the Become Jehovah’s Friend series.
22:37 Now, I’ve got to ask you,
22:39 Do you have an idea for a new Caleb video?
22:42 I think I have one.
22:43 Caleb is at school;
22:46 he gets asked to go  to a birthday party at someone’s house.
22:49 He goes home and shows his parents the card,
22:51 and they discuss what he should do about it,
22:53 and then he preaches at school.
22:55 But before he does that,
22:57 Sophia gives him a couple of pointers  on preaching at school and on boldness.
23:01 Good.
23:01 How about you Aiden,  do you have an idea?
23:03 Yes, I think a good idea would be:
23:07 A new kid comes to Caleb’s class,  and it is his birthday,
23:12 and he passes out the treats.
23:14 But Caleb says, “No, thank you.”
23:16 And then he bullies him  that he doesn’t get to have fun;
23:21 he doesn’t get treats at school.
23:26 And I think  he should discuss it with the family,
23:29 and then maybe he could tell the boy
23:32 why he doesn’t celebrate birthdays.
23:35 Very nice.
23:36 Well, I’m sure the Teaching Committee  of the Governing Body
23:38 will give some thought  to your recommendations.
23:42 We brought you to the studio
23:44 because we want you  to help me with a little experiment.
23:47 And this is an experiment  that some of our viewers have seen before.
23:50 And you’ve probably seen it, too,  because it’s mentioned in Volume 2
23:53 of the book Questions Young People Ask —Answers That Work.
23:57 And the idea is to help us appreciate
24:00 how we can make time  for “the more important things.”
24:03 Now, let me explain  what we have on the table.
24:05 The two pails represent  one week in a Christian’s life.
24:10 The large rocks represent  the most important things
24:13 that we need  to accomplish during the week,
24:15 and all these little pebbles
24:18 represent the nonessential things of life
24:21 —recreation, playing games, playing sports,
24:26 going on the Internet,
24:28 working with social media,
24:30 our hobbies, taking music lessons.
24:33 They’re all fun things to do,  but, really, they’re not essential.
24:36 Now, our challenge is
24:38 to try to get all the big rocks  into the pail with the little pebbles.
24:43 So as I hand you each rock, Logan,  I want you to put it in the pail.
24:47 Now, this first one represents
24:50 the important things  that your father might have to do.
24:54 He works to support the family.
24:57 Maybe your mother  is a pioneer or has to work secularly.
25:01 Your mothers certainly have a lot of work  to do around the home caring for the family.
25:05 And you boys go to school  and have homework to do,
25:08 so that’s a big part  of your time, isn’t it?
25:12 Now, this rock represents
25:14 all the chores that everyone  in the family has to do at home:
25:18 cleaning, washing clothes, cooking,
25:21 caring for the yard,  the automobile, and so on.
25:24 That takes a lot of time.
25:31 This rock represents a third of your life
25:34 —sleeping.
25:41 Now, here are the most important things —our spiritual activities.
25:44 For instance, when we read the Bible  and meditate on what we read
25:49 and when we do  personal study and family worship.
25:55 This one represents  all the time it takes for us
25:58 to prepare for, dress for, travel to,
26:01 and attend our congregation meetings —midweek and on the weekend.
26:08 And this represents the time we spend  in the field service on the weekend.
26:15 Now, I didn’t tell you  that we can’t go above the top of the pail.
26:20 They don’t fit, do they?
26:21 No.
26:22 OK.
26:23 And when that happens in a person’s life,
26:25 some brothers and sisters  are tempted to decide:
26:29 ‘Well, maybe I’ll skip  field service this week,’
26:33 or ‘Maybe I’ll stay home  from the meetings,’
26:37 or ‘Maybe I just won’t get  my Bible reading
26:39 and studying and family worship  done this week.’
26:42 But that’s a big mistake, isn’t it?
26:44 These are the most important things of life —our spiritual activities.
26:48 So is there some way that we can get  all of this into our week’s schedule?
26:53 Here’s what we’re going to do now.
26:55 We’re going to put  the rocks in the empty pail.
26:58 So, Logan,  see if you can get them all in there.
27:22 Very good! They all fit.
27:24 Isn’t that nice?
27:25 We can get the more important things done.
27:27 But you know, we also want  a little time for recreation, don’t we?
27:31 So, Aiden,
27:33 let’s have you pour  the little pebbles into that bucket
27:37 and see how much  of that you can get in there.
27:53 You can put a lot more in.
28:06 Very good!
28:07 Look how much you got in there!
28:09 Now, you didn’t get them all in,  did you?
28:11 But that’s OK because the Bible tells us
28:14 we have to ‘buy out the time’  for the more important things.
28:16 So, no, we can’t spend all the time  that we may want to on recreation.
28:20 We want to get  the more important things done.
28:24 So, what have we learned  from this little demonstration?
28:27 Why weren’t we able to get  the big rocks in the pail the first time?
28:31 Aiden?
28:32 Because there was too much recreation.
28:35 That’s right.
28:37 Now, Logan, why were we able to get  all the rocks in the second time?
28:41 Because we put in the nonessential things
28:44 —like watching TV, playing video games— in second.
28:48 We put that in last, didn’t we?
28:50 Good.
28:50 So that teaches us:  Put the more important things first.
28:55 And it all depends  on what we fill our pail up with,
28:58 or our life with, first.
29:01 Thank you very much for your help.
29:03 I appreciate that.
29:05 And keep up your good work  as Kingdom publishers,
29:09 and I’ll see you at the Kingdom Hall  at the next meeting.
29:12 With this illustration in mind—
29:14 Let’s turn our attention  to the Schiller family.
29:16 Is it possible to balance raising a family  with a busy spiritual routine?
29:21 And if circumstances allow,  can parents reach out for spiritual goals
29:26 —even full-time service?
29:28 Let’s listen to their answers  to those questions.
29:33 Sometimes people say:  “Well, you know, what was your secret?
29:37 How did you raise six kids?”
29:39 We got married September 16, 1972.
29:43 Two things started coming quickly
29:45 —spiritual privileges came along  and the children came along—
29:48 together.
29:50 I was made an elder
29:52 shortly after the elder arrangement  came into effect.
29:57 The kids were just part of all that,
30:00 and you might think  that sometimes they didn’t know it.
30:04 We were doing  substitute work with five children,
30:07 and I don’t think they  even knew what we were doing.
30:11 In 1989, we were pioneering,
30:14 and then we had the opportunity  to help out at Bethel,
30:18 maybe a week or two at a time.
30:22 About that time,  Patterson was starting up.
30:26 And we kind of recognized
30:29 that maybe we were getting too comfortable.
30:34 We went one time to Bethel and said:
30:36 “Hey, if you need a doctor out at Patterson,  why, we’d be available.
30:40 Or we could make ourselves available,  maybe.”
30:44 And wouldn’t you know it,  shortly after, we got a call,
30:47 “How quickly could you  sell your place and be up here?”
30:51 So we went to Bethel with six kids,
30:54 sold our house at a loss so we could do that,
30:58 and started a new life there.
31:03 So we learned pretty quickly:  Don’t turn down any privileges
31:07 —and especially not because we had kids.
31:11 When we went to Bethel,  the oldest one was 17.
31:16 Having children
31:18 kept my husband and me very humble
31:23 because as soon as you thought  you had something figured out,
31:25 each child needed  to be disciplined in a different way.
31:28 And as soon as you thought,  ‘Boy, you know, I’ve got this figured out,’
31:31 you’re thrown a curve.
31:33 A challenge was  to keep doing the basic things.
31:38 You’d come home tired.
31:41 It would be so easy  not to have the family study
31:45 maybe one Monday.
31:47 It’s those basic, simple things
31:50 that I think kept us on an even keel.
31:55 I often think  of the illustration that Jesus gave
31:59 at the end of the Sermon on the Mount,
32:01 what he said about this foundation  that was washed away.
32:06 And Jesus never blamed the storm;  he blamed the foundation.
32:10 And so we recognize that any child anywhere
32:15 —in fact, even adults—  can get their faith tested.
32:18 So we tried to really make sure
32:20 they had a good foundation  that didn’t get washed away.
32:23 Prepare them,  let them learn how to deal with people
32:26 while they’re under your care,
32:30 and get them ready for life.
32:32 We got to thinking, ‘Other parents  require their kids to go to college,’
32:36 so we just required them
32:39 to pioneer for a year.
32:41 Any kind of education—
32:42 Any kind of secular education can teach you
32:47 how to have a skill so that you have a job.
32:50 But the Bible teaches you how to live,
32:53 and it teaches you principles  that you can live your life by.
32:58 And all of them kept pioneering.
33:01 You know, they did various jobs  to support themselves.
33:04 They cleaned; they worked at lumberyards;  they worked on roofing.
33:08 And none of them have
33:11 a complicated life that holds them down.
33:13 I wanted everlasting life  for my children,
33:16 and I knew I would have to give  them back to Jehovah.
33:19 We have to realize we don’t own our children —Jehovah does.
33:23 And we have to respect that.
33:25 We’re not telling them what to do anymore.
33:29 We appreciate  and we’re very, very thankful
33:31 when our children,  as far away as they are
33:34 and as busy as they are,
33:36 take the time to communicate with us.
33:41 And I know you won’t remember this,
33:44 but I remember one time,  before you fell asleep at night,
33:48 I said,  “With all that you have done for Jehovah,
33:53 what would you like in return?”
33:57 Do you remember what you said?
34:00 You said three words, “All my children.”
34:06 In Deuteronomy it says:  “I have put life and death before you,
34:10 . . . and you must choose.”
34:12 So we can do what we can as parents
34:14 —some things good,  some things not so good.
34:17 In the end, each one had to make
34:20 his or her own decision.
34:23 And that’s why, again,  it was not any secret we had.
34:27 We’re so proud of what the kids decided
34:30 and how they turned out  because it was their decision.
34:33 I think that’s the thing that we’ve learned:
34:37 Don’t turn down opportunities.
34:45 Isn’t it wonderful to hear of ones  like Brother and Sister Schiller
34:49 who have offered their gifts to Jehovah?
34:52 Brother Schiller said  that it was doing the basic things
34:55 that kept his family focused spiritually.
34:58 So when opportunities came along,  he was able to do more,
35:01 which included pioneering,  substitute circuit work,
35:05 and using the medical training  he had already acquired
35:08 to volunteer  at the Patterson Educational Center.
35:12 Proverbs 10:22 says:
35:15 “It is the blessing of Jehovah  that makes one rich,
35:19 and He adds no hardship with it.”(Ftn.)
35:22 That certainly has proved true  for Brother Schiller and his family.
35:27 We can all agree that one of the ways  Jehovah provides spiritual riches
35:31 is through the training  we receive at meetings,
35:33 assemblies, conventions,  and even special schools.
35:37 Such training helps us to prioritize
35:41 and to do “the more important things.”
35:43 Over the past few years,  members of the Bethel family
35:46 have attended the Pioneer Service School.
35:48 Let’s see how the school has helped them
35:51 in their Bethel service  and in their ministry.
36:02 It was a really great privilege  for us as Bethelites
36:05 to be able to study for six days.
36:07 The Governing Body  giving us time to study more
36:10 about Jehovah’s qualities was tremendous
36:13 to help build our spirituality.
36:15 For many Bethelites,
36:17 this was like a gift from Jehovah
36:20 because they had never attended before.
36:23 In fact, one couple
36:24 who had been 50 years in full-time service
36:27 had never attended the pioneer school before.
36:31 I’d been invited twice before,
36:33 but unfortunately,  both times I wasn’t able to go.
36:38 I felt like Jehovah  was giving me a third chance,
36:40 and this time I wouldn’t miss it.
36:43 At first, you feel a little like,
36:46 this is strange;
36:48 you’re at Bethel;  you’re not out pioneering.
36:50 But then,  when you’ve gone to the school
36:52 and you’ve seen what the school  actually does for your ministry,
36:56 it was really—
36:58 You can see why the Governing Body—
36:59 It was such a kind gift for them  to give us this privilege of coming.
37:03 You’re surrounded by people  who have been pioneers for years;
37:06 some have been to Gilead;  some have been in the traveling work;
37:09 some have conducted  pioneer schools themselves.
37:11 It’s the best.
37:15 Even though they’re  in this spiritual environment,
37:17 they need to be upbuilt.
37:20 As Bethelites,  we go out in service
37:22 not as much as we did  when we were pioneering.
37:25 So being able to have  an effective use of our time
37:28 in the ministry makes a big difference.
37:30 You learn a lot about the field ministry  in pioneer school.
37:34 So in a month when 30 hours was an option,
37:36 I applied to auxiliary pioneer
37:38 and I also tried to participate  a lot in the ministry on weekends.
37:42 This way I was able  to prepare for the school.
37:47 I think that every Christian  needs to have goals,
37:49 and even for us serving in Bethel,  we need goals.
37:53 So the main thing I learned from the school
37:55 is that even while working in Bethel,
37:57 I can do more for the congregation
37:59 and make a bigger effort in the ministry.
38:01 After the pioneer school,
38:03 I realized I needed to cultivate
38:06 more humility in my Bethel service
38:08 and the field ministry.
38:12 Because there’s so much spiritual food
38:14 available at Bethel,
38:16 it can become easy to neglect personal study.
38:18 Listening to the deeply meditated comments
38:21 from the students  and the instructors really stimulated me
38:24 to also meditate more deeply.
38:27 During the school,
38:28 I had to study more than usual,
38:31 so I had to set aside more time for reading
38:33 so as to be well-prepared for class.
38:35 It was really practical for me
38:37 to improve my ministry,
38:39 and it was really nice  because with this new school,
38:41 we had a demonstration
38:42 of what we have to avoid  and what is good to do.
38:47 There was a demonstration  about what not to do on a Bible study,
38:50 and I saw myself doing some of those things.
38:53 So I realized that I really needed
38:56 to get better at conducting Bible studies.
38:58 I remember one demonstration that taught us
39:02 how we can witness informally  in a supermarket line, for example.
39:08 That demonstration  gave me more confidence
39:10 to witness informally.
39:13 In the school, we learned a lot about Jesus
39:15 —how he was hardworking, zealous,
39:17 and showed genuine interest  in the people around him.
39:21 That example helped me  to be more hardworking and zealous,
39:24 as well as to be more approachable  to those whom I work with.
39:27 That’s why we’re here in Bethel
39:29 —it’s to support the preaching work.
39:31 So it doesn’t matter what assignment we have.
39:33 In a way, it’s connected to that.
39:35 The fruitage of the spirit  is good not just for the ministry
39:37 but it’s good for everything in everyday life  toward our brothers and sisters.
39:43 Love is such an important quality  for Bethelites.
39:48 I work in the Computer Department,
39:49 but I don’t treat computers with love.
39:52 But the school strengthened my determination
39:54 to treat my brothers and sisters with love.
39:58 Out of all the other schools I’ve attended,
40:00 this school had the most impact on my life.
40:02 In just one week,  it strengthens our faith,
40:05 widens our view of things,  trains our conscience,
40:08 and deepens our love.
40:10 It definitely
40:12 stimulated the pioneer spirit.
40:14 Even though we’re not pioneers,
40:16 it helped us to understand
40:18 the importance of the pioneer service
40:21 and how it contributes  to our overall joy
40:24 in serving Jehovah.
40:25 So that’s something  that we would never want to neglect.
40:28 We really appreciated  the emphasis that was placed on that
40:32 and how it also helps to keep  our close relationship with Jehovah.
40:40 Certainly, we can see  the blessings that have come
40:43 from making time  for that additional spiritual training.
40:46 Spiritual training at Bethel  also includes morning worship.
40:51 Many of you have expressed appreciation
40:53 for the morning worship programs
40:55 posted on JW Broadcasting.
40:58 Let’s listen to Brother Geoffrey Jackson  of the Governing Body
41:01 as he shows us how we  can maintain a faithful life course
41:05 like that of Abraham.
41:08 This morning I’d like you to imagine
41:10 for a few moments
41:11 that you’ve been asked to write
41:13 your life story for The Watchtower.
41:16 Well, once you get over the shock,
41:18 how would you go about doing that?
41:20 You’ve probably noticed with many  of the life experiences in The Watchtower,
41:25 usually the first paragraph,
41:27 have a defining moment in that person’s life.
41:32 For example, Brother Eric Beveridge,  who serves with us here in the United States,
41:37 he started off this way:
41:39 “‘I hereby sentence you  to six months in prison.’
41:43 “With those words ringing in my ears,  I was taken off to . . .
41:46 “[p]rison in Manchester, England. . . .
41:48 “I had just faced  one of the toughest tests of my young life
41:52 —I had refused to be conscripted  for military service.”
41:56 Or another brother, Brother Harley Harris,
41:58 who served as a missionary  in Ecuador for many years,
42:01 he referred to the date September 2, 1950.
42:05 He said: “We were at a circuit assembly,  surrounded by a mob.
42:09 “The mayor brought in the National Guard  to protect us from the unruly crowd.
42:13 “Soldiers with drawn rifles  and bayonets lined the street.
42:17 “Amid insults,  we walked to our cars and drove to . . .
42:21 “the remaining sessions of the assembly.
42:23 It was there  that I was baptized at the age of 14.”
42:28 Or another brother, Brother Don MacLean
42:30 —who serves  on the Branch Committee in Australasia,
42:32 a brother originally from Canada—
42:35 made this comment.
42:37 He started his life experience:
42:39 “There I sat, hour after hour,
42:41 “with one of the Royal Canadian  Mounted Police by my side.
42:44 “I was his prisoner.
42:46 “We were headed  for the prison camp at . . . Ontario, Canada,
42:50 “and it seemed  [that] the 1,500-mile train trip
42:53 would never end.”
42:56 Well, those certainly were defining moments
42:58 in the lives of those brothers.
43:00 What about you?
43:02 What is your defining moment?
43:06 Well, you might be thinking,
43:08 ‘No one put a gun  to my head and said,
43:11 “Decide now whether  you’ll serve Jehovah or not.”’
43:15 But for many of us, there have been  defining moments in our lives.
43:19 Perhaps it’s the moment  you decided to serve Jehovah
43:24 or the moment you decided  to become a full-time servant.
43:28 Perhaps it involved some decisions,  such as selling a home,
43:32 selling a business,  deciding to move to Bethel,
43:36 or perhaps leaving your country  and going somewhere else.
43:40 Or it may have involved  certain tests or trials,
43:44 perhaps giving up  opportunities for education
43:47 or for lucrative job opportunities.
43:51 Well, whatever the case,
43:53 I’m sure most of us  have had some defining moments
43:57 in our lives that we remember
43:59 —the decisions that were made  that resulted in much good.
44:04 Let’s think for a moment  about the faithful man Abraham.
44:08 What was the defining moment in his life?
44:11 Well, if you take your Bibles  and turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11,
44:15 of course, here we see  the apostle Paul giving us an outline
44:20 or history of many  of the defining moments
44:23 in the lives of faithful ones.
44:26 At Hebrews 11:8,  it says of Abraham:
44:30 “By faith Abraham, when he was called,
44:34 “obeyed by going out to a place
44:36 “he was to receive as an inheritance;
44:39 he went out,  although not knowing where he was going.”
44:44 Yes, that was a defining moment  in the life of Abraham, wasn’t it?
44:48 He decided to obey Jehovah,  to leave Ur,
44:53 and to travel to a distant country  that he didn’t really know about.
45:00 But was that all that was involved
45:03 with Abraham receiving the reward?
45:06 No.
45:07 Let’s read on a little further in verse 9.
45:11 There it says:
45:12 “By faith he lived as a foreigner
45:14 “in the land of the promise  as in a foreign land,
45:17 “living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,
45:21 the heirs with him  of the very same promise.”
45:25 Now, this is not a defining moment, is it?
45:28 This is a course of faithfulness,
45:31 day in, day out.
45:34 So, what’s the point?
45:36 Well, in the case of Abraham,
45:38 we remember  that eventually he and his family
45:41 crossed the Euphrates River  and into the Promised Land
45:44 in the year 1943 B.C.E.
45:47 But he had to wait 25 years  before his son Isaac was born
45:52 and then another 60 years
45:55 before his grandsons  Esau and Jacob were born.
45:58 And eventually,  he died after being in the Promised Land
46:02 as a foreigner for about 100 years.
46:05 So, what’s the point?
46:07 Although there was  a definite decision he made
46:11 —a defining moment in his life—
46:13 that was backed up as verse 9 says,
46:17 by his faithfulness
46:19 —day in, day out—
46:21 serving Jehovah.
46:23 So the lesson we learn from that is
46:26 that it’s not just the defining moments
46:30 that define who we are.
46:32 Rather, those moments and those decisions
46:36 need to be backed up by faithful service.
46:39 Let’s be quite frank.
46:42 Many of the life experiences  that we read in The Watchtower
46:45 may have a very exciting first paragraph.
46:48 “Yes, they put a gun to my head.
46:51 “Make your decision.
46:52 “Will you die?
46:53 Would you be willing to die for Jehovah?”
46:56 But then,  when you read the rest of the article,
46:59 nothing really exciting  happened in that person’s life.
47:02 I’m sorry to say it.
47:05 That includes my life experience as well.
47:09 Why?
47:10 Because the majority of our lives
47:13 are not involved with defining moments
47:16 —exciting things that are happening.
47:19 Rather, they involve  our faithfulness to Jehovah.
47:23 So we can’t just rely  upon these defining moments and say,
47:27 “Well, I made this decision  to serve Jehovah;
47:30 I passed this test,  so everything is good.”
47:33 No, we need to continue  to back up those defining moments
47:38 with faithful service.
47:41 Remember that in the Scriptures,
47:43 there were many who had  defining moments in their lives.
47:46 Take, for example, Solomon.
47:48 He had a defining moment, didn’t he,  when he prayed to Jehovah
47:52 and he was praised for the fact  that he asked for wisdom rather than wealth?
47:57 But that wasn’t backed up by faithfulness.
48:01 Eventually, that defining moment in his life
48:04 really wasn’t as valuable as it could’ve been
48:07 because of his lack of faithfulness.
48:10 And what about Judas Iscariot?
48:13 Were there some defining moments in his life?
48:16 Obviously, he decided  to follow Jesus at one point.
48:20 And during that time,  when he faithfully followed Jesus,
48:23 no doubt, there were very exciting,  interesting things that happened.
48:28 But again,  those defining moments in his life
48:32 proved to be of little value
48:34 because of the lack  of faithfulness on his part.
48:38 So that helps us to understand
48:40 why the apostle Paul  said some very interesting points
48:44 just before he started this list  that he gives us in Hebrews chapter 11.
48:48 Let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 10,
48:53 Hebrews 10:35-39.
48:59 Notice, this is the point  that we should gain from this lesson.
49:04 Paul says starting in verse 35:
49:08 “Therefore, do not throw away your boldness,
49:11 “which will be richly rewarded.
49:14 For you need endurance,”
49:17 now, that reminds us of what Jesus said
49:19 about ‘the one who endures  to the end will be saved,’
49:23 “so that after you  have done the will of God,
49:26 “you may receive  the fulfillment of the promise.
49:29 “For yet ‘a very little while,’
49:31 “and ‘the one who is coming  will arrive and will not delay.’
49:36 “‘But my righteous one  will live by reason of faith,’
49:41 “and ‘if he shrinks back,  I have no pleasure in him.’
49:45 “Now we are not the sort  who shrink back to destruction,
49:49 but the sort who have faith  for the preserving of our lives.”
49:54 What a very positive comment that is.
49:57 So when we think of our life experience,
50:01 don’t be disappointed if you  don’t have some spectacular things
50:05 that you can mention as defining moments.
50:08 Remember, the important thing
50:11 is not just the decisions  that we make along the way
50:14 but the fact that we remain  faithful to Jehovah
50:18 day in, day out.
50:21 As Brother Jackson mentioned,
50:23 we might experience  a “defining moment” in our spiritual lives,
50:27 but real faithfulness is shown
50:29 in how we handle  smaller challenges day to day.
50:33 One example might be if someone
50:35 were to attack  our beliefs in front of others.
50:37 Have you ever experienced that?
50:39 Were you nervous?
50:41 Did you find it challenging to find  the right words to make a defense?
50:45 In the next video,  notice how the character of Grayson
50:49 deals with a similar situation.
51:01 It was one of those mornings
51:04 when everything seemed to be going right.
51:09 In fact, this whole year was going right
51:12 ever since I got baptized.
51:15 My family is closer than ever.
51:18 I’ve made some good friends  in the congregation.
51:22 I even started a Bible study.
51:26 It felt good to let go of my fears
51:28 and serve Jehovah with everything I have.
51:35 But things can change very quickly.
51:48 Uh, I’m sorry.  You know what?
51:50 I think I saw Grayson  over the weekend on Saturday.
51:53 I think he might be one of those people  that tells you about the Bible.
51:55 One of those, uh—
51:55 You’re saying Grayson is a Jehovah’s Witness?
51:59 Yeah.  Let me go ask him.
52:01 Hey, Grayson?
52:03 Hey, how’s it going, Ron?
52:05 Did I see you on Saturday morning  over on Main Street?
52:07 Yeah.  You know, I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
52:10 And what we do,  we go out and talk to people about—
52:12 I’m sorry.  I just don’t get it.
52:14 You’ll go knocking on strangers’ doors
52:16 to support your own religion,  yet you won’t stand and support this country.
52:20 Why don’t you people
52:21 get involved and make  a real difference for once?
52:34 I was really disappointed in myself.
52:38 I guess I hadn’t moved past  all my fears like I thought.
52:43 Later that night,  for family worship,
52:45 we sat down and discussed  our brothers who were in prison
52:48 for their faith.
52:50 Mom, why are they in prison?
52:53 They don’t want to fight;  they don’t want to kill people.
52:55 It really touched Aiden.
52:58 He was moved to pray for them that night.
53:02 His prayer touched my heart.
53:04 And with so much on my mind,  I couldn’t sleep.
53:08 So I decided to get up  and do some research.
53:11 I found some information  on the apostle Peter.
53:15 Despite his zeal,
53:18 he also struggled at times
53:20 with fear of man
53:22 like when he denied Jesus three times.
53:28 But eventually, he overcame that fear.
53:33 We strictly ordered you
53:35 not to keep teaching  on the basis of this name,
53:39 and yet look!
53:41 you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching,
53:43 and you are determined
53:45 to bring the blood of this man upon us.
53:48 We must obey God as ruler rather than men.
53:51 The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus,
53:54 whom you killed,  hanging him on a stake.
54:16 “Always ready to make a defense
54:19 “before everyone who demands of you a reason
54:23 for the hope you have”
54:26 —Peter focused on his hope,
54:29 not his fear.
54:32 Just like these faithful brothers  have been doing,
54:36 I want to be like them  and make Jehovah proud of me.
54:52 The next day I woke up,
54:54 and I was thinking about the apostle Peter
54:56 and our brothers  who were in prison for their faith.
55:05 And even though I was still a little nervous,
55:07 I felt ready to talk to Eric.
55:13 Hey, Ron, Eric.
55:15 Sorry I didn’t get a chance  to explain the other day,
55:17 but if you have a moment now,  I’d love to be able to talk to you.
55:20 I don’t want to hear it.
55:23 Sorry, Grayson.
55:26 And I thought that was it.
55:31 But it wasn’t.
55:34 Ron said he wanted to know more.
55:39 Maybe I’ll never completely  get rid of my fears.
55:42 But my love for Jehovah
55:44 and the example of his courageous servants
55:47 helps me to be ready to meet the challenge.
55:49 The other day I wanted to show you something.
55:54 What a practical example  of how taking time to meditate
55:58 on Biblical or modern integrity-keepers
56:01 can help us have  the courage to defend our faith!
56:04 This is just another example  of how making time
56:08 for “the more important things”
56:10 —such as prayer, study, and godly devotion—
56:13 can help us remain faithful.
56:16 Before we conclude our program,
56:18 let’s take a moment  and travel to the country of Hungary.
56:22 Situated in the center of Europe,
56:25 visitors to Hungary  can enjoy delicious food and wine
56:28 and see the beautiful great plain  known as the Puszta.
56:32 Water also plays a vital role  throughout the country,
56:35 with its abundant rivers,  lakes, and thermal springs.
56:39 There are more than 21,000 publishers
56:42 and close to 300 congregations.
56:45 They’re offering waters of truth to others,
56:47 often in spite of severe economic challenges.
56:51 In fact, during the last ten years,
56:54 the number of regular pioneers  has nearly doubled.
56:58 In 2016,
57:00 a pregroup  in the Lovari language was formed.
57:03 This language is spoken  by many Roma people in Hungary.
57:07 While none in the group  is a native Lovari speaker,
57:11 they’re willing to learn this language  to help these thirsty ones.
57:16 Additionally, this year,  nearly 30,000 foreign students
57:21 enrolled at various universities  in Hungary,
57:24 providing a very diverse territory  for those serving
57:27 in a foreign-language congregation  or group.
57:31 Our brothers and sisters from Hungary
57:33 are overjoyed to send  their love and greetings to all of you.
57:37 We send them our Christian love in return.
57:41 From the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
57:44 this is JW Broadcasting.

00:00 Welcome to JW Broadcasting.
00:03 In this month’s program,
00:05 we will feature the study methods  that are used in Gilead School.
00:08 For a moment, let’s imagine ourselves  starting our day as a Gilead student.
00:15 See you later.
00:16 See you, Nathan.
00:35 Morning.
00:36 Have a good day in class.
00:37 Thank you.
00:44 Welcome.
00:45 How are you?
00:49 Good morning.
00:50 Hello, Nathan.
00:58 Lyubomyr.
00:59 Nice to see you.
01:00 How are you?
01:00 Good.
01:01 I am good.
01:01 Good to see you.
01:02 How was your night?
01:03 It was good.
01:04 A long night of studying,  but it was worth it.
01:06 I’m really looking forward  to the lesson this morning.
01:09 You know, I agree with you.  I feel the same.
01:11 The information we have been studying  is really touching my heart.
01:15 I know what you mean.
01:16 I feel like I’ve become  more of a spiritual person,
01:18 and my relationship with Jehovah  has become so much stronger.
01:21 Good morning everyone.  Very good to see you all here this morning.
01:25 What are the study methods  that are helping the students grow
01:29 in their relationship with Jehovah?
01:31 And more importantly,  how can we apply these methods
01:35 in our own personal study?
01:37 We’ll find the answers and more.
01:39 Here are some  of the highlights of what’s ahead.
01:42 These brothers and sisters describe
01:44 how they approach their personal Bible study.
01:46 They’re from different parts of the world,
01:49 but they share  many common study techniques.
01:52 What questions do they ask  as they read and meditate on the Bible?
01:56 How does their deep study take them  beyond the basics of Bible understanding?
02:02 Young ones,  are you digging deep into God’s Word now?
02:06 How can this help you  make the truth your own?
02:10 And can you succeed even without the support
02:12 of those spiritually close to you?
02:14 This sister’s experience will show us
02:17 the benefits of searching the Bible
02:19 as if for hidden treasures.
02:22 Can you be ready to make  a wise choice in matters of conscience?
02:26 Do study habits affect  how well-prepared and well-trained
02:29 your conscience is  for an unexpected situation?
02:33 We’ll see how  the sister in this dramatization
02:35 answers these questions.
02:38 This is JW Broadcasting for July 2018.
03:01 We begin with an archived interview  of Brother Allan Boyle.
03:04 Among his many assignments,  Brother Boyle spent 37 years
03:08 in the Art Department  at world headquarters.
03:11 The beautiful and accurate illustrations
03:14 produced there enhance our study,
03:16 helping us to visualize  and meditate on what we are reading.
03:20 An assignment  to create these pictures is exciting,
03:23 but it requires  that a person have spiritual qualities.
03:27 Artists collaborate
03:29 and must humbly listen  to each other’s comments.
03:31 They must apply direction  from “the faithful and discreet slave”
03:35 to prepare artwork  that we can take in as spiritual food.
03:39 As you’ll hear Brother Boyle describe,
03:41 a person must be  an avid student of the Bible.
03:45 Listen to Brother Boyle’s story,
03:47 and note what he said was needed  for him to do his assignment well.
04:07 I was born in 1933.
04:10 I got to the age of 18,  and one suppertime
04:14 my mother  had invited the company servant,
04:17 as they were called back then,  to come for supper.
04:20 He asked me  what I was going to do with my life.
04:22 I said to him,  “Well, I’m going to pioneer.”
04:25 So three weeks later,  at the convention in London,
04:28 I got baptized and then  went pioneering six months after that.
04:33 I was 21 when I was in the circuit work,
04:35 and that was a wonderful experience.
04:37 And in those days,  of course, you didn’t have a car.
04:39 I used to have a motorbike.
04:41 And I’d go around  on the motorbike with my briefcase
04:44 and my typewriter  and my clothes in the other case on the back.
04:47 Yeah, that was very exciting.
04:49 I was invited to go to Gilead,  and that was wonderfully exciting.
04:53 We had 103 in the class.
04:56 Little did I know at the time
04:58 that I would be sent  as a missionary to Ireland.
05:09 My friend had been invited to go down
05:12 to London Bethel to do the artwork there.
05:15 I’d always wanted to be in Bethel.
05:17 I thought, ‘Well, why don’t I just  call him up and congratulate him?’
05:20 So that’s what I did,  and he told me that he decided not to go.
05:23 So he said: “If you’re  still interested, why don’t you go?
05:26 You know, call them up and let them know.”
05:28 So that’s what I did.  The next morning, I called up London Bethel,
05:31 and within a week I was  in London Bethel doing the graphics work
05:36 for the magazines, you know.
05:37 It was a wonderful, thrilling experience.
05:41 I was in London Bethel for a couple of years,
05:44 in 1977 to 1979,
05:47 and then Brother Barry invited me  to come over to Brooklyn Bethel.
05:55 You know that you’re doing  something that’s going to be beneficial
06:00 and helpful to other people,
06:02 even to people in different  languages, in different cultures.
06:05 A little painting that you do  is going to help them
06:08 to get a memory of something significant.
06:13 One of the most beautiful things  about working in the Art Department
06:18 and doing paintings  is that it makes you do research.
06:22 You have to investigate.  Is this the right time of the day?
06:24 Is it night? Is it day?
06:26 What did the sky look like?
06:28 What was it like  before the Flood when Noah built the ark?
06:32 How did he paint underneath the ark?
06:34 How did he waterproof it?
06:36 Because that’s  the most important part, isn’t it?
06:38 He used bitumen.  OK, how did he get underneath the ark?
06:41 Maybe he put it on stilts.
06:42 You have to come up  with all these little questions in your mind.
06:51 To do the research was very rewarding.
07:16 This is a little model of a boat,
07:18 and underneath the deck they used to keep
07:20 a ballast sack of 110 pounds (50 kg) of sand.
07:23 It says in the Scriptures  that Jesus was asleep on “a pillow.”
07:27 Apparently, this was  the ballast sack that he was asleep on.
07:31 And actually,  in the Kingdom Interlinear translation,
07:34 it doesn’t say  that he was asleep on “a pillow”;
07:37 it says he was asleep on “the pillow.”
07:39 So apparently,  back 2,000 years ago in that area,
07:42 everybody knew what “the pillow” was.
07:49 I remember meeting  a brother once who’d been to Siberia,
07:54 and he’d taken a snapshot  of somebody’s kitchen in Siberia.
07:58 And to my amazement, on the wall
08:00 —pinned with drawing pins on the wall—
08:03 was one of the pages of the publications
08:06 that we produced here at Brooklyn.
08:08 And so, remarkably,
08:10 it’s wonderful to feel  that whatever we do here
08:14 —if it’s support work,  if it’s the painting,
08:17 and, of course, we need  a lot of support work for the paintings—
08:20 all of what we do here
08:22 has an effect upon the brothers and sisters
08:24 out there in the world, wherever it might be.
08:27 And you really feel  that your time is well spent.
08:34 You’re adorning the Word of truth.
08:36 You’re helping other people  to be taught something from the Bible,
08:41 which is going to be to their benefit.
08:45 It’s been very rewarding and thrilling
08:49 to be in Jehovah’s service,  and I’ve really enjoyed it.
09:11 Allan Boyle finished  his earthly course in 2016.
09:16 Those in the Art Department  who worked with him
09:18 remember his enthusiasm  and his thorough attention to detail.
09:23 What Allan brought to his assignment
09:25 was rooted  in his own personal study of the Bible.
09:28 He found it rewarding to do the research
09:30 needed to illustrate Bible scenes.
09:33 Today, the Writing Department supplies
09:36 a team of researchers to assist the artists.
09:39 But did you recall  what Allan said helped his research?
09:42 He asked questions  about the scenes he was painting!
09:47 These same kinds of questions  are part of the study methods
09:50 Gilead students learn in class.
09:52 And these are the same methods  that we’ll learn about in this program.
09:58 How would you feel
10:00 if you received an invitation
10:02 to attend the next class of Gilead School?
10:05 For many, it has been  a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.
10:08 The course helps students  keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
10:13 For others, the idea of five months  of intense study seems intimidating.
10:18 We know we need to study,
10:20 but we may find  it a challenge to get the most
10:22 out of the time we spend  reading God’s Word.
10:26 In this program, we will discuss  why study is so important,
10:31 what it means to study something,
10:34 and how you can get more  from your study sessions.
10:38 Since most cannot attend Gilead,
10:40 we will demonstrate  the method used in Gilead School.
10:45 First, why is study so important?
10:50 Only by study can we  keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
10:55 When the apostle Paul penned these words,
10:57 he was imprisoned and nearing the end  of his action-packed life.
11:02 He had been the “apostle to the nations”
11:04 and had spent his best years
11:06 taking the Word of God  to the then-known world.
11:10 As he reflected on the fruits of his labors,
11:12 he wrote a letter to his friends  in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.
11:18 Inspired by holy spirit, he wrote words
11:21 that would aid his brothers  to gain the prize of eternal life.
11:25 These words are found  at Philippians 2:15, 16.
11:30 Let’s read them:
11:33 “So that you may come to be  blameless and innocent,
11:37 “children of God  without a blemish in the midst
11:40 “of a crooked and twisted generation,
11:43 “among whom you are shining  as illuminators in the world,
11:46 keeping a tight grip on the word of life.”
11:51 Imagine the joy Paul felt
11:54 when he was reunited  in the heavenly resurrection
11:57 with those who listened to his admonition
12:00 to keep “a tight grip on the word of life”!
12:03 Whether we have  the heavenly or earthly hope,
12:07 Paul’s words can help us gain  the prize of eternal life.
12:10 They imprint on our hearts and minds  a basic exhortation
12:15 that will lead us through these last days  and into our everlasting reward.
12:20 The question is, Will we remain  ‘blameless and without blemish
12:25 in the midst of this crooked  and twisted generation’ of our day?
12:30 Will we rejoice with other faithful servants  of God in the new world?
12:35 We can and we will
12:38 if we take to heart Paul’s counsel
12:40 to keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
12:45 Next, what does it mean to study?
12:49 Stop and contemplate this word picture
12:51 for keeping a tight grip.
12:54 Imagine a hiker who has slipped near a ledge.
12:57 But before falling over the cliff,  he grabs hold of a tree branch.
13:02 How tight do you think  his grip will be on that branch?
13:05 This is not a halfhearted effort.
13:08 Likewise, keeping a tight grip  on the word of life
13:12 is not just a mechanical routine,  nor is it a casual habit.
13:17 It requires strenuous effort.
13:20 It involves actively living  by the truths in God’s Word.
13:25 To do this, we must understand
13:28 more than what God  expressly commands and condemns.
13:31 We must be able to identify principles,
13:34 or life lessons, contained in the Bible.
13:38 Once identified, we must understand
13:41 how to match these valuable truths
13:43 to specific situations in our lives.
13:47 Then we must allow these principles  to influence our decisions
13:51 and guide our reaction  to trials and temptations.
13:56 Ask yourself,
13:58 ‘How strong is my grip  on the word of life?’
14:02 To answer that,
14:04 let’s consider  the fundamentals of Bible study.
14:09 This is not about old methods or new methods,
14:12 nor is it about what device you are using.
14:15 This discussion transcends devices.
14:19 Study requires active thinking.
14:22 In a world of increasing distractions,
14:25 this is becoming an even greater challenge.
14:28 We’ve often received instant information
14:30 that enables us to quickly recite facts,
14:33 but this is not the same as active thinking.
14:37 Through active thinking,
14:39 we draw meaningful conclusions in our hearts.
14:43 We are certainly grateful  for all the study tools we’ve been given.
14:47 We should use these to the full.
14:50 At the same time, we need to be careful
14:53 that these tools do not cause us  to develop mental laziness.
14:57 Devices can help us to access information,
15:01 but they can’t think for us.
15:04 We must work hard if we are  to develop new patterns of thinking.
15:08 For example, if we study  The Watchtower on a device,
15:13 we can use the hyperlink feature  to read the Scriptures.
15:17 With a simple touch,  we quickly find and read the verse.
15:21 That is good!
15:23 If you regularly do this,  you get a grip on the word of life.
15:27 But would you like to get  a tight grip on the word of life?
15:32 To get a tight grip requires more effort
15:35 than a swipe of a finger  and then swiftly moving on.
15:39 You need to slow down  and analyze the material.
15:43 Only then will the information you study
15:46 become imprinted on your mind and heart,
15:49 leaving a clear and distinct impression.
15:53 How, then, can I get more out of my study?
15:57 Let’s demonstrate a method  taught during Gilead School.
16:01 It involves the use of six questions.
16:05 The following poem, written  by English journalist Rudyard Kipling,
16:09 can help guide better thinking:
16:12 “I keep six honest serving-men
16:15 “(They taught me all I knew);
16:17 “Their names are What and Why
16:19 “and When and How
16:21 and Where and Who.”
16:25 When studying God’s Word,  ask yourself these questions
16:29 and then do research in our publications
16:32 to get the facts  and discern the spiritual lessons.
16:36 To illustrate how to do this,
16:39 let’s open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49
16:42 and look at verses 22 through 25.
16:51 First, we ask the when and where.
16:55 Now, with some research,
16:57 we learn that Jacob  spoke these words near the end of his life.
17:01 He was in Egypt,
17:03 but what he described  takes us back to Canaan some 40 years
17:07 when his son Joseph was a young man.
17:10 Now we have  a clearer picture of these verses.
17:13 So now, let’s read and analyze verse 22:
17:18 “Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree,
17:23 a fruitful tree by a spring,  whose branches extend over the wall.”
17:28 “The offshoot of a fruitful tree.”
17:31 Who is the “fruitful tree”?
17:32 It is Joseph’s father, Jacob.
17:35 How was he fruitful?
17:37 He bore many children.
17:40 Joseph’s “branches extend over the wall.”
17:44 As Jacob’s offshoot,  Joseph is singled out
17:48 for a special blessing  superior to that of his brothers.
17:51 Why?
17:53 Joseph proved he had  the qualities needed for leadership.
17:57 However, of even greater value  than his abilities
18:00 was his being a spiritual man.
18:03 Let’s read verse 23:
18:06 “But the archers kept harassing him
18:09 and shot at him and kept harboring  animosity against him.”
18:13 “The archers kept harassing him.”
18:15 Who are “the archers”?
18:17 Joseph’s half brothers.
18:19 How?
18:21 They shot figuratively at Joseph
18:23 —arrows of envy and hatred  and jealousy were used to attack him.
18:28 Now, eventually,  his brothers sold him into slavery.
18:32 Now let’s read verse 24:
18:34 “And yet his bow remained in place,
18:38 “and his hands stayed strong and agile.
18:41 “This was from the hands  of the powerful one of Jacob,
18:44 from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.”
18:47 “His bow remained in place.”
18:49 How?
18:51 Despite the repeated attacks,
18:53 Joseph repaid animosity with kindness.
18:56 Joseph endured this ill-treatment
18:59 and did not weaken in his devotion to God.
19:02 Now we ask, How?
19:04 How is it that Joseph  kept a spiritual outlook
19:07 despite the harassment and animosity?
19:10 Let’s read verse 25:
19:13 “He [Joseph] is from the God of your father,
19:17 “and he will help you,  and he is with the Almighty,
19:21 “and he will bless you with the blessings  of the heavens above,
19:24 “with the blessings of the deep below,
19:26 with the blessings of the breasts and womb.”
19:30 “He is with the Almighty.”
19:33 Joseph had Jehovah’s help.
19:36 The Almighty was by his side through it all.
19:39 We’ve used our questions  to get the facts of the account,
19:43 but we’re not done.
19:45 Now let’s use them  to take our study to a spiritual plane.
19:49 Next, let’s ask a what question.
19:53 What does this account  teach us about Jehovah?
19:57 Jehovah never abandons his loyal servants.
20:01 Even in the depths of prison,  Joseph was not alone.
20:06 Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph.
20:09 Now make the connection  to Jehovah’s people today,
20:12 including yourself.
20:14 Jehovah will never abandon us.
20:17 Rather, he shows loyal love  to all those who serve him whole-souled.
20:22 Would Jehovah let Joseph  remain in prison indefinitely?
20:27 No.
20:29 At the appointed time, relief came.
20:32 Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains
20:35 to the second most powerful man in Egypt
20:38 —from prison to palace in one day.
20:41 Make the connection to us.
20:43 Our trials are temporary.
20:46 Jehovah will soon bring relief,
20:48 even in unexpected or surprising ways.
20:52 Meanwhile, we are never alone;
20:55 Jehovah is with us.
20:59 Again, let’s ask the question, How?
21:02 How does the account  contribute to the Bible’s theme?
21:07 Joseph suffered, but his suffering led
21:10 to the survival of Abraham’s offspring,
21:13 leading to the Messiah.
21:15 Joseph’s account  is not just a riveting story.
21:19 It directly contributed
21:21 to the development of Jehovah’s purpose.
21:24 Think about this:
21:26 In spite of the poor conduct of his brothers,
21:30 Joseph forgave them and took the initiative
21:33 to improve their relationship with him.
21:37 Joseph’s attitude  was a reflection of Jehovah’s attitude.
21:42 With their family reunited,
21:44 Jehovah also forgave Joseph’s brothers
21:47 and took the initiative  in restoring their relationship with Himself.
21:52 In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph’s brother Judah
21:57 the honor of being  an ancestor of the Messiah.
22:01 What are the lessons in this account?
22:04 Let’s highlight just one.
22:06 Genesis 49:23:
22:10 “But the archers kept harassing him
22:13 and shot at him and kept harboring  animosity against him.”
22:18 Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph.
22:21 Recall Joseph’s response in verse 24?
22:27 “And yet his bow remained in place,
22:30 and his hands stayed strong and agile.”
22:33 In other words, he did not return fire.
22:37 His bow remained in place.
22:39 Reflect on the last time  you were wronged by someone.
22:44 How did we react to what we experienced?
22:48 Did we seek to vindicate ourselves  or insist on our rights?
22:53 Did we fire arrows of animosity in return,
22:57 or did we show mercy and loyal love?
23:00 Did our reaction reveal  that God’s spirit was operative on us?
23:05 Like Joseph, we know  we will have Jehovah’s approval
23:09 even if we are wronged or experience trials
23:13 that make us feel like we are in prison.
23:15 Reflective questions like these
23:18 enable us to make the account our own.
23:21 It becomes part of us,
23:23 part of our way of thinking,  our way of acting.
23:25 This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.
23:29 This type of study rewards us  not simply with a collection of facts
23:34 that impress us today  and are forgotten tomorrow.
23:38 Rather, it leaves us  with core principles that we remember,
23:42 that influence our decisions,  and that guide our lives.
23:46 We tighten our grip on the word of life.
23:51 Let’s review the fundamentals of study.
23:54 Again, this is not  about old methods or new methods
23:58 or about what device you are using.
24:00 This discussion transcends devices.
24:03 It’s about basic methods of Bible study.
24:08 We can liken these three phases of study
24:11 to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.
24:15 Gathering is when we read the Bible.
24:18 We don’t run through the field  grabbing just handfuls of grain;
24:22 we systematically harvest the field.
24:26 Sifting is when we sort out what we gathered,
24:29 answering who, what, where,  when, why, and how to get the facts.
24:33 Baking is when we think
24:36 —“turning up the heat” in our mind and heart—
24:39 something no one else can do for you.
24:43 The questions we ask  can take our study to a spiritual plane.
24:48 Most importantly,  what does this teach me about Jehovah?
24:53 How does it contribute to the Bible’s theme?
24:56 And the bottom line:  What is the lesson for me?
25:03 Jehovah gave us a mind  that is begging to learn.
25:06 It is a gift with the capacity  to cultivate thinking ability.
25:11 When we make the effort  to unearth gems from God’s Word,
25:14 we find that study  is rewarding and delightful.
25:18 More importantly, our study skills enable us
25:21 to keep a tight grip on the word of life.
25:24 A tight grip on God’s Word  will make our life better now
25:29 and give us the opportunity  to continue learning
25:32 about our heavenly Father for all eternity.
25:37 Joseph’s account  was an excellent example for us
25:41 to demonstrate  the fundamentals of Bible study.
25:45 During our discussion,
25:47 we used pictures  to help bring the account to life.
25:51 As we learned  from Brother Boyle’s interview,
25:53 pictures and illustrations  give us an accurate image
25:57 to use in our meditation.
25:59 And if there’s a video,
26:01 we have yet another way  to imagine ourselves in the account.
26:05 So we’re excited  to introduce this month’s music video
26:09 depicting the trials  and blessings that Joseph experienced.
26:13 It reminds us that, like Joseph,
26:16 when we have Jehovah,  we are never alone.
26:36 Abandoned and betrayed,  Forsaken and alone,
26:50 Despair my one companion,  My heart within me like a stone
27:04 With no one here for me,  No kindly word of care,
27:18 Who’ll offer consolation?  My heavy burden, who can share?
27:29 I’m not alone;  I never was.
27:37 I’ll never be,  And all because
27:44 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
27:51 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
27:58 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.
28:14 Whatever I may lose  By sticking close to you,
28:29 No matter who may fail me,  I know you’ll never be untrue.
28:43 You’re close to me, O God,  And never far away.
28:57 My faith, my hope, reliance​—  I know you never will betray.
29:08 I’m not alone;  I never was.
29:15 I’ll never be,  And all because
29:23 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
29:29 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
29:37 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.
29:47 I never was.
29:51 I’ll never be,  And all because
29:58 Jehovah knows;  Jehovah sees.
30:05 He hears my prayer;  He’s here with me.
30:12 Whatever comes my way,  I’m never alone.
30:31 Have you ever felt as Joseph did?
30:35 There were times when Joseph’s life  was not turning out as he had hoped.
30:40 He no doubt wondered  if he’d ever be set free from prison
30:44 or if he’d ever see his father again  or his younger brother, Benjamin.
30:49 But Joseph knew that his God, Jehovah,  never lost sight of him.
30:54 This surely helped him endure.
30:57 We could be in a painful situation  that seems to drag on endlessly.
31:02 But when we study  a Bible account like Joseph’s
31:05 —asking the six questions—
31:07 we can fully understand  and apply the lessons in our life.
31:11 Then we can build the same faith that he had
31:14 —that we too are never alone.
31:19 Let’s now listen to brothers and sisters
31:21 who are using  the study methods we’ve discussed.
31:24 Some learned them in Gilead School,  others from Gilead graduates,
31:28 or good examples  in their families and congregations.
31:32 They’ve also applied what they learned
31:34 from our publications  about good study habits.
31:37 See if any of the ways they study
31:39 could help you keep  “a tight grip” on God’s Word.
31:45 The more you study,
31:47 the more you understand Jehovah.
31:49 The more you understand Jehovah,
31:51 the more you love him.
31:53 Jehovah clearly tells us:
31:54 “My thoughts are not your thoughts.”
31:56 So if we want to understand  Jehovah’s thinking better,
31:59 we need to dig deep in our study,
32:01 and then we share those thoughts with others.
32:05 Personal study is like fuel
32:07 that keeps you going.
32:10 Personally, I’m not a good student,
32:12 but I really learned how to study the Bible.
32:16 The Bible came alive during Gilead.
32:18 Self-discipline is involved  —very much.
32:25 I overcome the tiredness aspect
32:29 of Bible study by not doing it
32:32 at a time of day  when I know I’m going to be tired.
32:34 I can be tired for other things later on  —but not for that.
32:40 Each session of my Bible study  begins with a prayer,
32:43 “Please help me recognize  it is counsel for me,
32:47 and then give me the strength  to work on it.”
32:50 I have a color-coded system,
32:52 so I know what certain things stand for.
32:55 I have a particular color
32:57 for Jehovah’s good hand in people’s lives;
33:02 I have another color for warning examples;
33:07 I have another for fine examples to imitate.
33:23 You have to get behind the information,
33:26 not just focus on one verse or one chapter.
33:29 See who’s involved, the time,
33:32 the conditions, how many people are there,
33:35 and then you’ll get  the true meaning of the verse.
33:39 John 1:1,
33:41 who is “the Word”?
33:44 We can go to verse 18.
33:46 “Begotten” meant
33:48 he had a beginning,  a time when he started
33:50 —when he began—
33:53 in heaven with his Father.
33:55 That’s where he was.
33:58 Philippians 4:6, 7 is a scripture  that I’ve read many times over.
34:02 “The peace of God that excels all thought.”
34:05 OK, how do you get that?
34:07 It’s from having  a good relationship with Jehovah.
34:11 How is it that God’s peace  ‘guards your heart’?
34:15 “By means of Christ Jesus” our Lord.
34:17 And I said: “Why by Jesus?
34:21 “Because Jesus paid the ransom;
34:25 that ransom is what makes possible  a relationship with Jehovah.”
34:30 So it almost goes full circle.
34:57 I attended a School for Congregation Elders
35:00 that had Gilead graduates as instructors.
35:04 One of the methods is to analyze
35:07 a certain Bible account  from different perspectives.
35:10 We can’t see  the whole picture from one angle.
35:15 I share my research results  with Bible students,
35:17 and that helps them  to know Jehovah better,
35:20 and it helps them to see  that what they’re studying
35:22 is of practical value.
35:25 I had studied up on Jacob;
35:27 he wrestled all night
35:29 with an angel.
35:32 And I wanted to share it  with some of my friends.
35:35 One of the brothers  that happened to sit around
35:40 when this discussion was going on  came back to me, and he said to me:
35:45 “I had concluded my arrangements
35:49 “to quit full-time service.
35:50 “But after listening to that discussion,
35:53 I’ve decided that I’m no longer stopping.”
35:56 And that was  such a wonderful moment for me.
36:00 I thanked Jehovah.
36:04 When I learned that I  was going to become a mom,
36:06 I said, “Jehovah, if this little one
36:09 could love you,  then I’ll get to keep him forever.”
36:13 And I began to teach everything  I was learning to him.
36:17 So it’s a matter
36:19 of keeping my faith strong,
36:22 and there’s no shortcut.
36:24 Every session of study  that is properly done with good meditation
36:28 adds a new pillar
36:30 to the strength of our faith.
36:35 I look forward to those times  when I can, you know,
36:36 run upstairs by myself  and just shut everything off,
36:39 and it’s just me and Jehovah.
36:44 Life today is very unpredictable,
36:46 but I’ve come to see that as long as I  keep a tight grip on God’s Word,
36:50 nothing can “separate [me] from God’s love.”
36:54 The joy these brothers and sisters get  from their personal study
36:58 is clearly heard in their expressions.
37:00 Recall what they said:
37:02 “The more you understand Jehovah,  the more you love him.”
37:06 “Study is like fuel that keeps you going.”
37:09 And “I can shut everything off,  and it’s just me and Jehovah.”
37:14 We also heard them ask the six questions:
37:16 who, what, where, when, why, and how.
37:20 They also used tools for research  and note-taking that works for them.
37:24 Is there something you saw  or that we discussed
37:27 that you’d like to add  to your study routine?
37:29 If so, try it out.
37:33 Young ones, it’s true  that the more you understand Jehovah,
37:36 the more you love him.
37:38 And what a blessing you have  if your family worships Jehovah with you
37:42 and teaches you how to draw close to him.
37:45 But some young ones  have had to build their faith
37:48 without their family’s support.
37:51 Listen to the experience of Ersi Royer  from the United States.
37:55 What spiritual decision did she face  at just 14 years old?
38:00 And what did she do  that illustrates the value
38:03 of deep personal study?
38:05 Growing up,
38:08 it wasn’t the typical,
38:10 “My mom is a pioneer, my dad is an elder,
38:13 and we’re doing great in the congregation.”
38:15 My family life wasn’t the best,
38:18 so why would I want to do this religion  that nobody is happy
38:21 in our family with?
38:24 And I think that can make you feel
38:26 very alone or odd
38:29 or awkward or secluded.
38:33 And at that time,  I was graduating eighth grade.
38:35 There were dances;
38:36 friends were hanging out, going to parties.
38:39 And I remember thinking:  ‘Wow, these look like really nice kids.
38:44 Why aren’t I doing that?’
38:47 I hadn’t really delved into the Bible enough  to answer questions
38:51 that I really needed to know.
38:54 I went in prayer to Jehovah and said:  “I’m so sorry, but today I’m not a Witness.
38:58 I’m going to try to prove  everything that I’ve been taught is wrong.”
39:02 I asked him that if he’s real,
39:05 to help me understand.
39:07 So I went in my room
39:09 and shut the door.
39:10 I got every book off the shelf.
39:13 I started off organized,
39:15 but by the end of the evening,
39:16 I had books  all over the place with pages open.
39:19 The more I kept reading about Jehovah,
39:22 the more the next topic would take me  to then connect the scriptures.
39:26 Jesus is linked to Jehovah;
39:28 the angels are linked to Jehovah;  the resurrection is linked to Jehovah.
39:31 So you can’t believe in one thing  and not everything else
39:35 if you really want to know the truth.
39:37 And so that’s what did it for me,
39:41 especially the scripture in Psalms
39:43 when it said  that ‘you saw even the embryo of me.’
39:47 And it was an emotional scripture for me
39:49 because I thought:  ‘Wow,
39:52 ‘my parents aren’t doing great  in the truth right now.
39:55 ‘But Jehovah found a way to find me,
39:58 ‘and he knew what I could be.
40:01 ‘Now I have my answer.  I don’t have an excuse.
40:03 ‘Jehovah gave me enough knowledge  that now I’m responsible.
40:06 I now need to act on that  and show my love in return for him.’
40:11 Within a week, I found another sister
40:14 in the hall that was really helpful  in me getting out
40:16 in service quite often.
40:19 I don’t think to this day she ever knew  how much I appreciated that.
40:22 Although things were declining  in our family spiritually,
40:26 I was able to get baptized.
40:28 As I progressed spiritually,
40:30 I could see that I did not have
40:32 the support of my family,
40:35 but I had to trust that Jehovah  would help me through it.
40:37 And at least by the time I got home,  if there was an issue,
40:40 I had the strength of the meeting  and the brothers and sisters
40:43 and joy that they  couldn’t take away from me.
40:48 I remember I came home one day  with some friends.
40:50 It was a nice day
40:52 —encouraging, upbuilding.
40:54 We pulled into our driveway;  they dropped me off
40:57 and said good-bye.
40:59 My parents were really upset
41:02 when they came and met me at the door.
41:04 They couldn’t fully understand
41:07 why I was making my decisions
41:10 the way I was  to serve Jehovah more fully.
41:15 We just could not agree
41:17 on where my relationship  with Jehovah was going.
41:21 And at that point,  I left with the clothes on my back.
41:26 In a matter of a few minutes,
41:29 my life forever changed.
41:37 I had a spiritual aunt that took me in,
41:42 helped me gather myself together,
41:43 and literally fed me, clothed me,
41:47 helped me spiritually.
41:50 And so then, my support became Jehovah
41:53 and the congregation.
41:57 I remember that a sister told me years ago,
42:00 “Be who you needed when you were young.”
42:03 And so when I look at those little ones,
42:06 I look at myself and say,
42:08 ‘How could I have benefited
42:10 from someone taking the time for me  when I was that age?’
42:14 I’ve always tried remembering the young ones
42:16 —because that’s just part of who I am—
42:19 and making sure that they know  that they’re not alone.
42:22 If there is a young one out there  who isn’t sure
42:25 if this is the truth or not,
42:27 I would like them to know  that Jehovah knows
42:30 who they are,
42:32 and he’s finding a way  for them to know him.
42:35 Jehovah is real,  he knows them by name,
42:40 he wants them to live,  and he’s fighting for them.
42:44 How amazing that young Ersi chose  to spend an entire day studying
42:49 —proving to herself  that Jehovah knew her and loved her.
42:54 But this was no onetime study marathon.
42:57 From there, she worked to develop  the study habits she needed
43:00 to endure, grow,  and become a spiritual person.
43:04 She pioneered for several years,
43:06 and now serves at Bethel  with her husband, Jeff.
43:09 In my conversation with Ersi,  she expressed her love for her family
43:14 and the hope that someday in the future
43:17 she’ll be reunited with them spiritually.
43:21 There’s no situation in life
43:23 that cannot be handled better than by seeking
43:26 Jehovah’s guidance in the Bible.
43:29 That’s certainly true  in matters of conscience.
43:32 In these situations,
43:34 Jehovah does not tell us  what to do with a command,
43:38 but his Word gives us the principles  we use to train our conscience.
43:43 In this dramatization,
43:45 Emma has to make a difficult decision.
43:48 How is her conscience involved,
43:50 and what steps  does she take to make her decision?
43:57 Every day we make choices
43:59 that can affect  our relationship with Jehovah.
44:02 When there’s a clear Scriptural command,
44:04 the right choice may seem easy.
44:08 But what if there’s not?
44:12 How can we be sure  we’re making a wise decision?
44:17 An invitation to our niece’s wedding arrived.
44:22 Thomas was excited about it.
44:28 I was excited too.
44:32 But the ceremony
44:34 was being held at a local church.
44:38 I wondered if it would still be OK  for me to attend.
44:43 Even though Thomas wasn’t yet willing
44:45 to accept a Bible study,  he gradually softened over the years
44:48 since I came into the truth.
44:51 I knew he understood why  I would never enter a church for worship,
44:55 but what about attending a wedding?
44:57 Jehovah approves of weddings.
45:03 That afternoon,
45:04 I went to help Amy plan a menu
45:06 for the pioneer school lunch coming up.
45:12 She noticed I was a bit distracted,
45:16 so I told her my concerns about the wedding.
45:19 But you’re not thinking of going, are you?
45:22 Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter,
45:25 but I didn’t feel  she really understood my situation.
45:31 Although I appreciated her concern,
45:34 I felt like she was judging me.
45:39 The next day, I decided  to visit Charlotte and Allan
45:42 and ask their advice.
45:46 Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth
45:48 many years before Allan,  so they really understood my situation.
45:53 Is Amy right?
45:55 Would it be wrong to attend the wedding?
45:58 What would you do if you were me?
46:01 Charlotte explained that in situations
46:04 where there’s no specific Bible command,
46:06 it becomes a matter of conscience.
46:10 And what one person’s conscience allows
46:13 may be different from another.
46:17 The important thing
46:19 is that we make decisions  that leave us with a good conscience.
46:35 But how do I do that?
46:38 Dear Emma, it’s really a matter of training.
46:43 Allan showed me the scripture  at Hebrews 5:14,
46:45 where the apostle Paul wrote:
46:47 “Solid food belongs to mature people,
46:50 “to those who through use
46:52 “have their powers of discernment trained
46:55 to distinguish both right and wrong.”
47:00 But Paul didn’t just write those words;
47:05 he lived them.
47:09 He carefully studied  the principles in God’s Word.
47:14 And as a result,  he was able to make decisions
47:18 that left him with a good conscience.
47:24 So even when there’s no stated law  on a matter,
47:27 we can always find a Bible principle
47:30 that can give us insight into God’s thinking.
47:36 So I made it a matter of prayer,  and then I got to work.
47:45 I researched articles
47:48 in the Watch Tower Publications Index  and the Research Guide.
47:53 I found a really good thought  in chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book.
48:02 I also read about others  who faced similar situations
48:05 and what Bible principles they found helpful.
48:09 Then I meditated on all these.
48:20 As I kept studying,  I was able to bring my conscience
48:23 in harmony with Jehovah’s spirit,
48:26 not just with my heart.
48:39 I realized that having  a Bible-trained conscience
48:42 doesn’t mean everyone  will always think exactly alike
48:46 —and that’s OK.
48:48 But if we train our conscience  by applying Bible principles,
48:53 it will guide us along in life,  so that each of us
48:56 can remain in God’s love.
49:00 What did our sister, Emma,  do that we can imitate?
49:04 When she realized  that she needed more information,
49:06 she got to work!
49:08 She studied in order  to train her conscience
49:11 and to make a decision  that left her conscience clean.
49:15 We can do the same  when a conscience matter comes up.
49:18 But we can do more.
49:20 We can prepare in advance,
49:22 train our conscience on matters  that do not have clear Bible commands,
49:27 and study Bible principles
49:29 that teach our conscience  the rules it should work with.
49:33 Then, when we need it, it’s ready.
49:35 We can trust it and make decisions
49:37 in harmony with a Bible-trained conscience.
49:41 We urge you brothers and sisters:
49:44 Keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
49:47 That’s what our program has been about.
49:50 We learned why  it’s essential to stay close to God
49:54 and to receive his gift of everlasting life.
49:57 But what’s more,  we learned practical ways to do it
50:01 using tried and true methods  of personal Bible study.
50:05 We may not have  an opportunity to attend Gilead
50:09 or another theocratic school,
50:11 but Jehovah shows all of us  how to benefit from his written Word.
50:16 What an expression of God’s love!
50:20 To prepare this month’s program,
50:22 our team spent time  with the Theocratic Schools Department
50:26 at the world headquarters facility  in Patterson, New York.
50:29 This has been the home  for Gilead School since 1995.
50:34 And since arriving here,
50:36 47 classes have graduated.
50:38 Gilead School began  with its first class in 1943,
50:42 and since then,  close to 9,000 students have been trained.
50:46 When students come to class each day,
50:50 the writings and models on display
50:52 put their mind on spiritual things
50:55 as they get ready to study God’s Word.
50:58 Isaiah 11:9 says:
51:00 “The earth will certainly be filled  with the knowledge of Jehovah
51:05 as the waters cover the sea.”
51:07 Our worldwide brotherhood
51:09 works in harmony with that prophecy.
51:12 It’s fitting then that here in the classroom,
51:15 lectures cover every part of the Bible,
51:19 exploring background information
51:21 to get the sense of the account.
51:23 . . . probably still got bruises.
51:25 And Paul is telling them, very honestly,
51:28 ‘we have to enter through many tribulations.’
51:31 Can you imagine, you’re sitting there  and you’re looking at this man
51:33 bruised and cut,
51:35 and he’s saying,
51:37 ‘We (you and I)  have to go through many tribulations.’
51:42 Students participate freely,
51:45 drawing lessons that they can use  in their life and assignments.
51:49 It impresses me to see  that the Christian congregation in our time
51:54 follows exactly  the pattern that was used back then.
51:58 Studying in the Theocratic Schools’ library
52:01 is a cherished part of their day.
52:04 In a quiet, relaxed setting,
52:06 they associate figuratively  with “the faithful and discreet slave,”
52:10 searching and taking in the spiritual food
52:13 that nourishes  and strengthens their relationship
52:16 with their heavenly Father, Jehovah.
52:19 Students benefit from the hard work  of the school instructors.
52:24 Under the direction  of the Teaching Committee
52:26 of the Governing Body,
52:28 they manage the curriculum  for Gilead and other schools
52:31 that are taught here and in the field.
52:34 Through their diligent efforts  and Jehovah’s blessing,
52:37 the Theocratic Schools staff  count it a privilege
52:41 to serve their brothers  and the Governing Body.
52:44 We send you  our sincere Christian love and greetings.
52:51 Thank you for joining us this month.
52:54 This is JW Broadcasting
52:56 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

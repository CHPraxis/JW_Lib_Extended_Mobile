00:03.682 --> 00:06.625
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are known around the world 


00:06.625 --> 00:09.000
for preaching 
the good news of the Kingdom. 


00:11.132 --> 00:15.410
How is this work 
accomplished here in Indonesia? 


00:15.410 --> 00:18.557
It is certainly a challenging assignment. 


00:18.557 --> 00:21.102
This lifesaving message needs to be brought 


00:21.102 --> 00:23.460
to over 250 million people 


00:23.460 --> 00:26.415
living on thousands of different islands. 


00:26.415 --> 00:28.632
To support this tremendous work, 


00:28.632 --> 00:31.094
the Indonesia branch office was relocated 


00:31.093 --> 00:33.908
to the 31st floor 
of the Central Park building in Jakarta 


00:33.908 --> 00:36.000
in April 2014. 


00:37.657 --> 00:40.660
A number of apartments 
at an adjacent apartment tower 


00:40.660 --> 00:42.667
are being used to house the Bethel family, 


00:42.667 --> 00:45.129
which has approximately 100 members 


00:45.128 --> 00:48.000
that support the work of the branch office. 


00:49.007 --> 00:54.000
Each morning they commute to this office, 
ready for their work assignments.


01:00.840 --> 01:05.690
We call this place Bethel, 
which means “House of God.” 


01:05.690 --> 01:08.485
By means of this brief video presentation, 


01:08.485 --> 01:12.008
we would like to warmly welcome you 
to our branch office and Bethel home 


01:12.008 --> 01:16.000
and provide you with an overview 
of what is being accomplished here.


01:17.807 --> 01:22.000
Our day always starts 
with a morning worship program at 7:20 a.m. 


01:23.490 --> 01:26.502
What is being considered? 


01:26.502 --> 01:29.589
Every day 
an interesting Bible verse is being read, 


01:29.588 --> 01:31.590
commented on, 


01:31.590 --> 01:34.343
and explained 
so as to make its practical value 


01:34.343 --> 01:36.511
clear to the Bethel family. 


01:36.512 --> 01:38.515
After a closing prayer, 


01:38.515 --> 01:41.000
all are ready to start working. 


01:42.268 --> 01:44.645
Would you like to know 
what the Bethel family is doing? 


01:44.645 --> 01:48.000
Let’s have a look at a few 
of the activities being done here.


01:49.440 --> 01:52.820
Our receptionist welcomes 
our many visitors in the main lobby 


01:52.820 --> 01:55.000
and will make arrangements for tours. 


01:56.282 --> 01:58.889
Also, all incoming calls are answered here, 


01:58.888 --> 02:02.000
and some additional secretarial work 
is done whenever time permits.


02:04.373 --> 02:09.753
An ever-growing work at our branch 
is related to audio and video recordings. 


02:09.753 --> 02:12.506
In addition to Indonesian language material, 


02:12.507 --> 02:17.429
in recent years we have started recording 
in many indigenous languages as well. 


02:17.428 --> 02:20.640
What is being recorded? 


02:20.640 --> 02:23.372
A wide variety 
of publications in audio format, 


02:23.372 --> 02:27.000
as well as convention dramas, 
videos, and Web materials. 


02:28.565 --> 02:30.775
The process is very involved. 


02:30.775 --> 02:33.193
Readers and voice participants 
are auditioned, 


02:33.193 --> 02:36.155
selected, and coached. 


02:36.155 --> 02:39.657
Hours are spent doing the actual recording. 


02:39.657 --> 02:41.825
Next, the material 


02:41.825 --> 02:44.000
is reviewed and edited 
to achieve the best possible quality. 


02:46.875 --> 02:50.670
When satisfied, the final product 
will be uploaded to jw.org 


02:50.670 --> 02:53.443
for the benefit of you 
and millions of other people 


02:53.443 --> 02:56.856
all around the world.


02:56.857 --> 03:00.034
Producing publications 
in many different languages, 


03:00.033 --> 03:04.000
whether in electronic or printed format, 
requires translation. 


03:05.157 --> 03:08.229
Some of this work 
is done at our branch office. 


03:08.228 --> 03:10.981
The translation process can be challenging, 


03:10.982 --> 03:14.610
but it is a very important 
and rewarding work. 


03:14.610 --> 03:17.488
Teams of translators work hard every day 


03:17.488 --> 03:20.031
to keep up 
with the steady flow of new material. 


03:20.032 --> 03:24.000
They are trained to translate 
the English text into Indonesian. 


03:25.330 --> 03:30.000
They are also provided 
with various research tools. 


03:31.065 --> 03:34.818
The English text is also made 
available to local language teams 


03:34.818 --> 03:37.258
located at remote translation offices, 


03:37.258 --> 03:39.676
or RTOs, throughout the country. 


03:39.677 --> 03:42.700
It is then translated 
into Indonesian Sign Language 


03:42.700 --> 03:45.808
and many other local languages. 


03:45.808 --> 03:47.810
This entire translation process 


03:47.810 --> 03:50.897
can take weeks or even months to complete, 


03:50.897 --> 03:53.420
and even then the work is not yet done. 


03:53.420 --> 03:55.485
What’s next? 


03:55.485 --> 03:59.217
The translated text is now ready 
for the composition process, 


03:59.217 --> 04:02.200
where a print-ready file is created. 


04:02.200 --> 04:04.222
Most of our publications are printed 


04:04.222 --> 04:09.687
at the Japan branch office 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


04:09.687 --> 04:13.524
Cleanliness is also observed 
in the Bethel residences and offices. 


04:13.523 --> 04:18.000
Each Bethel family member 
is responsible for cleaning their own room. 


04:19.403 --> 04:24.000
Housekeepers assist the family by cleaning 
each residence room once a month. 


04:27.632 --> 04:30.227
Besides the kitchen and laundry operations, 


04:30.227 --> 04:33.919
the Bethel Office is responsible 
for organizing spiritual programs 


04:33.918 --> 04:37.000
and for the overall management 
of all branch office properties.


04:43.137 --> 04:46.410
Back at the office, 
more work is being accomplished. 


04:46.410 --> 04:48.705
Hundreds of letters 
and reports from the field 


04:48.705 --> 04:50.707
are received on a weekly basis. 


04:50.707 --> 04:53.167
Where is this correspondence handled? 


04:53.167 --> 04:55.190
Here in the Service Department, 


04:55.190 --> 04:57.233
they are responsible to communicate with 


04:57.233 --> 04:59.713
and direct the activities in the field. 


04:59.713 --> 05:02.925
They also handle the organizing 
of various Bible schools, 


05:02.925 --> 05:04.932
conventions, assemblies, 


05:04.932 --> 05:08.000
and approve the formation 
of new congregations and groups. 


05:09.823 --> 05:13.311
Interest shown in our Bible educational work 
is followed up carefully. 


05:13.312 --> 05:16.024
When someone requests 
a visit from Jehovah’s Witnesses 


05:16.023 --> 05:18.546
by filling out the form 
on the jw.org website, 


05:18.547 --> 05:22.800
brothers locate 
the nearest congregation and inform them 


05:22.800 --> 05:25.000
in order to send someone 
as soon as possible.


05:31.157 --> 05:33.457
All this work 
would be much harder to accomplish 


05:33.457 --> 05:35.480
without the use of technology. 


05:35.480 --> 05:38.650
Therefore, 
a vital part of our operation here 


05:38.650 --> 05:41.048
is the Computer Department. 


05:41.048 --> 05:44.385
Existing systems 
need to be maintained and upgraded. 


05:44.385 --> 05:48.180
New equipment is bought and installed 
not only at the branch office 


05:48.180 --> 05:53.560
but also at satellite locations 
and remote translation offices.


05:53.560 --> 05:55.980
As a result of the good news being preached, 


05:55.980 --> 05:59.442
there is a growing need 
for more dignified places of worship. 


05:59.442 --> 06:01.444
The building of such Kingdom Halls 


06:01.443 --> 06:04.821
is organized 
by the Local Design/Construction Department. 


06:04.822 --> 06:08.952
Along with new construction,
the LDC is responsible for overseeing 


06:08.952 --> 06:11.787
the renovation and maintenance 
of existing Kingdom Halls 


06:11.787 --> 06:14.082
as well as maintenance training. 


06:14.082 --> 06:16.542
In addition to Kingdom Hall upkeep, 


06:16.542 --> 06:18.940
this department is involved 
with searching for properties 


06:18.940 --> 06:22.000
to be used as RTOs or missionary homes.


06:24.320 --> 06:29.388
Operating our branch office facilities 
requires a constant supply of various items. 


06:29.388 --> 06:32.350
The Purchasing Department 
cares for this responsibility 


06:32.350 --> 06:35.603
by managing vendor accounts 
and receiving shipments. 


06:35.603 --> 06:37.605
These goods are then processed 


06:37.605 --> 06:41.000
and sent to the branch facilities 
where they are needed.


06:42.513 --> 06:47.030
Some activities need to be handled 
administratively and legally. 


06:47.030 --> 06:49.450
Who is doing this? 


06:49.450 --> 06:51.932
The Governing Body 
appoints a Branch Committee, 


06:51.932 --> 06:55.519
who in turn receives 
the support of office personnel 


06:55.518 --> 06:57.770
to see to it that guidelines and instructions 


06:57.770 --> 07:02.505
are being implemented appropriately 
and in a timely manner. 


07:02.505 --> 07:07.343
This includes giving attention to those 
in need when natural disasters strike. 


07:07.343 --> 07:09.803
The Legal Department 
makes sure that all legal requirements 


07:09.803 --> 07:12.000
are being fulfilled.


07:15.372 --> 07:18.709
As you have just seen, 
much is being accomplished here at Bethel. 


07:18.708 --> 07:20.955
And amazingly, 
all of this is being accomplished 


07:20.955 --> 07:24.380
by volunteers 
who have dedicated themselves fully 


07:24.380 --> 07:27.280
to support the Kingdom 
preaching work here in Indonesia. 


07:27.280 --> 07:29.593
We thank you for your visit 


07:29.593 --> 07:39.835
and sincerely hope 
you will enjoy touring our branch office.

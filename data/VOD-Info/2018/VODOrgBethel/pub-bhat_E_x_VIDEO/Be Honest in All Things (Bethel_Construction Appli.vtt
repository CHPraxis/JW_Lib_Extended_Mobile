On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.766 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we warmly commend you for your desire

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to expand your service to Jehovah

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your interest
in submitting an application

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as a temporary volunteer

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as a member
of the Worldwide Order

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Special Full-Time Servants

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By making yourself available
to serve in this unique way,

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you imitate the faithful prophet Isaiah,

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who said at Isaiah 6:8:

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:41.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am! Send me!”

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Submitting your application
may open a door of opportunity

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:47.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah and his organization

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:50.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a variety of ways.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, there’s a place
for everyone in Jehovah’s service.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we’re working hard
as a congregation publisher,

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a regular pioneer, a Bethelite,

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on a theocratic construction project,

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:07.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the satisfaction of knowing

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah treasures what we’re doing

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of our heartfelt love for him.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 6:10 says:

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love you showed
for his name by ministering

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:27.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continuing to minister
to the holy ones.”

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before submitting an application
for expanded theocratic service,

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to consider prayerfully

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you’ll respond
to the questions on the application.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:18 says:

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:45.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We wish to conduct ourselves

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:48.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honestly in all things.”

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you should be honest

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in answering the questions
on the application,

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially those that have to do

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your physical health
and spiritual health.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work being done at Bethel

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on theocratic construction projects

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requires good physical,
emotional, and mental health.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, you may have
a chronic health problem

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that requires the regular attention

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a physician
or must be treated with medication.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have
a significant limitation in this way,

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be better for you
to continue your faithful service

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the field
with your local congregation

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, if possible,
in the regular pioneer service.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re not sure
whether your health situation

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would prevent you
from submitting an application,

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders
in your congregation can help you.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can review with you
the specific application questions

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that deal with health matters

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you personally may determine

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether or not you should apply.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of where we’re serving,

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:03.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need Jehovah’s blessing
to be successful.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 127:1 says:

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:10.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is in vain
that its builders work hard on it.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:17.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Unless Jehovah guards the city,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in vain that the guard stays awake.”

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:26.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the account
in Joshua chapter 7 vividly testifies,

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s possible for Jehovah
to withhold his blessing.

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what happened

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Achan stole from the things

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:37.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were supposed
to be dedicated to Jehovah?

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israel lost God’s backing.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our service to Jehovah is important.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot afford
to lose Jehovah’s blessing.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this reason,
the spiritual qualifications

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for expanded service are high.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s expected that all of those
offering themselves to serve at Bethel

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:03.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in other theocratic assignments

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:06.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a clean conscience before Jehovah,

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:10.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having left behind all unclean practices

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or immoral conduct.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
those who have viewed pornography

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the past year should not apply.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, if you realize

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you may have become involved
in unclean conduct

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone
of the opposite sex or the same sex,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:33.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah very considerately explains
what we should do

00:04:33.377 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in James 5:14, 15:

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is there anyone
[spiritually] sick among you?

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:45.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let him call the elders
of the congregation to him,

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let them pray over him,

00:04:47.682 --> 00:04:51.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“applying oil to him
in the name of Jehovah.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the prayer of faith
will make the sick one well,

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Jehovah will raise him up.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, if he has committed sins,
he will be forgiven.”

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring!

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:09.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have a heavy conscience
because of something you’ve done,

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should get help to strengthen
your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can later submit an application
with a clean conscience,

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:21.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that Jehovah
will bless your efforts.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t hesitate to speak

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one of the elders
in your congregation if you need help.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:31.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They love you
and want you to progress and qualify

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:36.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for special privileges
of service in Jehovah’s organization.

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve spoken frankly to you

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:42.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we want you
to make a success

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your service to Jehovah.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also want to reassure you

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your assistance
is very much needed.

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:55.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you enjoy good health,
both spiritually and physically,

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and want to apply
for expanded theocratic service

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a temporary or full-time basis,

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask your elders for an application

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as a temporary volunteer

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:11.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as a member of the Worldwide Order

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:13.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Special Full-Time Servants

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After completing the application,
return it to your elders.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:23.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then continue to allow Jehovah

00:06:23.236 --> 00:06:26.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct your steps
wherever you may serve.

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:30.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you
for the willing spirit you show.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be assured
of our prayers in your behalf

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:38.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you continue
to reach out in Jehovah’s service.

00:00:05 God made me in a wonderful way.
00:00:08 I can see and hear and laugh and play.
00:00:12 I can run and jump and skip along the way.
00:00:16 I’m glad he made me in a wonderful way.
00:00:20 Jehovah made me in a wonderful way—
00:00:23 Such a wonderful way, such a special way.
00:00:27 He knows just how to make ev’rything good—
00:00:31 Better than anyone else ever could.
00:00:39 My ears can hear; my voice can sing;
00:00:42 My hands are made to do so many things.
00:00:46 He made my heart to love others too.
00:00:50 And they love back for the things I do.
00:00:54 Jehovah made me in a wonderful way—
00:00:58 Such a wonderful way, such a special way.
00:01:01 He knows just how to make ev’rything good—
00:01:05 Better than anyone else ever could.

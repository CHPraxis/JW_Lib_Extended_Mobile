I know Jehovah
cares for me;

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cares
for others too.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:14.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I want
to pray for them

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
’Cause they need
help like I do.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of those
who might be sad.

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think
about my mom and dad.

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of brothers
locked in jail,

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I pray
they’ll never fail.

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,
others need my prayers,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And prayers
can help them out.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll think
of what to say

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whom
my prayers should be about.

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah
loves our prayers;

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He listens
all the time.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thoughtful prayers
are what he likes,

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want him
to hear mine.

00:00:05 Jehovah is my best Friend; He made everything there is.
00:00:15 We need him to be our Friend; He wants us to be his.
00:00:25 I know him by his name; He knows my name too.
00:00:34 He loves me, and I love him, ’Cause that’s the way friends do.
00:00:53 Yes, he loves me, and I love him, ’Cause that’s the way friends do.

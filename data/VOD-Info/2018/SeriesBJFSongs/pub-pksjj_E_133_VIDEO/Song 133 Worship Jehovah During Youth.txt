00:00:13 Loving attention  to us he will give,
00:00:19 Blessing our days  for as long as we live.
00:00:28 Honoring parents  who care for our lives
00:00:34 Helps us express  what weâ€™re feeling inside.
00:00:40 Then we find favor  with God and with men,

00:01:03 Growing each day  in our love of the truth.
00:01:09 Giving our best to our God,  we will bring
00:01:15 Joy to the heart  of Jehovah, our King.

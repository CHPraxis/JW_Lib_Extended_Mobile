00:00:04 Now that I’m a little older, And I’m a little bigger too,
00:00:10 I’m ready for some bigger things— For the next ones I can do.
00:00:17 I can sing, and I can answer, And help to clean the Kingdom Hall.
00:00:23 I’ll visit with the older ones— Get to know and love them all.
00:00:30 I’m ready for the next things, The next big things for me.
00:00:36 I’m ready for the next things, The next big things for me.
00:00:43 In the ministry, I’m learning To give a witness at the door
00:00:49 With scriptures I can learn to read.
00:00:53 I can do all this and more!
00:00:56 I’m ready for the next things, The next big things for me.
00:01:02 I’m ready for the next things, The next big things for me.

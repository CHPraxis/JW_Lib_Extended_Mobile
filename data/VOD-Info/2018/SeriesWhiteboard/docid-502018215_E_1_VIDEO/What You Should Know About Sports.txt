00:07 Sports—they can be good for you.
00:10 In fact, at 1 Timothy 4:8,
00:13 the Bible says that  “physical exercise is beneficial.” (Ftn.)
00:16 Sports can teach you vital skills,
00:19 including how to cooperate  and communicate with others.
00:22 But sports can also be bad for you.
00:26 It all depends on what you play,
00:28 how you play,
00:30 and how much you play.
00:33 Consider what you play.
00:35 At Psalm 11:5, the Bible reminds us
00:38 that God “hates anyone who loves violence.”
00:42 And some sports are clearly violent.
00:45 So ask yourself,
00:47 ‘Does it make sense to be entertained
00:49 by watching others get knocked around?’
00:52 Next, consider how you play.
00:55 At Philippians 2:3, the Bible says:
00:58 “Do nothing out of contentiousness  or out of egotism,
01:01 but with humility  consider others superior to you.”
01:05 Of course, nearly every sport
01:07 involves a degree of competition.
01:09 But a win-at-all-costs attitude
01:12 will just take the fun out of the game.
01:15 And besides, at Proverbs 16:18,
01:18 the Bible says that  “pride is before a crash.”
01:21 So ask yourself:
01:23 ‘Do I enjoy playing with overly competitive  and prideful people?
01:27 Then why would I want to be like that?’
01:31 Finally, consider how much you play sports  —or even watch.
01:35 At Philippians 1:10, the Bible says:
01:38 “Make sure of the more important things.”
01:41 That’s good advice because, let’s face it,
01:45 putting too much emphasis on sports
01:47 is like putting too much salt on your food.
01:50 If you spend too much time watching  or playing sports,
01:53 other things in your life will suffer.
01:55 That includes your family life,
01:58 school grades,
02:00 and the time you need to devote to worship.
02:02 In the end, sports shouldn’t be  the most important thing in your life.
02:07 Instead, think of it as the reward you get
02:10 for taking care  of your responsibilities first.
02:13 That way,  you really get the benefits of sports
02:17 and avoid the pitfalls.

00:01 To set the stage  for the experiences in our program,
00:04 I’d like to talk to you  for a few minutes on the theme
00:07 “Invigorate Your Ministry—How?”
00:11 You dear brothers and sisters are having
00:14 a regular share in the preaching work,
00:16 and just think of the results.
00:18 Each year,
00:19 about two billion hours  are spent in the ministry.
00:23 Millions of Bible studies are conducted,
00:26 and those being baptized  number into the hundreds of thousands.
00:31 If you are a Kingdom publisher,
00:33 you have had a share  in those thrilling statistics.
00:37 But there’s a potential danger.
00:40 With so much to do in our life
00:42 —not just in the ministry  but also with secular work,
00:46 family responsibilities,  for some, even health issues—
00:50 we can get into a rut.
00:53 It’s not always easy to detect at first,
00:56 because in this age of technology
00:58 we always feel busy.
01:01 But what consumes our day?
01:04 Watch this one-minute video,
01:06 and try to detect what’s going on  in the life of one brother.
01:10 His life is in a rut.
01:13 Try to figure out why.
02:29 Would you say  that this brother’s life is in a rut?
02:32 Oh, he’s active all day
02:34 —he always has something to do.
02:37 But it’s as if his mind  has been kidnapped by his devices.
02:42 Have you ever had  the experience of reading an e-mail
02:46 while someone  is trying to tell you something?
02:48 It can be embarrassing
02:50 when you realize  that they’ve asked you a question,
02:53 and they’re waiting for an answer,
02:55 but you have no idea what they asked.
02:57 It’s embarrassing, right?
02:59 But what if the person  who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah?
03:05 Even though we aren’t doing anything wrong,
03:08 our daily routine  can occupy our attention so much
03:12 that we are not able to hear  the refreshing words of Jehovah.
03:17 That can happen to any one of us.
03:20 Even our spiritual activity  can get into a rut.
03:24 One Christian sister described it this way:
03:27 “I would go out in service,
03:30 “go to meetings, study, pray
03:33 “—but I did it all on automatic control,
03:36 never feeling anything.”
03:40 Have you ever felt that way?
03:42 Do you see  all the happy servants of Jehovah
03:45 whose experiences  appear on JW Broadcasting,
03:48 and you say to yourself:
03:50 ‘Why can’t I find that joy?
03:52 Why is my ministry in a rut?’
03:55 Perhaps you feel  like a remote-control train
03:58 that goes around and around on a track,
04:01 working the same territory,  with the same partner,
04:05 saying the same thing at each door.
04:07 Of course, there’s nothing wrong  with being in a good routine.
04:12 But being in a rut can sap our energy
04:16 and take the joy out of our service.
04:18 We could even come to view  our ministry as boring.
04:23 Of course, we feel invigorated  when we get good results:
04:27 We meet an interested person  when going from door to door
04:30 —we’re invigorated!
04:32 An inactive person approaches the cart
04:34 and wants to get in touch  with the local congregation
04:37 —we’re even more invigorated!
04:39 We start a Bible study  —we’re on top of the world!
04:42 I’m sure you’ll agree,
04:44 all those outcomes  are good reasons for joy.
04:48 The problem is  that we’re not always in control
04:51 of getting those outcomes.
04:54 In real life,  we may spend an entire morning
04:57 in the door-to-door work  without meeting an interested person.
05:00 We may spend months
05:02 making return visits  without starting a study.
05:06 And once again,  our ministry can get into a rut.
05:10 Now, don’t misunderstand.
05:12 It’s not that we’re doing anything wrong,
05:15 but we’re not getting  the full joy out of doing what’s right.
05:20 Of course, Satan would love it
05:22 if our service to Jehovah  were to fall into a rut.
05:25 He would love it if we lost our joy.
05:28 If we lose our joy, we lose hope,
05:32 we lose strength,
05:34 and we might even begin  to feel like giving up.
05:38 The point is this, brothers and sisters:
05:41 If you feel that your ministry  has fallen into a rut,
05:45 don’t be discouraged and don’t give up.
05:48 There are ways  that we can invigorate our ministry
05:51 and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.
05:54 To illustrate that:
05:56 Maybe you’ve had
05:57 the frustrating experience  of locking yourself
06:00 out of your house or apartment.
06:04 Of course, with a key,  opening the door is simple.
06:07 A locked door  might seem like an obstacle,
06:10 but it isn’t if you have the key.
06:14 And the same is true  with invigorating our ministry.
06:17 If we’ve fallen into a rut
06:19 and if we’ve lost  that feeling of joy in our service,
06:23 there are a number of keys  that can help us unlock the door.
06:28 Let’s look at one.
06:30 Open your Bible  to 1 Corinthians 16:8, 9.
06:36 Now, in these verses,
06:38 the apostle Paul was presented  with a key of opportunity,
06:42 and he used it to open a door.
06:45 First Corinthians 16:8, 9 says:
06:49 “But I am remaining in Ephesus
06:52 “until the Festival of Pentecost,
06:55 “because a large door that leads to activity
06:58 has been opened to me.”
07:01 Here, the apostle Paul found a key,
07:04 and it didn’t require  moving to another location.
07:07 In this case,  the key was to stay where he was
07:11 and to take full advantage  of an opportunity right before him.
07:17 Sometimes, the key  to getting out of a rut in our ministry
07:21 is to take advantage of opportunities  we have right where we are.
07:26 For example,  have you considered auxiliary pioneering
07:30 or regular pioneering?
07:32 What about learning a foreign language
07:34 with the goal of helping  a nearby group or congregation?
07:39 Opening one door often leads  to other doors of opportunity.
07:44 For example,  a brother named Jacob wrote this:
07:48 “When I was seven,  many of my classmates were Vietnamese.
07:53 “I wanted to tell them about Jehovah,
07:55 “so after a while  I made plans to learn their language.
07:59 “For the most part,
08:01 “I learned by comparing  the English and Vietnamese editions
08:04 “of The Watchtower.
08:06 “I also made friends in a nearby  Vietnamese-language congregation.
08:10 “When I was 18, I started pioneering.
08:14 “Later, I attended  the Bible School for Single Brothers.
08:17 “This helped me  with my present pioneer assignment,
08:20 “where I am the only elder  in a Vietnamese-language group.
08:25 “Many Vietnamese people are amazed  that I have learned their language.
08:29 “They invite me in,  and often I can study the Bible with them.
08:34 Some have progressed to baptism.”
08:37 The point is,  our ministry is what we make it.
08:42 If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut,
08:45 it will be boring.
08:47 If we use our keys  and if we take advantage
08:50 of opportunities that present themselves,
08:52 we will invigorate our ministry  and give it new meaning.
08:57 This doesn’t always involve  putting in more time in the ministry.
09:01 It could mean that we  simply ‘make the best use of our time’
09:05 as Ephesians 5:16 says.
09:09 In fact, there’s a saying:
09:11 “Don’t work harder; work smarter.”
09:15 The key to working smarter
09:17 could be as simple  as switching things up a bit.
09:20 For example:
09:22 Could we work with different publishers  instead of the same one all the time?
09:26 Could we try a different approach  to our presentation,
09:29 perhaps making better use  of the Bible or our videos?
09:34 Could we engage  in other aspects of the ministry,
09:37 such as cart witnessing  or phone witnessing?
09:41 Could we use our time  more effectively to reach people
09:44 when they’re most likely to be home?
09:47 Here’s something else  we could do to unlock a door
09:50 and invigorate our ministry.
09:52 Open your Bible to Acts 16:9, 10.
10:00 Now, here the apostle Paul found
10:02 a unique way to unlock  a door to greater joy.
10:06 Acts 16:9, 10 says:
10:09 “And during the night  a vision appeared to Paul
10:13 “—a Macedonian man  was standing there urging him and saying:
10:17 “‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’
10:21 “As soon as he had seen the vision,
10:24 “we tried to go into Macedonia,
10:26 “drawing the conclusion  that God had summoned us
10:29 to declare the good news to them.”
10:33 Notice, Paul didn’t think of all the reasons
10:37 he couldn’t step into Macedonia.
10:39 No, he took action
10:41 as soon as he was presented  with the opportunity.
10:44 Paul unlocked the door  to invigorate his ministry.
10:49 Sometimes we think  that only those who are young
10:53 can reach out to pioneer  or to serve where the need is greater.
10:57 But that’s not always the case.
11:01 You parents may be able to unlock  a door of opportunity for yourselves,
11:06 and think of the example  you set for your children when you do so.
11:11 That’s what a mother named Tara discovered:
11:16 “I started pioneering  when my youngest daughter
11:19 was in elementary school,” she says.
11:22 “It was important to me
11:24 “that my children see me serving Jehovah
11:27 to the best of my ability  as I encouraged them to reach out.”
11:33 Tara’s husband, Anthony,
11:35 saw the effect  that his wife’s pioneering had
11:38 and, in time,  he too joined the ranks.
11:41 This is what he said:
11:43 “When Tara became a pioneer,
11:45 “it made an immediate impact
11:47 “on daughters number one and number two,
11:50 “and they became pioneers.
11:53 “When I became a pioneer,
11:55 “daughters number three  and number four followed.
11:57 “I wish I had pursued  full-time service sooner,
12:01 as it made a huge impact  on the spirituality of the family.”
12:07 I can relate to this experience
12:09 because of the good example of my parents.
12:13 My mother was baptized in Canada
12:16 in 1940 when she was 16.
12:19 Jehovah’s Witnesses  had just been banned in Canada.
12:23 Her father had already died,
12:25 and her mother was opposed at that time.
12:28 The brothers had very little money,
12:31 but they encouraged  my mother to pursue spiritual goals.
12:35 With that encouragement,
12:37 she started pioneering in 1942
12:39 while the ban was still on in Canada.
12:43 In 1947, she was invited  to become a special pioneer
12:47 in the province of Quebec.
12:50 At that time,  special pioneers were required
12:53 to spend 200 hours  each month in the ministry.
12:57 With basically no money  and no family support,
13:01 she accepted that assignment.
13:03 This picture was taken  when she and her pioneer partner
13:07 were boarding the train to Quebec.
13:10 Whenever I see this picture,
13:12 it reminds me  of the intrepid spirit that my mother had
13:16 —not being afraid  to take on a challenging assignment,
13:20 but putting complete trust in Jehovah.
13:24 That spirit encourages me even to this day.
13:28 My father has that same spirit.
13:31 In the summer of 1976,  when I was 11 years old,
13:35 a new arrangement was announced  at our district convention
13:39 —auxiliary pioneering.
13:41 You could be an auxiliary pioneer
13:44 if you could devote 60 hours  in one month to the ministry.
13:48 The month of October 1976  had five weekends.
13:52 My father encouraged  our whole congregation
13:56 to try auxiliary pioneering that month.
13:58 So many brothers and sisters, including me,
14:02 decided to get a taste of pioneering.
14:05 It was a wonderful experience
14:07 that I will never forget.
14:10 Parents, your good example  will help your children
14:14 to have a living ministry  of their own that they will love.
14:19 Brothers and sisters,  if you find yourself in a rut,
14:23 there is no reason to stay there.
14:26 We’ve discussed several ways  to reinvigorate our ministry,
14:30 and with Jehovah’s help  we will be successful.

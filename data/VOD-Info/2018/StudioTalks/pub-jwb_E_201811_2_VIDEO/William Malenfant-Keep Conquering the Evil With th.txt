00:00:01 ‎And that is also the theme  ‎for this month’s program:
00:00:05 ‎“Keep Conquering the Evil With the Good.”
00:00:09 ‎This challenging exhortation
00:00:12 ‎was written by the apostle Paul  ‎at Romans 12:21.
00:00:16 ‎It’s challenging  ‎because we live in a world
00:00:19 ‎that is alienated  ‎from God and the truth,
00:00:22 ‎a world that tries  ‎to squeeze everyone into its mold.
00:00:28 ‎Isaiah 5:20 shows how the world
00:00:30 ‎has changed God-given standards.
00:00:34 ‎It reads:
00:00:36 ‎“Woe to those who say  ‎that good is bad
00:00:40 ‎“and bad is good,
00:00:42 ‎“those who substitute darkness for light
00:00:46 ‎“and light for darkness,
00:00:48 ‎“those who put bitter for sweet
00:00:51 ‎and sweet for bitter!”
00:00:53 ‎By adhering to the standard
00:00:55 ‎“of healthful words” in the Scriptures
00:00:58 ‎and to the examples  ‎of faithful servants of the past,
00:01:02 ‎we can ‘conquer the evil with the good.’
00:01:06 ‎The faithful man Enoch was born
00:01:09 ‎when Adam  ‎was about 600 years old,
00:01:12 ‎which means  ‎that Enoch and Adam
00:01:14 ‎were contemporaries ‎for about 300 years.
00:01:18 ‎However, there is no record
00:01:20 ‎of any contact between them ‎during that period of time.
00:01:25 ‎The Scriptures indicate  ‎that violence and hate for God
00:01:29 ‎were widespread  ‎in that pre-Flood world.
00:01:32 ‎Many centuries later,
00:01:35 ‎the disciple Jude described ‎the fear-inspiring prophecy
00:01:39 ‎that God gave to Enoch
00:01:41 ‎about Jehovah coming ‎with his holy myriads,
00:01:44 ‎legions of mighty angels in battle array,
00:01:47 ‎to bring destruction to all the ungodly.
00:01:51 ‎Enoch fearlessly went about declaring
00:01:54 ‎the coming judgment and destruction and,
00:01:58 ‎what is more, he did it alone!
00:02:01 ‎The prophecy was fulfilled ‎in the global Deluge,
00:02:06 ‎and it set the pattern
00:02:08 ‎of a greater destruction yet to come.
00:02:12 ‎No wonder that Genesis 5:24 tells us
00:02:16 ‎that “Enoch kept walking ‎with the true God.”
00:02:20 ‎Enoch’s example gives us courage
00:02:23 ‎to remain firm for true worship
00:02:25 ‎even if family and friends ‎stand apart from us.
00:02:30 ‎Enoch did not try to fit in ‎with the evil crowd
00:02:34 ‎of the pre-Flood world,
00:02:36 ‎and we don’t want to fit in
00:02:38 ‎with the present dying world ‎and its evil ways.
00:02:42 ‎We may feel alone at times,
00:02:44 ‎but we are reminded  ‎that Jehovah never abandoned Enoch,
00:02:49 ‎and neither will He abandon ‎His faithful servants today.
00:02:54 ‎We imitate Enoch
00:02:56 ‎by not allowing  ‎the evil surrounding us
00:03:00 ‎to undermine our faith in Jehovah.
00:03:03 ‎Like Enoch, we can  ‎‘conquer the evil with the good’
00:03:08 ‎by avoiding bad associations,
00:03:11 ‎sticking close to Jehovah God
00:03:13 ‎and the earthly part of his organization,
00:03:16 ‎and boldly proclaiming the good news.
00:03:21 ‎Elisha the prophet
00:03:23 ‎refused to engage in ‘paying evil for evil,’
00:03:27 ‎even when it seemed justified.
00:03:29 ‎The account is found
00:03:31 ‎at 2 Kings 6:14-23.
00:03:37 ‎Syria was at war with Israel.
00:03:40 ‎The king of Syria was enraged
00:03:43 ‎because Elisha  ‎was able to foresee wherever it was
00:03:47 ‎that Syria was planning  ‎to ambush the Israelites.
00:03:51 ‎Elisha would warn  ‎the king of Israel, and he, in turn,
00:03:55 ‎would keep his troops away ‎from the place of ambush.
00:03:59 ‎The king of Syria became exasperated
00:04:03 ‎and wanted desperately  ‎to take the prophet Elisha captive
00:04:07 ‎to stop him  ‎from warning the king of Israel.
00:04:11 ‎It came about  ‎that the king of Syria learned
00:04:15 ‎that Elisha was in the city of Dothan,
00:04:18 ‎so the king sent horses,
00:04:20 ‎war chariots, as well as a large army
00:04:23 ‎to surround Dothan by night
00:04:25 ‎in order to take Elisha captive.
00:04:29 ‎The following morning,
00:04:31 ‎Jehovah listened to Elisha
00:04:33 ‎and did something amazing.
00:04:36 ‎He struck the Syrian troops
00:04:38 ‎with a temporary form of blindness,
00:04:41 ‎and Elisha guided all those troops,
00:04:44 ‎not back to Syria, but to Samaria,
00:04:47 ‎where the king of Israel resided.
00:04:51 ‎The king of Israel was anxious
00:04:53 ‎to strike down and kill the Syrian troops,
00:04:56 ‎but Elisha said to him,
00:04:58 ‎as recorded in verses 22 and 23
00:05:01 ‎of 2 Kings chapter 6:
00:05:04 ‎“‘You must not strike them down.
00:05:07 ‎“‘Do you strike down  ‎those whom you have taken captive
00:05:11 ‎“‘with your sword and with your bow?
00:05:13 ‎“‘Give them bread and water  ‎so they may eat and drink
00:05:17 ‎“and return to their lord.’
00:05:19 ‎“So he spread a great feast for them,
00:05:22 ‎“and they ate and drank,
00:05:25 ‎after which he sent them away ‎to return to their lord.”
00:05:29 ‎What a shock this must have been ‎to the Syrian soldiers,
00:05:33 ‎who likely thought  ‎that they were as good as dead!
00:05:37 ‎This astounding turn of events
00:05:39 ‎was far better than ‘paying evil for evil.’
00:05:43 ‎How do we know it was better?
00:05:46 ‎The latter part of verse 23 says:
00:05:49 ‎“And not once did the marauder bands
00:05:53 ‎of the Syrians come again ‎into the land of Israel.”
00:05:57 ‎Can you imagine  ‎the men of the Syrian army
00:06:00 ‎relating to their king  ‎what had taken place?
00:06:03 ‎They went out to take Elisha captive.
00:06:06 ‎However, Elisha,  ‎with the help of Jehovah’s spirit,
00:06:10 ‎had taken  ‎the Syrians captive without a battle.
00:06:14 ‎The Syrian king  ‎must have been dumbfounded
00:06:17 ‎when he heard the report.
00:06:19 ‎And you can be sure ‎that the soldiers
00:06:21 ‎of the Syrian army  ‎were not only grateful
00:06:24 ‎but they acquired  ‎a very respectful fear of Jehovah
00:06:28 ‎and of his prophet Elisha.
00:06:31 ‎The good done to the Syrians
00:06:34 ‎would not be soon forgotten.
00:06:37 ‎Like Elisha,
00:06:39 ‎we want to do  ‎what is good for people,
00:06:42 ‎including those  ‎who do not view us favorably.
00:06:45 ‎When tragedies such as fires, floods,
00:06:48 ‎earthquakes, and hurricanes strike,
00:06:51 ‎we go out of our way
00:06:53 ‎to comfort people with the Scriptures.
00:06:56 ‎Also, Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:06:58 ‎serving as relief workers are well-known
00:07:00 ‎for the practical assistance they render
00:07:03 ‎to fellow believers and to others.
00:07:06 ‎As a result, many people  ‎have changed their view of us
00:07:10 ‎and have come to appreciate ‎that in these last days,
00:07:14 ‎Jehovah does indeed have ‎“a people for his name” on the earth.
00:07:20 ‎At 2 Timothy 2:23-25,
00:07:25 ‎the apostle Paul encourages us
00:07:27 ‎to display qualities  ‎that make us different from the world.
00:07:31 ‎He says:
00:07:33 ‎“Further, reject foolish ‎and ignorant debates,
00:07:38 ‎“knowing that they produce fights.
00:07:40 ‎“For a slave of the Lord ‎does not need to fight,
00:07:44 ‎“but needs to be gentle toward all,
00:07:47 ‎“qualified to teach,  ‎showing restraint when wronged,
00:07:52 ‎instructing with mildness  ‎those not favorably disposed.”
00:07:57 ‎And then Paul explains the desired result:
00:08:00 ‎“Perhaps God may give them repentance
00:08:04 ‎leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.”
00:08:08 ‎Paul was “gentle toward all”
00:08:10 ‎and “qualified to teach.”
00:08:13 ‎He ‘showed restraint’ ‎when he was imprisoned
00:08:15 ‎by the Roman authorities ‎around 60 or 61 C.E.
00:08:20 ‎He spent about two years  ‎under house arrest in Rome,
00:08:24 ‎perhaps even being chained to a guard.
00:08:27 ‎He had done nothing  ‎to merit imprisonment.
00:08:31 ‎However, he did not dwell ‎on the evil done to him,
00:08:35 ‎and he did not allow it ‎to make him bitter
00:08:38 ‎and resentful of Roman authorities.
00:08:42 ‎Rather, at Philippians 1:12-14,
00:08:47 ‎Paul wrote:
00:08:49 ‎“Now I want you to know, brothers,
00:08:52 ‎“that my situation has actually turned out
00:08:56 ‎“for the advancement of the good news,
00:08:58 ‎“so that my prison bonds ‎for the sake of Christ
00:09:01 ‎“have become public knowledge
00:09:03 ‎“among all the Praetorian Guard ‎and all the rest.
00:09:06 ‎“Now most of the brothers in the Lord ‎have gained confidence
00:09:10 ‎“because of my prison bonds,
00:09:12 ‎“and they are showing all the more courage
00:09:14 ‎to speak the word of God fearlessly.”
00:09:17 ‎In his letter to Titus
00:09:20 ‎in chapter 3, verses 1 and 2,
00:09:23 ‎Paul gives reminders  ‎on how Christians today
00:09:26 ‎can ‘conquer the evil with the good’
00:09:28 ‎by showing proper respect
00:09:30 ‎for governmental authorities ‎wherever we may live.
00:09:34 ‎He writes:
00:09:36 ‎“Continue reminding them  ‎[fellow Christians]
00:09:41 ‎“to be in subjection and to be obedient
00:09:44 ‎“to governments and authorities,
00:09:46 ‎“to be ready for every good work,
00:09:50 ‎“to speak injuriously of no one,
00:09:53 ‎“not to be quarrelsome,
00:09:56 ‎“but to be reasonable,
00:09:58 ‎displaying all mildness toward all men.”
00:10:03 ‎Paul followed his own advice.
00:10:06 ‎While in custody in Rome,
00:10:08 ‎Paul wrote inspired letters
00:10:10 ‎to Christian congregations ‎in Greece and Asia Minor,
00:10:14 ‎and we today benefit  ‎from the counsel in those letters.
00:10:18 ‎Never do we read in his letters
00:10:21 ‎criticism aimed at human rulers
00:10:24 ‎or encouragement for Christians
00:10:26 ‎to favor one political figure ‎or party over another.
00:10:30 ‎He was “no part of the world,”
00:10:33 ‎and he knew that man’s only hope
00:10:36 ‎was the Kingdom of God.
00:10:40 ‎Paul was a spiritual man,
00:10:43 ‎and he ‘conquered the evil with the good’
00:10:46 ‎by following  ‎Jesus’ instructions at Mark 12:17
00:10:50 ‎of giving “Caesar’s things to Caesar,
00:10:53 ‎but God’s things to God,”
00:10:56 ‎all the while displaying  ‎“a mildness that belongs to wisdom.”
00:11:03 ‎At 1 Peter 2:21,
00:11:06 ‎we receive further direction
00:11:08 ‎about the course that we are to follow.
00:11:11 ‎Peter writes:
00:11:13 ‎“In fact, ‎to this course you were called,
00:11:17 ‎“because even Christ suffered for you,
00:11:20 ‎leaving a model for you  ‎to follow his steps closely.”
00:11:25 ‎Some of Christ’s steps ‎are enumerated
00:11:28 ‎in verses 22 and 23, ‎where it reads:
00:11:31 ‎“He [Jesus] committed no sin,
00:11:35 ‎“nor was deception found in his mouth.
00:11:38 ‎“When he was being insulted,
00:11:41 ‎“he did not insult in return.
00:11:43 ‎“When he was suffering, ‎he did not threaten,
00:11:47 ‎“but he entrusted himself
00:11:49 ‎to the One who judges righteously.”
00:11:53 ‎Jehovah is  ‎“the One who judges righteously.”
00:11:57 ‎However, the Jewish religious leaders
00:12:00 ‎did not judge the Christ righteously.
00:12:03 ‎They insulted Jesus frequently
00:12:05 ‎and even accused him of having a demon.
00:12:09 ‎Jesus did not stoop
00:12:11 ‎to “return evil for evil,”
00:12:13 ‎hurling insults or threatening people.
00:12:17 ‎Insults and threats  ‎do not open hearts
00:12:22 ‎to accept the good news.
00:12:24 ‎When Jesus was on trial,
00:12:27 ‎the Jewish religious leaders ‎spurred the crowd on
00:12:30 ‎to cry out for his execution.
00:12:32 ‎The Roman authorities  ‎had Jesus nailed to a torture stake
00:12:36 ‎to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.
00:12:40 ‎While suffering on the torture stake,
00:12:43 ‎what did Jesus speak about?
00:12:46 ‎Did he curse the Roman soldiers
00:12:48 ‎who had mistreated him  ‎and were now executing him?
00:12:51 ‎To the contrary,
00:12:53 ‎he ‘conquered the evil with the good.’
00:12:57 ‎Among Jesus’ last words
00:13:00 ‎are those recorded at Luke 23:34:
00:13:03 ‎“Father, forgive them,
00:13:06 ‎for they do not know  ‎what they are doing.”
00:13:10 ‎Jesus knew  ‎that the Roman soldiers
00:13:13 ‎were ignorant ‎of who he really was
00:13:15 ‎and did not know  ‎what they were doing.
00:13:18 ‎He could forgive them with the hope
00:13:20 ‎that they would eventually respond
00:13:22 ‎to the truth and become his disciples.
00:13:26 ‎In every respect,
00:13:28 ‎Jesus ‘conquered the evil with the good,’
00:13:31 ‎and he always displayed ‎complete confidence
00:13:35 ‎in “the One who judges righteously,”
00:13:38 ‎Jehovah God.
00:13:40 ‎We want to demonstrate the same kind
00:13:43 ‎of confidence in Jehovah and in his Word
00:13:46 ‎that Jesus displayed.
00:13:49 ‎We do our best to imitate the Christ
00:13:52 ‎by applying the spirit-inspired counsel
00:13:54 ‎at Romans 12:17, 18:
00:13:59 ‎“Return evil for evil to no one.
00:14:04 ‎“Take into consideration
00:14:06 ‎“what is fine  ‎from the viewpoint of all men.
00:14:09 ‎“If possible, as far as it depends on you,
00:14:13 ‎be peaceable with all men.”
00:14:17 ‎Heeding this counsel  ‎is particularly important
00:14:20 ‎in homes that are religiously divided.
00:14:23 ‎The Christian mate resists the temptation
00:14:27 ‎to repay an unkind word or act
00:14:29 ‎with another unkindness.
00:14:32 ‎Really, no good comes  ‎from ‘returning evil for evil.’
00:14:36 ‎On the contrary, such an attitude
00:14:39 ‎can only aggravate the situation.
00:14:42 ‎In the domestic setting,
00:14:44 ‎a wife who shows genuine kindness ‎to her husband
00:14:48 ‎after he makes unpleasant comments ‎about her beliefs
00:14:52 ‎may well diffuse ‎a potentially explosive situation.
00:14:58 ‎At Proverbs 31:12,  ‎we are told how a capable, God-fearing wife
00:15:03 ‎deals with her husband:
00:15:05 ‎“She rewards him with good,
00:15:08 ‎not bad, all the days of her life.”
00:15:12 ‎Additionally, by taking “into consideration
00:15:15 ‎what is fine from the viewpoint of all men,”
00:15:18 ‎Jehovah’s people  ‎have often overcome prejudice
00:15:21 ‎by providing practical assistance
00:15:24 ‎to their neighbors as opportunity affords,
00:15:26 ‎and particularly when a disaster strikes.
00:15:30 ‎We conscientiously adhere
00:15:33 ‎to Romans 12:19, which states:
00:15:37 ‎“Do not avenge yourselves, beloved,
00:15:40 ‎“but yield place to the wrath; ‎for it is written:
00:15:45 ‎“‘“Vengeance is mine;
00:15:47 ‎I will repay,” says Jehovah.’”
00:15:50 ‎The footnote on verse 19 shows
00:15:54 ‎that Paul is telling us  ‎to yield to “God’s wrath,” or anger.
00:15:58 ‎Jehovah is the one  ‎who will set matters straight,
00:16:02 ‎and he will do it  ‎much better than we ever could.
00:16:06 ‎As James 1:20 states:
00:16:09 ‎“Man’s anger  ‎does not bring about God’s righteousness.”
00:16:15 ‎The theme of this discussion
00:16:17 ‎is summarized exquisitely
00:16:19 ‎at Romans 12:20, 21
00:16:23 ‎with this direction  ‎to all of Jehovah’s people:
00:16:27 ‎“But ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him;
00:16:32 ‎“‘if he is thirsty,  ‎give him something to drink;
00:16:36 ‎“for by doing this  ‎you will heap fiery coals on his head.’
00:16:41 ‎“Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,
00:16:46 ‎but keep conquering the evil with the good.”

00:00:01 ‎In addition to being clear and accurate,
00:00:04 ‎what should be the primary goal  of any Bible translation?
00:00:09 ‎The answer is found
00:00:11 ‎in the theme of our program this month:
00:00:13 ‎“Father, Glorify Your Name.”
00:00:17 ‎It’s based on Jesus’ words
00:00:19 ‎recorded at John 12:28.
00:00:22 ‎Let’s start by examining  the context of those words
00:00:26 ‎as found in verses 27 and 28:
00:00:30 ‎“‘Now I am troubled,  and what should I say?
00:00:35 ‎“‘Father, save me out of this hour.
00:00:38 ‎“‘Nevertheless, this is why  I have come to this hour.
00:00:43 ‎“Father, glorify your name.’
00:00:46 ‎“Then a voice came out of heaven:
00:00:48 ‎‘I have glorified it and will glorify it again.’”
00:00:53 ‎Jesus uttered these words
00:00:55 ‎just four days before his agonizing death.
00:00:59 ‎But even though Jesus was very troubled
00:01:02 ‎about what was soon to happen to him,
00:01:04 ‎what was his primary concern?
00:01:08 ‎It was for Jehovah’s name to be glorified.
00:01:12 ‎We today are likewise concerned
00:01:15 ‎about the glorification of Jehovah’s name and his reputation.
00:01:20 ‎But how can someone  be glorified, or made famous,
00:01:24 ‎if nobody knows his name?
00:01:26 ‎Knowing God’s personal name, Jehovah,
00:01:30 ‎is closely tied in with glorifying his reputation.
00:01:34 ‎In fact, knowing Jehovah’s name
00:01:36 ‎is the very first step in that process.
00:01:41 ‎The June 2015 program of JW Broadcasting
00:01:45 ‎discussed why God’s personal name
00:01:47 ‎should appear in all translations of the Bible.
00:01:51 ‎You might find it helpful to review that program.
00:01:54 ‎But this month, we will consider another aspect of this subject
00:01:59 ‎that is far more controversial, namely,
00:02:03 ‎Should the divine name appear  in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:02:08 ‎or what is commonly called  the New Testament?
00:02:13 ‎Many scholars who agree with us
00:02:15 ‎that the divine name should appear  in the Hebrew Scriptures
00:02:19 ‎disagree with our use of the same name
00:02:22 ‎in the New Testament.
00:02:24 ‎So, what prompted the translators  of the New World Translation
00:02:28 ‎to restore the divine name 237 times
00:02:32 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:02:34 ‎The answer to that question  involves some fascinating events
00:02:39 ‎that seem to be too amazing  to be just coincidence.
00:02:44 ‎It also requires us to do some detective work.
00:02:48 ‎Sound intriguing?
00:02:49 ‎It is!
00:02:51 ‎So let’s start our journey together.
00:02:54 ‎First of all, imagine that you are back in the late 1940’s
00:02:59 ‎—the time when the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:03:02 ‎was translating the book of Matthew.
00:03:05 ‎As they started the project,
00:03:07 ‎no doubt they realized  that Matthew’s account contains
00:03:11 ‎many quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures.
00:03:14 ‎Many of these contain the Tetragrammaton,
00:03:17 ‎that is, the divine name  in Hebrew letters in the original text.
00:03:22 ‎For example, let’s consider Matthew 22:44.
00:03:29 ‎This verse records Jesus quoting the words of Psalm 110:1:
00:03:35 ‎“Jehovah said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand.’”
00:03:40 ‎But did Jesus use the divine name when making this quote?
00:03:45 ‎Or did he substitute the divine name
00:03:48 ‎with an equivalent such as “Lord”?
00:03:51 ‎Well, the brothers would have realized
00:03:53 ‎that many editions of the King James Version
00:03:55 ‎did something very interesting at Matthew 22:44.
00:04:00 ‎In that verse, the English word “LORD”
00:04:03 ‎is written in capital letters.
00:04:05 ‎This technique is used  throughout the King James Version
00:04:09 ‎to indicate where  the original Hebrew text uses the divine name.
00:04:14 ‎So using “LORD” in capital letters in this verse,
00:04:17 ‎in effect,  acknowledges that the name of God
00:04:21 ‎was originally in this quote.
00:04:23 ‎The implication is
00:04:25 ‎that Jesus used God’s name  when making this quote.
00:04:29 ‎However, in the years prior  to the release of the New World Translation,
00:04:34 ‎many scholars argued  that long before Jesus came to earth,
00:04:39 ‎the Jewish people had already removed the Tetragrammaton
00:04:42 ‎from the Greek translation of the Hebrew text —the Septuagint.
00:04:47 ‎If true, that would mean
00:04:49 ‎that copies of the Holy Writings  used in Jesus’ day
00:04:53 ‎would not have contained  the divine name.
00:04:56 ‎So, what should the Translation Committee do?
00:05:00 ‎Should they use the divine name in their translation or not?
00:05:04 ‎This is where the story becomes intriguing.
00:05:09 ‎Around that time, some exciting discoveries
00:05:12 ‎were made that proved those scholars wrong.
00:05:16 ‎One of these discoveries was documented by the brothers
00:05:19 ‎in the foreword of the 1950 edition
00:05:22 ‎of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:05:26 ‎It involved  some papyri copies of the Septuagint
00:05:30 ‎that dated  back to around the time of Jesus.
00:05:33 ‎What did these papyri fragments reveal?
00:05:37 ‎Let’s find out in this documentary report.
00:05:43 ‎In 1950,
00:05:46 ‎the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.
00:05:49 ‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing
00:05:53 ‎“the New World Translation
00:05:55 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!”
00:06:00 ‎This translation was unique
00:06:03 ‎in that it restored  the divine name, Jehovah,
00:06:06 ‎237 times in the main text
00:06:09 ‎of the so-called New Testament.
00:06:12 ‎But how could they do that,  considering that for centuries
00:06:15 ‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name?
00:06:19 ‎And why did the divine name  need to be restored?
00:06:24 ‎The oldest copies we have available
00:06:26 ‎do not use the divine name
00:06:28 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;
00:06:30 ‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.
00:06:34 ‎Very early on,
00:06:35 ‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,
00:06:38 ‎they simply replaced
00:06:40 ‎—they got into the practice of replacing— God’s name.
00:06:44 ‎We know that this is not a translation
00:06:48 ‎because one is a name  and the other one is a title.
00:06:50 ‎And it’s not even   a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.
00:06:54 ‎Since the Greek Scriptures
00:06:56 ‎were an inspired addition
00:06:58 ‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and,
00:06:59 ‎in fact,
00:07:00 ‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,
00:07:02 ‎was used some 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures,
00:07:06 ‎the sudden disappearance in the Greek text is inconsistent.
00:07:10 ‎Even though  the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:07:14 ‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear
00:07:16 ‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:07:18 ‎they also knew that at that time
00:07:21 ‎virtually all Bible scholars  disagreed with that belief.
00:07:24 ‎Those scholars argued  that by the time of Jesus,
00:07:28 ‎even the Greek translation  of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint,
00:07:32 ‎no longer contained the divine name.
00:07:35 ‎So why would the writers  of the New Testament
00:07:37 ‎use the divine name when their copies  of the Holy Scriptures in Greek
00:07:41 ‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton?
00:07:44 ‎This view was based on faulty information.
00:07:47 ‎How so?
00:07:48 ‎Did the Septuagint still use
00:07:50 ‎the divine name in Jesus’ time?
00:07:53 ‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence
00:07:55 ‎that answers this question.
00:07:57 ‎Something amazing happened in 1944.
00:08:00 ‎A theological journal published a picture
00:08:02 ‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment
00:08:05 ‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection.
00:08:08 ‎Now, inside that fragment  there was the divine name.
00:08:12 ‎In the Greek text,  you had the Tetragrammaton,
00:08:15 ‎not just once but throughout.
00:08:17 ‎Now, this fragment was very old,  dating back to the first century B.C.E.,
00:08:21 ‎but the important point is  that this was proof, clear proof,
00:08:25 ‎that the divine name was originally there.
00:08:29 ‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked
00:08:32 ‎to obtain photographs of these fragments,
00:08:34 ‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.
00:08:38 ‎The New World Translation Committee  was very interested in this
00:08:41 ‎because they started translating
00:08:44 ‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.
00:08:48 ‎After obtaining permission,  pictures of 12 of the fragments
00:08:52 ‎were published in the foreword  of the New World Translation
00:08:54 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:09:00 ‎What amazes me about this is the timing.
00:09:04 ‎When our brothers —this New World Translation Committee—
00:09:08 ‎did their research, before even translating,
00:09:11 ‎suddenly something that was unknown
00:09:13 ‎until essentially 1944
00:09:17 ‎came to light that confirmed
00:09:19 ‎that the eternal name of God
00:09:23 ‎had to be revealed; it could no longer be hidden.
00:09:27 ‎It should be shown to everyone  who wants to worship Jehovah.
00:09:30 ‎This careful preservation  supports what Jesus said in prayer
00:09:35 ‎at John 17:26,  when he said to his Father:
00:09:38 ‎“I have made your name known . . .  and will make it known.”
00:09:42 ‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses,  we are proud to be “a people for his name.”
00:09:47 ‎Knowing his name  is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,
00:09:52 ‎and the fact that Jehovah  has provided this arrangement
00:09:55 ‎through his people
00:09:57 ‎makes it very clear
00:10:00 ‎that he was gathering  “a people for his name.”
00:10:03 ‎This is why  this Bible translation is so beautiful,
00:10:07 ‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah.
00:10:09 ‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere, which could apply to anyone,
00:10:13 ‎but he is Jehovah, our God.
00:10:17 ‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,
00:10:19 ‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’
00:10:25 ‎What an amazing find!
00:10:28 ‎They found proof that the divine name in Hebrew letters
00:10:32 ‎was included in the text of the Septuagint
00:10:35 ‎that would have been available in Jesus’ day
00:10:38 ‎and just at the right time
00:10:40 ‎—the time when the members of the Translation Committee
00:10:43 ‎were making the decision as to whether they should use
00:10:46 ‎the name Jehovah in their translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:10:51 ‎We are so happy that the brothers  were able to find this information
00:10:55 ‎because these fragments  were not released for general publication
00:11:00 ‎until much later in 1971
00:11:04 ‎—years after the time when the committee  needed to make that vital decision.
00:11:09 ‎But that’s not all!
00:11:11 ‎Do you remember  what other important material
00:11:13 ‎was discovered starting in 1947?
00:11:17 ‎It was the Dead Sea Scrolls.
00:11:20 ‎Many of these scrolls were dated to around the time when Jesus was on earth.
00:11:24 ‎And what did these scrolls contain over and over again?
00:11:29 ‎You guessed it
00:11:31 ‎—the Tetragrammaton— the divine name.
00:11:35 ‎Isn’t it interesting
00:11:37 ‎that these discoveries were made around the time
00:11:40 ‎when our brothers were translating the New World Translation?
00:11:44 ‎Is this just coincidence
00:11:46 ‎or do you see Jehovah’s hand in this?
00:11:50 ‎What has happened  in the years since that time?
00:11:53 ‎It’s important to note
00:11:55 ‎that the divine name is consistently used
00:11:58 ‎in fragments of the Septuagint
00:12:00 ‎that date from the first century B.C.E.
00:12:03 ‎and the first century C.E.
00:12:06 ‎This has led some scholars to acknowledge the possibility
00:12:10 ‎that Jesus and his disciples
00:12:12 ‎used the divine name when making these quotations.
00:12:16 ‎But we need to remember  that Hebrew Scripture quotations
00:12:20 ‎account for approximately one third
00:12:23 ‎of the 237 times
00:12:26 ‎the New World Translation restores the divine name
00:12:29 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:12:32 ‎So, what about the other  two thirds of occurrences?
00:12:35 ‎Well, this brings us  to the part of our program
00:12:39 ‎that involves some detective work.
00:12:43 ‎Imagine that you are a detective,
00:12:46 ‎and you catch an art thief
00:12:48 ‎who has stolen  over 200 original pieces of art
00:12:51 ‎from various museums and art galleries.
00:12:55 ‎This thief not only stole each piece of art
00:12:58 ‎but he also substituted it with a copy.
00:13:02 ‎So you need to start an investigation
00:13:05 ‎and follow the clues.
00:13:08 ‎First of all, you need to find out
00:13:10 ‎where each painting was located originally.
00:13:14 ‎Once you have verified  that fakes are hanging in those locations,
00:13:18 ‎you would be in a position  to return the originals
00:13:22 ‎to their proper locations.
00:13:25 ‎In a similar way,  we have solid evidence
00:13:28 ‎that a crime was committed  in the second and third centuries C.E.
00:13:33 ‎Apostate Christians removed the divine name
00:13:36 ‎from manuscripts of the Bible
00:13:38 ‎and replaced it with Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord.”
00:13:43 ‎There is much evidence for this conclusion.
00:13:46 ‎So they are like the art thief in our illustration.
00:13:49 ‎They stole something valuable
00:13:52 ‎when they removed Jehovah’s name from the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:13:57 ‎But we have a problem.
00:13:59 ‎There are no copies  of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:14:03 ‎from the first century for us to examine.
00:14:06 ‎The earliest existing manuscripts
00:14:08 ‎that would have a bearing on this matter
00:14:11 ‎date from the late second century onward
00:14:14 ‎—a time when we know that the crime  had already been committed
00:14:18 ‎and Jehovah’s name  had already been removed.
00:14:22 ‎So how do we know where Jehovah’s name
00:14:24 ‎originally appeared in the Greek text
00:14:27 ‎before the apostates removed it?
00:14:30 ‎Well, just like the detective in our illustration,
00:14:34 ‎we need to start an investigation
00:14:36 ‎and follow the clues.
00:14:39 ‎To do our work properly,
00:14:41 ‎we need to examine every time  the word “Lord” appears in the text
00:14:45 ‎and see if it refers to Jehovah, to Jesus,
00:14:49 ‎or to some other person with the title “Lord.”
00:14:53 ‎Basically,  there are five clues that will help us
00:14:56 ‎to find out where the original artwork,
00:14:59 ‎that is, Jehovah’s name,  needs to be returned to.
00:15:03 ‎Let’s scrutinize these clues.
00:15:07 ‎The first clue is,
00:15:09 ‎as we have already mentioned, the easiest clue,
00:15:12 ‎where the title “Lord” appears
00:15:14 ‎in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures
00:15:17 ‎that originally used the divine name.
00:15:20 ‎The second clue is
00:15:22 ‎where the Greek text contains a Hebrew idiom
00:15:25 ‎that would normally contain the divine name.
00:15:28 ‎For example,  if someone says in English,
00:15:32 ‎“He escaped by the skin of his . . . ,”
00:15:34 ‎what word do you expect?
00:15:36 ‎Teeth, not eye.
00:15:38 ‎Yes, the expression is “skin of his teeth.”
00:15:42 ‎This is similar with Hebrew expressions.
00:15:45 ‎Some of these contain the divine name.
00:15:48 ‎For example,  the expression found at Matthew 1:20
00:15:52 ‎is “the angel of Jehovah.”
00:15:56 ‎So whenever we find  a Greek translation of a Hebrew idiom
00:16:00 ‎that uses the divine name,
00:16:02 ‎this is another clue  that Jehovah’s name should be there.
00:16:07 ‎The third clue
00:16:09 ‎is where the term “Lord” appears
00:16:11 ‎in the context surrounding a quotation
00:16:14 ‎that is originally attributed to Jehovah.
00:16:17 ‎An example of this is Matthew 1:22:
00:16:22 ‎“All of this actually came about to fulfill
00:16:25 ‎what was spoken by Jehovah  through his prophet, saying . . .”
00:16:29 ‎The quotation  that immediately follows at Matthew 1:23
00:16:34 ‎is taken from Isaiah 7:14.
00:16:38 ‎This is a prophetic message
00:16:40 ‎spoken by Jehovah through Isaiah.
00:16:43 ‎The fourth clue
00:16:45 ‎is when we see in the Greek text
00:16:47 ‎where there is no definite article  before Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord,”
00:16:52 ‎in places where the Greek grammar normally expects a definite article.
00:16:57 ‎This clue may indicate  that a proper name, such as Jehovah,
00:17:02 ‎originally was there in the text
00:17:04 ‎and was removed from later manuscripts and replaced with Kyʹri·os.
00:17:09 ‎To illustrate the importance of this clue,
00:17:12 ‎imagine that you are a newspaper reporter
00:17:16 ‎who is reporting on a car accident.
00:17:18 ‎You report that Joe Smith, the driver of the vehicle,
00:17:22 ‎was killed in the accident.
00:17:24 ‎But just before the story goes to press,
00:17:27 ‎your editor informs you  that Joe Smith’s relatives
00:17:31 ‎have not yet been notified of his death.
00:17:34 ‎So you are told to remove his name from the report.
00:17:37 ‎You do that, but in doing so,
00:17:41 ‎you forget to add  the “the” before the word “driver.”
00:17:45 ‎What would happen?
00:17:47 ‎Your report would say,
00:17:49 ‎“As a result of the accident, driver was killed.”
00:17:53 ‎That sounds strange, doesn’t it?
00:17:55 ‎It sounds like “driver”  is the name of the person killed.
00:17:59 ‎That’s because you suppressed the name
00:18:02 ‎and forgot to add the appropriate article.
00:18:05 ‎That is similar  to what our symbolic art thieves did
00:18:09 ‎when removing  Jehovah’s name from the Bible.
00:18:13 ‎An example of this
00:18:15 ‎is found in the Greek text of Mark 13:20.
00:18:20 ‎“In fact, unless Lord had cut short the days,
00:18:25 ‎no flesh would be saved.”
00:18:28 ‎That sounds like “Lord” is a name,
00:18:30 ‎and clearly it should be Jehovah’s name.
00:18:34 ‎That’s why the New World Translation  restores the divine name in this verse.
00:18:40 ‎However,  even in cases where the definite article
00:18:44 ‎occurs before the word “Lord,”
00:18:46 ‎there may be other strong reasons
00:18:48 ‎for viewing “Lord”  as a substitute for the divine name,
00:18:52 ‎like the ones we already discussed.
00:18:55 ‎The final clue
00:18:58 ‎is where the divine name  needs to be added to avoid ambiguity.
00:19:03 ‎An example of this
00:19:05 ‎is in Mark 5:19.
00:19:08 ‎There, Jesus says to a man he healed:
00:19:12 ‎“Go home to your relatives,
00:19:15 ‎“and report to them all the things
00:19:17 ‎Jehovah has done for you  and the mercy he has shown you.”
00:19:22 ‎How do we know that “Lord”  here refers to Jehovah
00:19:26 ‎and not Jesus?
00:19:28 ‎Well, in recording the same event,
00:19:30 ‎Luke 8:39 uses the Greek word The·osʹ (God),
00:19:35 ‎supporting the thought  that Kyʹri·os (Lord) at Mark 5:19
00:19:40 ‎is used with reference to Jehovah God.
00:19:43 ‎So these five clues helped  the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:19:48 ‎to ascertain where the name Jehovah
00:19:50 ‎should be restored to the Biblical text.
00:19:54 ‎In this way, they were able to right the wrong
00:19:57 ‎that was committed by apostate Christians
00:19:59 ‎in the second and third centuries or,
00:20:02 ‎in other words, they were able to return
00:20:05 ‎the figurative pieces of stolen artwork
00:20:07 ‎to their proper places.
00:20:10 ‎If you would like to review these five clues,
00:20:13 ‎you will find a detailed explanation in Appendix C
00:20:17 ‎of the Study Edition of the New World Translation.
00:20:21 ‎You can either find this in the JW Library® app
00:20:24 ‎or online at Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY.
00:20:28 ‎In the same Appendix C,
00:20:31 ‎you will find a list  of what we call J-References
00:20:34 ‎that support these decisions.

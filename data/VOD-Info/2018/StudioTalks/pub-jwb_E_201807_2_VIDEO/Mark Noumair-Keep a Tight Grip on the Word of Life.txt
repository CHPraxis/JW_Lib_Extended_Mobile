00:00 How would you feel
00:02 if you received an invitation
00:04 to attend the next class of Gilead School?
00:07 For many, it has been  a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.
00:11 The course helps students  keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
00:15 For others, the idea of five months  of intense study seems intimidating.
00:20 We know we need to study,
00:22 but we may find  it a challenge to get the most
00:25 out of the time we spend  reading God’s Word.
00:28 In this program, we will discuss  why study is so important,
00:33 what it means to study something,
00:36 and how you can get more  from your study sessions.
00:40 Since most cannot attend Gilead,
00:43 we will demonstrate  the method used in Gilead School.
00:47 First, why is study so important?
00:52 Only by study can we  keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
00:57 When the apostle Paul penned these words,
01:00 he was imprisoned and nearing the end  of his action-packed life.
01:04 He had been the “apostle to the nations”
01:06 and had spent his best years
01:08 taking the Word of God  to the then-known world.
01:12 As he reflected on the fruits of his labors,
01:15 he wrote a letter to his friends  in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.
01:20 Inspired by holy spirit, he wrote words
01:23 that would aid his brothers  to gain the prize of eternal life.
01:27 These words are found  at Philippians 2:15, 16.
01:32 Let’s read them:
01:35 “So that you may come to be  blameless and innocent,
01:39 “children of God  without a blemish in the midst
01:43 “of a crooked and twisted generation,
01:45 “among whom you are shining  as illuminators in the world,
01:49 keeping a tight grip on the word of life.”
01:53 Imagine the joy Paul felt
01:56 when he was reunited  in the heavenly resurrection
01:59 with those who listened to his admonition
02:02 to keep “a tight grip on the word of life”!
02:06 Whether we have  the heavenly or earthly hope,
02:09 Paul’s words can help us gain  the prize of eternal life.
02:13 They imprint on our hearts and minds  a basic exhortation
02:17 that will lead us through these last days  and into our everlasting reward.
02:22 The question is, Will we remain  ‘blameless and without blemish
02:27 in the midst of this crooked  and twisted generation’ of our day?
02:32 Will we rejoice with other faithful servants  of God in the new world?
02:37 We can and we will
02:40 if we take to heart Paul’s counsel
02:42 to keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”
02:47 Next, what does it mean to study?
02:51 Stop and contemplate this word picture
02:54 for keeping a tight grip.
02:56 Imagine a hiker who has slipped near a ledge.
02:59 But before falling over the cliff,  he grabs hold of a tree branch.
03:04 How tight do you think  his grip will be on that branch?
03:08 This is not a halfhearted effort.
03:10 Likewise, keeping a tight grip  on the word of life
03:15 is not just a mechanical routine,  nor is it a casual habit.
03:20 It requires strenuous effort.
03:22 It involves actively living  by the truths in God’s Word.
03:27 To do this, we must understand
03:30 more than what God  expressly commands and condemns.
03:34 We must be able to identify principles,
03:37 or life lessons, contained in the Bible.
03:40 Once identified, we must understand
03:43 how to match these valuable truths
03:45 to specific situations in our lives.
03:49 Then we must allow these principles  to influence our decisions
03:53 and guide our reaction  to trials and temptations.
03:58 Ask yourself,
04:00 ‘How strong is my grip  on the word of life?’
04:04 To answer that,
04:06 let’s consider  the fundamentals of Bible study.
04:11 This is not about old methods or new methods,
04:14 nor is it about what device you are using.
04:17 This discussion transcends devices.
04:21 Study requires active thinking.
04:24 In a world of increasing distractions,
04:27 this is becoming an even greater challenge.
04:30 We’ve often received instant information
04:32 that enables us to quickly recite facts,
04:35 but this is not the same as active thinking.
04:39 Through active thinking,
04:41 we draw meaningful conclusions in our hearts.
04:45 We are certainly grateful  for all the study tools we’ve been given.
04:49 We should use these to the full.
04:52 At the same time, we need to be careful
04:55 that these tools do not cause us  to develop mental laziness.
05:00 Devices can help us to access information,
05:03 but they can’t think for us.
05:06 We must work hard if we are  to develop new patterns of thinking.
05:10 For example, if we study  The Watchtower on a device,
05:15 we can use the hyperlink feature  to read the Scriptures.
05:19 With a simple touch,  we quickly find and read the verse.
05:23 That is good!
05:25 If you regularly do this,  you get a grip on the word of life.
05:30 But would you like to get  a tight grip on the word of life?
05:34 To get a tight grip requires more effort
05:37 than a swipe of a finger  and then swiftly moving on.
05:41 You need to slow down  and analyze the material.
05:46 Only then will the information you study
05:49 become imprinted on your mind and heart,
05:51 leaving a clear and distinct impression.
05:55 How, then, can I get more out of my study?
05:59 Let’s demonstrate a method  taught during Gilead School.
06:04 It involves the use of six questions.
06:07 The following poem, written  by English journalist Rudyard Kipling,
06:11 can help guide better thinking:
06:14 “I keep six honest serving-men
06:18 “(They taught me all I knew);
06:20 “Their names are What and Why
06:22 “and When and How
06:24 and Where and Who.”
06:27 When studying God’s Word,  ask yourself these questions
06:31 and then do research in our publications
06:34 to get the facts  and discern the spiritual lessons.
06:39 To illustrate how to do this,
06:41 let’s open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49
06:45 and look at verses 22 through 25.
06:53 First, we ask the when and where.
06:57 Now, with some research,
06:59 we learn that Jacob  spoke these words near the end of his life.
07:04 He was in Egypt,
07:06 but what he described  takes us back to Canaan some 40 years
07:09 when his son Joseph was a young man.
07:12 Now we have  a clearer picture of these verses.
07:15 So now, let’s read and analyze verse 22:
07:20 “Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree,
07:25 a fruitful tree by a spring,  whose branches extend over the wall.”
07:30 “The offshoot of a fruitful tree.”
07:33 Who is the “fruitful tree”?
07:35 It is Joseph’s father, Jacob.
07:37 How was he fruitful?
07:40 He bore many children.
07:42 Joseph’s “branches extend over the wall.”
07:46 As Jacob’s offshoot,  Joseph is singled out
07:50 for a special blessing  superior to that of his brothers.
07:53 Why?
07:55 Joseph proved he had  the qualities needed for leadership.
07:59 However, of even greater value  than his abilities
08:02 was his being a spiritual man.
08:05 Let’s read verse 23:
08:08 “But the archers kept harassing him
08:11 and shot at him and kept harboring  animosity against him.”
08:15 “The archers kept harassing him.”
08:18 Who are “the archers”?
08:20 Joseph’s half brothers.
08:22 How?
08:23 They shot figuratively at Joseph
08:25 —arrows of envy and hatred  and jealousy were used to attack him.
08:30 Now, eventually,  his brothers sold him into slavery.
08:34 Now let’s read verse 24:
08:37 “And yet his bow remained in place,
08:40 “and his hands stayed strong and agile.
08:43 “This was from the hands  of the powerful one of Jacob,
08:47 from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.”
08:49 “His bow remained in place.”
08:52 How?
08:53 Despite the repeated attacks,
08:55 Joseph repaid animosity with kindness.
08:59 Joseph endured this ill-treatment
09:01 and did not weaken in his devotion to God.
09:04 Now we ask, How?
09:06 How is it that Joseph  kept a spiritual outlook
09:09 despite the harassment and animosity?
09:12 Let’s read verse 25:
09:15 “He [Joseph] is from the God of your father,
09:19 “and he will help you,  and he is with the Almighty,
09:23 “and he will bless you with the blessings  of the heavens above,
09:26 “with the blessings of the deep below,
09:29 with the blessings of the breasts and womb.”
09:33 “He is with the Almighty.”
09:35 Joseph had Jehovah’s help.
09:38 The Almighty was by his side through it all.
09:42 We’ve used our questions  to get the facts of the account,
09:45 but we’re not done.
09:47 Now let’s use them  to take our study to a spiritual plane.
09:52 Next, let’s ask a what question.
09:55 What does this account  teach us about Jehovah?
09:59 Jehovah never abandons his loyal servants.
10:04 Even in the depths of prison,  Joseph was not alone.
10:08 Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph.
10:11 Now make the connection  to Jehovah’s people today,
10:15 including yourself.
10:17 Jehovah will never abandon us.
10:20 Rather, he shows loyal love  to all those who serve him whole-souled.
10:25 Would Jehovah let Joseph  remain in prison indefinitely?
10:30 No.
10:32 At the appointed time, relief came.
10:35 Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains
10:38 to the second most powerful man in Egypt
10:40 —from prison to palace in one day.
10:43 Make the connection to us.
10:45 Our trials are temporary.
10:48 Jehovah will soon bring relief,
10:50 even in unexpected or surprising ways.
10:54 Meanwhile, we are never alone;
10:57 Jehovah is with us.
11:01 Again, let’s ask the question, How?
11:05 How does the account  contribute to the Bible’s theme?
11:09 Joseph suffered, but his suffering led
11:12 to the survival of Abraham’s offspring,
11:15 leading to the Messiah.
11:17 Joseph’s account  is not just a riveting story.
11:21 It directly contributed
11:23 to the development of Jehovah’s purpose.
11:27 Think about this:
11:29 In spite of the poor conduct of his brothers,
11:32 Joseph forgave them and took the initiative
11:36 to improve their relationship with him.
11:39 Joseph’s attitude  was a reflection of Jehovah’s attitude.
11:44 With their family reunited,
11:46 Jehovah also forgave Joseph’s brothers
11:49 and took the initiative  in restoring their relationship with Himself.
11:54 In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph’s brother Judah
11:59 the honor of being  an ancestor of the Messiah.
12:04 What are the lessons in this account?
12:06 Let’s highlight just one.
12:08 Genesis 49:23:
12:13 “But the archers kept harassing him
12:16 and shot at him and kept harboring  animosity against him.”
12:20 Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph.
12:24 Recall Joseph’s response in verse 24?
12:29 “And yet his bow remained in place,
12:32 and his hands stayed strong and agile.”
12:36 In other words, he did not return fire.
12:39 His bow remained in place.
12:42 Reflect on the last time  you were wronged by someone.
12:46 How did we react to what we experienced?
12:50 Did we seek to vindicate ourselves  or insist on our rights?
12:55 Did we fire arrows of animosity in return,
12:59 or did we show mercy and loyal love?
13:03 Did our reaction reveal  that God’s spirit was operative on us?
13:08 Like Joseph, we know  we will have Jehovah’s approval
13:12 even if we are wronged or experience trials
13:15 that make us feel like we are in prison.
13:18 Reflective questions like these
13:20 enable us to make the account our own.
13:23 It becomes part of us,
13:25 part of our way of thinking,  our way of acting.
13:27 This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.
13:31 This type of study rewards us  not simply with a collection of facts
13:36 that impress us today  and are forgotten tomorrow.
13:40 Rather, it leaves us  with core principles that we remember,
13:44 that influence our decisions,  and that guide our lives.
13:48 We tighten our grip on the word of life.
13:53 Let’s review the fundamentals of study.
13:56 Again, this is not  about old methods or new methods
14:00 or about what device you are using.
14:02 This discussion transcends devices.
14:06 It’s about basic methods of Bible study.
14:10 We can liken these three phases of study
14:13 to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.
14:17 Gathering is when we read the Bible.
14:20 We don’t run through the field  grabbing just handfuls of grain;
14:25 we systematically harvest the field.
14:28 Sifting is when we sort out what we gathered,
14:31 answering who, what, where,  when, why, and how to get the facts.
14:36 Baking is when we think
14:38 —“turning up the heat” in our mind and heart—
14:41 something no one else can do for you.
14:45 The questions we ask  can take our study to a spiritual plane.
14:51 Most importantly,  what does this teach me about Jehovah?
14:56 How does it contribute to the Bible’s theme?
14:59 And the bottom line:  What is the lesson for me?
15:05 Jehovah gave us a mind  that is begging to learn.
15:08 It is a gift with the capacity  to cultivate thinking ability.
15:13 When we make the effort  to unearth gems from God’s Word,
15:17 we find that study  is rewarding and delightful.
15:20 More importantly, our study skills enable us
15:23 to keep a tight grip on the word of life.
15:26 A tight grip on God’s Word  will make our life better now
15:31 and give us the opportunity  to continue learning
15:34 about our heavenly Father for all eternity.

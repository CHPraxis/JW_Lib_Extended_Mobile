00:13.117 --> 00:17.288
‎‪The Faroe Islands are 
also called the Land of Maybe.‏

00:17.288 --> 00:20.875
‎‪The weather is very diverse
and can rapidly change.‏

00:23.043 --> 00:26.171
‎‪So when you begin in the ministry,
the weather can be sunny.‏

00:26.171 --> 00:28.632
‎‪And then ten minutes later,
you find yourself‏

00:28.632 --> 00:31.427
‎‪in a massive rain shower
and everything gets wet.‏

00:32.469 --> 00:34.555
‎‪Wind is another challenge.‏

00:34.555 --> 00:36.974
‎‪We have some severe winter storms.‏

00:36.974 --> 00:40.895
‎‪So you have to be careful
that your service partner or the car door‏

00:40.895 --> 00:44.690
‎‪doesn’t blow away
while you’re getting out of the car.‏

00:46.191 --> 00:49.528
‎‪We make sure to wear clothes
appropriate for the weather.‏

00:50.821 --> 00:54.783
‎‪And also to stay updated
on the weather situation‏

00:54.783 --> 00:59.204
‎‪and see where in our territory
the weather is most suitable, and then adapt.‏

01:00.247 --> 01:03.751
‎‪If the weather is nice,
then we try to go from house to house.‏

01:03.751 --> 01:05.878
‎‪And if the weather is bad,‏

01:05.878 --> 01:08.172
‎‪then you can go on calls
where you can go inside,‏

01:08.172 --> 01:10.424
‎‪meaning where they will invite you in‏

01:10.424 --> 01:12.426
‎‪or where the entrance is covered.‏

01:14.053 --> 01:16.347
‎‪And you can plan your ministry
so that if the weather gets bad,‏

01:16.347 --> 01:19.350
‎‪you can make visits that you know
will be at home that time of day.‏

01:21.685 --> 01:24.897
‎‪When the weather is poor,
it’s good to adjust.‏

01:24.897 --> 01:28.734
‎‪Maybe you can do
some telephone witnessing or letter writing.‏

01:28.734 --> 01:30.736
‎‪At a meeting for pioneers,‏

01:30.736 --> 01:33.405
‎‪an elder reminded us
that when the weather is bad,‏

01:33.405 --> 01:36.951
‎‪try not to think:
‘The weather is bad again,’‏

01:36.951 --> 01:41.372
‎‪but instead,
‘Yay! Now people are actually at home.’‏

01:42.164 --> 01:45.668
‎‪It is a good idea to have a plan
for whom you’d like to visit‏

01:45.668 --> 01:48.003
‎‪and what you’d like
to talk to them about‏

01:48.003 --> 01:51.048
‎‪because then when it rains
or the weather isn’t ideal,‏

01:51.048 --> 01:52.883
‎‪you focus on your plan‏

01:52.883 --> 01:55.386
‎‪instead of thinking
that now I have been out preaching‏

01:55.386 --> 01:58.514
‎‪for five hours in stormy weather.‏

01:58.514 --> 02:03.435
‎‪I think Ecclesiastes 11:4
applies quite well to our territory:‏

02:03.435 --> 02:07.481
‎‪“The one who watches the wind
will not sow seed,‏

02:07.481 --> 02:11.193
‎‪and the one who looks at the clouds
will not reap.”‏

02:11.193 --> 02:15.406
‎‪If we have to wait
for the perfect weather conditions to preach,‏

02:15.406 --> 02:17.700
‎‪then we wouldn’t be out that often.‏

02:17.700 --> 02:20.202
‎‪Something else
that helps us to endure bad weather‏

02:20.202 --> 02:24.081
‎‪is to think of the first publishers
in the Faroe Islands.‏

02:24.081 --> 02:26.667
‎‪They fought with seasickness, bad weather,‏

02:26.667 --> 02:30.295
‎‪and they had to hike over the mountains 
to visit remote settlements.‏

02:30.295 --> 02:32.381
‎‪They overcame these obstacles,‏

02:32.381 --> 02:37.302
‎‪and it motivates me to overcome
the challenges I am facing today.‏

02:37.302 --> 02:39.930
‎‪I remember when we came
to the Faroe Islands,‏

02:39.930 --> 02:43.183
‎‪I looked out the window 
and thought,‘Is it even possible‏

02:43.183 --> 02:45.728
‎‪to go out in the ministry
in this kind of weather?’‏

02:45.728 --> 02:48.731
‎‪And then we arrived
at the meeting for field service,‏

02:48.731 --> 02:51.525
‎‪and the friends
with children and strollers were there‏

02:51.525 --> 02:54.194
‎‪and were positive
and ready for field service.‏

02:54.194 --> 02:57.531
‎‪It made me think
that if they can do it, then I can too.‏

03:00.075 --> 03:04.455
‎‪So we are a team of publishers,
and we have the weather as our challenge.‏

03:04.455 --> 03:08.625
‎‪And especially when the weather is bad,
we encourage one another.‏

03:10.419 --> 03:14.465
‎‪We really like the song
“The Life of a Pioneer.”‏

03:14.465 --> 03:16.800
‎‪It’s an amazing song.‏

03:16.800 --> 03:20.846
‎‪It says: “In the work we endure,
whether sunshine or rain.”‏

03:20.846 --> 03:24.683
‎‪It’s because we love Jehovah.‏

03:24.683 --> 03:27.978
‎‪We really want people
to get to know Jehovah.‏

03:27.978 --> 03:29.980
‎‪They need to know the truth.‏

03:30.981 --> 03:33.150
‎‪When Jesus said that we should preach,‏

03:33.150 --> 03:35.527
‎‪I think that he 
also would have put on a raincoat‏

03:35.527 --> 03:37.738
‎‪and gone out to preach the good news.‏

03:39.198 --> 03:43.827
‎‪We experience how Jehovah blesses
our efforts when we go in the ministry.‏

03:43.827 --> 03:46.914
‎‪And you especially feel it
when you persist in your efforts‏

03:46.914 --> 03:48.916
‎‪to preach when the weather isn’t good.‏

03:48.916 --> 03:52.586
‎‪It may be that one day
you have a really nice conversation‏

03:52.586 --> 03:55.005
‎‪with a person about the Bible.‏

03:55.005 --> 03:57.591
‎‪I also feel it gives me great joy.‏

03:57.591 --> 04:01.303
‎‪Paul said that the one who “sows bountifully
will also reap bountifully.”‏

04:02.137 --> 04:05.557
‎‪So if you want to sow bountifully 
in the Faroe Islands,‏

04:05.557 --> 04:08.018
‎‪you need to preach
also when the weather is bad.‏

04:08.018 --> 04:10.646
‎‪And we feel
that we have reaped bountifully‏

04:10.646 --> 04:13.107
‎‪with nice return visits and Bible studies.‏

04:13.107 --> 04:15.275
‎‪I feel it’s worth all the effort‏

04:15.275 --> 04:18.028
‎‪because we see that people in the territory‏

04:18.028 --> 04:20.030
‎‪really appreciate what they are learning.‏

04:20.030 --> 04:21.824
‎‪All that we do in our ministry‏

04:22.407 --> 04:25.410
‎‪is motivated by love for Jehovah‏

04:25.410 --> 04:30.040
‎‪and the people in the territory,
and it won’t be changed by bad weather.‏

04:30.040 --> 04:34.211
‎‪It’s an opportunity to show
that our worship is wholehearted.‏

04:34.211 --> 04:36.755
‎‪You don’t just go
in the ministry when everything is good‏

04:36.755 --> 04:39.341
‎‪and the sun is shining.‏

04:40.425 --> 04:43.053
‎‪I think we have become more enduring‏

04:43.053 --> 04:56.840
‎‪and flexible in our ministry.‏

‎Welcome to Extraordinary Experiences,

00:00:03.357 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎where we hear faith-strengthening stories
‎from our brothers and sisters

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:08.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎serving in all different parts of the world.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We’re very happy today to have with us

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Brother Miguel and Sister Normaryt Guillén,

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎serving at the branch in Venezuela.

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They attended the 144th class of Gilead.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s very nice to have you here with us today.

00:00:18.664 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Welcome.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:20.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thank you.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Venezuela recently has been experiencing
‎serious economic problems. 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Can you explain to us, Miguel, 
‎just what the situation is presently?

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the past, 
‎Venezuela was a normal country.

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:34.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But for some years,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it has been suffering 
‎a situation of civil unrest.

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Right now there are severe shortages

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of food and medicine

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that make it very difficult 
‎to find the most basic products.

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So how do they cope with this challenge?

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, they are seeking first the Kingdom
‎despite the situation.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They are happy, smiling, loving,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and sharing everything 
‎they have between them.

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So we can say 
‎that despite their physical poverty,

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they are more rich than ever

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in love, faith, and generosity.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎What an excellent example!

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:18.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In this climate and in these circumstances,

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how has the preaching work been affected?

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, in some areas that are very dangerous

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because there is 
‎a lot of violence in the streets,

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎it’s amazing to see how,

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎even in this situation,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they have the courage to go

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and share the good news to the people

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎because they know that people really need

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to listen to the message at this moment.

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎During the first months

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of this service year,

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎2,000 publishers got baptized,

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we have in the country
‎33,000 regular pioneers.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s remarkable to see such a spirit
‎—a pioneer spirit. 

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Normaryt, 
‎what trials of our brothers and sisters

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎have affected you personally?

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, the suffering of one family
‎really affected me. 

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎First, men came to the Kingdom Hall

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and stole all the belongings of the brothers

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the car of one brother of that family.

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎One month later,
‎the same men came to the Kingdom Hall

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and they shot the father in the leg.

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Because of this situation, 
‎the sister (the mother) was very nervous

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:36.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the family decided to move

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and to leave the country.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But when they were preparing
‎their documentation,

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:45.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the mother was kidnapped,

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and four days later,

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎she was killed.

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When I heard that, I felt so bad

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—so discouraged.

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:58.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But that same weekend,
‎we went to the convention

00:02:58.282 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—regional convention—

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:04.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and it was so amazing
‎to see the brother who lost his wife

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that same week giving a talk.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He was there speaking with serenity

00:03:12.588 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎about the experiences of Job.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It showed me 
‎that Jehovah was helping them 

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:21.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with his holy spirit

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and also was helping us 
‎through them to face the situation.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Yes, and I am sure that this is just one
‎of many such situations in Venezuela. 

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How would you say that Jehovah is helping

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:38.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the brothers to cope 
‎and you to cope with this crisis?

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Frankly, the situation

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎sometimes looks very, very scary.

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But thanks to Gilead,

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we don’t have fear to return,

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:55.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎not because we are so special

00:03:55.214 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or so strong,

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:01.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but if we have Jehovah with us,

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:03.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎there is no reason to fear.

00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:08.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And we want to transmit 
‎these feelings to our beloved brothers.

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thank you.

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:10.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Once in class,

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the instructor was telling us

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎how important joy is

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and how we can face 
‎the situation in our assignments,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:25.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he said that is only because “the joy 
‎of Jehovah is [our] stronghold.” 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In that moment, I had to cry.

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:34.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I immediately thought about the brothers 
‎and sisters in my congregation

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:37.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—those families who had faced 
‎so many difficult things. 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How can they face that situation?

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:44.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How can they be in the Kingdom Hall smiling,

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎sharing what they have?

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How? How can they be like this 
‎in this difficult time? 

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎It’s because “the joy of Jehovah 
‎is [our] stronghold.”

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎That’s a beautiful point, Normaryt. 

00:04:57.734 --> 00:04:58.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thank you very much,

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and again we 
‎thank you both very, very much

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for sharing your experiences with us today.

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thank you.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:04.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Thank you.

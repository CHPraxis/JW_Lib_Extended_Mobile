00:03.085 --> 00:05.355
I learned the truth as a child 


00:05.355 --> 00:08.023
and since then have always had to struggle 


00:08.023 --> 00:11.026
to conduct myself 
in a way that pleases Jehovah.


00:11.027 --> 00:16.800
I don’t find it easy 
to control my temper or to keep calm. 


00:16.800 --> 00:19.302
When I first arrived in this country, 


00:19.302 --> 00:22.139
a brother treated me in an unkind manner 


00:22.138 --> 00:25.141
and was not very hospitable. 


00:25.142 --> 00:30.347
Because of this, 
I started feeling resentment toward him, 


00:30.347 --> 00:33.617
so much so 
that when he called me on the phone, 


00:33.617 --> 00:36.987
I spoke to him very rudely.


00:36.987 --> 00:38.789
My wife had to help me, 


00:38.788 --> 00:42.491
reminding me that both the brother 
and I are imperfect 


00:42.492 --> 00:45.495
and that the feelings I had 
toward him were not healthy. 


00:45.495 --> 00:48.932
During that time, 
I felt awful and really bad 


00:48.932 --> 00:51.234
about my relationship with Jehovah.


00:51.233 --> 00:54.703
Discipline is never a cause for joy, 


00:54.703 --> 00:57.540
and especially when I receive 
a letter from the branch 


00:57.540 --> 00:59.975
correcting and counseling me 


00:59.975 --> 01:02.545
for something I have not been doing right. 


01:02.545 --> 01:05.000
It certainly makes me feel uncomfortable. 


01:06.015 --> 01:07.350
But I try to reflect 


01:07.350 --> 01:11.720
on the fact that acting 
in accord with Jehovah’s wisdom 


01:11.720 --> 01:13.890
will bring me blessings.


01:13.890 --> 01:18.027
Prayer to Jehovah, Bible principles, 


01:18.027 --> 01:21.030
and trusting that Jehovah 
will give me the needed direction 


01:21.030 --> 01:24.533
has really helped me. 


01:24.533 --> 01:29.305
As the Psalms mention, 
Jehovah is aware “that we are dust.” 


01:29.305 --> 01:31.507
It’s as if he were saying to me: 


01:31.507 --> 01:33.877
“Son, you make so many mistakes, 


01:33.877 --> 01:36.345
“but I love you anyway. 


01:36.345 --> 01:38.413
“I can use you in my service, 


01:38.413 --> 01:40.516
and I know that you will succeed.” 


01:40.517 --> 01:42.519
And, of course, 


01:42.518 --> 01:45.621
it’s possible because Jehovah 
has always helped his servants


01:45.622 --> 01:49.059
—all of them, 
from Abel down to our day. 


01:49.058 --> 01:53.000
All of us who are serving him 
are imperfect people.


01:58.635 --> 02:01.137
One day I was doing some electrical work, 


02:01.137 --> 02:03.272
and I was electrocuted. 


02:03.272 --> 02:05.275
When the doctor saw me, 


02:05.275 --> 02:10.213
he decided that it was necessary 
to amputate both my hands.


02:10.213 --> 02:12.315
I had lost my hands! 


02:12.315 --> 02:14.317
There was so much I wouldn’t be able to do. 


02:14.317 --> 02:16.185
How would I work? 


02:16.185 --> 02:20.923
How would I care for my children? 
for my wife? 


02:20.923 --> 02:22.925
The first thing I asked for was a Bible 


02:22.925 --> 02:25.295
to see if I would be able to turn the pages, 


02:25.295 --> 02:27.330
and I could! 


02:27.330 --> 02:30.933
That made me so happy.


02:30.933 --> 02:33.000
Now I am able to work to support my family. 


02:35.305 --> 02:39.408
I work as a painter, welder, and carpenter. 


02:39.408 --> 02:43.980
I can even drive myself to and from work.


02:43.980 --> 02:46.582
I have been able 
to work on my spiritual goals 


02:46.582 --> 02:49.985
as I continue serving Jehovah, 
like being an elder in the congregation and, 


02:49.985 --> 02:51.988
above all, 


02:51.988 --> 02:55.881
helping my family 
to continue to grow spiritually.


02:55.882 --> 02:58.995
Keeping myself occupied 
with spiritual matters 


02:58.995 --> 03:01.397
has meant that I don’t dwell 
on my disability. 


03:01.397 --> 03:05.402
In fact, sometimes 
I even forget that I’m disabled.


03:05.402 --> 03:08.772
Jehovah has always sustained me. 


03:08.772 --> 03:10.840
Since the day of the accident, 


03:10.840 --> 03:12.675
I have seen how Jehovah God 


03:12.675 --> 03:15.010
by means of my family
—my wife and kids—


03:15.010 --> 03:17.213
and the brothers 
and sisters in the congregation 


03:17.213 --> 03:19.548
has helped me to move on.


03:19.548 --> 03:21.850
Once, after giving a talk, 


03:21.850 --> 03:24.653
a young girl came up to me 
and gave me a letter 


03:24.653 --> 03:26.821
and a drawing she had done of me. 


03:26.822 --> 03:30.660
She thanked me and encouraged me 
by saying that very soon 


03:30.660 --> 03:34.000
Jehovah would give me 
my hands back in the Paradise.


03:35.665 --> 03:40.000
Things like that, 
like being able to hold my wife’s hand, 


03:41.503 --> 03:45.475
my children’s too, 
to carry them and play with them, 


03:45.475 --> 03:47.477
that’s my hope, 


03:47.477 --> 03:52.000
and I have complete confidence 
that Jehovah will bring it about. 


03:57.570 --> 04:00.440
I was arrested and sentenced 
to two and a half years in prison 


04:00.440 --> 04:02.575
for my neutrality. 


04:02.575 --> 04:05.912
The surroundings in prison 
were unfamiliar and overwhelming. 


04:05.912 --> 04:10.784
I didn’t know anyone, 
and I didn’t know what to expect from them. 


04:10.783 --> 04:14.000
I was the only Witness.


04:17.223 --> 04:20.258
I was continually praying 
to Jehovah for power and strength 


04:20.258 --> 04:23.361
to be able to resolve 
any problems in a peaceful manner 


04:23.362 --> 04:25.699
and withstand any difficulties. 


04:25.698 --> 04:29.901
In that situation, only prayer 
and God’s Word brought me comfort. 


04:29.902 --> 04:32.672
But then my Bible was taken away from me. 


04:32.672 --> 04:35.775
It was returned to me, 
though, some time later. 


04:35.775 --> 04:38.477
I was allowed to have 
literature on one condition: 


04:38.477 --> 04:40.647
That I would not preach. 


04:40.647 --> 04:42.649
True, preaching wasn’t allowed, 


04:42.648 --> 04:46.751
but that didn’t mean 
I wasn’t allowed to speak, did it? 


04:46.752 --> 04:49.000
I was determined 
that no matter what happened, 


04:50.022 --> 04:52.559
I would remain faithful.


04:52.558 --> 04:56.461
My good conduct had 
a positive effect on the other prisoners. 


04:56.462 --> 04:59.099
Some of them started reading the Bible. 


04:59.098 --> 05:03.000
Quite often, 
I couldn’t even get my turn to read it. 


05:04.603 --> 05:07.806
I didn’t swear, 
and I kept myself physically clean. 


05:07.807 --> 05:10.000
This didn’t go unnoticed 
by the prison officials. 


05:11.910 --> 05:13.312
One day, they said to me, 


05:13.312 --> 05:16.415
“Because you are morally 
and physically clean, 


05:16.415 --> 05:19.000
we want you to be our head cook.”  


05:20.218 --> 05:23.000
That’s how I became their chef.


05:25.358 --> 05:28.761
I constantly saw evidence of Jehovah’s hand. 


05:28.762 --> 05:30.930
The ministry was amazing. 


05:30.930 --> 05:34.933
There were months 
when I served up to 120 hours. 


05:34.933 --> 05:38.436
I placed more than 100 pieces of literature. 


05:38.437 --> 05:41.240
Thanks to Jehovah, 
I was able to stay in the full-time ministry 


05:41.240 --> 05:44.677
the whole time I was in prison. 


05:44.677 --> 05:47.914
This filled my heart with joy.


05:47.913 --> 05:49.915
The thought at 1 Peter 5:9, 


05:49.915 --> 05:52.985
which says 
that the entire association of brothers 


05:52.985 --> 05:57.157
is experiencing the same kind 
of suffering I was, strengthened me. 


05:57.157 --> 06:01.794
I am confident that no matter 
what circumstances we find ourselves in, 


06:01.793 --> 06:05.000
no matter who is around us, 
Jehovah will never abandon us. 


06:06.798 --> 06:09.201
The day for my release finally arrived.


06:09.202 --> 06:12.972
It was a complete surprise for my mother. 


06:12.972 --> 06:15.000
I hadn’t told her.


06:18.210 --> 06:30.857
I will never forget that moment 
when we were reunited.

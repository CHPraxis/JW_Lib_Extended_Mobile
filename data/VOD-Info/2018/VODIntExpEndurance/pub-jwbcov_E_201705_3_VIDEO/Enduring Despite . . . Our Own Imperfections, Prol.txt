00:03 I learned the truth as a child
00:05 and since then have always had to struggle
00:08 to conduct myself  in a way that pleases Jehovah.
00:11 I don’t find it easy  to control my temper or to keep calm.
00:16 When I first arrived in this country,
00:19 a brother treated me in an unkind manner
00:22 and was not very hospitable.
00:25 Because of this,  I started feeling resentment toward him,
00:30 so much so  that when he called me on the phone,
00:33 I spoke to him very rudely.
00:36 My wife had to help me,
00:38 reminding me that both the brother  and I are imperfect
00:42 and that the feelings I had  toward him were not healthy.
00:45 During that time,  I felt awful and really bad
00:48 about my relationship with Jehovah.
00:51 Discipline is never a cause for joy,
00:54 and especially when I receive  a letter from the branch
00:57 correcting and counseling me
00:59 for something I have not been doing right.
01:02 It certainly makes me feel uncomfortable.
01:06 But I try to reflect
01:07 on the fact that acting  in accord with Jehovah’s wisdom
01:11 will bring me blessings.
01:13 Prayer to Jehovah, Bible principles,
01:18 and trusting that Jehovah  will give me the needed direction
01:21 has really helped me.
01:24 As the Psalms mention,  Jehovah is aware “that we are dust.”
01:29 It’s as if he were saying to me:
01:31 “Son, you make so many mistakes,
01:33 “but I love you anyway.
01:36 “I can use you in my service,
01:38 and I know that you will succeed.”
01:40 And, of course,
01:42 it’s possible because Jehovah  has always helped his servants
01:45 —all of them,  from Abel down to our day.
01:49 All of us who are serving him  are imperfect people.
01:58 One day I was doing some electrical work,
02:01 and I was electrocuted.
02:03 When the doctor saw me,
02:05 he decided that it was necessary  to amputate both my hands.
02:10 I had lost my hands!
02:12 There was so much I wouldn’t be able to do.
02:14 How would I work?
02:16 How would I care for my children?  for my wife?
02:20 The first thing I asked for was a Bible
02:22 to see if I would be able to turn the pages,
02:25 and I could!
02:27 That made me so happy.
02:30 Now I am able to work to support my family.
02:35 I work as a painter, welder, and carpenter.
02:39 I can even drive myself to and from work.
02:43 I have been able  to work on my spiritual goals
02:46 as I continue serving Jehovah,  like being an elder in the congregation and,
02:49 above all,
02:51 helping my family  to continue to grow spiritually.
02:55 Keeping myself occupied  with spiritual matters
02:58 has meant that I don’t dwell  on my disability.
03:01 In fact, sometimes  I even forget that I’m disabled.
03:05 Jehovah has always sustained me.
03:08 Since the day of the accident,
03:10 I have seen how Jehovah God
03:12 by means of my family —my wife and kids—
03:15 and the brothers  and sisters in the congregation
03:17 has helped me to move on.
03:19 Once, after giving a talk,
03:21 a young girl came up to me  and gave me a letter
03:24 and a drawing she had done of me.
03:26 She thanked me and encouraged me  by saying that very soon
03:30 Jehovah would give me  my hands back in the Paradise.
03:35 Things like that,  like being able to hold my wife’s hand,
03:41 my children’s too,  to carry them and play with them,
03:45 that’s my hope,
03:47 and I have complete confidence  that Jehovah will bring it about.
03:57 I was arrested and sentenced  to two and a half years in prison
04:00 for my neutrality.
04:02 The surroundings in prison  were unfamiliar and overwhelming.
04:05 I didn’t know anyone,  and I didn’t know what to expect from them.
04:10 I was the only Witness.
04:17 I was continually praying  to Jehovah for power and strength
04:20 to be able to resolve  any problems in a peaceful manner
04:23 and withstand any difficulties.
04:25 In that situation, only prayer  and God’s Word brought me comfort.
04:29 But then my Bible was taken away from me.
04:32 It was returned to me,  though, some time later.
04:35 I was allowed to have  literature on one condition:
04:38 That I would not preach.
04:40 True, preaching wasn’t allowed,
04:42 but that didn’t mean  I wasn’t allowed to speak, did it?
04:46 I was determined  that no matter what happened,
04:50 I would remain faithful.
04:52 My good conduct had  a positive effect on the other prisoners.
04:56 Some of them started reading the Bible.
04:59 Quite often,  I couldn’t even get my turn to read it.
05:04 I didn’t swear,  and I kept myself physically clean.
05:07 This didn’t go unnoticed  by the prison officials.
05:11 One day, they said to me,
05:13 “Because you are morally  and physically clean,
05:16 we want you to be our head cook.”
05:20 That’s how I became their chef.
05:25 I constantly saw evidence of Jehovah’s hand.
05:28 The ministry was amazing.
05:30 There were months  when I served up to 120 hours.
05:34 I placed more than 100 pieces of literature.
05:38 Thanks to Jehovah,  I was able to stay in the full-time ministry
05:41 the whole time I was in prison.
05:44 This filled my heart with joy.
05:47 The thought at 1 Peter 5:9,
05:49 which says  that the entire association of brothers
05:52 is experiencing the same kind  of suffering I was, strengthened me.
05:57 I am confident that no matter  what circumstances we find ourselves in,
06:01 no matter who is around us,  Jehovah will never abandon us.
06:06 The day for my release finally arrived.
06:09 It was a complete surprise for my mother.
06:12 I hadn’t told her.
06:18 I will never forget that moment  when we were reunited.

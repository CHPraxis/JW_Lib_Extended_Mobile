00:03.691 --> 00:07.319
Spain is a land of castles.

00:07.319 --> 00:09.321
From the mountains of central Spain

00:09.321 --> 00:14.034
to the Mediterranean coast, 
castles dominate the landscape.

00:15.327 --> 00:20.332
But there is one castle
—the Castle of Santa Catalina—

00:20.332 --> 00:24.837
that played a unique part in the history
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain.

00:25.796 --> 00:29.508
This castle that guards the entrance

00:29.508 --> 00:31.969
to the harbor of Cádiz,
in southern Spain,

00:31.969 --> 00:35.848
became a military prison
over two centuries ago.

00:35.848 --> 00:37.850
And this fortress

00:37.850 --> 00:42.021
tested the faith
of around 300 Spanish Witnesses.

00:43.856 --> 00:48.068
The battle began
in the 1960’s when Spain was ruled

00:48.068 --> 00:51.822
by General Franco, a military dictator.

00:51.822 --> 00:56.160
Franco wanted all Spanish men
to serve the fatherland,

00:56.160 --> 00:58.913
and this meant military service.

01:00.039 --> 01:03.542
But in Spain, there were Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:03.542 --> 01:05.753
whose conscience said no.

01:05.753 --> 01:08.881
So this castle became a battleground

01:08.881 --> 01:11.926
where Franco’s military regime fought

01:11.926 --> 01:15.638
to stamp out the Christian consciences 
of those young Witnesses.

01:18.766 --> 01:22.353
But times have changed in Spain.

01:22.353 --> 01:25.022
The city of Cádiz has organized an exhibition

01:25.022 --> 01:29.985
to salute the sacrifice made
by those valiant Witnesses.

01:30.653 --> 01:33.739
Over 40 years after their release,

01:34.490 --> 01:37.326
some of those conscientious objectors
have returned to Cádiz

01:37.326 --> 01:40.245
to attend this exhibition.

01:41.038 --> 01:43.040
At the inauguration,

01:43.040 --> 01:46.460
the mayor described them
as citizens who spoke up

01:46.460 --> 01:49.713
and who presented arguments
against the injustice

01:49.713 --> 01:52.883
—arguments based on peace, freedom,

01:52.883 --> 01:56.553
and, above all, their conscience.

01:56.553 --> 01:59.890
Those who spent years
of their lives behind bars

01:59.890 --> 02:01.892
have vivid memories

02:01.892 --> 02:04.728
of the times
when this castle was their prison.

02:07.481 --> 02:09.900
I think one of the greatest challenges

02:09.900 --> 02:11.527
was never knowing

02:11.527 --> 02:15.280
if we would be granted our freedom.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.616
Our first sentence

02:17.616 --> 02:19.576
was for three years.

02:19.576 --> 02:23.038
And since we still refused
to enlist in the military,

02:23.038 --> 02:26.667
we were then sentenced again
for another lengthy period.

02:26.667 --> 02:30.421
So it seemed as if we had a life sentence.

02:31.839 --> 02:33.882
We organized daily activities

02:33.882 --> 02:36.677
to keep us busy.

02:36.677 --> 02:40.472
Mornings, we worked at our trades

02:40.472 --> 02:42.516
to earn a little money.

02:42.516 --> 02:47.521
Afternoons, we set aside
for spiritual activities.

02:47.521 --> 02:51.525
Our preaching
was done mainly by writing letters.

02:53.193 --> 02:57.406
And in this way,
some of us could even pioneer.

02:57.406 --> 03:00.576
A few people did reply to our letters,

03:00.576 --> 03:05.039
and we were thrilled to hear
that some of them accepted the truth.

03:06.582 --> 03:10.002
Of course,
we also preached to other prisoners,

03:10.002 --> 03:13.422
and a few of them
became baptized Witnesses.

03:14.048 --> 03:16.425
We also studied the Bible thoroughly,

03:16.425 --> 03:18.635
both individually and as a group,

03:18.635 --> 03:23.640
which proved vital
in building us up spiritually.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.894
At first,
we had to study our literature secretly,

03:26.894 --> 03:29.021
but later the guards

03:29.021 --> 03:32.316
allowed us to have
the Bible and other publications.

03:33.275 --> 03:35.360
As our numbers grew,

03:35.360 --> 03:38.030
all the Witnesses 
were kept together

03:38.030 --> 03:40.157
in the same place
—in the same barracks—

03:40.157 --> 03:43.118
so we could organize meetings.

03:45.329 --> 03:48.624
We even held assemblies,
including the Biblical dramas.

03:50.876 --> 03:52.961
And we loved

03:52.961 --> 03:55.172
singing Kingdom songs.

03:55.172 --> 03:59.009
These songs really
lifted up our spirits.

04:02.054 --> 04:07.017
We really felt Jehovah’s loving care
when the brothers came to visit us.

04:07.017 --> 04:10.395
We even had a special visit
from Brother Grant Suiter

04:10.395 --> 04:12.940
of the Governing Body,

04:15.025 --> 04:19.071
but there were also other visits
that we really looked forward to.

04:19.071 --> 04:23.742
Many of the brothers endured
years of separation from their families

04:23.742 --> 04:25.744
and fiancées.

04:25.744 --> 04:28.205
This was a real test.

04:28.205 --> 04:29.832
But these faithful sisters

04:29.832 --> 04:33.877
wholeheartedly supported their neutral stand.

04:33.877 --> 04:37.256
Those were years that molded me spiritually.

04:37.256 --> 04:41.552
I studied the Bible
as I had never done before.

04:41.552 --> 04:46.515
I developed skills
as a public speaker and as an overseer.

04:46.515 --> 04:49.601
Above all, it was a time in my life

04:49.601 --> 04:52.229
when I learned to rely totally on Jehovah.

04:53.897 --> 04:58.360
Thanks to my fervent prayers,
he became my closest friend

04:59.111 --> 05:01.363
and he never let me down.

05:01.363 --> 05:04.241
That was priceless.

05:04.241 --> 05:07.369
The firm stand of those Witnesses

05:07.369 --> 05:11.415
gave a powerful testimony
in Cádiz and throughout Spain.

05:11.415 --> 05:14.209
The run-down military prison

05:14.209 --> 05:16.837
that once tested their faith

05:16.837 --> 05:18.255
has been restored.

05:18.255 --> 05:20.299
It is now a tourist attraction

05:20.299 --> 05:22.509
and a cultural center.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.971
But while the castle has changed,

05:25.971 --> 05:30.225
the faith of those valiant Witnesses has not.

05:30.225 --> 05:32.936
The castle certainly tested them,

05:32.936 --> 05:36.440
but they fought a fine fight for the faith.

05:36.440 --> 05:40.861
And with Jehovah’s help, they won the battle.

05:40.861 --> 05:42.863
Forty years later,

05:42.863 --> 05:45.866
their victory is still giving a witness

05:45.866 --> 06:03.406
to Jehovah’s name.

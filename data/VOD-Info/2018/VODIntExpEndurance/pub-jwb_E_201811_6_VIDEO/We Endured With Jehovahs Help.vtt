00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was 21 years old,

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was sent to prison

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:17.496 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Nonsan military training center

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.333 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I refused to serve in the military.

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The soldier working 
in the military prison came

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and started to beat me, 
and he beat me relentlessly.

00:00:31.093 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was late December 1975. 

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.932 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Four of the brothers were put 

00:00:36.932 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into standing solitary confinement cells

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎called dokgeochang. 

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It literally feels like you are in a coffin. 

00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The outside temperature dropped

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to minus 13 degrees Celsius (8°F),

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:55.034 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and cold air seeped out from the wet walls. 

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brothers couldn’t lay down to sleep,
so they had to crouch, 

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I could hear them groaning all night.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I extended my hand through the iron bars

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the brother in the cell next to mine, 
and he did the same. 

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We held hands

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and encouraged each other to stay strong.

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.815 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My health condition wasn’t really good

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.193 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎while serving my prison sentence. 

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I weighed about 47 kilograms (103 lbs),

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and without my family’s support,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was mentally and physically weak. 

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Under these extremely difficult circumstances,

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there were times I wasn’t able to eat at all. 

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During those times, 
the brothers provided me 

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with porridge
—which was easy to digest—

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:54.677 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎warm clothing, 
and a sleeping bag for the winter. 

00:01:56.428 --> 00:01:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I could really feel their love.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:02.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Having been sent to prison three times,

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I truly feel that Jehovah showed interest in me

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and took care of me 
just as he promised at 1 Peter 5:7. 

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He especially supported me through my brothers

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when I was facing difficulties.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.828 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A day in the prison started

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.162 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with us eating breakfast

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.498 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then moving 300 bricks. 

00:02:25.332 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After lunch, we would have 
to carry another 300 bricks. 

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because I usually finished my work early,

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:35.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had a 20-minute break 
before going back in. 

00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, this brother named Park Byung-Man

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who was much stronger 
and bigger than I was

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎carried bricks all day long. 

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:49.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I found out later that Park Byung-Man

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:51.942 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was carrying Choi Sung-Kyu’s share 

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of bricks because of his frail health. 

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:59.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This kind of brotherly love really moved me

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to start studying the Bible.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got baptized a year later

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:07.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in April of 1977 in the Anyang Prison. 

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After getting baptized,

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎my mother passed away,

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and two months before being released,

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎my father passed away as well. 

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that time was especially difficult for me. 

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the brothers encouraged me

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with their warm words and kind gestures. 

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Their encouragement really touched me

00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:33.067 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and helped me to endure until I was released.

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.950 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One time, I had a severe stomachache. 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The symptoms were not getting any better

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with the medication I was given,

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so I was having a very difficult time. 

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One day, we were served some vegetables 

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as a side dish

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and one brother crushed

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and squeezed the vegetables 
to make juice for me. 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.684 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He cared for me that way for several days. 

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I really would like to see that self-sacrificing

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and loving brother once again.

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:17.236 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At the time, none of our publications

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎other than the Bible were allowed into the prison. 

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Of course, that included our songbook. 

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brothers memorized

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.664 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the lyrics from the songbook,

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they would write them down. 

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.585 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Also, there were some songs

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.587 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that were sung at the regional convention. 

00:04:36.463 --> 00:04:39.508 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Songs like . . .

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We sang them silently together 
even in this isolated place. 

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:13.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was a great source of encouragement

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.461 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to share the love among our fellow brothers.

00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:19.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I remember this encouraging scripture

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:22.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from 1 Corinthians 10:13. 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says that Jehovah 
‘does not let us be tempted

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘beyond what we can bear
and will make the way out

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:32.060 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so we may endure it.’ 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Although there were many challenges, 
I was convinced 

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah would always

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:39.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎make a way out through our fellow brothers. 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.112 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even though 40 years have passed,

00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:46.283 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when we look back at those days,
the memories are still fresh

00:05:46.283 --> 00:05:49.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we are moved to tears at times. 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.622 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So to make a meaningful trip

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎out of our 40 years of friendship,

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:56.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎all the friends who went through the same trials

00:05:56.877 --> 00:06:00.255 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎decided to visit the headquarters 
in the United States together.

00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s really refreshing to be here 
with everyone again today. 

00:06:09.848 --> 00:06:12.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It feels like I’m taking a field trip.

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:22.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was especially moved to tears

00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:24.696 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when I saw our old prison uniforms

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:26.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there in the museum

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at world headquarters
displayed in the neutrality section.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:36.959 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎While on the tour, the brothers sat

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and lay down on the floor 
inside the dokgeochang 

00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:43.257 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we were able to reflect on the times 

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we spent together in prison.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:50.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Our gratitude to Jehovah

00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:53.850 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for giving us such loyal friends was renewed.

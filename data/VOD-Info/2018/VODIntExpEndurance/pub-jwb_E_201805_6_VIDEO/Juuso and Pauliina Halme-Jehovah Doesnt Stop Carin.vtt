00:03.232 --> 00:05.484
Worrying doesn’t help us.

00:05.484 --> 00:08.696
There is no need, really, 
to worry about what could happen.

00:08.696 --> 00:11.699
Even if it happens, let Jehovah show

00:11.699 --> 00:14.326
how he can handle the situation.

00:14.326 --> 00:19.290
He can actually do it in ways 
you could never expect.

00:19.290 --> 00:21.834
We are Juuso and Pauliina Halme.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.836
We loved our assignment 
in the Finland branch.

00:23.836 --> 00:26.797
We had wonderful friends.

00:26.797 --> 00:29.258
Our families, they were very close.

00:30.009 --> 00:32.887
We had time to be with them often.

00:32.887 --> 00:36.098
In 2014, we got the Yearbook

00:36.098 --> 00:39.518
and that had an account of Sierra Leone.

00:39.518 --> 00:41.645
And I was reading that account,

00:41.645 --> 00:44.231
and I remember saying 
a couple of times to Pauliina,

00:44.231 --> 00:46.358
“This would be a tough place.”

00:46.358 --> 00:49.278
After coming back from Gilead, 
I couldn’t believe it;

00:49.278 --> 00:51.989
we got a letter saying

00:51.989 --> 00:55.784
that we had been reassigned 
to Sierra Leone branch.

00:55.784 --> 00:58.787
And it was a huge change for us.

00:58.787 --> 01:01.999
Then what we did 
is we Googled Sierra Leone

01:01.999 --> 01:06.128
and what we saw was only about a civil war

01:06.128 --> 01:08.130
that took place years ago.

01:08.130 --> 01:12.343
An Ebola outbreak 
was starting in West Africa.

01:12.343 --> 01:15.095
Some of our relatives 
were worried about that.

01:15.095 --> 01:19.016
That was our impression, 
first impression, about the country.

01:19.016 --> 01:21.727
We were terrified, and we couldn’t sleep.

01:21.727 --> 01:23.729
We just prayed the whole night.

01:23.729 --> 01:28.359
And really, with the reassignment, 
our greatest fear was my father.

01:28.359 --> 01:31.612
He had been terminally ill 
for about two years,

01:31.612 --> 01:35.115
and we knew that at some point 
it would get worse.

01:35.115 --> 01:38.827
He would need more help 
and also Juuso’s mother.

01:38.827 --> 01:41.997
So were we able to travel back to Finland?

01:41.997 --> 01:45.292
It’s so expensive, 
and we didn’t have savings.

01:45.292 --> 01:47.503
Although we had all those fears,

01:47.503 --> 01:50.714
after praying about it a lot,

01:50.714 --> 01:53.634
we just realized 
that we could not say no.

01:53.634 --> 01:56.971
And we realized 
that this assignment was from Jehovah.

01:56.971 --> 01:59.181
Let’s go there.

01:59.181 --> 02:03.769
Let’s get to work. 
Let’s give our best to it.

02:03.769 --> 02:08.691
Then actually in three months, 
our greatest fear came true.

02:08.691 --> 02:10.693
It really happened

02:10.693 --> 02:14.071
that Juuso’s mom 
called us and she told us

02:14.071 --> 02:17.574
that Juuso’s father’s situation had changed.

02:17.574 --> 02:21.120
So we immediately started to check flights.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.789
And then the next call was

02:23.789 --> 02:26.875
that he had passed away.

02:28.252 --> 02:31.672
We were able to get flights, fly back home,

02:31.672 --> 02:34.800
support my mother, 
and help with the funeral.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.929
We were so happy 
when we finally got back to Sierra Leone.

02:38.929 --> 02:41.390
And now we thought that we could focus

02:41.390 --> 02:45.644
on our assignment and on our work at Bethel.

02:45.644 --> 02:49.314
Then one day, we got another 
Skype call from my father.

02:49.314 --> 02:51.483
And then he told us 
that he was diagnosed

02:51.483 --> 02:54.236
with an extremely aggressive cancer,

02:54.236 --> 02:57.698
and he’s in hospital now, 
and he asked us

02:57.698 --> 03:00.576
to come back to Finland for a visit.

03:02.619 --> 03:05.873
We had a beautiful ten days 
together with my father.

03:05.873 --> 03:08.667
Then, finally, he passed away.

03:08.667 --> 03:12.129
Yeah, that was really 
the lowest point in our life.

03:12.129 --> 03:15.799
That came out of the blue; 
we were not expecting it.

03:15.799 --> 03:18.594
We had two widows to take care of.

03:18.594 --> 03:20.929
So we were really wondering

03:20.929 --> 03:23.223
if we could continue 
in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.979
At that time, 
one of our favorite scriptures was

03:28.979 --> 03:31.106
Isaiah 30:15

03:31.106 --> 03:35.778
that “your strength will be 
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

03:35.778 --> 03:40.157
And when we poured our hearts 
to Jehovah in prayer,

03:40.157 --> 03:44.953
we could see so well how Jehovah 
helped us to stay calm

03:44.953 --> 03:47.664
and have peace.

03:47.664 --> 03:50.793
And we got some good advice here 
from mature brothers

03:50.793 --> 03:53.253
not to make any quick decisions.

03:53.253 --> 03:57.132
So we put our trust in Jehovah, 
and we could just see

03:57.132 --> 04:01.720
that it was Jehovah’s will that we continue 
in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.141
The fact is that, really, 
the blessings always

04:06.141 --> 04:08.894
surpass any of the challenges.

04:08.894 --> 04:13.065
And we have come to love 
our assignment in Sierra Leone.

04:13.065 --> 04:16.443
Our brothers and sisters, 
they are so faithful in Sierra Leone

04:16.443 --> 04:19.404
despite their problems and challenges.

04:19.404 --> 04:22.241
They give beautiful examples for us.

04:22.241 --> 04:26.286
Being in a country where there is a lot 
of potential, a lot of work, . . .

04:26.286 --> 04:29.706
. . . you can have as many Bible studies 
as you can conduct,

04:29.706 --> 04:32.751
so it’s just a preaching paradise.

04:32.751 --> 04:35.921
Going through these experiences,

04:35.921 --> 04:39.174
we are so happy that Jehovah 
is the Writer of our story.

04:39.174 --> 04:42.010
And, for sure, 
there’s a happy end.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.930
If he wants to take you there, go there;

04:44.930 --> 04:47.391
see what Jehovah 
has in mind for you.

04:47.391 --> 05:00.885
And then you can really 
“taste and see that Jehovah is good.”

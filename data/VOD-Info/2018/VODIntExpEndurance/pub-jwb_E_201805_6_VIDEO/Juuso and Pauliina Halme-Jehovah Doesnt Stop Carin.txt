00:03 Worrying doesn’t help us.
00:05 There is no need, really,  to worry about what could happen.
00:08 Even if it happens, let Jehovah show
00:11 how he can handle the situation.
00:14 He can actually do it in ways  you could never expect.
00:19 We are Juuso and Pauliina Halme.
00:21 We loved our assignment  in the Finland branch.
00:23 We had wonderful friends.
00:26 Our families, they were very close.
00:30 We had time to be with them often.
00:32 In 2014, we got the Yearbook
00:36 and that had an account of Sierra Leone.
00:39 And I was reading that account,
00:41 and I remember saying  a couple of times to Pauliina,
00:44 “This would be a tough place.”
00:46 After coming back from Gilead,  I couldn’t believe it;
00:49 we got a letter saying
00:51 that we had been reassigned  to Sierra Leone branch.
00:55 And it was a huge change for us.
00:58 Then what we did  is we Googled Sierra Leone
01:01 and what we saw was only about a civil war
01:06 that took place years ago.
01:08 An Ebola outbreak  was starting in West Africa.
01:12 Some of our relatives  were worried about that.
01:15 That was our impression,  first impression, about the country.
01:19 We were terrified, and we couldn’t sleep.
01:21 We just prayed the whole night.
01:23 And really, with the reassignment,  our greatest fear was my father.
01:28 He had been terminally ill  for about two years,
01:31 and we knew that at some point  it would get worse.
01:35 He would need more help  and also Juuso’s mother.
01:38 So were we able to travel back to Finland?
01:41 It’s so expensive,  and we didn’t have savings.
01:45 Although we had all those fears,
01:47 after praying about it a lot,
01:50 we just realized  that we could not say no.
01:53 And we realized  that this assignment was from Jehovah.
01:56 Let’s go there.
01:59 Let’s get to work.  Let’s give our best to it.
02:03 Then actually in three months,  our greatest fear came true.
02:08 It really happened
02:10 that Juuso’s mom  called us and she told us
02:14 that Juuso’s father’s situation had changed.
02:17 So we immediately started to check flights.
02:21 And then the next call was
02:23 that he had passed away.
02:28 We were able to get flights, fly back home,
02:31 support my mother,  and help with the funeral.
02:34 We were so happy  when we finally got back to Sierra Leone.
02:38 And now we thought that we could focus
02:41 on our assignment and on our work at Bethel.
02:45 Then one day, we got another  Skype call from my father.
02:49 And then he told us  that he was diagnosed
02:51 with an extremely aggressive cancer,
02:54 and he’s in hospital now,  and he asked us
02:57 to come back to Finland for a visit.
03:02 We had a beautiful ten days  together with my father.
03:05 Then, finally, he passed away.
03:08 Yeah, that was really  the lowest point in our life.
03:12 That came out of the blue;  we were not expecting it.
03:15 We had two widows to take care of.
03:18 So we were really wondering
03:20 if we could continue  in our assignment in Sierra Leone.
03:26 At that time,  one of our favorite scriptures was
03:28 Isaiah 30:15
03:31 that “your strength will be  in keeping calm and showing trust.”
03:35 And when we poured our hearts  to Jehovah in prayer,
03:40 we could see so well how Jehovah  helped us to stay calm
03:44 and have peace.
03:47 And we got some good advice here  from mature brothers
03:50 not to make any quick decisions.
03:53 So we put our trust in Jehovah,  and we could just see
03:57 that it was Jehovah’s will that we continue  in our assignment in Sierra Leone.
04:01 The fact is that, really,  the blessings always
04:06 surpass any of the challenges.
04:08 And we have come to love  our assignment in Sierra Leone.
04:13 Our brothers and sisters,  they are so faithful in Sierra Leone
04:16 despite their problems and challenges.
04:19 They give beautiful examples for us.
04:22 Being in a country where there is a lot  of potential, a lot of work, . . .
04:26 . . . you can have as many Bible studies  as you can conduct,
04:29 so it’s just a preaching paradise.
04:32 Going through these experiences,
04:35 we are so happy that Jehovah  is the Writer of our story.
04:39 And, for sure,  there’s a happy end.
04:42 If he wants to take you there, go there;
04:44 see what Jehovah  has in mind for you.
04:47 And then you can really  “taste and see that Jehovah is good.”

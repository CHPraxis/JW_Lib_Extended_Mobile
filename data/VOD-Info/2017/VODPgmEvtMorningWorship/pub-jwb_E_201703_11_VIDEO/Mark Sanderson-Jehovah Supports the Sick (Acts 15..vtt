00:01.650 --> 00:04.287
None of us like to contemplate 


00:04.287 --> 00:08.290
being in a serious accident or receiving news 


00:08.290 --> 00:10.560
that we have a very serious illness 


00:10.560 --> 00:13.997
that may even be life threatening. 


00:13.997 --> 00:18.602
When the blood issue also arises, 
at such times, 


00:18.602 --> 00:23.374
of course we’re all determined 
that we’re going to keep our integrity. 


00:23.373 --> 00:28.745
But we also feel the need 
for comfort and for support 


00:28.745 --> 00:31.247
so that we can remain faithful.


00:31.247 --> 00:35.485
Now, Jehovah never promised 
for this period of time 


00:35.485 --> 00:38.622
that we would receive miraculous healing. 


00:38.622 --> 00:42.659
But he did promise that we would receive 
something very significant. 


00:42.658 --> 00:44.660
Would you open your Bibles with me? 


00:44.660 --> 00:51.000
Let’s look together at Psalm 41:3. 


00:52.168 --> 00:56.438
It says: “Jehovah will sustain him 
on his sickbed; 


00:56.438 --> 01:01.000
during his sickness 
you will completely change his bed.”


01:02.378 --> 01:06.883
Well, now, The Watchtower, back in 2008, 
the September 15 issue,


01:06.883 --> 01:09.151
just made a nice little comment 
on this verse. 


01:09.152 --> 01:11.822
It said: 
“David did not expect Jehovah 


01:11.822 --> 01:15.225
“to perform 
a miracle and remove [his] sickness. 


01:15.225 --> 01:20.163
“Rather, David felt certain 
that Jehovah would ‘sustain him’


01:20.163 --> 01:24.133
“—that is, give him support and strength 


01:24.133 --> 01:26.770
while he was lying on his sickbed.” 


01:26.770 --> 01:29.338
Well, that’s what Jehovah has promised. 


01:29.338 --> 01:33.308
He’s promised that he’s going to provide us 
with the support and the strength 


01:33.308 --> 01:37.546
that we need
so that we can keep our integrity.


01:37.547 --> 01:41.084
Well, Hospital Information Services (HIS) 
here in Brooklyn, 


01:41.083 --> 01:44.786
the Hospital Information Desks 
at each of the branches, 


01:44.787 --> 01:47.890
and the Hospital Liaison Committees (HLC) 


01:47.890 --> 01:52.062
have been very powerful tools 
in the hand of Jehovah 


01:52.062 --> 01:55.432
to provide this support and strength 


01:55.432 --> 01:57.434
when the blood issue arises. 


01:57.433 --> 02:00.570
Did you know that now worldwide 


02:00.570 --> 02:04.940
there are some 1,700
—that is 1,700—


02:04.940 --> 02:09.000
Hospital Liaison Committees 
with over 13,000 members?


02:11.347 --> 02:13.415
This is not easy work. 


02:13.415 --> 02:18.087
The vast majority of these brothers 
are not physicians; 


02:18.087 --> 02:21.090
they’re not connected 
to the medical community in any way. 


02:21.090 --> 02:24.027
Often, they have to get up 
in the middle of the night 


02:24.027 --> 02:26.062
to go to the hospital. 


02:26.062 --> 02:30.400
Sometimes they deal 
with very confrontational situations. 


02:30.400 --> 02:35.000
Usually all of the situations 
that they deal with are emotionally charged. 


02:36.338 --> 02:40.676
Their work is very seldom seen by others. 


02:40.677 --> 02:42.912
They are not in the spotlight.


02:42.912 --> 02:47.850
Well, when we reflect on the work 
of these wonderful brothers 


02:47.850 --> 02:51.620
who are willing to accomplish this work 


02:51.620 --> 02:55.225
of giving assistance and 
support and help to our brothers, 


02:55.225 --> 03:00.000
we can’t help but think of this scripture 
in Jeremiah chapter 23, 


03:01.497 --> 03:03.667
where Jehovah says— 


03:03.667 --> 03:06.000
Jeremiah 23:4: 


03:07.603 --> 03:10.105
“‘And I will raise up over them shepherds 


03:10.105 --> 03:12.908
“‘who will really shepherd them. 


03:12.908 --> 03:16.278
“‘They will no longer be afraid 
or be terrified,


03:16.278 --> 03:20.416
and none will be missing,’ 
declares Jehovah.” 


03:20.417 --> 03:22.752
Well, that’s exactly 


03:22.752 --> 03:26.355
what the Hospital Liaison Committee 
brothers do. 


03:26.355 --> 03:30.627
They are wonderful shepherds 
who are there to help the brothers 


03:30.627 --> 03:33.630
to have the information 
and the assistance they need 


03:33.630 --> 03:36.132
so that they can maintain their integrity.


03:36.132 --> 03:38.434
I recall one experience when I was working 


03:38.433 --> 03:41.336
with the Hospital Information Desk in Canada. 


03:41.337 --> 03:45.140
A sister in a northern Canadian city, 


03:45.140 --> 03:47.877
she had been very, very seriously injured. 


03:47.877 --> 03:52.649
She had to be airlifted to a larger center 


03:52.648 --> 03:55.618
where she would be able to receive 
more intensive care. 


03:55.618 --> 04:00.155
A Hospital Liaison Committee member 
was immediately notified; 


04:00.155 --> 04:02.158
he went to the hospital. 


04:02.158 --> 04:04.593
And so, as soon as the aircraft landed 


04:04.593 --> 04:08.898
and the sister was being taken off 
and wheeled into the hospital, 


04:08.898 --> 04:11.533
there the brother was waiting in the hallway. 


04:11.533 --> 04:15.638
And so, when he approached her 
lying on the stretcher, 


04:15.638 --> 04:18.641
the sister was trembling with fear. 


04:18.642 --> 04:21.677
Well, when he looked down at her, 


04:21.677 --> 04:24.714
she looked up and she said, 
“Are you a doctor?” 


04:24.713 --> 04:28.618
And he said, 
“No, I’m your brother.” 


04:28.618 --> 04:32.688
Well, immediately the sister


04:32.688 --> 04:37.560
—this huge sigh of relief 
because now there was someone 


04:37.560 --> 04:41.730
who could give her the practical help 
that she so much needed.


04:41.730 --> 04:43.767
Well, what are some of the ways 


04:43.767 --> 04:47.170
that this arrangement 
does provide practical support? 


04:47.170 --> 04:49.572
Well, I’m not sure if you know this, 


04:49.572 --> 04:53.075
but at 89 branch offices around the world


04:53.075 --> 04:55.612
—including the United States and Canada—


04:55.612 --> 04:57.947
we have brothers who are on call 


04:57.947 --> 05:00.884
24 hours a day, seven days a week 


05:00.883 --> 05:04.386
to answer calls 
from Hospital Liaison Committee members 


05:04.387 --> 05:06.422
and also from doctors 


05:06.422 --> 05:08.424
who request assistance 


05:08.423 --> 05:11.760
on how to treat Jehovah’s Witnesses 
without the use of blood.


05:11.760 --> 05:15.365
This is an amazing arrangement. 


05:15.365 --> 05:17.367
When I worked with HIS, 


05:17.367 --> 05:19.935
I recall many times 
in the middle of the night, 


05:19.935 --> 05:22.705
we would receive calls 
from a brother or a sister 


05:22.705 --> 05:25.240
or from an HLC or from a doctor 


05:25.240 --> 05:28.912
about someone who 
was desperately in need of assistance. 


05:28.912 --> 05:32.615
And the organization 
had provided such wonderful tools. 


05:32.615 --> 05:37.153
For example, 
a database has been assembled 


05:37.153 --> 05:40.723
of literally thousands of medical articles 


05:40.723 --> 05:43.358
from respected medical journals. 


05:43.358 --> 05:48.363
Now these articles can be sent 
to a doctor or to a medical team, 


05:48.363 --> 05:51.633
and they explain very specifically 


05:51.633 --> 05:54.903
what can be done to address a situation 


05:54.903 --> 05:57.440
without the use of a blood transfusion. 


05:57.440 --> 06:00.108
Often, when a doctor 
receives an article like that


06:00.108 --> 06:04.680
—he sees it’s from one of his peers, 
it’s been published in a respected journal—


06:04.680 --> 06:07.750
he is much more willing to cooperate. 


06:07.750 --> 06:12.122
And also, he sees 
in a practical way what can be done.


06:12.122 --> 06:16.259
But even better, 
each Hospital Information Desk 


06:16.258 --> 06:19.528
maintains a list of consulting doctors. 


06:19.528 --> 06:23.598
Now, these are 
very well-respected physicians 


06:23.598 --> 06:26.835
who are not afraid 
to confer with other doctors 


06:26.835 --> 06:31.773
and explain to them how 
even very complex, very difficult cases 


06:31.773 --> 06:34.610
can be managed without the use of blood.


06:34.610 --> 06:37.747
I recall one time in the middle of the night, 


06:37.747 --> 06:42.119
we received a call about a sister 
who had just given birth, 


06:42.118 --> 06:45.353
and she had lost 
a significant amount of blood. 


06:45.353 --> 06:50.191
The doctor managing her case 
was very interested in receiving help. 


06:50.192 --> 06:55.130
Well, we called 
a very, very well-respected professor 


06:55.130 --> 06:57.833
of obstetrics and gyneocology 
in Canada 


06:57.833 --> 07:00.903
who was always willing 
to provide assistance. 


07:00.903 --> 07:03.438
Well, I started off the call by saying, 


07:03.438 --> 07:07.676
“I’m so sorry to call you so late at night.” 


07:07.677 --> 07:11.180
Well, the doctor said: 
“Please don’t apologize, Mark. 


07:11.180 --> 07:15.752
I’m always happy to do anything 
I can to help the sisters.” 


07:15.752 --> 07:18.000
Well, of course, 
he was not a Witness himself. 


07:19.522 --> 07:24.494
But he viewed those dear ones 
as his own sisters, 


07:24.493 --> 07:26.628
and he was willing to help them.


07:26.628 --> 07:31.533
Well, such courageous and skilled physicians 
all around the world 


07:31.533 --> 07:34.203
have done so much to help our brothers. 


07:34.203 --> 07:38.473
And the tools just keep on improving. 


07:38.473 --> 07:40.510
Many of you may know 


07:40.510 --> 07:44.147
that now we have a section 
for medical professionals 


07:44.147 --> 07:46.782
on our jw.org website. 


07:46.782 --> 07:48.784
Now, I’ll reiterate: 


07:48.783 --> 07:52.921
This is not a site or an area 
for Jehovah’s people; 


07:52.922 --> 07:56.292
it’s specifically designed 
for medical professionals. 


07:56.292 --> 07:58.327
But that area, 


07:58.327 --> 08:00.664
although it’s only recently been established, 


08:00.663 --> 08:03.933
is already having a wonderful effect.


08:03.933 --> 08:06.001
Let me relate this experience. 


08:06.002 --> 08:08.972
A sister wrote this into the branch. 


08:08.972 --> 08:12.875
She said: “Recently my husband took me 
to the emergency room, 


08:12.875 --> 08:16.778
“and we discovered 
I had a mass of some sort near my appendix 


08:16.778 --> 08:19.481
“and that a huge 
and possibly messy surgery 


08:19.482 --> 08:21.450
“was needed to discover the problem. 


08:21.450 --> 08:23.920
“When I told the surgeon 
that was assigned to me 


08:23.920 --> 08:26.055
“that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


08:26.055 --> 08:29.192
“he became agitated when I reinforced 


08:29.192 --> 08:31.394
“my nonnegotiable stand. 


08:31.393 --> 08:33.561
“He never became rude or harsh, 


08:33.562 --> 08:36.132
“but I could tell that he was very troubled. 


08:36.132 --> 08:40.069
“My husband left 
to make a phone call to the brothers. 


08:40.068 --> 08:43.338
“Five minutes later, 
a resident came to tell me 


08:43.338 --> 08:47.643
“that the surgeon 
had just gone to the jw.org website 


08:47.643 --> 08:50.211
“and was downloading information. 


08:50.212 --> 08:52.415
“We had never mentioned the website. 


08:52.415 --> 08:55.517
“How he knew or who told him, 
we’ll never know. 


08:55.517 --> 08:59.889
“But ten minutes later, 
he came back with copies of the information. 


08:59.888 --> 09:03.025
“He had read it, 
he had marked the pages, 


09:03.025 --> 09:06.128
“and he went over everything 
with my husband and me. 


09:06.128 --> 09:09.565
“Then he took my hand, and he smiled. 


09:09.565 --> 09:11.900
“He asked if I was ready, 


09:11.900 --> 09:14.570
“and he promised to do his very best for me. 


09:14.570 --> 09:16.572
“He said he too had made 


09:16.572 --> 09:21.377
“some nonnegotiable decisions 
with God in his lifetime. 


09:21.377 --> 09:24.914
“He saw me about 12 hours after the surgery, 


09:24.913 --> 09:27.783
“and I teased him about being a trouble. 


09:27.783 --> 09:31.686
“He said, ‘No, it was extraordinary.’ 


09:31.687 --> 09:34.857
“We know he meant what he had just learned 


09:34.857 --> 09:36.992
“about the Hospital Liaison Committee 


09:36.992 --> 09:40.864
and Jehovah’s provision 
for information for His people.” 


09:40.863 --> 09:43.165
The sister concluded by saying, 


09:43.165 --> 09:47.470
“I have never felt 
such a wave of peace from Jehovah 


09:47.470 --> 09:49.972
in all my years in the truth.”


09:49.972 --> 09:53.342
Well, Jehovah did not promise us 


09:53.342 --> 09:55.979
miraculous healing at this time, 


09:55.978 --> 09:58.613
but he did promise 
that he would provide us 


09:58.613 --> 10:02.518
with support and strength 
when we are sick. 


10:02.518 --> 10:06.555
What a beautiful gift Jehovah 
has given his people 


10:06.555 --> 10:10.492
through the fine work 
of the Hospital Liaison Committees! 


10:10.492 --> 10:14.564
Truly, this has been 
a strengthening aid for us 


10:14.563 --> 10:23.856
“to keep abstaining from . . . blood.”

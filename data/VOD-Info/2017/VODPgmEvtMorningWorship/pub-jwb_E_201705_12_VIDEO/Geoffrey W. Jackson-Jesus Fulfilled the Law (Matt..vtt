00:01.283 --> 00:04.320
In your ministry, have you ever met someone 


00:04.320 --> 00:07.057
who strongly believes that we are still 


00:07.057 --> 00:09.592
under the Ten Commandments? 


00:09.592 --> 00:12.829
Now, that can happen at times 
because many people


00:12.828 --> 00:15.765
—especially in the southern parts 
of this country—


00:15.765 --> 00:18.602
feel very strongly 
about the Ten Commandments. 


00:18.602 --> 00:21.170
There are even legal battles going on 


00:21.170 --> 00:24.273
as to whether monuments 
displaying the Ten Commandments 


00:24.273 --> 00:27.876
can be displayed 
on government property. 


00:27.877 --> 00:31.647
And, of course, many people feel 
that the Ten Commandments 


00:31.647 --> 00:35.485
are basically what was used 
for the Constitution 


00:35.485 --> 00:37.653
and for the laws of many countries.


00:37.653 --> 00:41.991
So at one point, perhaps, 
a person might say to us, 


00:41.992 --> 00:46.162
‘Do you believe that we are still 
under the Ten Commandments?’ 


00:46.162 --> 00:49.165
Perhaps you may diplomatically answer, 


00:49.165 --> 00:53.570
‘Well, I believe we are under the principles 
of the Ten Commandments 


00:53.570 --> 00:56.672
and the law of love
—the law of the Christ.’ 


00:56.672 --> 00:58.875
But a person may push 
the point and say, 


00:58.875 --> 01:02.912
‘But do you believe the Ten Commandments 
are binding today?’ 


01:02.912 --> 01:06.449
Well, when we give them 
an explanation from the Scriptures, 


01:06.448 --> 01:10.820
perhaps they may feel disappointed 
and maybe they realize 


01:10.820 --> 01:14.723
that there’s a verse in the Bible 
that they feel supports their belief.


01:14.723 --> 01:16.760
So let’s take our Bibles 


01:16.760 --> 01:20.430
and turn to Matthew chapter five,
the Sermon on the Mount,  


01:20.430 --> 01:23.967
from which our text 
is taken this morning. 


01:23.967 --> 01:26.535
And perhaps they may point 


01:26.535 --> 01:29.538
to verses 17 and 18. 


01:29.538 --> 01:31.740
Now that reads: 


01:31.740 --> 01:35.845
“Do not think I came to destroy 
the Law or the Prophets. 


01:35.845 --> 01:39.448
“I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. 


01:39.448 --> 01:43.920
“Truly I say to you that sooner 
would heaven and earth pass away 


01:43.920 --> 01:47.623
“than for one stroke of a letter 
to pass away from the Law 


01:47.623 --> 01:50.393
until all things take place.” 


01:50.393 --> 01:54.330
Now, this person, 
in presenting their explanation, 


01:54.330 --> 01:57.600
may show that they believe 
this expression “fulfilled” 


01:57.600 --> 02:00.570
means “established permanently.” 


02:00.570 --> 02:03.338
And even some Bible commentaries 


02:03.338 --> 02:06.608
say that this involves total commitment. 


02:06.608 --> 02:10.078
Well, how would you answer 
the person at that stage? 


02:10.078 --> 02:12.081
How can we help them?


02:12.082 --> 02:15.452
Perhaps you might take them 
through a series of scriptures, 


02:15.452 --> 02:18.955
such as Romans 10:4 
where it says: 


02:18.955 --> 02:20.957
“Christ is the end of the Law.” 


02:20.957 --> 02:25.662
You might read Galatians 4:4,5 
where it says, 


02:25.662 --> 02:28.330
‘those under the law were released.’ 


02:28.330 --> 02:33.202
Or Ephesians 2:15 where it speaks 
of the Law being “abolished.” 


02:33.202 --> 02:35.905
But if you’ve done that, 


02:35.905 --> 02:38.508
perhaps you’ve had 
the same experience that I have


02:38.508 --> 02:42.711
—that a person may agree 
with those scriptures but say: 


02:42.712 --> 02:46.082
‘That’s not referring 
to the Ten Commandments. 


02:46.082 --> 02:50.654
‘That’s referring to all the other laws 
in the Mosaic Law arrangement. 


02:50.653 --> 02:53.790
But the Ten Commandments 
remain forever.’


02:53.790 --> 02:58.427
Well, how can you help someone 
to reason on that matter? 


02:58.427 --> 03:02.599
Well, let’s look back again 
at Matthew chapter 5, 


03:02.598 --> 03:06.001
and we notice there 
in verses 17 and 18, 


03:06.002 --> 03:10.307
it mentions that Jesus came 
“not to destroy, but to fulfill.” 


03:10.307 --> 03:14.577
And we could ask the person 
how they understand the word “fulfill”


03:14.577 --> 03:16.579
—what they feel that means. 


03:16.578 --> 03:20.550
And perhaps they might say, 
‘Established permanently.’ 


03:20.550 --> 03:22.652
Well, then we could point out 


03:22.652 --> 03:27.157
that Jesus then continues to talk 
about various aspects of the Law. 


03:27.157 --> 03:30.860
If we look at verse 21, 
what do we notice? 


03:30.860 --> 03:34.263
“You heard that it was said 
to those of ancient times: 


03:34.263 --> 03:36.331
‘You must not murder.’” 


03:36.332 --> 03:40.404
So, yes, this is one 
of the Ten Commandments. 


03:40.403 --> 03:44.840
Interestingly, the study Bible has a note 
on this verse that says 


03:44.840 --> 03:47.710
this phrase,
 “You heard that is was said:


03:47.710 --> 03:52.182
“. . . can refer both to things stated 
in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures 


03:52.182 --> 03:54.817
and to teachings of Jewish tradition.” 


03:54.817 --> 03:57.154
Now, we’ll see this as we go on. 


03:57.153 --> 03:59.988
If we go to verse 23, 


03:59.988 --> 04:02.591
what does it talk about here? 


04:02.592 --> 04:05.829
“If, then, you are bringing 
your gift to the altar 


04:05.828 --> 04:09.231
and there you remember your brother 
has something against you.” 


04:09.232 --> 04:12.202
This is not part 
of the Ten Commandments, is it? 


04:12.202 --> 04:16.105
It’s talking about the arrangements 
for sacrifices. 


04:16.105 --> 04:19.142
Then, if we look at verse 27: 


04:19.142 --> 04:23.647
“You heard that it was said: 
‘You must not commit adultery.’” 


04:23.647 --> 04:26.715
Well, again we have 
the Ten Commandments. 


04:26.715 --> 04:31.453
But if we look at verse 31, 
Jesus here says: 


04:31.453 --> 04:35.458
“Moreover, it was said: 
‘Whoever divorces his wife, 


04:35.458 --> 04:38.260
let him give her 
a certificate of divorce.’” 


04:38.260 --> 04:41.563
That’s not one 
of the Ten Commandments, is it? 


04:41.563 --> 04:45.166
Reading on further in verse 33, 
it says: 


04:45.167 --> 04:48.370
“Again you heard that it was said 
to those of ancient times: 


04:48.370 --> 04:51.273
‘You must not swear without performing.’” 


04:51.273 --> 04:54.710
Again, not one 
of the Ten Commandments. 


04:54.710 --> 04:58.682
Verse 38: 
“You heard that it was said: 


04:58.682 --> 05:01.717
‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’” 


05:01.717 --> 05:04.854
Again, not one 
of the Ten Commandments. 


05:04.853 --> 05:08.156
And then we come to the scripture 
we’ve been considering this morning 


05:08.157 --> 05:10.159
in verse 43:


05:10.158 --> 05:12.228
“You heard that it was said: 


05:12.228 --> 05:16.398
‘You must love your neighbor 
and hate your enemy.’” 


05:16.398 --> 05:19.135
Now, when we consider this


05:19.135 --> 05:22.338
—we look at the study Bible notes 
on this verse—


05:22.338 --> 05:25.375
it makes this comment 
about “hate your enemy.” 


05:25.375 --> 05:29.045
It says: “The Mosaic Law 
contained no such command. 


05:29.045 --> 05:32.948
“Some Jewish rabbis believed 
that the command to love their neighbor 


05:32.948 --> 05:36.151
implied that they should hate their enemy.” 


05:36.152 --> 05:41.024
So this wasn’t really part 
of the Law that Moses gave.


05:41.023 --> 05:43.726
But what do we see from this? 


05:43.727 --> 05:48.530
Well, if a person argues very strongly 
that the word “fulfilled,” 


05:48.530 --> 05:50.733
when Jesus is talking about the Law, 


05:50.733 --> 05:54.936
applies to the Ten Commandments only


05:54.937 --> 05:58.307
—we look down here—
Jesus when he’s talking about the Law, 


05:58.307 --> 06:00.877
doesn’t just talk 
about the Ten Commandments, does he? 


06:00.877 --> 06:05.515
He talks about all these things, 
including even the oral tradition. 


06:05.515 --> 06:10.453
So if a person were to believe 
that Jesus’ words, when saying “fulfilled,”  


06:10.453 --> 06:15.425
refer to absolutely establishing 
something permanently, 


06:15.425 --> 06:18.293
would also feel
—or have to feel—


06:18.293 --> 06:21.830
that he’s referring to this law 
of “eye for eye, tooth for tooth” 


06:21.830 --> 06:26.035
when, in fact, he showed 
something better than that, didn’t he? 


06:26.035 --> 06:29.738
And the same too 
with the scripture for today’s text.


06:29.738 --> 06:31.740
So, what do we see here? 


06:31.740 --> 06:35.645
Well, we can’t make 
that comment about Jesus’ words. 


06:35.645 --> 06:37.980
So, what does it mean 
when it says, 


06:37.980 --> 06:41.283
‘to fulfill and not to destroy’? 


06:41.283 --> 06:44.620
Perhaps a simple illustration 
would help us. 


06:44.620 --> 06:48.157
If someone signs 
a contract as a builder 


06:48.157 --> 06:50.660
to build a home 
for someone else, 


06:50.660 --> 06:54.730
what does it mean 
to destroy the contract? 


06:54.730 --> 06:59.235
Well, perhaps it means ripping it up, 
burning it, getting rid of it


06:59.235 --> 07:02.205
—certainly not building the house. 


07:02.205 --> 07:04.507
But on the other hand, 
what does it mean 


07:04.507 --> 07:08.077
to fulfill the contract 
to build the house? 


07:08.077 --> 07:11.280
Well, it means 
that the person builds the house. 


07:11.280 --> 07:13.648
But once the house is built, 


07:13.648 --> 07:18.320
then the contract 
is completed, or fulfilled. 


07:18.320 --> 07:22.192
This person isn’t under obligation 
to continue over and over again 


07:22.192 --> 07:24.194
to keep building the same house. 


07:24.193 --> 07:27.196
So perhaps an illustration 
such as that 


07:27.197 --> 07:30.734
may help someone 
of humble heart 


07:30.733 --> 07:32.935
to see that when Jesus said 


07:32.935 --> 07:35.772
he “came, not to destroy, 
but to fulfill,” 


07:35.772 --> 07:38.607
that he wasn’t there 
to eradicate the Law. 


07:38.607 --> 07:41.410
In Galatians 4, it mentions 
he was ‘born under Law.’ 


07:41.410 --> 07:45.782
So he had to fulfill, or complete, 
or do what the Law stated. 


07:45.782 --> 07:48.985
But, of course, the other scriptures 
help us when they tell us 


07:48.985 --> 07:51.020
that the Law was completed, 


07:51.020 --> 07:53.990
that the Christ 
was the end to the Law.


07:53.990 --> 07:56.692
Now, perhaps a person 
might still find this 


07:56.692 --> 07:59.029
a little difficult to comprehend. 


07:59.028 --> 08:01.630
One final scripture we could share with them 


08:01.630 --> 08:03.632
is in the book of Romans, 


08:03.632 --> 08:08.000
Romans 7:6, 7. 


08:09.372 --> 08:13.877
Romans 7:6, 7, 
verse 6 says: 


08:13.877 --> 08:16.712
“But now we have been released 
from the Law, 


08:16.712 --> 08:21.050
“because we have died
to that which restrained us, 


08:21.050 --> 08:25.287
“in order that we might be slaves 
in a new sense by the spirit 


08:25.287 --> 08:28.457
and not in the old sense 
by the written code.” 


08:28.457 --> 08:32.562
Now, if we pause there, 
perhaps the person might jump in and say:


08:32.562 --> 08:36.799
‘Ah, yes. That’s the Law 
that doesn’t include the Ten Commandments. 


08:36.798 --> 08:41.370
Those are all the other laws, 
but the Ten Commandments remain forever.’ 


08:41.370 --> 08:44.740
Well, then we ask them, 
 ‘Just let’s read on, verse 7, 


08:44.740 --> 08:46.775
what does it say?’ 


08:46.775 --> 08:48.945
“What, then, are we to say? 


08:48.945 --> 08:50.947
“Is the Law sin? 


08:50.947 --> 08:52.949
“Certainly not! 


08:52.948 --> 08:55.785
“Really, I would not have come 
to know sin 


08:55.785 --> 08:57.787
“had it not been for the Law. 


08:57.787 --> 08:59.822
For example, . . .” 


08:59.822 --> 09:02.359
Now, what example 
is Paul going to use? 


09:02.358 --> 09:06.361
It says: “For example, 
I would not have known covetousness 


09:06.362 --> 09:10.700
if the Law had not said: 
‘You must not covet.’” 


09:10.700 --> 09:15.705
So, obviously, the apostle Paul 
and our Lord Jesus Christ 


09:15.705 --> 09:18.573
did not separate the Law 
into two parts


09:18.573 --> 09:21.876
—the Ten Commandments 
and the other laws.


09:21.877 --> 09:25.014
So we can see clearly from here 
that we have a good answer 


09:25.013 --> 09:28.183
to give persons 
when they adamantly state 


09:28.183 --> 09:30.686
that the Ten Commandments 
are still binding. 


09:30.687 --> 09:33.489
Hopefully, we can go on then 
to help them to see 


09:33.488 --> 09:37.693
that Jesus was teaching us 
the principles behind the laws  


09:37.693 --> 09:41.196
and that “the law of the Christ” 
involves loving Jehovah 


09:41.197 --> 09:43.199
and loving our neighbors, 


09:43.198 --> 09:46.801
and then following 
what direction Jehovah has given us. 


09:46.802 --> 09:51.340
So you may think 
this is quite a complicated subject 


09:51.340 --> 09:54.010
to discuss early in the morning. 


09:54.010 --> 09:57.413
But next time 
when someone does ask you, 


09:57.413 --> 10:00.481
“Do you believe 
the Ten Commandments are binding?” 


10:00.482 --> 10:09.509
hopefully, you’ll remember 
these comments.

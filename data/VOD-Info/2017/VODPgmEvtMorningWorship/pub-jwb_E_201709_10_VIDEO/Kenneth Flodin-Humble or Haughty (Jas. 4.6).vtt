00:01.317 --> 00:03.620
James 4:6: 


00:03.620 --> 00:06.588
“God opposes the haughty ones, 


00:06.588 --> 00:08.758
“but he gives undeserved kindness 


00:08.758 --> 00:11.193
to the humble ones.” 


00:11.193 --> 00:15.031
Well, 
haughtiness is really disdainful pride, 


00:15.032 --> 00:17.600
superciliousness, arrogance. 


00:17.600 --> 00:21.003
One who is haughty 
is in his own estimation 


00:21.003 --> 00:23.005
superior to his fellow man. 


00:23.005 --> 00:25.065
On the other hand, 


00:25.065 --> 00:29.478
humility is freedom 
from pride or arrogance. 


00:29.478 --> 00:33.281
It’s the state of lowliness of mind. 


00:33.282 --> 00:38.354
Humility and haughtiness 
are the exact opposites of each other. 


00:38.353 --> 00:41.858
Humility is here; 


00:41.858 --> 00:45.995
haughtiness is at the other end 
of the spectrum. 


00:45.995 --> 00:48.465
Which one are you? 


00:48.465 --> 00:52.402
Likely neither, 
but somewhere in between.


00:52.402 --> 00:55.905
Now, if Jehovah 
had a “humble/haughty meter,” 


00:55.905 --> 00:59.675
where would the needle be 
if he was monitoring you? 


00:59.675 --> 01:01.677
Would it be in the middle? 


01:01.677 --> 01:03.212
Well, hopefully not. 


01:03.212 --> 01:05.682
Hopefully it would be closer to humility. 


01:05.682 --> 01:07.684
We’re imperfect, but we want to be 


01:07.683 --> 01:11.053
as far away from haughtiness as possible. 


01:11.053 --> 01:13.055
The verse said: 


01:13.055 --> 01:15.057
“[Jehovah] opposes the haughty,” 


01:15.057 --> 01:18.729
but he favors those who are humble. 


01:18.728 --> 01:22.898
Haughtiness is not totally 
a mental condition per se. 


01:22.898 --> 01:26.001
Please find Mark chapter 7 with me, 


01:26.002 --> 01:28.905
Mark 7:21, 22. 


01:28.905 --> 01:32.108
Jesus put haughtiness in a lineup 


01:32.108 --> 01:36.211
with many unsavory qualities and actions. 


01:36.212 --> 01:40.484
Well, if it’s not totally a mental condition, 
what is haughtiness? 


01:40.483 --> 01:45.121
Notice how Jesus describes 
where it comes from 


01:45.122 --> 01:50.000
at Mark 7:21, 22. 


01:53.195 --> 01:54.197
It says: 


01:54.197 --> 01:57.234
“For from inside, 
out of the heart of men, 


01:57.233 --> 01:59.235
[so it’s a heart condition] 


01:59.235 --> 02:02.305
“come injurious reasonings, 
sexual immorality, thefts, 


02:02.305 --> 02:05.142
“murders, acts of adultery, greed, 
acts of wickedness, deceit, 


02:05.142 --> 02:09.012
“brazen conduct, 
an envious eye, blasphemy, 


02:09.012 --> 02:12.915
“haughtiness, and unreasonableness. 


02:12.915 --> 02:16.953
All these . . . things come from within 
and defile a man.” 


02:16.953 --> 02:19.355
So haughtiness is really 
a condition of the heart, 


02:19.355 --> 02:21.357
the inner person. 


02:21.357 --> 02:24.727
And it says it’s a ‘wicked thing.’


02:24.727 --> 02:27.464
Well, what about humility? 


02:27.463 --> 02:29.765
In some ancient cultures, 


02:29.765 --> 02:32.902
a humble person 
was always thought to be a slave, 


02:32.902 --> 02:36.139
miserable, a pitiful person. 


02:36.138 --> 02:40.876
But humility is not the same as humiliation. 


02:40.877 --> 02:45.382
Instead, 
in the Bible it stresses that humility


02:45.382 --> 02:46.615
—this lowliness of mind—


02:46.615 --> 02:49.818
can actually lead to honor, 
to status with God. 


02:49.818 --> 02:52.888
And so Proverbs 22:4 says: 


02:52.888 --> 02:58.000
“The result of humility . . . 
is riches and glory and life”


02:59.528 --> 03:04.633
—not miserable, 
not pitiful by any means.


03:04.633 --> 03:08.605
Well, we said earlier that if Jehovah 
had a “humble/haughty meter,” 


03:08.605 --> 03:13.577
the needle likely would not be pegged 
on humility in our case 


03:13.577 --> 03:15.579
nor on haughtiness. 


03:15.578 --> 03:17.646
Well, why is that? 


03:17.647 --> 03:20.450
Well, because as dedicated Christians, 


03:20.450 --> 03:25.053
none of us are absolutely haughty at heart. 


03:25.053 --> 03:28.725
But as imperfect dedicated Christians, 


03:28.725 --> 03:32.628
none of us have the market 
on true humility. 


03:32.628 --> 03:37.133
Only Jehovah and Jesus 
are absolutely humble.


03:37.133 --> 03:40.536
Well, can we be basically 
a humble person 


03:40.537 --> 03:44.707
and yet act haughtily, 
or arrogantly, at times? 


03:44.707 --> 03:46.875
Well, let’s consider Moses. 


03:46.875 --> 03:49.178
Jehovah gave him tremendous authority. 


03:49.178 --> 03:53.650
And it’s known that power, 
authority, a responsible position 


03:53.650 --> 03:57.320
can erode humility. 


03:57.320 --> 04:00.590
But Moses proved 
his humility time after time. 


04:00.590 --> 04:02.925
For example, 
in Numbers chapter 11 


04:02.925 --> 04:05.295
he gathered together 70 elders, 


04:05.295 --> 04:09.898
and verse 25 says that Jehovah 
took some of the spirit of Moses away 


04:09.898 --> 04:11.900
and put it on the 70 elders, 


04:11.900 --> 04:14.137
and they began to behave as prophets. 


04:14.137 --> 04:16.705
Well, 
there’s nothing that indicates Moses 


04:16.705 --> 04:20.743
jealously tried to guard 
his authority and privileges. 


04:20.743 --> 04:22.745
He was humble.


04:22.745 --> 04:26.748
And we all remember the account 
where Moses’ father-in-law 


04:26.748 --> 04:31.686
suggested that he delegate 
some of his workload to others. 


04:31.687 --> 04:35.024
Moses did not arrogantly resist that. 


04:35.023 --> 04:38.026
He humbly accepted the suggestion. 


04:38.027 --> 04:40.029
And then later, 
at the end of his life 


04:40.028 --> 04:43.565
when Jehovah chose his replacement
—Joshua—


04:43.565 --> 04:45.768
Moses humbly accepted that decision. 


04:45.768 --> 04:48.000
He urged the people to follow Joshua’s lead.


04:50.573 --> 04:52.575
Well, 
we could say nothing else 


04:52.575 --> 04:57.647
than Moses was 
an excellent example of humility, 


04:57.647 --> 04:59.715
but he was not perfect. 


04:59.715 --> 05:02.000
Please find with me Numbers chapter 20, 


05:03.887 --> 05:05.889
Numbers 20. 


05:05.888 --> 05:08.858
Humble Moses allowed himself 
to be provoked 


05:08.858 --> 05:12.428
and perform an act of haughtiness, 
or arrogance. 


05:12.428 --> 05:15.631
The situation was that there was no water 
for the assembly of Israel, 


05:15.632 --> 05:20.000
and the people began to show 
an arrogant, rebellious spirit. 


05:21.437 --> 05:23.665
Please pick up the dialogue with me 


05:23.665 --> 05:27.000
in verse 4 of Numbers chapter 20. 


05:28.477 --> 05:29.479
They said: 


05:29.478 --> 05:31.198
“Why have you brought 
Jehovah’s congregation 


05:31.198 --> 05:34.016
“into this wilderness for us 
and our livestock to die here? 


05:34.017 --> 05:37.820
“And why have you led us up out of Egypt 
to bring us into this evil place? 


05:37.820 --> 05:40.557
“It is no place for seed and figs 
and vines and pomegranates, 


05:40.557 --> 05:42.959
and there is no water to drink.” 


05:42.958 --> 05:46.428
Well, they got under Moses’ skin. 


05:46.428 --> 05:50.566
They caused him 
to lose his humility momentarily. 


05:50.567 --> 05:53.804
Look at verse 9: 


05:53.803 --> 05:56.138
“So Moses took the rod 
from before Jehovah, 


05:56.138 --> 05:58.140
“just as He had commanded him. 


05:58.140 --> 06:00.377
“Then Moses and Aaron 
called the congregation together 


06:00.377 --> 06:02.379
“before the crag, 
and he said to them: 


06:02.378 --> 06:04.146
“‘Hear, now, you rebels! 


06:04.147 --> 06:07.650
“‘Must we [meaning Aaron and I] 


06:07.650 --> 06:10.520
bring out water for you from this crag?’” 


06:10.520 --> 06:14.390
Well, 
that was a haughty, arrogant act. 


06:14.390 --> 06:16.425
Admittedly, 
the people were out of line 


06:16.425 --> 06:18.693
with their speech and attitude. 


06:18.693 --> 06:21.063
But Jehovah took note 


06:21.063 --> 06:25.266
of “the spike in the needle” 
of the “haughty meter.” 


06:25.267 --> 06:28.637
Look at verse 12: 


06:28.637 --> 06:30.640
“Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron: 


06:30.640 --> 06:32.808
“‘Because you did not show faith in me 


06:32.808 --> 06:35.845
“‘and sanctify me before the eyes 
of the people of Israel, 


06:35.845 --> 06:38.280
“‘you will not bring this congregation 


06:38.280 --> 06:41.017
into the land that I will give them.’” 


06:41.017 --> 06:43.854
So although generally Moses’ “needle” 


06:43.853 --> 06:46.855
was always very close to humility, 


06:46.855 --> 06:49.125
Jehovah was displeased 


06:49.125 --> 06:52.762
with this “spike on the needle” 
toward haughtiness, 


06:52.762 --> 06:54.864
even though momentary.


06:54.863 --> 06:56.865
Well, it’s good for us to consider this 


06:56.865 --> 07:00.002
because it’s easy 
for us to lose our humility, 


07:00.002 --> 07:03.005
particularly if we are invested 
with some authority. 


07:03.005 --> 07:05.942
Maybe we have a new responsibility 


07:05.942 --> 07:09.079
in the congregation, 
in the circuit, at the branch. 


07:09.078 --> 07:11.446
Or maybe we have a skill 
and talent that we excel in, 


07:11.447 --> 07:13.449
and we get compliments galore. 


07:13.448 --> 07:16.085
Or we’re at odds with a fellow believer. 


07:16.085 --> 07:19.888
Will we maintain our humility? 


07:19.888 --> 07:23.491
There was a great line 
in the February 2013 Watchtower. 


07:23.492 --> 07:27.230
It said: “Remember: 
In order to be useful to Jehovah, 


07:27.230 --> 07:31.000
our humility 
should always exceed our ability.” 


07:32.100 --> 07:35.705
Well, King Saul allowed his ability 


07:35.705 --> 07:37.873
to exceed his humility. 


07:37.873 --> 07:40.375
And at 1 Samuel 15:17


07:40.375 --> 07:42.997
—he was not to take 
any spoils from the land,


07:42.997 --> 07:45.014
but he allowed that to happen—


07:45.013 --> 07:48.616
in verse 17, 
Samuel confronted him, and he said: 


07:48.617 --> 07:52.589
“Were you not insignificant 
[or humble] in your own eyes?” 


07:52.588 --> 07:55.356
And then he said: 
‘Why did you disobey Jehovah?’ 


07:55.357 --> 07:57.360
Well, 
Saul stammered and stuttered. 


07:57.360 --> 07:59.462
But bottom line, 
Jehovah was not pleased 


07:59.462 --> 08:02.699
because in verse 23, 
Jehovah said through Samuel: 


08:02.698 --> 08:05.635
‘Rebelliousness is the same 
as the sin of divination, 


08:05.635 --> 08:09.938
‘and pushing ahead presumptuously 
the same as magical power and idolatry. 


08:09.938 --> 08:14.000
You rejected the word of God, 
I reject you as king.’


08:15.177 --> 08:17.180
Well, it’s just as our text said: 


08:17.180 --> 08:20.917
“[Jehovah] opposes the haughty ones.” 


08:20.917 --> 08:32.912
May we all strive to keep 
our “needle” close to humility.

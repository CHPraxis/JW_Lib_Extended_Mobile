00:01 James 4:6:
00:03 “God opposes the haughty ones,
00:06 “but he gives undeserved kindness
00:08 to the humble ones.”
00:11 Well,  haughtiness is really disdainful pride,
00:15 superciliousness, arrogance.
00:17 One who is haughty  is in his own estimation
00:21 superior to his fellow man.
00:23 On the other hand,
00:25 humility is freedom  from pride or arrogance.
00:29 It’s the state of lowliness of mind.
00:33 Humility and haughtiness  are the exact opposites of each other.
00:38 Humility is here;
00:41 haughtiness is at the other end  of the spectrum.
00:45 Which one are you?
00:48 Likely neither,  but somewhere in between.
00:52 Now, if Jehovah  had a “humble/haughty meter,”
00:55 where would the needle be  if he was monitoring you?
00:59 Would it be in the middle?
01:01 Well, hopefully not.
01:03 Hopefully it would be closer to humility.
01:05 We’re imperfect, but we want to be
01:07 as far away from haughtiness as possible.
01:11 The verse said:
01:13 “[Jehovah] opposes the haughty,”
01:15 but he favors those who are humble.
01:18 Haughtiness is not totally  a mental condition per se.
01:22 Please find Mark chapter 7 with me,
01:26 Mark 7:21, 22.
01:28 Jesus put haughtiness in a lineup
01:32 with many unsavory qualities and actions.
01:36 Well, if it’s not totally a mental condition,  what is haughtiness?
01:40 Notice how Jesus describes  where it comes from
01:45 at Mark 7:21, 22.
01:53 It says:
01:54 “For from inside,  out of the heart of men,
01:57 [so it’s a heart condition]
01:59 “come injurious reasonings,  sexual immorality, thefts,
02:02 “murders, acts of adultery, greed,  acts of wickedness, deceit,
02:05 “brazen conduct,  an envious eye, blasphemy,
02:09 “haughtiness, and unreasonableness.
02:12 All these . . . things come from within  and defile a man.”
02:16 So haughtiness is really  a condition of the heart,
02:19 the inner person.
02:21 And it says it’s a ‘wicked thing.’
02:24 Well, what about humility?
02:27 In some ancient cultures,
02:29 a humble person  was always thought to be a slave,
02:32 miserable, a pitiful person.
02:36 But humility is not the same as humiliation.
02:40 Instead,  in the Bible it stresses that humility
02:45 —this lowliness of mind—
02:46 can actually lead to honor,  to status with God.
02:49 And so Proverbs 22:4 says:
02:52 “The result of humility . . .  is riches and glory and life”
02:59 —not miserable,  not pitiful by any means.
03:04 Well, we said earlier that if Jehovah  had a “humble/haughty meter,”
03:08 the needle likely would not be pegged  on humility in our case
03:13 nor on haughtiness.
03:15 Well, why is that?
03:17 Well, because as dedicated Christians,
03:20 none of us are absolutely haughty at heart.
03:25 But as imperfect dedicated Christians,
03:28 none of us have the market  on true humility.
03:32 Only Jehovah and Jesus  are absolutely humble.
03:37 Well, can we be basically  a humble person
03:40 and yet act haughtily,  or arrogantly, at times?
03:44 Well, let’s consider Moses.
03:46 Jehovah gave him tremendous authority.
03:49 And it’s known that power,  authority, a responsible position
03:53 can erode humility.
03:57 But Moses proved  his humility time after time.
04:00 For example,  in Numbers chapter 11
04:02 he gathered together 70 elders,
04:05 and verse 25 says that Jehovah  took some of the spirit of Moses away
04:09 and put it on the 70 elders,
04:11 and they began to behave as prophets.
04:14 Well,  there’s nothing that indicates Moses
04:16 jealously tried to guard  his authority and privileges.
04:20 He was humble.
04:22 And we all remember the account  where Moses’ father-in-law
04:26 suggested that he delegate  some of his workload to others.
04:31 Moses did not arrogantly resist that.
04:35 He humbly accepted the suggestion.
04:38 And then later,  at the end of his life
04:40 when Jehovah chose his replacement —Joshua—
04:43 Moses humbly accepted that decision.
04:45 He urged the people to follow Joshua’s lead.
04:50 Well,  we could say nothing else
04:52 than Moses was  an excellent example of humility,
04:57 but he was not perfect.
04:59 Please find with me Numbers chapter 20,
05:03 Numbers 20.
05:05 Humble Moses allowed himself  to be provoked
05:08 and perform an act of haughtiness,  or arrogance.
05:12 The situation was that there was no water  for the assembly of Israel,
05:15 and the people began to show  an arrogant, rebellious spirit.
05:21 Please pick up the dialogue with me
05:23 in verse 4 of Numbers chapter 20.
05:28 They said:
05:29 “Why have you brought  Jehovah’s congregation
05:31 “into this wilderness for us  and our livestock to die here?
05:34 “And why have you led us up out of Egypt  to bring us into this evil place?
05:37 “It is no place for seed and figs  and vines and pomegranates,
05:40 and there is no water to drink.”
05:42 Well, they got under Moses’ skin.
05:46 They caused him  to lose his humility momentarily.
05:50 Look at verse 9:
05:53 “So Moses took the rod  from before Jehovah,
05:56 “just as He had commanded him.
05:58 “Then Moses and Aaron  called the congregation together
06:00 “before the crag,  and he said to them:
06:02 “‘Hear, now, you rebels!
06:04 “‘Must we [meaning Aaron and I]
06:07 bring out water for you from this crag?’”
06:10 Well,  that was a haughty, arrogant act.
06:14 Admittedly,  the people were out of line
06:16 with their speech and attitude.
06:18 But Jehovah took note
06:21 of “the spike in the needle”  of the “haughty meter.”
06:25 Look at verse 12:
06:28 “Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron:
06:30 “‘Because you did not show faith in me
06:32 “‘and sanctify me before the eyes  of the people of Israel,
06:35 “‘you will not bring this congregation
06:38 into the land that I will give them.’”
06:41 So although generally Moses’ “needle”
06:43 was always very close to humility,
06:46 Jehovah was displeased
06:49 with this “spike on the needle”  toward haughtiness,
06:52 even though momentary.
06:54 Well, it’s good for us to consider this
06:56 because it’s easy  for us to lose our humility,
07:00 particularly if we are invested  with some authority.
07:03 Maybe we have a new responsibility
07:05 in the congregation,  in the circuit, at the branch.
07:09 Or maybe we have a skill  and talent that we excel in,
07:11 and we get compliments galore.
07:13 Or we’re at odds with a fellow believer.
07:16 Will we maintain our humility?
07:19 There was a great line  in the February 2013 Watchtower.
07:23 It said: “Remember:  In order to be useful to Jehovah,
07:27 our humility  should always exceed our ability.”
07:32 Well, King Saul allowed his ability
07:35 to exceed his humility.
07:37 And at 1 Samuel 15:17
07:40 —he was not to take  any spoils from the land,
07:42 but he allowed that to happen—
07:45 in verse 17,  Samuel confronted him, and he said:
07:48 “Were you not insignificant  [or humble] in your own eyes?”
07:52 And then he said:  ‘Why did you disobey Jehovah?’
07:55 Well,  Saul stammered and stuttered.
07:57 But bottom line,  Jehovah was not pleased
07:59 because in verse 23,  Jehovah said through Samuel:
08:02 ‘Rebelliousness is the same  as the sin of divination,
08:05 ‘and pushing ahead presumptuously  the same as magical power and idolatry.
08:09 You rejected the word of God,  I reject you as king.’
08:15 Well, it’s just as our text said:
08:17 “[Jehovah] opposes the haughty ones.”
08:20 May we all strive to keep  our “needle” close to humility.

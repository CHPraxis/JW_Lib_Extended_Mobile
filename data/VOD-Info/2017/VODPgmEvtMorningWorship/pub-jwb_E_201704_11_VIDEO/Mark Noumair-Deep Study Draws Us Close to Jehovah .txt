00:01 A little deeper study  helps you to draw close to Jehovah.
00:04 The interactions that Jehovah  has with his faithful servants
00:08 —we think about them,  we meditate on them,
00:10 it actually becomes a personal matter.
00:13 Drawing close to God becomes personal,
00:16 and then we can use that  in our circumstances in life.
00:20 If we are dealing with a sickness  or the illness of a mate
00:23 or even with the great tribulation  in the offing,
00:26 how are we going to handle  our relationship with Jehovah?
00:29 How are we going to stay strong?
00:31 Well, we had this beautiful drama
00:34 “O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You,”
00:36 the Hezekiah drama,  that we had for our regional convention.
00:40 Since that is still ringing very clearly  in our minds and hearts,
00:44 let’s open our Bibles  to 2 Kings chapter 19.
00:49 Let’s review a few thoughts  from the life of Hezekiah
00:53 and that time period with Sennacherib —the king of Assyria—
00:57 the attack on Jerusalem  in the year 732 B.C.E.,
01:00 and Isaiah’s words to Hezekiah.
01:03 Again, with the focus of:
01:06 ‘How can I draw close to Jehovah God?
01:09 What can this account  continue to teach me?’
01:11 So chapter 19,  let’s start with verse 6:
01:16 “Isaiah said to them:  ‘This is what you should say to your lord,
01:20 “This is what Jehovah says.”’”
01:22 Now this was to Hezekiah:  “Do not be afraid.”
01:26 Four words, but so powerful.  Why?
01:30 Because positive assurance, Hezekiah,
01:32 that Sennacherib will be defeated.
01:35 ‘Do not be afraid  because I’ve heard all the things
01:39 that Sennacherib has said,  and he’s blasphemed me.’
01:45 “Do not be afraid.”
01:47 Think about that.  It engenders confidence.
01:50 It engenders in us  to approach Jehovah God.
01:53 He wants to help us.  He wanted to help Hezekiah.
01:56 He saw his situation.
01:59 Hezekiah was emerging  as one of the greatest kings of all Israel.
02:02 He was beating the odds.  He had an apostate father.
02:05 And yet, Jehovah had his eye on Hezekiah  and wanted to help him.
02:09 “Do not be afraid.”
02:12 You see, trusting in Jehovah  as Hezekiah did is an act of worship.
02:17 It’s something that gets Jehovah’s blessing.
02:21 When Jehovah tells us  under our circumstances:
02:25 “Do not be afraid.  I will help you.
02:27 I want to help you,”  that helps us to be loyal to him.
02:31 We draw close to him.
02:33 Now when we show loyalty to Jehovah,
02:35 then he acts in loyalty toward us.
02:38 There’s an action; it’s not passive.
02:41 He acts in loyalty toward us.
02:43 He gives us his holy spirit.
02:45 He draws closer to us.
02:47 We feel his support;  we can sense that he has helped us.
02:51 Our personal relationship with Jehovah  becomes more keen, you see.
02:55 And that is because Jehovah  is telling us as our heavenly Father,
02:59 “Do not be afraid.”
03:01 He did that to Hezekiah,  and he does it with us.
03:04 It’s part of drawing close to him.
03:08 Next, Hezekiah senses  what really is important,
03:12 and this is so valuable to you and me.
03:14 Let’s go now to verse 19:
03:18 “But now, O Jehovah our God,
03:21 please save us out of his hand,”
03:23 now that is Sennacherib’s hand,  we know that,
03:26 “so that all the kingdoms  of the earth may know
03:30 that you alone are God, O Jehovah.”
03:34 So “all the kingdoms of the earth,” see,
03:38 Hezekiah was interested in Jehovah’s name
03:41 —the sanctification of that name.
03:44 He was interested  in the reputation of Jehovah God.
03:47 Now, he didn’t talk about himself,
03:50 but he just spoke about Jehovah God.
03:53 And again, that is the lesson  that we can learn.
03:56 If we’re going to draw close to Jehovah,
03:58 we think about his reputation, his name,
04:01 we think about the issue  of universal sovereignty,
04:04 we think about what that Kingdom  is going to do to cleanse the earth.
04:09 Now, I know that oftentimes  we think about our own suffering
04:13 and ‘I need to get into the new world.’
04:16 And we think about the relief  that we’re going to have,
04:19 and that is, of course, important.
04:21 But the core issues —the greater issues—
04:23 are Jehovah’s name,
04:25 proving the Devil a liar,
04:28 our loyalty at this time.
04:31 This is what Jehovah is looking at.  This is the real issue.
04:34 Imagine as the great tribulation approaches
04:37 how delightful,  how exciting, it’s going to be
04:40 as we see even  “the sign of the Son of man.”
04:42 There at Matthew 24:30,
04:45 some supernatural demonstration
04:47 displayed of Christ’s kingly power
04:49 as Jehovah demonstrates His sovereignty.
04:52 “All the kingdoms of the earth”
04:55 must know that Jehovah is God.
04:58 Again, thinking about these things
05:01 really brings our attention  to the important things in life,
05:05 and it helps us  to draw close to Jehovah God.
05:09 Let’s go a little bit further.
05:11 Let’s look at verse 28.
05:13 Now here,
05:16 Sennacherib is going to learn  a big lesson, we know.
05:19 Verse 28: “Because your rage,”
05:21 now, Jehovah is speaking to Sennacherib,  of course, through Isaiah.
05:25 ‘Because your rage against me
05:27 ‘and your roaring  have reached my ears.
05:30 ‘I’m going to put a hook in your nose  and a bridle in your lips,
05:34 ‘and I’m going to lead you back  to the way you came,’
05:37 right back to Nineveh.
05:38 Sennacherib,  you made a big mistake
05:41 by planting yourself in the land  that I gave my people.
05:43 You made a big mistake.  You shouldn’t have done that.
05:45 You’re used to putting hooks
05:47 in the noses of other people  and bridles in their lips.
05:50 Well, I’m going to put a hook in your nose  and drag you right back,
05:52 yank you back to Nineveh.
05:54 This is encouraging.
05:55 This helps us to see exactly  what Jehovah God is going to do
05:59 to this modern-day Assyrian
06:01 as they try to attack us  in the near future.
06:04 Whether it be the modern-day Assyrian  or ‘Gog of Magog,’
06:07 “the king of the north,”  “the kings of the earth,”
06:09 they don’t stand a chance.
06:11 This helps us to draw close  to Jehovah God.
06:16 Now verse 29.
06:19 Imagine this time period as we saw  through that beautiful drama.
06:22 How are they going to eat?  What are they going to eat?
06:25 With the Assyrian invasion,
06:26 it’s not possible  to have a harvest to sow seed.
06:29 What would they do?
06:31 Verse 29:  “And this will be the sign,”
06:36 a miraculous sign,  “for you,” Hezekiah,
06:39 “This year you will eat  what grows on its own.”
06:43 So imagine that!
06:45 Jehovah says: “Don’t worry!
06:47 “From those spilled kernels  from last year,
06:49 “I’m going to have food shoot up
06:52 from the old grain from last year.”
06:55 That is amazing!
06:57 A miraculous provision of food.
06:59 And then notice it goes on, it says:
07:02 “And in the second year
07:05 you will eat grain  that sprouts from that.”
07:07 So again, even the second year,
07:09 but what is even more interesting,
07:12 according to Bible chronology,
07:14 that second year would be  a Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle.
07:19 And the Sabbath year of the Jubilee cycle,
07:21 the faithful Jews would not be able to plant;  they wouldn’t sow seed;
07:25 they would let the land  lay dormant or let it rest.
07:29 And Jehovah said,  “I’m still going to provide for you.”
07:33 And then, of course,  it goes on and says:
07:35 ‘In the third year you can sow seed  and reap a harvest.’
07:40 You see the faith it must have taken
07:43 on the part of these faithful Jews  at that time.
07:46 Would they really trust  that sufficient crops would be available
07:49 for two years in a row  without working their fields?
07:52 How would you have felt?
07:54 Maybe it was going through their minds:
07:57 ‘Well, maybe we should go to Sennacherib.
07:59 ‘He’s offering us food.  He’s offering us survival.
08:02 Maybe we should surrender.’
08:04 This was portrayed  in the drama so beautifully.
08:06 So again, what’s the big point for us?
08:09 Jehovah wants to help us,
08:11 and we draw close to Jehovah God knowing
08:14 that as the great tribulation  even approaches,
08:17 geographical location has no bearing
08:19 on Jehovah rendering assistance  to his people.
08:22 But now is the time:
08:24 As we study these accounts,  we draw close to Jehovah,
08:27 we gain confidence—trusting him,
08:30 being loyal,  knowing that he will loyally support us
08:34 under any circumstances.
08:36 So meditating on these accounts
08:38 should help us to continue  to stay loyal,
08:41 not be afraid  as God’s enemies will not succeed,
08:45 keeping focused  that “all the kingdoms of the earth”
08:48 must know that Jehovah is God
08:50 and that his sovereignty  will be the main issue in the universe,
08:55 and that Jehovah’s fatherly eye is upon us
08:58 as we continue to draw close to God
09:01 and serve him for an eternity.

00:01 Jehovah God has the purpose  of gathering His people
00:06 out of Satan’s world  into His congregation.
00:11 Christ Jesus promised us  that he would be with us
00:16 until the conclusion  of this system of things.
00:19 When we see  this huge organization worldwide,
00:24 we know that Jesus  is fulfilling his promise
00:28 and Jehovah is executing  His purposes in a wonderful way.
00:33 This huge organization  has many services
00:37 or ministries  associated with it.
00:40 It can only be accomplished  by means of Jehovah.
00:44 He is the orchestrator  of this organization.
00:49 The apostle Paul,  here in 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
00:53 explains in great detail
00:56 how Jehovah  organizes His organization.
01:00 If we’d look at verse 14  of 1 Corinthians chapter 12,
01:05 it says:  “Indeed, the body is made up
01:09 not of one member  but of many.”
01:12 So Paul is using the body,  the human body,
01:17 as an analogy  of the organization.
01:21 And it has many members.
01:24 Each individual member  is assigned a ministry.
01:29 Let us read here  verses 4 through 6.
01:32 It says:  “Now there are different gifts,
01:35 “but there is the same spirit;
01:38 “and there are different ministries,
01:40 “and yet there is the same Lord;
01:44 “and there are different activities,
01:47 “and yet it is the same God
01:50 who performs them all in everyone.”
01:54 This reminds us that this organization  does not belong to any man.
01:59 No human is putting it together;
02:01 no human is moving it along.
02:04 It is Jehovah God himself.
02:07 And we are helped  by Paul in this chapter
02:10 to understand  our relationship to one another.
02:14 Let us read here  verses 17 and 19 and 21.
02:19 It says,
1 Corinthians 12:17:
02:23 “If the whole body were an eye,
02:27 “where would the sense of hearing be?
02:29 If it were all hearing,  where would the sense of smell be?”
02:34 Nineteen:  “If they were all the same member,
02:38 where would the body be?”
02:40 And 21:  “The eye cannot say to the hand,
02:45 “‘I do not need you,’
02:47 “or again,  the head cannot say to the feet,
02:50 ‘I do not need you.’”
02:52 We all understand  we need each other.
02:55 We do different operations  or ministries,
02:59 but we need each other  very much.
03:02 And that’s why it says  in verse 20:
03:06 “Now they are many members,  yet one body.”
03:10 We are still one body.
03:13 We belong to the same congregation.
03:16 Now, this brings us  to the text for today in verse 22
03:19 where Paul says:  “On the contrary, the members of the body
03:23 that seem to be weaker are necessary.”
03:26 So “weaker” in this context,  what does it mean?
03:29 It does not refer  that this member is deficient
03:33 or not able  to do their work;
03:35 no, it just means  that this member may be,
03:38 from a physical point of view,  seem weaker.
03:42 Maybe we have an older brother
03:46 suffering with some illness,
03:49 and he cannot do  as much as he used to do.
03:52 Does it mean that  he is not fulfilling his assignment
03:56 or that he does not fit  into God’s arrangement
03:59 or that he  is useless to Jehovah?
04:01 Not at all.
04:02 He may seem to be weaker,
04:06 but we understand  how that works,
04:08 and we appreciate  God’s arrangement.
04:11 Look what it says in verse 23:
04:13 “And the parts of the body
04:15 “that we think to be less honorable
04:18 “we surround with greater honor,
04:21 “so our unseemly parts
04:23 are treated with greater modesty.”
04:26 And this is God’s arrangement.
04:28 Verse 24 says:
04:30 “Whereas our attractive parts  do not need anything.
04:33 “Nevertheless,  God has so composed the body,
04:38 giving greater honor  to the part that had a lack.”
04:45 So there is no division  in the body.
04:48 It cooperates.
04:50 You do not have members  looking down on others
04:54 because of their inability  or limited circumstances.
04:59 That’s why it says in verse 25:
05:02 “So that there should be  no division in the body,
05:05 but its members should have  mutual concern for one another.”
05:13 How does this work?
05:15 How has Jehovah arranged  and orchestrated this organization?
05:19 It’s beautifully described by Paul
05:22 in Ephesians 4:16.
05:27 Now in verse 15 here in Ephesians 4,  Paul says:
05:31 “Let us by love grow up in all things
05:35 into him who is the head, Christ.”
05:39 Christ Jesus is the Head.
05:41 There’s no pyramid structure.
05:44 Christ said:  “Your Leader is one.”
05:47 And then it says, from verse 16,  the first part of verse 16,
05:52 it explains how Jehovah God
05:55 organizes his people.
05:58 It says:  “From him,” from Christ,
06:00 “all the body  is harmoniously joined together
06:05 “and made to cooperate
06:08 through every joint  that gives what is needed.”
06:11 So it is harmoniously joined together.
06:15 It’s like the human hand.
06:17 The fingers are joined by the palm.
06:20 The palm is joined to the wrist.
06:22 There is a harmonious joining together,
06:26 and then it says here,  they are made to cooperate.
06:30 So they have been designed  to fit together,
06:33 to cooperate,  to work together.
06:35 This is what Jehovah God does.
06:37 But then the second part of the verse  shows what we need to do.
06:41 It says we need to give what is needed  and then it says:
06:45 “When each respective member  functions properly,
06:50 “this contributes  to the growth of the body
06:54 as it builds itself up in love.”
06:58 So that is our function —to give what is needed,
07:01 to do what is required.
07:04 Jesus illustrated that  so beautifully for us in John 13.
07:08 Remember the time when  he washed the feet of the disciples.
07:12 We turn there to John 13,
07:16 and if we look
07:22 at verses 12 through 15,
07:24 Jesus explained what he did.
07:27 Then he explains the purpose of this.
07:29 It says:  “When, now, he had washed their feet
07:32 “and had put  his outer garments on,
07:35 “he again reclined at the table  and said to them:
07:39 “‘Do you understand  what I have done to you?
07:43 “‘You address me  as “Teacher” and “Lord,”
07:46 “‘and you are correct,  for I am such.
07:49 “‘Therefore, if I, the Lord and Teacher,  washed your feet,
07:53 “‘you also should wash  the feet of one another.
07:57 “‘For I set the pattern for you,
07:59 that just as I did to you,  you should also do.’”
08:04 So imagine, here is Jesus,  the Head of the congregation,
08:08 he got down on his knees
08:10 and washed the feet of his disciples,
08:14 and then he said
08:17 we must follow that example.
08:21 So, what is the purpose  of this arrangement?
08:24 Each of us fits  into God’s arrangement.
08:28 All of us have a function,  a beautiful function,
08:33 that is to serve one another
08:36 —give what is needed.
08:38 As stated there in Ephesians
08:41 in the final part of verse 16,  as we read:
08:44 “This contributes  to the growth of the body
08:48 as it builds itself up in love.”
08:52 So Jehovah has made  this wonderful arrangement
08:55 of gathering his people together.
08:57 He will take this organization,  this congregation of people,
09:02 through into  the righteous new system of things
09:05 where we will experience  wonderful blessings.
09:09 But right now,  it is our opportunity to cooperate
09:13 and to work together  in love and unity.
09:16 And that way,  whether we are weaker or stronger
09:20 from a physical point of view  does not matter,
09:22 we’re all part of the same body.

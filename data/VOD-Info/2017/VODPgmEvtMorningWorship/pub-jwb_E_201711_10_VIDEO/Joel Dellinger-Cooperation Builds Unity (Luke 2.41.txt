00:01 A key factor that promotes unity
00:04 among Jehovah’s people
00:05 is the fact that we receive
00:07 very clear direction
00:09 and regular reminders.
00:11 Just think about what we receive each month
00:13 from Jehovah’s organization.
00:15 Unfailingly, we receive  a study edition of The Watchtower;
00:19 we receive a public edition  of The Watchtower or Awake! magazine,
00:23 the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook,
00:25 and an hour-long program  on JW Broadcasting.
00:29 Almost daily, we receive new articles,
00:32 news, and legal updates posted to jw.org.
00:37 Are you having a challenge  keeping up with it all?
00:41 How good to have that button  on the home page
00:44 of jw.org that’s entitled “See What’s New.”
00:47 Like a gourmet multicoursed meal,
00:52 these regular provisions  from Jehovah’s organization
00:55 not only delight us  but they keep us alive spiritually
01:00 —energized to move on  in our service to Jehovah.
01:04 What about those of us  who are entrusted with responsibility,
01:08 whether in the congregation  or here at Bethel?
01:11 We are not lacking for clear direction  and regular reminders.
01:16 You might find it interesting to learn
01:18 that during the 2016 calendar year,
01:22 headquarters prepared 80 letters of direction
01:26 that were sent to the brothers in the field
01:29 —such as elders and circuit overseers.
01:31 For the benefit of the branch committees  in 90 branch offices,
01:35 during that same time period,  the six Governing Body committees
01:39 sent out 240 letters to help these brothers
01:43 carry out their work in a unified way.
01:46 And, of course, that’s in addition  to the thousands of letters
01:50 that are sent each month in reply
01:53 to the individual questions  that come from the branches.
01:56 Such clear and timely direction
01:59 is a key factor that contributes  to our unity as Jehovah’s people.
02:04 But for a few minutes,  let’s discuss a second factor
02:07 that strengthens our unity.
02:09 Our commenters all touched on this.
02:12 It’s our personal willingness
02:15 to cooperate with theocratic direction.
02:19 In this regard, I invite you  to open up your Bible
02:21 to Hebrews 13:7.
02:26 Here we’d like to ask the question:
02:28 What type of relationship
02:31 does Jehovah want us to cultivate
02:34 with our overseers,  with the hardworking elders?
02:38 Verse 7 in Hebrews chapter 13 says:
02:41 “Remember those  who are taking the lead among you,
02:45 “who have spoken the word of God to you,
02:47 “and as you contemplate  how their conduct turns out,
02:50 imitate their faith.”
02:52 Let’s focus  on the first action word—remember.
02:57 To remember means to keep in mind
03:00 the good work an elder does.
03:03 Doing so will help us  to cultivate warm feelings
03:07 —feelings of love and appreciation  for the elders.
03:11 A recent study edition  of The Watchtower says
03:13 that the word “remember”  could also be translated “mention.”
03:18 So our heartfelt interest  in the elders taking the lead
03:22 moves us to mention them  in our prayers to Jehovah.
03:27 Think about that relationship
03:29 that God encourages us  to cultivate with our overseers.
03:33 What a contrast that is  to the rebellious, contentious attitude
03:38 that many in the world have  toward those in positions of authority.
03:43 Notice in this same chapter,  Hebrews chapter 13, what verse 17 adds.
03:48 We’re told: “Be obedient
03:51 “to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive,
03:55 “for they are keeping watch over you  as those who will render an account,
03:59 “so that they may do this  with joy and not with sighing,
04:03 for this would be damaging to you.”
04:07 Here we’re admonished  to obey and be submissive.
04:12 Of course, obedience is easier
04:15 when we understand the direction given,
04:17 when it suits our personal preference.
04:20 But what if some theocratic direction  we receive does not make sense,
04:24 takes us by surprise,  or doesn’t suit us personally?
04:29 In such cases, the latter part  of that verse comes into play
04:34 where we’re directed to be submissive.
04:37 Why?
04:39 As the verse highlights,  because in the long run,
04:42 yielding to theocratic direction
04:45 is for our own good.
04:48 Of course, this does not make  following direction easy
04:52 —knowing that it’s for our good.
04:54 To illustrate the challenge we face,
04:57 you might imagine yourself  trekking in the wilderness
05:01 with the Israelites  during that 40-year period.
05:05 Imagine that you and your family  have been walking for some days,
05:09 and all of a sudden,  the pillar of cloud stops.
05:13 You stop; you look around;  you’re obedient to the direction.
05:18 But you do ask yourself,  ‘How long will we be here?
05:22 a day? a week? a few months?’
05:25 You ask yourself, ‘Should we pack, unpack all of our belongings now?’
05:30 So at the beginning, you decide  to unpack just a few things.
05:34 Then a few days go by, you get tired  of hunting through all your belongings,
05:39 so you decide to unpack everything.
05:41 Guess what happens next?
05:43 The pillar of cloud  starts lifting up and moving.
05:46 Now it’s time to start packing.
05:49 Is it easy to follow through  on theocratic direction?
05:52 Not always.
05:54 In this regard, notice how the Israelites  responded to the movements
05:59 of Jehovah through that cloud.
06:02 In Numbers chapter 9,
06:04 please turn your attention to verse 17,
06:08 and then we’ll read verse 22.
06:10 Numbers 9:17 says:
06:13 “Whenever the cloud lifted from the tent,
06:16 “the Israelites would promptly depart,
06:19 “and in the place  where the cloud would remain,
06:21 there is where the Israelites would encamp.”
06:24 Verse 22: “Whether it was two days,  a month, or longer,
06:29 “as long as the cloud  stayed over the tabernacle,
06:33 “the Israelites remained encamped  and would not depart.
06:36 But when it lifted, they would depart.”
06:41 Are you working to cultivate a similar spirit
06:45 toward theocratic direction?
06:48 The Bethel family sets  an outstanding example in this regard.
06:53 When preparing these comments,
06:55 I couldn’t help but think of an overseer  that I worked closely with at Brooklyn Bethel
07:00 who always carried in his pocket  a pen and a notepad.
07:04 As soon as someone asked him  to follow through on something,
07:07 out came the pen and notepad  and he was making a note.
07:11 And in many cases before the day was over,
07:14 he would have followed through  on all those action items.
07:17 The principle of Luke 16:10  was true of this brother:
07:22 “The person faithful in what is least  is faithful also in much.”
07:27 And as a result, it’s obvious  that Jehovah’s organization
07:32 has been able to entrust this brother  with many weighty responsibilities.
07:38 Well, that brother is not unique.
07:41 We have many brothers and sisters  in the worldwide brotherhood
07:45 who demonstrate such an interest  in following through
07:49 on theocratic direction.
07:51 Recently, while visiting  a branch office in Africa,
07:54 the overseer  of the Local Design/Construction Department
07:57 told me that his department meets  for 15 minutes three times a week
08:02 to read out loud a portion  of the LDC department guidelines.
08:06 If you like mnemonics, that’s the DC50.
08:10 Why does he feel that’s necessary?
08:13 As he told me, he has found that a review
08:17 with the entire department,  of the printed direction,
08:19 helps the whole department to be sure  they’re on the same page
08:23 —that they understand the direction clearly.
08:26 The regular review  has also brought to their attention
08:29 points that they may have overlooked  when they first read the guidelines
08:33 or that they now understand even better
08:35 in the light of changing circumstances.
08:38 Again, another heartwarming example
08:42 of willing cooperation  and prompt follow-through.
08:45 Well, what does this teach us today?
08:49 Today, we are being provided  with an abundance
08:53 of clear direction and timely reminders.
08:57 Jehovah is leading us through the elders,
09:01 who are taking the lead among us.
09:03 His presence is as clear to us
09:06 as it was to the Israelites  who were following
09:08 ‘the pillar of cloud by day  and the pillar of fire by night.’
09:12 So as we finish up the final leg
09:15 of our wilderness journey,
09:18 may we all be resolved to cooperate fully
09:21 with any theocratic direction we’re given.

00:01.017 --> 00:04.887
When we think of Acts 1:8, 


00:04.887 --> 00:07.724
we think of this challenging assignment 


00:07.723 --> 00:10.093
that the apostles were given, 


00:10.093 --> 00:13.730
and we can only just imagine 
them thinking about 


00:13.730 --> 00:17.567
the other promise of “power” 
and “holy spirit” being with them. 


00:17.567 --> 00:22.005
They certainly would need that to go 
“to the most distant part of the earth.” 


00:22.005 --> 00:24.540
When we think back 
to the first century, 


00:24.540 --> 00:28.445
we think of ones such as 
the apostle Paul, Barnabas, Timothy, 


00:28.445 --> 00:31.147
and many others 
who literally tried to go 


00:31.147 --> 00:35.085
as far as they could 
to reach various territories.


00:35.085 --> 00:37.453
If we take our Bibles 
and turn to the book 


00:37.453 --> 00:42.458
of Romans 15:23, 24, 


00:42.458 --> 00:45.161
we see summarized here 


00:45.162 --> 00:48.465
the apostle Paul’s viewpoint 
with regard to this. 


00:48.465 --> 00:51.067
Romans 15:23: 


00:51.067 --> 00:55.139
“But now I no longer have 
untouched territory in these regions, 


00:55.138 --> 00:57.473
and for many years 
I have longed to come to you.” 


00:57.473 --> 00:59.475
And that’s the brothers in Rome. 


00:59.475 --> 01:03.580
“Therefore, when I journey to Spain, 
I hope that I will see you.” 


01:03.580 --> 01:08.518
So Paul was very concerned 
about going to untouched territories.


01:08.518 --> 01:10.520
Well, in recent times, 


01:10.520 --> 01:13.188
we can say the same 
is true of Jehovah’s people, 


01:13.188 --> 01:16.860
whether it be the Gilead missionaries 
who have been sent out 


01:16.860 --> 01:18.862
or other missionaries even prior 


01:18.862 --> 01:21.832
to the time of Gilead 
being established. 


01:21.832 --> 01:25.269
Or we think of the brothers 
who have moved to other countries 


01:25.268 --> 01:27.270
to serve where the need is greater 


01:27.270 --> 01:31.107
or perhaps those who 
have gone out to unassigned territories 


01:31.107 --> 01:34.377
or helped in areas 
where very few people 


01:34.377 --> 01:36.880
get the opportunity 
to hear the message. 


01:36.880 --> 01:38.882
When we hear 
those experiences, 


01:38.882 --> 01:42.285
we certainly are encouraged 
by them, aren’t we?


01:42.285 --> 01:44.520
But perhaps we 
could think this morning 


01:44.520 --> 01:48.958
about just one of the aspects 
of the history in the past. 


01:48.958 --> 01:52.961
It’s something referred to 
in the March 2016 Watchtower, 


01:52.962 --> 01:54.964
in the “Questions From Readers.” 


01:54.963 --> 01:56.966
You remember this was discussing 


01:56.967 --> 02:01.104
the valley of dry bones 
in Ezekiel 37. 


02:01.103 --> 02:04.240
It spoke about 
the gradual restoration 


02:04.240 --> 02:06.542
of true worship, 


02:06.542 --> 02:09.479
and it made the comment 
there that in the Scriptures, 


02:09.478 --> 02:12.215
it speaks of a “rattling” noise. 


02:12.215 --> 02:14.217
And The Watchtower 
made this comment, 


02:14.217 --> 02:17.654
it said that even 
prior to the time of the end, 


02:17.653 --> 02:19.788
there were some 
faithful individuals 


02:19.788 --> 02:21.958
who stood up 
in behalf of true worship. 


02:21.958 --> 02:25.595
Then it said: 
“Some of them endeavored to produce Bibles 


02:25.595 --> 02:28.532
in the languages of the common people.”


02:28.532 --> 02:32.835
So let’s just think 
for a few moments about some of those


02:32.835 --> 02:34.937
—perhaps less than 100 years 


02:34.937 --> 02:39.309
before the time that Brother Russell 
started The Watchtower—


02:39.308 --> 02:42.778
and how many 
of those were motivated 


02:42.778 --> 02:45.715
to go to distant parts 
of the earth 


02:45.715 --> 02:49.118
to translate the Bible 
and help others there.


02:49.118 --> 02:52.688
For example, 
in the year 1793, 


02:52.688 --> 02:55.291
a man by the name 
of William Carey 


02:55.292 --> 02:57.960
was a British shoemaker. 


02:57.960 --> 03:02.132
And this shoemaker 
was very impressed with the words 


03:02.132 --> 03:04.734
recorded at Matthew 28:19, 20. 


03:04.733 --> 03:09.471
He felt strongly that all Christians 
should follow that command. 


03:09.472 --> 03:12.142
So his goal was to go to India. 


03:12.142 --> 03:16.545
And he arrived in India 
and faced all sorts of problems


03:16.545 --> 03:19.815
—eventually his wife died, 
his son died as well, 


03:19.815 --> 03:22.818
he had to take 
a job planting indigo. 


03:22.818 --> 03:26.956
But this man, within 21 years, 
with the help of some others, 


03:26.957 --> 03:30.427
was able to translate the Bible, 
well, parts of it, 


03:30.427 --> 03:33.897
in 36 languages.


03:33.897 --> 03:37.034
Then in 1797, 


03:37.033 --> 03:39.201
another man, 
Henry Nott, 


03:39.202 --> 03:43.405
from England 
was a bricklayer. 


03:43.405 --> 03:47.577
And he and quite a number 
of others arrived in Tahiti. 


03:47.577 --> 03:50.447
Now, four of those on that ship 


03:50.447 --> 03:53.049
were noted to be pastors, 


03:53.048 --> 03:56.418
but they had 
no formal training whatsoever. 


03:56.418 --> 04:00.290
Henry Nott hadn’t had 
a very good education. 


04:00.290 --> 04:04.127
He was a bricklayer; 
he just had the basic education. 


04:04.127 --> 04:06.695
But this very faithful man 


04:06.695 --> 04:09.498
decided to learn Hebrew and Greek 


04:09.498 --> 04:12.135
and translate the Bible into Tahitian. 


04:12.135 --> 04:14.537
And he learned Tahitian very quickly, 


04:14.537 --> 04:18.675
and in 1835, 
after 30 years of translating, 


04:18.675 --> 04:21.210
it says that he put down his quill 


04:21.210 --> 04:25.615
and the Tahitian Bible, which, 
incidentally, uses Jehovah’s name 


04:25.615 --> 04:29.352
in both the Hebrew 
and the Greek sections of the Bible.


04:29.352 --> 04:33.122
Then 1807, 
Robert Morrison


04:33.122 --> 04:37.594
—a man who was determined 
to translate the Bible into Chinese. 


04:37.593 --> 04:39.728
He arrived in China to find out 


04:39.728 --> 04:42.265
that if anyone 
taught a foreigner Chinese, 


04:42.265 --> 04:44.333
there was a death penalty. 


04:44.333 --> 04:46.835
So he remained indoors 
for a couple of years 


04:46.835 --> 04:49.572
while he learned 
the Chinese language. 


04:49.572 --> 04:52.975
And then when he 
started to translate the Bible, 


04:52.975 --> 04:56.812
he found out the emperor 
had stated there would be a death penalty 


04:56.812 --> 05:01.317
for anyone who printed 
Christian literature in that country. 


05:01.317 --> 05:03.854
Well, in 1819, 


05:03.853 --> 05:08.523
Morrison completed 
his version there of the Bible.


05:08.523 --> 05:12.428
In 1812, 
Judson, an American, 


05:12.428 --> 05:15.598
along with his wife, 
left America 


05:15.598 --> 05:18.466
just after two weeks 
of marriage and, 


05:18.467 --> 05:21.470
in 1813, 
arrived in Burma, 


05:21.470 --> 05:23.773
which is now known 
as Myanmar. 


05:23.773 --> 05:26.708
And his determination 
was to translate 


05:26.708 --> 05:29.811
the Bible into the local language, 
which was very hard there. 


05:29.812 --> 05:31.814
There was no dictionary; 


05:31.813 --> 05:34.616
there was no one 
that could actually teach him, 


05:34.617 --> 05:38.120
and yet he set 
to learning the language. 


05:38.120 --> 05:41.423
He had a period of time 
where he was in prison 


05:41.423 --> 05:45.728
with three pairs of iron fetters 
attached to his body. 


05:45.728 --> 05:48.463
And he was very concerned 


05:48.463 --> 05:50.966
about his Bible manuscript 
that he’d been translating, 


05:50.967 --> 05:53.602
which was hidden 
in the earth under his home. 


05:53.602 --> 05:56.772
His wife eventually brought it 
to him in prison. 


05:56.772 --> 05:58.842
It was hidden in a pillow. 


05:58.842 --> 06:02.279
Well, this man, 
by 1835, 


06:02.278 --> 06:06.448
had the Bible translated 
into the local language there.


06:06.448 --> 06:09.485
But not all of these 
were white missionaries 


06:09.485 --> 06:12.488
from either America or England. 


06:12.488 --> 06:16.158
When the message 
reached the Pacific, for example, 


06:16.158 --> 06:19.228
many local persons
—Polynesians—


06:19.228 --> 06:23.298
were very determined to go 
to other islands within the Pacific 


06:23.298 --> 06:25.333
to spread the message. 


06:25.333 --> 06:28.170
An example of this is in 1823. 


06:28.170 --> 06:31.340
A man, 
a Polynesian by the name of Papeiha, 


06:31.340 --> 06:35.945
was determined to get 
the message in Rarotonga, 


06:35.945 --> 06:37.947
in the Cook Islands. 


06:37.947 --> 06:40.484
So the mission ship arrived there; 


06:40.483 --> 06:44.220
the two missionary couples 
from overseas, 


06:44.220 --> 06:47.157
white missionaries, 
were put ashore. 


06:47.157 --> 06:50.025
There was a misunderstanding 
with a drunken king, 


06:50.025 --> 06:52.528
which resulted in them 
being beaten up, 


06:52.528 --> 06:54.596
all their possessions 
being stolen, 


06:54.597 --> 06:57.600
and them fleeing back 
to the ship. 


06:57.600 --> 07:01.003
But Papeiha was determined 


07:01.003 --> 07:04.573
to take the Gospel message 
to those islanders. 


07:04.573 --> 07:08.210
So it’s reported that he said 
that he would swim ashore 


07:08.210 --> 07:10.212
and that he called out: 


07:10.212 --> 07:12.215
“Ko Jehova toku tiaki! 


07:12.215 --> 07:14.217
Tei roto au i tona rima!” 


07:14.217 --> 07:16.219
which translated means 


07:16.218 --> 07:18.220
“Jehovah is my shepherd! 


07:18.220 --> 07:20.222
I am in His hand!” 


07:20.222 --> 07:22.925
And holding a book 
with some translations 


07:22.925 --> 07:24.927
of the Bible in Tahitian, 


07:24.927 --> 07:27.130
he jumped overboard, 
swam ashore, 


07:27.130 --> 07:29.965
and started preaching 
to the local people.


07:29.965 --> 07:33.870
Well, you can’t help 
but admire that enthusiasm. 


07:33.870 --> 07:36.505
The conditions 
that these missionaries met 


07:36.505 --> 07:40.342
were very, very difficult, 
very primitive conditions. 


07:40.342 --> 07:43.512
In one country, 
the missionaries lived in villages 


07:43.512 --> 07:47.684
where people 
still practiced cannibalism and, 


07:47.683 --> 07:50.285
in many cases, 
when the chief died, 


07:50.285 --> 07:54.623
all his wives were executed 
at that point and buried with him. 


07:54.623 --> 07:57.293
So in the midst 
of these conditions, 


07:57.293 --> 08:01.230
these men translated 
the Bible and, in many cases, 


08:01.230 --> 08:03.900
used Jehovah’s name 
not only in the Bible 


08:03.900 --> 08:06.568
but in their personal writings.


08:06.568 --> 08:08.905
What kept them going? 


08:08.905 --> 08:12.575
What helped them to go 
to these distant parts of the earth? 


08:12.575 --> 08:16.112
Well, a book on the history 
of the missionary work in the Pacific 


08:16.112 --> 08:18.114
makes this interesting comment. 


08:18.113 --> 08:21.783
It says: 
“Strong faith in Jehovah 


08:21.783 --> 08:25.688
often overcame fear and despair.” 


08:25.688 --> 08:27.690
What an interesting thought. 


08:27.690 --> 08:30.225
Well, the obvious question is, 


08:30.225 --> 08:32.728
Were these ones anointed? 


08:32.728 --> 08:34.796
The answer obviously is, 


08:34.797 --> 08:36.799
We don’t know. 


08:36.798 --> 08:40.035
But we do know 
that Jesus said in Matthew 13 


08:40.035 --> 08:43.172
there would be 
wheatlike “sons of the Kingdom” 


08:43.172 --> 08:45.174
right down through history. 


08:45.173 --> 08:47.476
And if some of them 
were involved with this type of work, 


08:47.477 --> 08:49.645
I’m sure we wouldn’t be surprised. 


08:49.645 --> 08:52.615
And in the future, 
we will no doubt find out 


08:52.615 --> 08:55.183
if they were involved 
with that work or not.


08:55.183 --> 08:57.686
But what about us today? 


08:57.687 --> 09:00.857
Well, does it mean we 
have to all leave our Bethel homes now 


09:00.857 --> 09:03.225
and go to the most distant parts 
of the earth? 


09:03.225 --> 09:05.227
Well, remember, 
in Acts 1:8, 


09:05.227 --> 09:08.497
Jesus was speaking to people 
there in Jerusalem, 


09:08.497 --> 09:10.834
and you may already be living 


09:10.833 --> 09:13.168
in one of the most distant parts 
of the earth 


09:13.168 --> 09:16.005
when you view it 
from Jerusalem’s viewpoint. 


09:16.005 --> 09:19.742
But the main thing is, 
wherever we are


09:19.742 --> 09:22.345
—if we can reach out 
and go somewhere else 


09:22.345 --> 09:25.280
or whether we can preach 
within our own territory—


09:25.280 --> 09:28.583
if we follow the example 
of these faithful ones, 


09:28.583 --> 09:31.820
we’ll be sure to try 
and reach out to persons 


09:31.820 --> 09:34.623
who have not had 
the opportunity to hear the truth, 


09:34.623 --> 09:42.815
whether near or far.

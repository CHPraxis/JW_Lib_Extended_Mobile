00:01 When Paul wrote the letter to the Colossians,
00:04 it was in the year 60-61 C.E.,
00:07 just similar to the time  that he wrote Ephesians,
00:11 which we talked about yesterday.
00:13 And he wrote for similar reasons
00:15 —to protect his brothers  from the immoral environment
00:18 that was around them and to encourage them
00:20 to fight against the weaknesses of the flesh.
00:24 So let’s open our Bibles  to Colossians chapter 3,
00:27 and we’ll read verse 5 in its entirety.
00:30 Colossians 3:5:
00:33 “Deaden, therefore, your body members
00:35 “that are on the earth  as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness,
00:40 “uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire,
00:44 and greediness, which is idolatry.”
00:49 And we’ve been told  that these expressions
00:53 convey the idea  of totally wiping out these desires.
00:57 When we sense them  coming up in our heart and mind,
01:00 we slay them;  we wipe them out.
01:03 And it’s very important  because to fail to do that
01:07 puts us into all sorts  of difficulties with Jehovah
01:11 and with others  and causes problems for ourselves.
01:16 Look at verse 6:
01:18 “On account of those things  the wrath of God is coming.”
01:22 So it affects our everlasting future  as well, doesn’t it?
01:25 One thing that is highlighted here
01:28 is how serious these desires can become.
01:31 They get bound up with greediness,
01:34 covetousness, which is idolatry.
01:38 And covetousness has been described
01:41 as something that is insatiable.
01:44 It’s always after something  that it should not have
01:47 or it does not have the right to have.
01:49 It’s ruthless and self-seeking;  it has been defined as that.
01:53 And a covetous person,  or a greedy person,
01:57 makes the object of his desire so strong
02:00 that in essence it can become his god.
02:04 And that reminds us of the inspired words
02:07 at Philippians 3:18, 19,
02:09 where Paul used a similar expression
02:12 about those who used to be with him  in the truth but no longer were,
02:16 and he was very sad about that.
02:19 And what happened to them?
02:21 Well,  “their god [became] their belly,”
02:24 and their desires overwhelmed  even their love for Jehovah.
02:29 And it was back in 1978
02:32 that The Watchtower,  in the April 1 issue,
02:36 said this about this quality of greed
02:40 —covetousness— and idolatry.
02:42 It said this:
02:44 ‘If we become aware of a wrong desire
02:46 ‘building up within ourselves,
02:49 ‘we do well to call to mind
02:51 ‘how precious  our relationship with God is
02:54 ‘and how senseless  it would be to forfeit this
02:57 by making oneself an idolater.’
03:01 So that’s a very serious thought, isn’t it?
03:03 That a person  could actually start worshipping something
03:07 other than Jehovah.
03:10 And that was a very serious sin
03:14 even in ancient Israel, wasn’t it,  this matter of idolatry?
03:17 It carried the death penalty.
03:20 But, you know, another aspect  of the Ten Commandments
03:23 that carried the death penalty
03:25 was adultery.
03:28 So, what is the similarity
03:31 between idolatry and the death penalty
03:34 and adultery and the death penalty?
03:37 Well, worshipping an idol,
03:40 a person would break  his covenant with Jehovah.
03:43 And committing adultery,
03:46 he would break  his covenant with his spouse.
03:49 So why would Jehovah  feel so strongly about that?
03:52 Well, let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 33,
03:55 and we’ll look at the kind of person
03:59 Jehovah is when it comes to his word
04:02 and what he says.
04:05 Psalm 33, let’s read verse 4:
04:08 “For the word of Jehovah is upright,
04:12 and everything he does is trustworthy.”
04:16 And then look at verse 9:
04:19 “For he spoke, and it came to be;
04:22 he commanded, and it stood firm.”
04:25 So the psalmist is saying,
04:27 “When Jehovah says something, he means it.”
04:31 And so when a person says to Jehovah,
04:33 “I’m going to worship you exclusively”  and he doesn’t,
04:36 it’s treachery.
04:39 It’s unlike God, Jehovah.
04:41 It’s like the Devil,  who is a liar and untrustworthy.
04:46 So it adds weight, doesn’t it,
04:48 to our desire never to fall victim
04:51 to idolatry in any form?
04:55 Now, our comments in The Watchtower
04:58 (which we’ll read a little bit later today  in the actual printed comment)
05:03 do focus on this matter of marriage
05:06 and adultery and avoiding that,  of course.
05:10 And what we’d like to do now  is just take a few moments
05:14 and highlight some dangers
05:17 that could come up for married people
05:21 and see how that applies
05:24 to deadening, or slaying,  those desires
05:29 right from the very beginning
05:31 so that they do not flourish  and cause a problem.
05:34 One of the principles  that we can think about is Proverbs 22:3.
05:39 We see “the danger,” and we turn aside.
05:43 So, what are some things  that we could see as a danger,
05:47 identify them, and slay them  before they become a problem?
05:52 Well, obviously, what we look at,
05:55 listen to, and read
05:58 fills our mind with either good or bad,
06:01 so we avoid intake of bad things.
06:04 It only fuels bad desires.
06:08 But research has shown  and our publications have often commented
06:13 that when a person gets involved in adultery,
06:17 it isn’t always just a sexual greed,
06:22 or the sexual desire,
06:24 that motivates him  to go down that path in the first place
06:28 or her to go down  that path the first time.
06:32 Well, what is it?
06:34 Well, what is the fundamental function  of marriage?
06:38 It has often been said
06:40 that the fundamental function of marriage
06:43 is receiving and giving emotional support.
06:49 It’s a relationship  where a person feels loved,
06:53 appreciated, wanted,  and needed in a very special way.
06:58 And when a person begins  to feel that that is missing,
07:02 then they begin looking for someone  who can give them that
07:06 —not necessarily right away  sexual gratification.
07:11 And that’s why
07:13 the Awake! of January 8, ʹ86 Awake! said
07:19 that being a good listener  “has the capacity
07:22 “for making the other person feel  that he is especially valued
07:26 and what he is saying  is of concern and significance” to him.
07:31 So it’s this relationship  that needs to be guarded
07:34 —the friendship.
07:36 And the 1994 Watchtower of July 15
07:40 added weight to this comment
07:42 when it quoted a divorce attorney,  of all people.
07:46 And he said what was  the single biggest reason couples break up.
07:51 And this is what he said,  it was quoted in the magazine:
07:54 “The inability  to talk honestly with each other,
07:57 bare their souls  and treat each other as their best friend.”
08:01 That’s the main reason.
08:03 That can often lead  to other physical contact.
08:07 But it often is not  the one that gets it started.
08:12 So now, what can we do to avoid that?
08:15 Well, we want to treasure our relationships.
08:18 And it reminds us  of an experience that was given
08:20 in the August 15, 2012, Watchtower,
08:24 about an elder and pioneer named Daniel
08:28 and his wife, also pioneering.
08:31 He was very involved in the congregation
08:33 —always took on assignments.
08:36 He had three Bible students —men—
08:38 who got baptized,  but they needed a lot of help;
08:40 they were newly baptized.
08:42 He was busy with other assignments.
08:44 His wife spent a lot of time  with these newly baptized brothers.
08:49 He was neglecting his wife.
08:51 She bonded emotionally  with one of these brothers;
08:54 adultery was committed.
08:57 But Daniel said he bore  a heavy responsibility in that respect.
09:03 In fact,  at the end of the lessons learned,
09:06 he said this:
09:08 “There is much more to life  than struggling to care for privileges
09:11 to the detriment of your own family.”
09:14 So a need for balance.
09:17 Pursuing Kingdom interests, of course
09:20 —and an understanding wife or husband  can understand and support that—
09:24 but there is a balance.
09:26 And if it oversteps itself,  then real problems can result.
09:32 So we want to do all we can
09:34 to slay desires  when we sense them in ourselves.
09:38 And it’s going to take earnest effort;
09:41 it’s going to take endurance
09:43 because as long as we’re  in this imperfect state,
09:46 no one can say,  “I am immune to any of those desires
09:50 that could crop up at different times.”
09:52 So our love for Jehovah,  our love for our mates,
09:55 our love for our brothers  prevents us
09:57 from going down  the path of greediness and idolatry,
10:00 which only results in harm.
10:03 How grateful we are to be with brothers  and sisters like you who love Jehovah,
10:08 love their marriage mates,  love the brotherhood,
10:10 and do all they can  to stay morally clean!
10:13 Keep it up with Jehovah’s help.

00:01.583 --> 00:04.686
Our text is focusing 
on the powerful effect 


00:04.687 --> 00:06.857
that prayer can have on us 


00:06.857 --> 00:09.759
when it is true prayer, 


00:09.758 --> 00:12.295
genuine prayer. 


00:12.295 --> 00:15.065
Mere communication with God 


00:15.065 --> 00:18.200
is not necessarily prayer. 


00:18.200 --> 00:21.270
In Genesis 
chapters 3 and 4, 


00:21.270 --> 00:23.305
after Adam had sinned, 


00:23.305 --> 00:25.775
he had dialogue with Jehovah, 


00:25.775 --> 00:28.010
but it could hardly 
be viewed as prayer. 


00:28.010 --> 00:29.612
Why? 


00:29.612 --> 00:32.349
Because prayer involves trust, 


00:32.348 --> 00:37.186
respect, humility, devotion, 


00:37.187 --> 00:39.255
and a sense of dependence 


00:39.255 --> 00:41.925
on the one to whom 
the prayer is directed.


00:41.925 --> 00:45.528
Now, just to highlight 
the importance of trust 


00:45.528 --> 00:48.398
and prayer’s effectiveness, 


00:48.398 --> 00:51.366
let’s open our Bibles 
to Psalm 91, 


00:51.367 --> 00:54.937
and we’ll see the important quality 
of trust highlighted. 


00:54.937 --> 00:58.000
Psalm 91, 
we’ll read verses 1 and 2. 


01:00.543 --> 01:04.313
“Anyone dwelling in the secret place 
of the Most High 


01:04.313 --> 01:07.483
will lodge under the shadow 
of the Almighty.” 


01:07.483 --> 01:10.386
Well, we notice “the secret place,” 


01:10.387 --> 01:13.355
a place of spiritual security 


01:13.355 --> 01:17.893
where no one or no thing 
can rob us of our faith in Jehovah 


01:17.893 --> 01:19.895
or our love for Jehovah. 


01:19.895 --> 01:23.365
And it’s secret because unbelievers 
can’t understand it. 


01:23.365 --> 01:26.502
But now, 
how do we get there? 


01:26.502 --> 01:30.774
Verse 2: 
“I will say to Jehovah: 


01:30.773 --> 01:35.411
‘You are my refuge 
and my stronghold, 


01:35.412 --> 01:39.049
my God in whom I trust.’” 


01:39.048 --> 01:43.351
So the key of getting 
into the secret place, 


01:43.352 --> 01:46.222
the key to getting 
the peace of God, 


01:46.222 --> 01:50.560
is this humility 
and trust in Jehovah. 


01:50.560 --> 01:52.562
And we notice 
the expression here: 


01:52.562 --> 01:55.232
“You are my refuge 
and my stronghold.” 


01:55.232 --> 01:58.400
In this context, not ours
—while it’s true—


01:58.400 --> 02:00.068
but it has to be personal. 


02:00.068 --> 02:03.573
And that’s the trust 
that we have on an individual basis.


02:03.573 --> 02:07.343
And how grateful we are 
that we have Jehovah’s listening ear, 


02:07.343 --> 02:09.445
and he hears us 


02:09.445 --> 02:11.580
because of something 
that David said. 


02:11.580 --> 02:14.917
We go to Psalm 69 this time, 


02:14.917 --> 02:17.587
and as we turn here, 
we’d like to ask you to think, 


02:17.587 --> 02:21.390
“Have you ever felt, 
to a reasonable degree, 


02:21.390 --> 02:25.162
the same way that David 
expresses himself here?” 


02:25.162 --> 02:29.532
He’s going through 
a very stressful time, overwhelmed, 


02:29.532 --> 02:33.737
and in verse 20 of Psalm 69, 
he says:


02:33.737 --> 02:36.272
“Reproach has broken my heart, 


02:36.272 --> 02:39.375
“and the wound is incurable. 


02:39.375 --> 02:43.012
“I was hoping for sympathy, 
but there was none,


02:43.012 --> 02:47.450
and for comforters, 
but I found none.” 


02:47.450 --> 02:51.587
So at times, 
our fellow believers


02:51.587 --> 02:55.192
—our family members even, 
close friends—


02:55.192 --> 02:57.527
they may not be able to help us 


02:57.527 --> 02:59.529
the way we need to be helped. 


02:59.528 --> 03:01.530
And why is that? 


03:01.530 --> 03:04.900
Well, for one thing, they may be 
very busy dealing with their own problems, 


03:04.900 --> 03:07.537
and they don’t have 
the time to really notice. 


03:07.537 --> 03:09.772
Or the other factor is 


03:09.772 --> 03:13.342
that we all have things that differ 
when it comes to causing us stress. 


03:13.342 --> 03:17.647
What is a real stress for one person 
is not so hard for another. 


03:17.647 --> 03:20.317
And if they look on 
and see someone 


03:20.317 --> 03:22.985
going through something 
that they find easy, 


03:22.985 --> 03:25.322
perhaps the sympathy will be lacking.


03:25.322 --> 03:29.459
But, nonetheless, 
verse 33 of this same Psalm says:


03:29.458 --> 03:32.495
“For Jehovah 
is listening to the poor, 


03:32.495 --> 03:36.132
and he will not despise 
his captive people.” 


03:36.132 --> 03:40.370
Now, in principle, 
sometimes we may feel captive 


03:40.370 --> 03:42.472
to our circumstances 


03:42.472 --> 03:44.574
or to the feelings 
that we’re experiencing, 


03:44.573 --> 03:46.875
to our emotions, 
to what we are going through


03:46.875 --> 03:48.878
—we feel trapped. 


03:48.878 --> 03:51.446
Other people may not understand 


03:51.447 --> 03:53.515
or may not be able to help us. 


03:53.515 --> 03:56.152
But notice the reassurance 


03:56.152 --> 04:01.090
in 2 Chronicles 6:29, 30. 


04:01.090 --> 04:03.458
This is the prayer of Solomon 


04:03.458 --> 04:05.828
at the time 
of the dedication of the temple. 


04:05.828 --> 04:10.500
And in 2 Chronicles 6:29 
he says: 


04:10.500 --> 04:12.602
“Whatever request for favor 


04:12.602 --> 04:14.604
“may be made by any man 


04:14.603 --> 04:17.173
“or by all your people Israel 


04:17.173 --> 04:19.308
“(for each one knows 


04:19.308 --> 04:23.311
“his own plague and his own pain)


04:23.312 --> 04:26.049
when they spread out 
their hands toward this house,” 


04:26.048 --> 04:28.050
so we’re unique. 


04:28.050 --> 04:29.852
Other people may not be able to do it. 


04:29.852 --> 04:31.454
Why? 
Verse 30: 


04:31.453 --> 04:33.455
“Then may you hear
from the heavens, 


04:33.455 --> 04:35.858
“your dwelling place, 
and may you forgive; 


04:35.858 --> 04:38.995
“and reward each one 
according to all his ways, 


04:38.995 --> 04:41.063
“for you know his heart 


04:41.063 --> 04:44.900
“(you alone truly know 


04:44.900 --> 04:46.970
the human heart).” 


04:46.970 --> 04:49.572
So even if our friends care, 


04:49.572 --> 04:51.940
even if they want to be helpful, 


04:51.940 --> 04:56.045
they cannot possibly see 
the depth of what we’re feeling 


04:56.045 --> 04:59.448
or what we’re thinking 
or how it’s affecting us, 


04:59.448 --> 05:01.650
but Jehovah does. 


05:01.650 --> 05:04.253
He sees right 
to the heart of the matter, 


05:04.253 --> 05:06.888
and how reassuring that is. 


05:06.888 --> 05:10.000
So we trust him 
because he really knows us.


05:12.128 --> 05:15.000
But there’s something else 
involved in this trust. 


05:16.365 --> 05:18.668
Matthew 6:33 says: 


05:18.668 --> 05:22.605
“Keep on, then, seeking first 
the Kingdom and his righteousness, 


05:22.605 --> 05:26.075
and all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


05:26.075 --> 05:28.945
Now, there’s personal trust


05:28.945 --> 05:32.248
—trust that Jehovah 
knows what I need 


05:32.248 --> 05:37.520
and that he’s going to, 
as he always has, provide it. 


05:37.520 --> 05:39.000
But there can be a pitfall. 


05:40.557 --> 05:44.860
If a person 
is naturally calm, confident, 


05:44.860 --> 05:49.798
perhaps has a natural ability, 
family history that’s rich


05:49.798 --> 05:54.203
—both emotionally, 
maybe even financially—


05:54.203 --> 05:57.673
all of these things 
can make a person begin to feel, 


05:57.673 --> 06:02.845
‘Yes, I trust in Jehovah, 
but I can do this myself.’ 


06:02.845 --> 06:05.080
You know, sometimes 
we may hear this expression 


06:05.080 --> 06:07.317
when we hear of someone 


06:07.317 --> 06:10.052
that’s being transitioned 
from one form of special service, 


06:10.052 --> 06:12.055
perhaps into 
the regular pioneer work 


06:12.055 --> 06:14.123
or they have to leave Bethel 
for good reasons, 


06:14.123 --> 06:18.193
and they have to go back 
and get some secular work. 


06:18.193 --> 06:20.463
Have you ever heard this? 


06:20.463 --> 06:22.665
“They’re going to do fine 


06:22.665 --> 06:26.235
because they have marketable skills.” 


06:26.235 --> 06:28.237
Now, 
that’s a good thing. 


06:28.237 --> 06:30.407
Perhaps those marketable skills 
have been developed 


06:30.407 --> 06:32.775
in pursuing Kingdom interests, 
and that’s fine. 


06:32.775 --> 06:35.277
But we have to be careful. 


06:35.277 --> 06:39.682
Will they be fine 
because of their skills 


06:39.682 --> 06:44.020
or because of their continuing 
to seek first the Kingdom 


06:44.020 --> 06:48.290
and they let Jehovah 
be the one that provides for them? 


06:48.290 --> 06:51.460
And we’ll have to be careful too 
when we use that expression


06:51.460 --> 06:54.197
“They’ll have no problem; 
they have marketable skills.” 


06:54.197 --> 06:56.299
What if someone doesn’t? 


06:56.298 --> 06:59.135
Well, Jehovah 
takes care of them too. 


06:59.135 --> 07:02.772
Amos 7:14, 15, 
Amos said: 


07:02.772 --> 07:05.742
‘I wasn’t a prophet 
or the son of a prophet. 


07:05.742 --> 07:10.780
I was a nipper of figs, 
a very lowly herdsman, shepherd.’ 


07:10.780 --> 07:14.383
But Jehovah took him, 
used him, and provided for him. 


07:14.383 --> 07:18.653
So marketable skills 
were not the key factor. 


07:18.653 --> 07:21.456
And so we keep that 
in its proper perspective.


07:21.457 --> 07:25.327
And finally, 
in imitation of Jehovah, 


07:25.327 --> 07:27.330
when we try to help people, 


07:27.330 --> 07:30.700
we want to use the most powerful tool 
we have to encourage them


07:30.700 --> 07:33.202
and to help them deal 
with their anxiety. 


07:33.202 --> 07:37.072
There was an experience 
in the February 15, 1988, Watchtower 


07:37.072 --> 07:39.275
about Brother Arthur Winkler. 


07:39.275 --> 07:42.378
Now, 
the Gestapo found him, 


07:42.378 --> 07:45.380
and they beat him 
without mercy, 


07:45.380 --> 07:48.852
knocked out his teeth, 
dislocated his jaw. 


07:48.852 --> 07:51.220
His whole body 
was raw from the beating, 


07:51.220 --> 07:53.588
and they threw him in a dark cell. 


07:53.588 --> 07:56.758
At that moment, 
Brother Winkler said, 


07:56.758 --> 08:00.028
“I was in desperate need 
of spiritual food, 


08:00.028 --> 08:02.465
and I prayed to Jehovah.” 


08:02.465 --> 08:06.035
And then he talked to the guard 
and asked him to help him. 


08:06.035 --> 08:09.872
The cell door opened 
and a Bible was thrown in, 


08:09.872 --> 08:11.907
and he said: 


08:11.907 --> 08:15.010
“That daily enjoyment 
of those pleasant words of truth 


08:15.010 --> 08:17.045
“were precious. 


08:17.045 --> 08:20.315
I felt myself 
getting stronger spiritually.” 


08:20.315 --> 08:23.352
So, then, 
when we go to help people, 


08:23.352 --> 08:26.455
the best thing we can do 
in helping them cope is, 


08:26.455 --> 08:29.192
not with some 
often-used phrase 


08:29.192 --> 08:32.662
or something that is 
repeatable all the time, 


08:32.662 --> 08:35.865
but make sure it is the Bible. 


08:35.865 --> 08:39.968
They may feel captive, 
imprisoned by their situation. 


08:39.968 --> 08:42.136
But an account from the Bible


08:42.137 --> 08:44.174
—an account of a Bible character 


08:44.173 --> 08:46.608
that had gone through tough times 
and came through—


08:46.608 --> 08:50.311
those are the most meaningful things 
to deal with it. 


08:50.312 --> 08:54.984
Perhaps 
2 Corinthians 11:23-31, 


08:54.983 --> 08:58.353
where Paul reviewed
all of those things that he went through, 


08:58.353 --> 09:01.256
and yet years later, 
he wrote our day’s text for today, 


09:01.257 --> 09:04.794
saying Jehovah helped him 
stay calm and assisted him.


09:04.793 --> 09:06.928
So may these reminders 
from the Scriptures 


09:06.928 --> 09:17.123
help us to cope and help others 
to cope with anxieties.

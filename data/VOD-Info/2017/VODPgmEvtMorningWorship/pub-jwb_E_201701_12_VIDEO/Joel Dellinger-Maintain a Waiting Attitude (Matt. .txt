00:01 The text and comment in today’s  Examining the Scriptures Daily
00:05 was taken from a  Watchtower study article with the theme
00:08 “How Can We Maintain ‘a Waiting Attitude’?”
00:11 That’s a timely question  for all of us to ponder
00:14 because as that Watchtower said:
00:16 “Impatience can be dangerous,
00:19 for it can cause us to behave rashly.”
00:22 What’s the antidote to impatience?
00:26 Open, please,  your Bible to the theme text
00:28 for that Watchtower study  at Micah 7:7,
00:32 and let’s read Micah 7:7 together
00:35 and consider for a few moments  how Micah’s good example
00:39 can help us to maintain a waiting attitude.
00:43 That text reads:
00:45 “But as for me,  I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.
00:50 I will show a waiting attitude.”
00:53 Or as the footnote says:  “I will wait patiently
00:56 “for the God of my salvation.
00:58 My God will hear me.”
01:01 It’s beautiful  that in just that one verse,
01:03 three times Micah refers  to his God—our God—Jehovah.
01:08 And that’s a nice reminder  that no matter what the situation is
01:11 that may cause us to have feelings  of impatience or frustration,
01:15 whenever we put a problem  or difficulty side by side
01:19 with our God, Jehovah,  what happens to the situation?
01:24 It appears smaller —manageable with his help.
01:28 We might conclude, as did Brother Karl Klein  as published in his life story,
01:33 that ‘if Jehovah permits it,  we can take it.’
01:37 With Jehovah’s help, we can patiently endure
01:40 any trial, circumstance, or situation
01:44 as long as necessary without losing our joy.
01:49 Micah was confident of that.
01:51 Look again at chapter 7 and verse 7.
01:54 By saying that he would  “keep on the lookout for Jehovah,”
01:58 in effect, Micah was saying  that he was determined
02:02 to become like  an active sentry on a watchtower.
02:06 So let’s try to picture that:
02:09 A wide-eyed watchman on high alert.
02:14 That was Micah, spiritually speaking.
02:17 He was determined not to get impatient
02:20 and not to get frustrated  with things that he could not change.
02:24 Was it easy for Micah  to maintain a waiting attitude?
02:28 Probably not.
02:30 Notice the context that reveals  what circumstances were like
02:34 in Israel and in Judah  in Micah’s time.
02:37 Notice as you consider  some of the thoughts there
02:41 beginning in verse 2  of Micah chapter 7.
02:44 He says: “The loyal one  has perished from the earth.”
02:48 Verse 3: “Their hands  are expert at doing what is bad.”
02:53 Verse 4: “Their best one is like thorns,
02:57 their most upright one  is worse than a thorn hedge.”
03:01 In fact, in verse 5, he says:
03:03 “Do not put faith in your companion  or trust a close friend.
03:07 Guard what you say to the one  who lies in your embrace.”
03:10 Verse 6: “For a son despises his father,
03:14 “a daughter rises up against her mother,
03:16 “and a daughter-in-law  is against her mother-in-law;
03:19 a man’s enemies  are the men of his household.”
03:23 Yes, times were difficult  when Micah was alive.
03:27 During wicked King Ahaz’ rule,
03:30 the spiritual and moral conditions in Israel
03:32 deteriorated to an appalling state.
03:35 Can you relate to Micah’s circumstances?
03:39 All of Jehovah’s people today  experience a test of endurance,
03:43 a test of patience,  because we’re living in a selfish world
03:47 where, according to the Scriptures,
03:49 people are “unthankful, disloyal,”
03:51 they have “no natural affection.”
03:53 True Christians are  “objects of hatred,” as Jesus foretold.
03:57 Some of our brothers  and sisters experience
04:00 hatred and opposition  at school and at work
04:04 nearly every day.
04:06 Sometimes that hatred  is within the family,
04:09 from unbelieving family members.
04:11 Think, too, about the hatred  that our brothers and sisters
04:15 have experienced who are imprisoned.
04:18 I can’t help but think  about the two sisters in Azerbaijan,
04:23 who we’re praying fervently for
04:25 because of their unjust persecution,
04:29 or 600 more in Eritrea,
04:32 Nagorno-Karabakh, Singapore,  South Korea, and Turkmenistan.
04:37 Those are injustices  that we long to see corrected.
04:41 We’d love to see  those situations changed today!
04:45 But are we impatient?
04:47 No.  We cultivate a waiting attitude.
04:50 Added to these circumstances  are the health problems
04:53 that many of our brothers  and sisters are facing.
04:56 These too are tests of patience,  tests of endurance.
05:00 Maybe you’re dealing with a health challenge
05:02 or a family member or a friend of yours
05:04 is battling one of these  to a greater or lesser degree.
05:09 It made me think of the broadcast  for this month, for December,
05:12 where we met  Sabina Hernandez, in Panama,
05:15 who was born with a severe handicap.
05:18 Since birth, her life  has been anything but normal.
05:22 But what an encouragement she is!
05:25 She’s come to trust in Jehovah.
05:27 Like Micah,  she’s developed a waiting attitude,
05:29 and this sister is doing her best
05:32 to serve Jehovah  despite her health challenge.
05:35 She looks forward to the day  when those circumstances will change,
05:39 and we do too.
05:41 We’d love to see it today, wouldn’t we?
05:43 Of course, those problems will end,
05:46 and likely it will happen  sooner than we think.
05:49 But whether the end of our circumstances
05:53 that are so difficult  comes today or a little later,
05:56 what can Micah’s example teach us?
06:00 Well, think a little deeper about Micah.
06:02 Micah served faithfully
06:04 for some six decades,  some sixty years.
06:08 He did live to see the fulfillment of some  of Jehovah’s judgement messages.
06:12 He did see some good fruitage  from his prophesying activity.
06:16 But did Micah live to see the fulfillment  of all of Jehovah’s promises?
06:20 No.
06:22 So, what helped him to wait patiently,
06:24 to keep active,  to be confident in Jehovah?
06:27 It was his absolute confidence
06:29 that Jehovah would in time  fulfill all of His promises.
06:33 He trusted completely in Him.
06:36 Well, by way of a reminder,  what two practical steps
06:40 could we do or do more fully  that will help us to cultivate
06:45 that same trusting,  confident waiting attitude?
06:49 The first is the text found  at 1 Thessalonians 5:17;
06:55 let’s read that together,
1 Thessalonians 5:17.
06:59 Perhaps you have it memorized.
07:01 It’s one of the easiest verses to do that —two words.
07:05 What does it tell us to do?
07:07 “Pray constantly.”
07:09 We need to remember that prayer  is real communication with God.
07:14 We can never be charged  with talking too much to Jehovah.
07:18 When it comes  to real communication with God,
07:21 The Watchtower cited this text and said:
07:24 “He is willing to listen endlessly  to those who do his will.”
07:28 Let’s accept that invitation.
07:30 Let’s pray constantly about the things that distress us.
07:33 Let’s cultivate the trust  in him by praying specifically
07:37 about the things that we need help with.
07:39 But what if we pray constantly
07:41 and we’re enduring a situation  and the problem persists?
07:45 What then?
07:47 Notice Luke 11:9, please.
07:51 Jesus’ words give us  every reason for confidence
07:55 when it says at Luke 11:9:
07:57 “So I say to you, keep on asking,  and it will be given you;
08:02 “keep on seeking,  and you will find;
08:04 keep on knocking,  and it will be opened to you.”
08:08 Yes, we want to do  whatever is in our power
08:11 to solve our problems,
08:13 having confidence that in time Jehovah  will give us the solution
08:17 and until then he’ll help us endure.
08:19 Remember what happens to a mountain  when it’s put next to Jehovah.
08:23 It becomes a molehill.
08:26 We need to turn mountains into molehills
08:29 by throwing our concerns  upon Jehovah in prayer.
08:33 Micah’s confidence was not misplaced.
08:36 Soon he’ll be back with us  in the resurrection
08:39 to witness the fulfillment of all  of Jehovah’s promises
08:42 that he patiently waited for.
08:44 So, like him, may we curb  our natural feelings of impatience
08:48 by keeping wide awake in faith,  always “on the lookout for Jehovah.”

00:00 Well, before his death,
00:02 Jesus warned all of those
00:04 who would be his followers in the future
00:06 that they would be objects of persecution.
00:10 In Matthew chapter 10,  do you remember what Jesus said?
00:13 Let’s read this together, Matthew 10:22:
00:17 “And you will be hated.”
00:19 Verse 22: “And you will be hated  by all people on account of my name,
00:24 “but the one who has endured  to the end will be saved.
00:28 “When they persecute you in one city,  flee to another;
00:31 “for truly I say to you, you will by no means
00:33 “complete the circuit of the cities of Israel
00:36 until the Son of man arrives.”
00:38 Well, interestingly, almost immediately
00:42 after the holy spirit had been poured out
00:45 and Jehovah began to select  his anointed congregation,
00:48 those newly anointed disciples
00:51 became the targets  of intense persecution.
00:55 Do you remember what happened  in Acts chapter 4?
00:57 Let’s read this, Acts 4:1, it says:
01:05 “While the two were speaking to the people,
01:07 “the priests, the captain of the temple,
01:10 “and the Sadducees came up to them.
01:12 “These were annoyed because the apostles  were teaching the people
01:16 “and were openly declaring  the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
01:20 “So they seized them  and took them into custody
01:23 until the next day,  for it was already evening.”
01:26 And then, if you turn over  to chapter 5 and verse 17,
01:31 we remember the words, it says:
01:34 “But the high priest rose,  and all those with him,
01:37 “who were of the sect of the Sadducees,   and they were filled with jealousy.
01:41 And they seized the apostles   and put them in the public jail.”
01:46 Well, that’s the beginning.
01:48 That’s the very, very beginning  of the Christian congregation
01:52 —intense persecution right from day one.
01:56 Well, roughly, about 25 years later,
01:59 in about the year 59 C.E.,
02:01 when the apostle Paul arrived in Rome,
02:04 by that time the prominent Jews  in the city that Paul met with
02:09 had heard much  about the early Christians.
02:11 Do you remember what they said?
02:13 Acts 28:22,
02:19 it says—
02:20 These prominent Jews said to Paul:
02:23 “But we think it proper to hear  from you what your thoughts are,
02:27 “for truly as regards this sect,
02:30 we know  that it is spoken against everywhere.”
02:34 Isn’t that interesting?
02:36 So they called it a “sect,”
02:39 and they said  it was “spoken against everywhere.”
02:42 Well, what were  some of the accusations
02:45 that were brought  against the early Christians?
02:48 Well, writing of the Christians
02:50 in that first-century period  in the Roman Empire,
02:52 historian K. S. Latourette said this:
02:56 “The accusations varied.
02:58 “Because they refused  to participate in pagan ceremonies
03:02 “the Christians were dubbed atheists.
03:04 “Through their abstention  from much of community life
03:07 “—the pagan festivals,  the public amusements . . .
03:10 “—they were derided  as haters of the human race.
03:14 “The fact that  [the Memorial of Christ’s death]
03:16 “was celebrated  only in the presence of believers
03:19 “fed the rumours that Christians  regularly sacrificed an infant
03:24 and consumed its blood and flesh.”
03:27 In addition,
03:29 because the early Christians  refused to practice emperor worship,
03:33 they were accused  of being enemies of the State.
03:38 Well, does all that sound familiar?
03:40 We’ve heard things  much like that recently, haven’t we?
03:43 Well, much time has passed  since these events in the first century,
03:48 but the murderous hatred
03:51 that Satan the Devil has  for all faithful servants of Jehovah God
03:55 is still very much active on this earth.
03:59 And we’re not surprised by that.
04:01 Do you remember  what Revelation 12:17 says?
04:05 Let’s read it.
04:07 Revelation 12:17, it says:
04:12 “So the dragon  became enraged at the woman
04:16 “and went off to wage war  with the remaining ones of her offspring,
04:21 “who observe the commandments of God
04:23 and have the work  of bearing witness concerning Jesus.”
04:27 Well, do you see the point?
04:29 You see,  as a result of remaining faithful,
04:32 the remaining anointed ones  who are on the earth
04:36 and all of those  who associate with them
04:38 and who support them  in their work are in a war
04:42 —a literal war
04:44 against Satan the Devil  and the wicked spirit forces.
04:48 Now, recently,  we’ve seen the Devil’s attack
04:52 on Jehovah’s people  in the country of Russia.
04:54 Just yesterday  the Interfax News Agency reported
04:59 that Metropolitan Hilarion,
05:02 head of the Russian Orthodox Synodal  Department for External Church Relations,
05:07 said this:
05:09 “Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe
05:12 “in Jesus Christ as the God and the Savior.
05:15 “They do not recognize  the doctrine of the Trinity.
05:19 Therefore, they cannot be called Christians.”
05:22 He stated that he welcomed
05:25 the court ruling  of the Russian Supreme Court
05:28 and suggested that the pernicious  and harmful influence
05:32 of Jehovah’s Witnesses  would now start to decline.
05:36 Wow!
05:38 Can you hear the hatred  of the Devil in those comments?
05:42 But just as there  have always been opposers
05:45 of Jehovah’s faithful servants,
05:48 there have also been  individuals like Gamaliel
05:51 that Jehovah has raised up
05:53 who have come  to the defense of Jehovah’s people.
05:56 Now, some of these people  do not love Jehovah’s Witnesses.
06:01 But for their own purposes,  they’re willing to defend God’s people.
06:05 Just take this example:
06:07 Andre Kuraev, a Protodeacon  of the Russian Orthodox Church
06:12 and a professor  of their spiritual academy in Moscow.
06:16 He’s a very, very outspoken critic  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
06:20 But after the decision  of the Russian Supreme Court,
06:23 this is what he said:
06:25 “I argued that State agencies  should not cooperate with this sect,
06:30 “and I do not retract my words.
06:33 “But to accuse them of extremism,  that is not even funny.
06:38 “Such a decision  is nothing other than idiotic,
06:43 a waste  to accuse pacifists of extremism.”
06:47 Isn’t that something?
06:49 Yesterday, it was very amazing to me  to see a news conference in Russia,
06:54 where German Chancellor Angela Merkel
06:57 was on a podium  with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
07:01 There Chancellor Merkel  said that she asked Mr. Putin
07:06 to utilize his influence  to protect minority rights
07:09 as well as in the case  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
07:14 Well, my eyes almost fell  out of my head
07:17 as I saw Chancellor Merkel say that
07:19 in the presence  of President Putin of Russia.
07:22 Well, there are many others  who are willing
07:25 to come to the defense  of Jehovah’s people.
07:27 Last week  when I was in Kazakhstan,
07:30 a professor came to attend  our talk for the entire country.
07:34 He sat right in the front row.
07:36 He’s written a book  about Jehovah’s Witnesses
07:38 and is very eager always to defend us.
07:41 He wanted to speak to me,  and so he came backstage.
07:44 We talked for about 15 or 20 minutes,  and he asked me,
07:48 “What do you think is the source
07:50 of all of these bad reports  about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”
07:54 And I said to the professor,
07:56 “Well, Professor,
07:58 “anyone who truly knows  Jehovah’s Witnesses
08:02 “recognizes that all of these accusations
08:05 are completely ridiculous.”
08:08 Well, the professor looked at me
08:10 —and he’s a very distinguished  white-haired man
08:13 of probably about 60 or 70 years of age—
08:16 and he says to me,  “I know Jehovah’s Witnesses,
08:20 and I know  that those charges are ridiculous.”
08:25 Isn’t it wonderful  that we have people like this
08:28 who are willing to stand up  for God’s people?
08:30 Well, in spite of the hatred  that’s been spewed forth by the Devil,
08:34 it is amazing to see that persecution
08:37 never ever stops God’s faithful servants.
08:41 It has never stopped them in the past,
08:43 and it will not stop them in the future.
08:45 In fact, what did Jesus say here  in Matthew chapter 5?
08:54 Matthew 5:11:
09:01 “Happy are you
09:03 “when people reproach you  and persecute you
09:07 “and lyingly say  every sort of wicked thing
09:11 “against you for my sake.
09:13 “Rejoice and be overjoyed,
09:16 “since your reward  is great in the heavens,
09:20 for in that way they persecuted  the prophets prior to you.”
09:24 Well, that’s the attitude of true Christians.
09:27 We know we’re doing the right thing
09:29 when we incur the hatred  of these agents of the Devil.
09:34 Well, one thing  that brought me joy last week
09:36 when I was in Russia  and also in Kazakhstan
09:38 was that I heard so many reports  from brothers and sisters
09:42 saying that inactive ones,  former Bible students,
09:46 relatives of Witnesses  are all contacting the brothers,
09:49 wanting to become involved again  in the truth
09:52 because of what they see happening  in Russia.
09:54 They know the end is close at hand.
09:57 So while we keep on praying
10:00 on behalf of our brothers  who are being persecuted,
10:02 how vital it is, brothers,  that we keep on the watch.
10:06 That we continue to watch  what’s happening around the world
10:09 —being very alert to world events
10:12 and eagerly awaiting the time  when our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
10:17 will appear and deliver us from this world
10:20 that is so firmly in the hands of the Devil.

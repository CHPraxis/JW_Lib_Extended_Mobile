00:00.050 --> 00:02.185
Well, before his death, 


00:02.185 --> 00:04.287
Jesus warned all of those 


00:04.287 --> 00:06.422
who would be his followers in the future 


00:06.422 --> 00:10.294
that they would be objects of persecution. 


00:10.293 --> 00:13.095
In Matthew chapter 10, 
do you remember what Jesus said? 


00:13.095 --> 00:17.467
Let’s read this together, Matthew 10:22: 


00:17.467 --> 00:19.469
“And you will be hated.” 


00:19.468 --> 00:24.373
Verse 22: “And you will be hated 
by all people on account of my name, 


00:24.373 --> 00:28.176
“but the one who has endured 
to the end will be saved. 


00:28.177 --> 00:31.180
“When they persecute you in one city, 
flee to another;


00:31.180 --> 00:33.717
“for truly I say to you, you will by no means 


00:33.717 --> 00:36.285
“complete the circuit of the cities of Israel 


00:36.285 --> 00:38.888
until the Son of man arrives.”


00:38.888 --> 00:42.491
Well, interestingly, almost immediately 


00:42.492 --> 00:45.062
after the holy spirit had been poured out 


00:45.062 --> 00:48.732
and Jehovah began to select 
his anointed congregation, 


00:48.732 --> 00:51.500
those newly anointed disciples 


00:51.500 --> 00:55.472
became the targets 
of intense persecution. 


00:55.472 --> 00:57.940
Do you remember what happened 
in Acts chapter 4? 


00:57.940 --> 01:05.715
Let’s read this, Acts 4:1, it says: 


01:05.715 --> 01:07.717
“While the two were speaking to the people, 


01:07.717 --> 01:10.019
“the priests, the captain of the temple, 


01:10.018 --> 01:12.221
“and the Sadducees came up to them. 


01:12.222 --> 01:16.625
“These were annoyed because the apostles 
were teaching the people


01:16.625 --> 01:20.530
“and were openly declaring 
the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. 


01:20.530 --> 01:23.633
“So they seized them 
and took them into custody 


01:23.633 --> 01:26.903
until the next day, 
for it was already evening.” 


01:26.903 --> 01:31.740
And then, if you turn over 
to chapter 5 and verse 17, 


01:31.740 --> 01:34.210
we remember the words, it says: 


01:34.210 --> 01:37.047
“But the high priest rose, 
and all those with him, 


01:37.047 --> 01:41.350
“who were of the sect of the Sadducees, 
 and they were filled with jealousy. 


01:41.350 --> 01:46.588
And they seized the apostles 
 and put them in the public jail.” 


01:46.588 --> 01:48.625
Well, that’s the beginning. 


01:48.625 --> 01:52.495
That’s the very, very beginning 
of the Christian congregation


01:52.495 --> 01:56.398
—intense persecution right from day one.


01:56.398 --> 01:59.568
Well, roughly, about 25 years later, 


01:59.568 --> 02:01.838
in about the year 59 C.E., 


02:01.838 --> 02:04.273
when the apostle Paul arrived in Rome,


02:04.273 --> 02:09.011
by that time the prominent Jews 
in the city that Paul met with 


02:09.012 --> 02:11.949
had heard much 
about the early Christians. 


02:11.948 --> 02:13.950
Do you remember what they said? 


02:13.950 --> 02:17.000
Acts 28:22, 


02:19.222 --> 02:20.924
it says—


02:20.923 --> 02:23.693
These prominent Jews said to Paul: 


02:23.693 --> 02:27.163
“But we think it proper to hear 
from you what your thoughts are, 


02:27.163 --> 02:30.933
“for truly as regards this sect, 


02:30.933 --> 02:34.536
we know 
that it is spoken against everywhere.” 


02:34.537 --> 02:36.539
Isn’t that interesting? 


02:36.538 --> 02:39.175
So they called it a “sect,” 


02:39.175 --> 02:42.678
and they said 
it was “spoken against everywhere.”


02:42.678 --> 02:45.548
Well, what were 
some of the accusations 


02:45.548 --> 02:48.383
that were brought 
against the early Christians? 


02:48.383 --> 02:50.386
Well, writing of the Christians 


02:50.387 --> 02:52.789
in that first-century period 
in the Roman Empire, 


02:52.788 --> 02:56.091
historian K. S. Latourette said this: 


02:56.092 --> 02:58.094
“The accusations varied. 


02:58.093 --> 03:02.031
“Because they refused 
to participate in pagan ceremonies 


03:02.032 --> 03:04.767
“the Christians were dubbed atheists. 


03:04.767 --> 03:07.870
“Through their abstention 
from much of community life


03:07.870 --> 03:10.573
“—the pagan festivals, 
the public amusements . . .


03:10.573 --> 03:14.643
“—they were derided 
as haters of the human race. 


03:14.643 --> 03:16.913
“The fact that 
[the Memorial of Christ’s death] 


03:16.913 --> 03:19.915
“was celebrated 
only in the presence of believers 


03:19.915 --> 03:24.520
“fed the rumours that Christians 
regularly sacrificed an infant 


03:24.520 --> 03:27.457
and consumed its blood and flesh.” 


03:27.457 --> 03:29.459
In addition, 


03:29.458 --> 03:33.328
because the early Christians 
refused to practice emperor worship, 


03:33.328 --> 03:38.000
they were accused 
of being enemies of the State. 


03:38.000 --> 03:40.337
Well, does all that sound familiar? 


03:40.337 --> 03:43.405
We’ve heard things 
much like that recently, haven’t we?


03:43.405 --> 03:48.077
Well, much time has passed 
since these events in the first century, 


03:48.077 --> 03:51.080
but the murderous hatred 


03:51.080 --> 03:55.918
that Satan the Devil has 
for all faithful servants of Jehovah God 


03:55.918 --> 03:59.155
is still very much active on this earth. 


03:59.155 --> 04:01.157
And we’re not surprised by that. 


04:01.157 --> 04:05.127
Do you remember 
what Revelation 12:17 says? 


04:05.127 --> 04:07.164
Let’s read it. 


04:07.163 --> 04:12.701
Revelation 12:17, it says:


04:12.702 --> 04:16.439
“So the dragon 
became enraged at the woman 


04:16.438 --> 04:21.076
“and went off to wage war 
with the remaining ones of her offspring, 


04:21.077 --> 04:23.714
“who observe the commandments of God 


04:23.713 --> 04:27.816
and have the work 
of bearing witness concerning Jesus.” 


04:27.817 --> 04:29.852
Well, do you see the point? 


04:29.852 --> 04:32.622
You see, 
as a result of remaining faithful, 


04:32.622 --> 04:36.392
the remaining anointed ones 
who are on the earth 


04:36.392 --> 04:38.762
and all of those 
who associate with them 


04:38.762 --> 04:42.299
and who support them 
in their work are in a war


04:42.298 --> 04:44.300
—a literal war 


04:44.300 --> 04:48.037
against Satan the Devil 
and the wicked spirit forces.


04:48.037 --> 04:52.075
Now, recently, 
we’ve seen the Devil’s attack 


04:52.075 --> 04:54.810
on Jehovah’s people 
in the country of Russia. 


04:54.810 --> 04:59.415
Just yesterday 
the Interfax News Agency reported 


04:59.415 --> 05:02.185
that Metropolitan Hilarion, 


05:02.185 --> 05:07.523
head of the Russian Orthodox Synodal 
Department for External Church Relations, 


05:07.523 --> 05:09.391
said this: 


05:09.392 --> 05:12.129
“Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe 


05:12.128 --> 05:15.831
“in Jesus Christ as the God and the Savior. 


05:15.832 --> 05:19.035
“They do not recognize 
the doctrine of the Trinity. 


05:19.035 --> 05:22.805
Therefore, they cannot be called Christians.” 


05:22.805 --> 05:25.708
He stated that he welcomed 


05:25.708 --> 05:28.643
the court ruling 
of the Russian Supreme Court 


05:28.643 --> 05:32.981
and suggested that the pernicious 
and harmful influence 


05:32.982 --> 05:36.519
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
would now start to decline. 


05:36.518 --> 05:38.520
Wow! 


05:38.520 --> 05:42.558
Can you hear the hatred 
of the Devil in those comments?


05:42.558 --> 05:45.995
But just as there 
have always been opposers 


05:45.995 --> 05:48.297
of Jehovah’s faithful servants, 


05:48.297 --> 05:51.400
there have also been 
individuals like Gamaliel 


05:51.400 --> 05:53.402
that Jehovah has raised up 


05:53.402 --> 05:56.539
who have come 
to the defense of Jehovah’s people. 


05:56.538 --> 06:01.310
Now, some of these people 
do not love Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


06:01.310 --> 06:05.682
But for their own purposes, 
they’re willing to defend God’s people. 


06:05.682 --> 06:07.684
Just take this example: 


06:07.683 --> 06:12.888
Andre Kuraev, a Protodeacon 
of the Russian Orthodox Church 


06:12.888 --> 06:16.791
and a professor 
of their spiritual academy in Moscow. 


06:16.792 --> 06:20.864
He’s a very, very outspoken critic 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


06:20.863 --> 06:23.665
But after the decision 
of the Russian Supreme Court, 


06:23.665 --> 06:25.902
this is what he said: 


06:25.902 --> 06:30.840
“I argued that State agencies 
should not cooperate with this sect, 


06:30.840 --> 06:33.843
“and I do not retract my words. 


06:33.843 --> 06:38.815
“But to accuse them of extremism, 
that is not even funny. 


06:38.815 --> 06:43.085
“Such a decision 
is nothing other than idiotic, 


06:43.085 --> 06:47.390
a waste 
to accuse pacifists of extremism.” 


06:47.390 --> 06:49.592
Isn’t that something?


06:49.592 --> 06:54.330
Yesterday, it was very amazing to me 
to see a news conference in Russia, 


06:54.330 --> 06:57.367
where German Chancellor Angela Merkel 


06:57.367 --> 07:01.404
was on a podium 
with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 


07:01.403 --> 07:06.208
There Chancellor Merkel 
said that she asked Mr. Putin 


07:06.208 --> 07:09.711
to utilize his influence 
to protect minority rights 


07:09.712 --> 07:14.150
as well as in the case 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


07:14.150 --> 07:17.187
Well, my eyes almost fell 
out of my head 


07:17.187 --> 07:19.622
as I saw Chancellor Merkel say that 


07:19.622 --> 07:22.959
in the presence 
of President Putin of Russia.


07:22.958 --> 07:25.595
Well, there are many others 
who are willing 


07:25.595 --> 07:27.897
to come to the defense 
of Jehovah’s people. 


07:27.897 --> 07:30.634
Last week 
when I was in Kazakhstan, 


07:30.633 --> 07:34.536
a professor came to attend 
our talk for the entire country. 


07:34.537 --> 07:36.539
He sat right in the front row. 


07:36.538 --> 07:38.975
He’s written a book 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses 


07:38.975 --> 07:41.443
and is very eager always to defend us. 


07:41.443 --> 07:44.546
He wanted to speak to me, 
and so he came backstage. 


07:44.547 --> 07:48.250
We talked for about 15 or 20 minutes, 
and he asked me, 


07:48.250 --> 07:50.452
“What do you think is the source 


07:50.452 --> 07:54.224
of all of these bad reports 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?” 


07:54.223 --> 07:56.225
And I said to the professor, 


07:56.225 --> 07:58.427
“Well, Professor, 


07:58.427 --> 08:02.365
“anyone who truly knows 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 


08:02.365 --> 08:05.502
“recognizes that all of these accusations 


08:05.502 --> 08:08.170
are completely ridiculous.” 


08:08.170 --> 08:10.405
Well, the professor looked at me


08:10.405 --> 08:13.375
—and he’s a very distinguished 
white-haired man 


08:13.375 --> 08:16.378
of probably about 60 or 70 years of age—


08:16.378 --> 08:20.916
and he says to me, 
“I know Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


08:20.917 --> 08:25.154
and I know 
that those charges are ridiculous.” 


08:25.153 --> 08:28.056
Isn’t it wonderful 
that we have people like this 


08:28.057 --> 08:30.627
who are willing to stand up 
for God’s people?


08:30.627 --> 08:34.797
Well, in spite of the hatred 
that’s been spewed forth by the Devil, 


08:34.797 --> 08:37.700
it is amazing to see that persecution 


08:37.700 --> 08:41.603
never ever stops God’s faithful servants. 


08:41.603 --> 08:43.605
It has never stopped them in the past, 


08:43.605 --> 08:45.775
and it will not stop them in the future. 


08:45.775 --> 08:49.000
In fact, what did Jesus say here 
in Matthew chapter 5? 


08:54.517 --> 08:59.000
Matthew 5:11: 


09:01.690 --> 09:03.725
“Happy are you 


09:03.725 --> 09:07.095
“when people reproach you 
and persecute you 


09:07.095 --> 09:11.533
“and lyingly say 
every sort of wicked thing 


09:11.533 --> 09:13.668
“against you for my sake. 


09:13.668 --> 09:16.771
“Rejoice and be overjoyed, 


09:16.772 --> 09:20.242
“since your reward 
is great in the heavens, 


09:20.242 --> 09:24.714
for in that way they persecuted 
the prophets prior to you.” 


09:24.713 --> 09:27.916
Well, that’s the attitude of true Christians. 


09:27.917 --> 09:29.919
We know we’re doing the right thing 


09:29.918 --> 09:34.190
when we incur the hatred 
of these agents of the Devil. 


09:34.190 --> 09:36.492
Well, one thing 
that brought me joy last week 


09:36.492 --> 09:38.995
when I was in Russia 
and also in Kazakhstan  


09:38.995 --> 09:42.163
was that I heard so many reports 
from brothers and sisters 


09:42.163 --> 09:46.201
saying that inactive ones, 
former Bible students, 


09:46.202 --> 09:49.639
relatives of Witnesses 
are all contacting the brothers, 


09:49.638 --> 09:52.240
wanting to become involved again 
in the truth 


09:52.240 --> 09:54.643
because of what they see happening 
in Russia. 


09:54.643 --> 09:57.646
They know the end is close at hand.


09:57.647 --> 10:00.049
So while we keep on praying 


10:00.048 --> 10:02.785
on behalf of our brothers 
who are being persecuted, 


10:02.785 --> 10:06.322
how vital it is, brothers, 
that we keep on the watch. 


10:06.322 --> 10:09.859
That we continue to watch 
what’s happening around the world


10:09.858 --> 10:12.795
—being very alert to world events 


10:12.795 --> 10:17.232
and eagerly awaiting the time 
when our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 


10:17.232 --> 10:20.435
will appear and deliver us from this world 


10:20.435 --> 10:29.495
that is so firmly in the hands of the Devil.

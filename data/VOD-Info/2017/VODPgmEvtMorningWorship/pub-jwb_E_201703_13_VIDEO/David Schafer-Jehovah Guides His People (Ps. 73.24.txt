00:01 How many times have you read  in our publications
00:03 experiences whereby someone is praying
00:06 to be guided by God
00:10 while at the same time  one of our Kingdom proclaimers
00:13 is praying to be directed
00:15 to someone with whom they can share
00:17 Jehovah’s inspired wisdom?
00:20 What happens?
00:22 South Africa:
00:24 A sister begins  her auxiliary pioneer service
00:27 praying for Jehovah  to help her find someone
00:29 with whom  she can study the Bible.
00:31 The territory  includes the home of a person
00:34 who had been very rude  to her in the past.
00:36 Courageously,  she knocks on the door anyway
00:40 and discovers  that new tenants live there
00:42 —a mother and daughter  who had been praying
00:46 for someone to help them  understand the Bible.
00:50 Soon, all three were out  in service together.
00:55 The angels certainly know  how to work these things out.
00:59 Is it reasonable, then,  to believe that the angels
01:03 could also play a role in ensuring
01:05 that baptized Christians  get the information
01:07 that they need  either to receive or to give?
01:12 As our text indicates,  Jehovah ‘guides us with his advice.’
01:17 How does that work?
01:19 Well, often we find ourselves  in need of wisdom.
01:23 We pray to Jehovah for direction;  we search the Bible;
01:27 we search our Christian publications;
01:30 and at times, we ask people  who are already wise for their advice.
01:34 After all, Insight, Volume 2,  under “wisdom” refers to this as
01:38 “a superior and  timesaving way to wisdom.”
01:43 Superior, that is,  to experiencing punishment
01:46 or watching other people  go through it.
01:48 The Insight book  then cites Proverbs 22:17.
01:53 Let’s read that together.
01:54 Proverbs 22:17,
01:59 which says:
02:00 “Incline your ear and listen  to the words of the wise,
02:05 “in order to apply your heart
02:07 to my knowledge.”
02:11 Who is the “my”  in the expression “my knowledge”?
02:16 Well, Jehovah is speaking to us  through the pages of his Word,
02:19 indicating that if we listen
02:22 to counsel from wise people,
02:25 we can, in fact,  detect the wisdom of Jehovah.
02:30 Moreover,  Psalm 32:8 gives us this promise:
02:36 “I will give you insight
02:39 “and instruct you  in the way you should go.
02:41 I will give you advice  with my eye upon you.”
02:46 Now, does that mean  that if we pray intensely,
02:50 Jehovah will give us  tailor-made counsel
02:53 designed to fit  our individual circumstances
02:58 —that somehow through either
03:00 an encouraging visit  by a mature Christian,
03:02 a talk at one of the meetings,
03:05 or some information  in one of our publications,
03:08 we will find exactly what we need?
03:11 Yes,
03:13 prayers are often answered  in that exact way.
03:18 Now, with regard to elders’ meetings,
03:20 our brothers are trained to recognize
03:23 that Christ by means of his holy spirit  can influence any elder
03:27 (even the youngest,  most reticent elder on the body)
03:31 to make an expression  that results
03:34 in wise decisions
03:37 —decisions that may not have been reached
03:40 if each elder  had been consulted individually.
03:44 But, now, does that mean  that every expression
03:46 made by an elder automatically  reflects the knowledge of God?
03:50 We have to remember  that just as one who desires wisdom
03:54 has a responsibility to seek it,
03:56 so likewise one who gives advice
04:01 has a responsibility to base his comments
04:03 on Jehovah’s inspired Word.
04:05 Sometimes emotion  may get the better of an adviser.
04:10 How can we tell whether  that is taking place?
04:13 Turn with me, please,  to 1 Samuel chapter 23
04:17 —1 Samuel 23.
04:19 Now, how many times  did King David receive advice
04:23 from the likes of Gad, Nathan,
04:25 Abigail, Abishai, others?
04:29 How did David respond to it?
04:31 Well, first, please note  that David had the admirable habit
04:34 of inquiring of Jehovah  before making decisions.
04:37 Look at what it says here  in chapter 23,
04:40 1 Samuel 23:2:
04:43 “So David inquired of Jehovah:
04:46 “‘Should I go and strike down  these Philistines?’
04:49 “Jehovah said to David:
04:51 “‘Go, strike down the Philistines  and rescue Keilah.’
04:55 “But the men of David  said to him: ‘Look!
04:57 “‘We are afraid while here in Judah;
04:59 “‘how much more so if we go to Keilah
05:01 “‘against the battle line  of the Philistines!’
05:04 “So David inquired
05:08 once again of Jehovah.”
05:10 And many other texts show  that this was David’s practice.
05:14 Of course, there were also  notable occasions
05:16 when David  did not first inquire of Jehovah,
05:20 such as when he determined  to destroy Nabal
05:23 and every male in his household,
05:25 as reported in chapter 25.
05:27 But David recognized
05:29 in the words of Abigail
05:32 the knowledge of Jehovah.
05:34 Notice what he said  at 1 Samuel 25:32, 33:
05:40 “At this David said to Abigail:
05:43 “‘Praise Jehovah the God of Israel,  who sent you this day to meet me!
05:46 “‘And blessed be your good sense!
05:49 “‘May you be blessed  for restraining me
05:52 “‘this day from incurring bloodguilt
05:54 and from taking revenge  with my own hands.’”
05:57 Abigail brought Bible principles
06:00 back to David’s mind,
06:03 and he could see  that this was from Jehovah.
06:07 And yet, there were other times  when David’s advisers
06:10 were pointing to what  they considered to be proof
06:14 of Jehovah’s divine intervention,
06:18 but David did not buy into it.
06:21 Notice what it says
06:23 at 1 Samuel 24:4:
06:30 “David’s men said to him:
06:32 “‘This is the day
06:34 “‘on which Jehovah is saying to you,
06:37 “‘“Look! I am giving  your enemy into your hand,
06:41 and you can do to him  whatever seems good to you.”’”
06:45 Now, how would David  respond to that?
06:47 Would he say: “You’re right.
06:50 “Saul tried to kill me three times.  He’s been hunting me for years.
06:53 “He’s obviously lost  Jehovah’s holy spirit.
06:55 “Isn’t that why  Samuel anointed me?
06:57 “And now, look,  here he is by himself,
07:00 “vulnerable, in our very cave.
07:03 “When does that ever happen?
07:05 “Clearly, Jehovah has given me
07:08 this opportunity to seize the kingship.”
07:11 David did not draw that conclusion.
07:14 Why not?
07:16 We get a clue  in 1 Samuel chapter 26.
07:20 Notice, once again,  the counsel he receives in verse 8.
07:23 Was it a coincidence  that David and his men
07:26 now find Saul  and his army of 3,000 men
07:30 totally incapacitated  by deep sleep?
07:32 When does that ever happen?
07:34 Clearly, that was a gift from God.
07:38 That was what Abishai thought,  and so he said in verse 8:
07:43 “Today God has surrendered  your enemy into your hand.
07:47 “And now, please,  let me pin him to the ground
07:50 “with the spear just once,
07:52 and I will not need  to do it twice.”
07:55 Now, was that really  counsel from God
07:58 or just well-intentioned advice  driven by emotion?
08:03 David rejected it.
08:05 Why?
08:07 Was he thinking  about Bible principles?
08:09 Was he thinking  about Leviticus 19:18?
08:12 ‘You must not take revenge.’
08:17 Likely, as we read what it says  in verses 10 and 11,
08:20 notice what it says:
08:22 “As surely  as Jehovah is living,
08:24 “Jehovah himself  will strike him down,
08:27 “or his day will come  and he will die,
08:30 “or he will go down  into battle and perish.
08:32 “It is unthinkable  from Jehovah’s standpoint for me
08:36 to lift my hand  against the anointed of Jehovah!”
08:40 David loved Jehovah’s Word.
08:43 He tried to consider each situation
08:46 from Jehovah’s standpoint.
08:49 He sought to discern the difference between God’s knowledge
08:53 and human reasoning.
08:56 Today, we too may face  a difficult situation, a decision.
08:59 Someone might even encourage us  to take action
09:02 without fully considering God’s will.
09:05 We need to pray for Jehovah  to direct our hearts to his knowledge
09:10 not only that we may receive it
09:12 but even that we might convey it  when appropriate.
09:15 Sometimes you may be the one
09:17 who needs to give  the word of guidance.
09:20 Inquire of Jehovah.
09:22 Make sure your counsel  is in harmony with his Word.
09:27 If it is and if the recipient
09:30 also has a prayerful attitude,
09:32 then he too may feel
09:35 as in the words  of today’s inspired text writer
09:39 —that Jehovah is guiding us  with his advice.

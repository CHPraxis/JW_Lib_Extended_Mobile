00:01.283 --> 00:03.920
How many times have you read 
in our publications 


00:03.920 --> 00:06.823
experiences whereby someone is praying 


00:06.823 --> 00:10.260
to be guided by God 


00:10.260 --> 00:13.162
while at the same time 
one of our Kingdom proclaimers 


00:13.162 --> 00:15.165
is praying to be directed 


00:15.165 --> 00:17.233
to someone with whom they can share 


00:17.233 --> 00:20.503
Jehovah’s inspired wisdom? 


00:20.503 --> 00:22.538
What happens? 


00:22.538 --> 00:24.540
South Africa: 


00:24.540 --> 00:27.210
A sister begins 
her auxiliary pioneer service 


00:27.210 --> 00:29.212
praying for Jehovah 
to help her find someone 


00:29.212 --> 00:31.380
with whom 
she can study the Bible. 


00:31.380 --> 00:34.283
The territory 
includes the home of a person 


00:34.283 --> 00:36.920
who had been very rude 
to her in the past. 


00:36.920 --> 00:40.123
Courageously, 
she knocks on the door anyway 


00:40.123 --> 00:42.825
and discovers 
that new tenants live there


00:42.825 --> 00:46.428
—a mother and daughter 
who had been praying 


00:46.428 --> 00:50.933
for someone to help them 
understand the Bible. 


00:50.933 --> 00:55.805
Soon, all three were out 
in service together. 


00:55.805 --> 00:59.975
The angels certainly know 
how to work these things out.


00:59.975 --> 01:03.178
Is it reasonable, then, 
to believe that the angels 


01:03.178 --> 01:05.181
could also play a role in ensuring 


01:05.182 --> 01:07.517
that baptized Christians 
get the information  


01:07.517 --> 01:12.989
that they need 
either to receive or to give? 


01:12.988 --> 01:17.526
As our text indicates, 
Jehovah ‘guides us with his advice.’ 


01:17.527 --> 01:19.729
How does that work? 


01:19.728 --> 01:23.098
Well, often we find ourselves 
in need of wisdom. 


01:23.098 --> 01:27.770
We pray to Jehovah for direction; 
we search the Bible; 


01:27.770 --> 01:30.107
we search our Christian publications; 


01:30.107 --> 01:34.777
and at times, we ask people 
who are already wise for their advice. 


01:34.777 --> 01:38.882
After all, Insight, Volume 2, 
under “wisdom” refers to this as 


01:38.882 --> 01:43.487
“a superior and 
timesaving way to wisdom.” 


01:43.487 --> 01:46.622
Superior, that is, 
to experiencing punishment 


01:46.622 --> 01:48.859
or watching other people 
go through it. 


01:48.858 --> 01:53.195
The Insight book 
then cites Proverbs 22:17. 


01:53.195 --> 01:54.497
Let’s read that together. 


01:54.497 --> 01:59.102
Proverbs 22:17, 


01:59.102 --> 02:00.770
which says: 


02:00.770 --> 02:05.040
“Incline your ear and listen 
to the words of the wise, 


02:05.040 --> 02:07.677
“in order to apply your heart 


02:07.677 --> 02:11.815
to my knowledge.” 


02:11.815 --> 02:16.218
Who is the “my” 
in the expression “my knowledge”? 


02:16.218 --> 02:19.588
Well, Jehovah is speaking to us 
through the pages of his Word, 


02:19.588 --> 02:22.425
indicating that if we listen 


02:22.425 --> 02:25.628
to counsel from wise people, 


02:25.628 --> 02:30.633
we can, in fact, 
detect the wisdom of Jehovah. 


02:30.633 --> 02:35.000
Moreover, 
Psalm 32:8 gives us this promise: 


02:36.372 --> 02:39.075
“I will give you insight 


02:39.075 --> 02:41.978
“and instruct you 
in the way you should go. 


02:41.978 --> 02:46.950
I will give you advice 
with my eye upon you.”


02:46.950 --> 02:50.287
Now, does that mean 
that if we pray intensely, 


02:50.287 --> 02:53.422
Jehovah will give us 
tailor-made counsel 


02:53.422 --> 02:58.094
designed to fit 
our individual circumstances


02:58.093 --> 03:00.128
—that somehow through either 


03:00.128 --> 03:02.898
an encouraging visit 
by a mature Christian,


03:02.898 --> 03:05.568
a talk at one of the meetings, 


03:05.568 --> 03:08.403
or some information 
in one of our publications, 


03:08.403 --> 03:11.006
we will find exactly what we need? 


03:11.007 --> 03:13.109
Yes, 


03:13.108 --> 03:18.013
prayers are often answered 
in that exact way.


03:18.013 --> 03:20.450
Now, with regard to elders’ meetings, 


03:20.450 --> 03:23.018
our brothers are trained to recognize 


03:23.018 --> 03:27.990
that Christ by means of his holy spirit 
can influence any elder 


03:27.990 --> 03:31.727
(even the youngest, 
most reticent elder on the body) 


03:31.727 --> 03:34.264
to make an expression 
that results 


03:34.263 --> 03:37.633
in wise decisions


03:37.633 --> 03:40.436
—decisions that may not have been reached 


03:40.437 --> 03:44.240
if each elder 
had been consulted individually. 


03:44.240 --> 03:46.708
But, now, does that mean 
that every expression 


03:46.708 --> 03:50.980
made by an elder automatically 
reflects the knowledge of God? 


03:50.980 --> 03:54.083
We have to remember 
that just as one who desires wisdom 


03:54.083 --> 03:56.751
has a responsibility to seek it, 


03:56.752 --> 04:01.057
so likewise one who gives advice 


04:01.057 --> 04:03.660
has a responsibility to base his comments 


04:03.660 --> 04:05.662
on Jehovah’s inspired Word. 


04:05.662 --> 04:10.500
Sometimes emotion 
may get the better of an adviser. 


04:10.500 --> 04:13.970
How can we tell whether 
that is taking place? 


04:13.970 --> 04:17.373
Turn with me, please, 
to 1 Samuel chapter 23


04:17.373 --> 04:19.608
—1 Samuel 23. 


04:19.608 --> 04:23.078
Now, how many times 
did King David receive advice 


04:23.078 --> 04:25.915
from the likes of Gad, Nathan, 


04:25.915 --> 04:29.285
Abigail, Abishai, others? 


04:29.285 --> 04:31.453
How did David respond to it? 


04:31.453 --> 04:34.656
Well, first, please note 
that David had the admirable habit 


04:34.657 --> 04:37.294
of inquiring of Jehovah 
before making decisions. 


04:37.293 --> 04:40.161
Look at what it says here 
in chapter 23, 


04:40.162 --> 04:43.432
1 Samuel 23:2: 


04:43.432 --> 04:46.069
“So David inquired of Jehovah: 


04:46.068 --> 04:49.738
“‘Should I go and strike down 
these Philistines?’ 


04:49.738 --> 04:51.740
“Jehovah said to David: 


04:51.740 --> 04:55.512
“‘Go, strike down the Philistines 
and rescue Keilah.’ 


04:55.512 --> 04:57.514
“But the men of David 
said to him: ‘Look! 


04:57.513 --> 04:59.681
“‘We are afraid while here in Judah; 


04:59.682 --> 05:01.950
“‘how much more so if we go to Keilah 


05:01.950 --> 05:04.953
“‘against the battle line 
of the Philistines!’ 


05:04.953 --> 05:08.190
“So David inquired 


05:08.190 --> 05:10.427
once again of Jehovah.” 


05:10.427 --> 05:14.464
And many other texts show 
that this was David’s practice.


05:14.463 --> 05:16.831
Of course, there were also 
notable occasions 


05:16.832 --> 05:20.970
when David 
did not first inquire of Jehovah, 


05:20.970 --> 05:23.673
such as when he determined 
to destroy Nabal 


05:23.673 --> 05:25.675
and every male in his household, 


05:25.675 --> 05:27.877
as reported in chapter 25. 


05:27.877 --> 05:29.912
But David recognized 


05:29.912 --> 05:32.382
in the words of Abigail 


05:32.382 --> 05:34.550
the knowledge of Jehovah. 


05:34.550 --> 05:40.255
Notice what he said 
at 1 Samuel 25:32, 33: 


05:40.255 --> 05:43.058
“At this David said to Abigail: 


05:43.058 --> 05:46.728
“‘Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, 
who sent you this day to meet me! 


05:46.728 --> 05:49.465
“‘And blessed be your good sense! 


05:49.465 --> 05:52.135
“‘May you be blessed 
for restraining me 


05:52.135 --> 05:54.137
“‘this day from incurring bloodguilt 


05:54.137 --> 05:57.574
and from taking revenge 
with my own hands.’” 


05:57.573 --> 06:00.743
Abigail brought Bible principles 


06:00.743 --> 06:03.211
back to David’s mind, 


06:03.212 --> 06:07.015
and he could see 
that this was from Jehovah.


06:07.015 --> 06:10.687
And yet, there were other times 
when David’s advisers 


06:10.687 --> 06:14.290
were pointing to what 
they considered to be proof 


06:14.290 --> 06:18.293
of Jehovah’s divine intervention, 


06:18.293 --> 06:21.363
but David did not buy into it. 


06:21.363 --> 06:23.398
Notice what it says 


06:23.398 --> 06:28.000
at 1 Samuel 24:4: 


06:30.105 --> 06:32.142
“David’s men said to him: 


06:32.142 --> 06:34.310
“‘This is the day 


06:34.310 --> 06:37.713
“‘on which Jehovah is saying to you, 


06:37.713 --> 06:41.483
“‘“Look! I am giving 
your enemy into your hand, 


06:41.483 --> 06:45.386
and you can do to him 
whatever seems good to you.”’” 


06:45.387 --> 06:47.857
Now, how would David 
respond to that? 


06:47.857 --> 06:50.225
Would he say: “You’re right. 


06:50.225 --> 06:53.595
“Saul tried to kill me three times. 
He’s been hunting me for years. 


06:53.595 --> 06:55.765
“He’s obviously lost 
Jehovah’s holy spirit. 


06:55.765 --> 06:57.900
“Isn’t that why 
Samuel anointed me? 


06:57.900 --> 07:00.302
“And now, look, 
here he is by himself, 


07:00.302 --> 07:03.405
“vulnerable, in our very cave. 


07:03.405 --> 07:05.642
“When does that ever happen? 


07:05.642 --> 07:08.110
“Clearly, Jehovah has given me 


07:08.110 --> 07:11.447
this opportunity to seize the kingship.” 


07:11.447 --> 07:14.950
David did not draw that conclusion. 


07:14.950 --> 07:16.952
Why not? 


07:16.952 --> 07:20.222
We get a clue 
in 1 Samuel chapter 26. 


07:20.222 --> 07:23.894
Notice, once again, 
the counsel he receives in verse 8. 


07:23.893 --> 07:26.728
Was it a coincidence 
that David and his men 


07:26.728 --> 07:30.265
now find Saul 
and his army of 3,000 men 


07:30.265 --> 07:32.735
totally incapacitated 
by deep sleep? 


07:32.735 --> 07:34.970
When does that ever happen? 


07:34.970 --> 07:38.440
Clearly, that was a gift from God. 


07:38.440 --> 07:42.000
That was what Abishai thought, 
and so he said in verse 8: 


07:43.478 --> 07:47.783
“Today God has surrendered 
your enemy into your hand. 


07:47.783 --> 07:50.285
“And now, please, 
let me pin him to the ground 


07:50.285 --> 07:52.455
“with the spear just once, 


07:52.455 --> 07:55.257
and I will not need 
to do it twice.” 


07:55.257 --> 07:58.727
Now, was that really 
counsel from God 


07:58.727 --> 08:03.299
or just well-intentioned advice 
driven by emotion? 


08:03.298 --> 08:05.300
David rejected it. 


08:05.300 --> 08:07.102
Why? 


08:07.102 --> 08:09.672
Was he thinking 
about Bible principles? 


08:09.672 --> 08:12.875
Was he thinking 
about Leviticus 19:18? 


08:12.875 --> 08:15.000
‘You must not take revenge.’ 


08:17.180 --> 08:20.783
Likely, as we read what it says 
in verses 10 and 11, 


08:20.783 --> 08:22.785
notice what it says: 


08:22.785 --> 08:24.787
“As surely 
as Jehovah is living, 


08:24.787 --> 08:27.990
“Jehovah himself 
will strike him down, 


08:27.990 --> 08:30.092
“or his day will come 
and he will die, 


08:30.092 --> 08:32.729
“or he will go down 
into battle and perish. 


08:32.728 --> 08:36.598
“It is unthinkable 
from Jehovah’s standpoint for me 


08:36.598 --> 08:40.570
to lift my hand 
against the anointed of Jehovah!” 


08:40.570 --> 08:43.973
David loved Jehovah’s Word. 


08:43.973 --> 08:46.641
He tried to consider each situation 


08:46.642 --> 08:49.512
from Jehovah’s standpoint. 


08:49.512 --> 08:53.815
He sought to discern the difference
between God’s knowledge 


08:53.815 --> 08:56.018
and human reasoning.


08:56.018 --> 08:59.988
Today, we too may face 
a difficult situation, a decision. 


08:59.988 --> 09:02.625
Someone might even encourage us 
to take action 


09:02.625 --> 09:05.728
without fully considering God’s will. 


09:05.728 --> 09:10.431
We need to pray for Jehovah 
to direct our hearts to his knowledge 


09:10.432 --> 09:12.435
not only that we may receive it 


09:12.435 --> 09:15.738
but even that we might convey it 
when appropriate. 


09:15.738 --> 09:17.906
Sometimes you may be the one 


09:17.907 --> 09:20.744
who needs to give 
the word of guidance. 


09:20.743 --> 09:22.978
Inquire of Jehovah. 


09:22.978 --> 09:27.783
Make sure your counsel 
is in harmony with his Word. 


09:27.783 --> 09:30.653
If it is and if the recipient 


09:30.653 --> 09:32.888
also has a prayerful attitude, 


09:32.888 --> 09:35.925
then he too may feel 


09:35.925 --> 09:39.295
as in the words 
of today’s inspired text writer


09:39.295 --> 09:50.023
—that Jehovah is guiding us 
with his advice.

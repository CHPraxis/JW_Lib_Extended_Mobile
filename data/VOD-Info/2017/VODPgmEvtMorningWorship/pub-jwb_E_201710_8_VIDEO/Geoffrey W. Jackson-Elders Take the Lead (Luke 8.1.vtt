00:00.917 --> 00:04.087
While meditating on the text this morning,


00:04.087 --> 00:06.089
I was reminded of an experience 


00:06.088 --> 00:08.525
I had many years ago as a missionary. 


00:08.525 --> 00:09.358
At the time,


00:09.358 --> 00:11.626
I was studying with a young man


00:11.627 --> 00:13.630
who was training to be a pastor


00:13.630 --> 00:15.332
in his church.


00:15.332 --> 00:20.002
This man had got to the point
where he started to attend all our meetings


00:20.002 --> 00:24.807
while at the same time
still attending his church gatherings. 


00:24.807 --> 00:27.310
The church, obviously,
was very disturbed


00:27.310 --> 00:30.580
about the fact that he was coming
to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,


00:30.580 --> 00:33.950
and their headquarters
sent in a missionary from overseas 


00:33.950 --> 00:36.452
to try and rectify the situation. 


00:36.452 --> 00:38.722
The young man told me what happened. 


00:38.722 --> 00:40.724
He said the missionary asked him, 


00:40.723 --> 00:44.060
“What is it that impresses you
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?” 


00:44.060 --> 00:48.598
He said, “Well, one of the things is
that they do the preaching work.” 


00:48.598 --> 00:53.201
The missionary replied, 
“Well, our church can do that too.” 


00:53.202 --> 00:56.639
So the next time they had a service, 


00:56.638 --> 01:01.343
the missionary conducted the service 
and with great zeal and enthusiasm 


01:01.343 --> 01:05.548
demanded that everyone in the church
take part in the preaching work. 


01:05.548 --> 01:09.551
He announced the time that they
would have the group to go preaching. 


01:09.552 --> 01:12.689
The young man told me 
quite a number of people came along. 


01:12.688 --> 01:17.026
But there was just one thing missing,
you guessed it, the missionary. 


01:17.027 --> 01:19.362
He felt that it was enough


01:19.362 --> 01:24.934
just to encourage everybody else
to do it without engaging in it himself. 


01:24.933 --> 01:29.938
How different was the example
of Jesus and of our hard-working elders


01:29.938 --> 01:33.576
who do take the lead
with regard to the preaching work.


01:33.577 --> 01:37.580
Now let’s take our Bibles
and turn to a very interesting scripture


01:37.580 --> 01:42.585
in Hebrews 13:7, 17. 


01:42.585 --> 01:46.755
Now, I’d like to highlight the beauty
of the New World Translation 


01:46.755 --> 01:48.792
in these two verses. 


01:48.792 --> 01:51.127
You see at the beginning of verse 7:


01:51.127 --> 01:54.497
“Remember those
who are taking the lead among you.” 


01:54.497 --> 01:56.499
And then verse 17:


01:56.498 --> 02:00.000
“Be obedient to those
who are taking the lead among you.” 


02:01.203 --> 02:04.706
If you look at other Bibles,
whether new or old,


02:04.707 --> 02:08.010
most of them say “your leaders.” 


02:08.010 --> 02:11.815
Now, obviously,
the New World Translation Committee 


02:11.815 --> 02:14.750
had in mind Jesus’ comments with regard


02:14.750 --> 02:17.653
to no one being a leader among us,


02:17.653 --> 02:20.790
and although it’s a different
word in the Greek text, 


02:20.790 --> 02:25.060
still in English we can’t help
but be sensitive to that matter. 


02:25.060 --> 02:29.065
And so this accurate translation
of saying “taking the lead”


02:29.065 --> 02:33.670
really summarizes, doesn’t it,
what the role is of an elder. 


02:33.670 --> 02:37.573
We’re not leaders, 
but we set the right example.


02:37.573 --> 02:42.211
Now, this accurate translation
is also portrayed


02:42.212 --> 02:46.884
in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ 
as recorded in Luke chapter 22, 


02:46.883 --> 02:49.651
and you’ll be interested to note


02:49.652 --> 02:53.000
that this is part of the revision
of the New World Translation text. 


02:54.057 --> 02:58.995
Luke 22:26, 
it now portrays accurately


02:58.995 --> 03:02.498
the fact that both expressions in Hebrew 


03:02.498 --> 03:05.935
and this one here are the same word. 


03:05.935 --> 03:10.105
So, Luke 22:26,


03:10.105 --> 03:13.843
it says: 
“You, though, are not to be that way. 


03:13.843 --> 03:18.280
But let the one who is the greatest
among you become as the youngest.” 


03:18.280 --> 03:21.650
And then notice: 
“and the one taking the lead,” 


03:21.650 --> 03:24.553
now this is the same expression
as in the Hebrews, 


03:24.553 --> 03:27.590
“as the one ministering.” 


03:27.590 --> 03:32.595
So, obviously,
to take the lead means to do the work,


03:32.595 --> 03:36.532
to be a minister,
to be a servant, to serve others.


03:36.532 --> 03:39.169
This also reminds me, 
many years ago,


03:39.168 --> 03:44.173
when I worked with the translation team
in the Pacific nation of Samoa. 


03:44.173 --> 03:48.076
At that point, we were trying to select
an accurate expression


03:48.077 --> 03:51.280
to convey this thought of “taking the lead.” 


03:51.280 --> 03:54.250
And there were two words eventually
that the brothers


03:54.250 --> 03:57.153
were trying to select between, 
or choose between. 


03:57.153 --> 04:00.256
One was the word ta’ita’i
and the other ta’imua. 


04:00.257 --> 04:02.725
Now, you don’t have
to remember those words,


04:02.725 --> 04:06.595
but as a foreigner,
I didn’t really understand


04:06.595 --> 04:09.498
the subtleties between
the difference of the two words. 


04:09.498 --> 04:12.135
So I asked the brothers, 
“How can you explain to me 


04:12.135 --> 04:14.303
what these two words mean?” 


04:14.303 --> 04:17.373
So one of the brothers was very eloquent. 


04:17.373 --> 04:21.410
He said: “Well, just imagine
a procession, a parade. 


04:21.410 --> 04:24.847
“So a ta’ita’i is the old man who sits


04:24.847 --> 04:27.784
“on the side of the road
barking out the orders: 


04:27.783 --> 04:30.420
“‘You should do it this way;
you should do it that way.’ 


04:30.420 --> 04:35.292
“The ta’imua, on the other hand, 
is the one right in the front of the parade


04:35.292 --> 04:38.327
taking the lead
and everyone’s following him.” 


04:38.327 --> 04:41.330
Which word do you think we selected?


04:41.330 --> 04:46.335
Doesn’t that summarize nicely just exactly
what’s involved with being an elder? 


04:46.335 --> 04:50.072
It’s not a matter of sitting
on the sidelines barking out orders


04:50.072 --> 04:52.075
but getting involved,


04:52.075 --> 04:55.210
setting the right example,
and then others following. 


04:55.210 --> 04:58.113
And this is in harmony
with one Greek lexicon


04:58.113 --> 05:01.016
that describes
this expression this way, it says, 


05:01.017 --> 05:03.987
“The concept of leading can be expressed


05:03.987 --> 05:06.789
“by showing how to do something, 


05:06.788 --> 05:09.191
“demonstrating how we ought to do it, 


05:09.192 --> 05:11.894
and going ahead showing the way.”


05:11.893 --> 05:15.698
Of course, on the other hand,
some religions even view


05:15.698 --> 05:18.701
the expression “elder” as a title. 


05:18.702 --> 05:21.704
You’ve probably heard of them
introducing themselves,


05:21.703 --> 05:24.606
“Good morning, I’m Elder Jackson.” 


05:24.607 --> 05:27.310
Well, of course,
none of us would want to view


05:27.310 --> 05:31.580
being an elder as a title
in the sense of a position


05:31.580 --> 05:33.683
that lords it over others. 


05:33.683 --> 05:37.386
And with that in mind,
another subtlety to the revision


05:37.387 --> 05:40.222
is seen in 1 Timothy chapter 3, 


05:40.222 --> 05:43.059
so please turn there with me, 


05:43.058 --> 05:46.928
1 Timothy 3:1. 


05:46.928 --> 05:49.665
These are well-known words


05:49.665 --> 05:54.670
—particularly when brothers are considering
the qualifications for elders—


05:54.670 --> 05:57.607
but you may or may not have seen


05:57.607 --> 06:01.377
the subtleties of the change
here in this revision. 


06:01.377 --> 06:05.949
It says now:
“This statement is trustworthy: 


06:05.948 --> 06:09.485
“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,


06:09.485 --> 06:12.988
he is desirous of a fine work.” 


06:12.988 --> 06:17.993
Do you remember before 
the original New World Translation said:


06:17.993 --> 06:22.865
‘If someone is reaching out 
for the office of being an overseer?’ 


06:22.865 --> 06:26.402
And that reflected
and no doubt was influenced


06:26.402 --> 06:30.072
by the King James 
and many of the older translations


06:30.072 --> 06:32.542
that translated it that way. 


06:32.542 --> 06:35.210
But when we look at the rest of the verse, 


06:35.210 --> 06:39.115
we see that it’s not the office,
or the position, 


06:39.115 --> 06:42.718
of being an overseer
that someone reaches out for;


06:42.718 --> 06:44.786
rather, it’s the work. 


06:44.787 --> 06:49.359
Yes, the hard work that needs 
to be done by an overseer. 


06:49.358 --> 06:52.595
An overseer recognizes


06:52.595 --> 06:57.433
that he needs to work hard
at setting the right example, 


06:57.433 --> 06:59.435
and then others will follow


06:59.435 --> 07:02.872
—rather than just telling
everyone what they should do. 


07:02.872 --> 07:06.675
So when we look at these subtleties
in the New World Translation,


07:06.675 --> 07:09.678
it only helps us to appreciate
it even more, doesn’t it?


07:09.678 --> 07:11.480
So with this in mind,


07:11.480 --> 07:15.350
what does our text this morning
help us to keep in mind? 


07:15.350 --> 07:19.222
Well, as elders, what do we need to do? 


07:19.222 --> 07:23.960
Not sit on the sidelines
barking out orders but, rather, 


07:23.960 --> 07:27.930
to take the lead,
be in the forefront, do the work,


07:27.930 --> 07:30.365
and then others will follow our example,


07:30.365 --> 07:39.258
just as we follow the example of Jesus.

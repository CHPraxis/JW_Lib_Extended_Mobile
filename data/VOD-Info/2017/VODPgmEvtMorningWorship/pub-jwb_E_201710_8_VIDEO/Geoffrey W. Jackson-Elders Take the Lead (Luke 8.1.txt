00:00 While meditating on the text this morning,
00:04 I was reminded of an experience
00:06 I had many years ago as a missionary.
00:08 At the time,
00:09 I was studying with a young man
00:11 who was training to be a pastor
00:13 in his church.
00:15 This man had got to the point where he started to attend all our meetings
00:20 while at the same time still attending his church gatherings.
00:24 The church, obviously, was very disturbed
00:27 about the fact that he was coming to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:30 and their headquarters sent in a missionary from overseas
00:33 to try and rectify the situation.
00:36 The young man told me what happened.
00:38 He said the missionary asked him,
00:40 “What is it that impresses you about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”
00:44 He said, “Well, one of the things is that they do the preaching work.”
00:48 The missionary replied,  “Well, our church can do that too.”
00:53 So the next time they had a service,
00:56 the missionary conducted the service  and with great zeal and enthusiasm
01:01 demanded that everyone in the church take part in the preaching work.
01:05 He announced the time that they would have the group to go preaching.
01:09 The young man told me  quite a number of people came along.
01:12 But there was just one thing missing, you guessed it, the missionary.
01:17 He felt that it was enough
01:19 just to encourage everybody else to do it without engaging in it himself.
01:24 How different was the example of Jesus and of our hard-working elders
01:29 who do take the lead with regard to the preaching work.
01:33 Now let’s take our Bibles and turn to a very interesting scripture
01:37 in Hebrews 13:7, 17.
01:42 Now, I’d like to highlight the beauty of the New World Translation
01:46 in these two verses.
01:48 You see at the beginning of verse 7:
01:51 “Remember those who are taking the lead among you.”
01:54 And then verse 17:
01:56 “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you.”
02:01 If you look at other Bibles, whether new or old,
02:04 most of them say “your leaders.”
02:08 Now, obviously, the New World Translation Committee
02:11 had in mind Jesus’ comments with regard
02:14 to no one being a leader among us,
02:17 and although it’s a different word in the Greek text,
02:20 still in English we can’t help but be sensitive to that matter.
02:25 And so this accurate translation of saying “taking the lead”
02:29 really summarizes, doesn’t it, what the role is of an elder.
02:33 We’re not leaders,  but we set the right example.
02:37 Now, this accurate translation is also portrayed
02:42 in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ  as recorded in Luke chapter 22,
02:46 and you’ll be interested to note
02:49 that this is part of the revision of the New World Translation text.
02:54 Luke 22:26,  it now portrays accurately
02:58 the fact that both expressions in Hebrew
03:02 and this one here are the same word.
03:05 So, Luke 22:26,
03:10 it says:  “You, though, are not to be that way.
03:13 But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest.”
03:18 And then notice:  “and the one taking the lead,”
03:21 now this is the same expression as in the Hebrews,
03:24 “as the one ministering.”
03:27 So, obviously, to take the lead means to do the work,
03:32 to be a minister, to be a servant, to serve others.
03:36 This also reminds me,  many years ago,
03:39 when I worked with the translation team in the Pacific nation of Samoa.
03:44 At that point, we were trying to select an accurate expression
03:48 to convey this thought of “taking the lead.”
03:51 And there were two words eventually that the brothers
03:54 were trying to select between,  or choose between.
03:57 One was the word ta’ita’i and the other ta’imua.
04:00 Now, you don’t have to remember those words,
04:02 but as a foreigner, I didn’t really understand
04:06 the subtleties between the difference of the two words.
04:09 So I asked the brothers,  “How can you explain to me
04:12 what these two words mean?”
04:14 So one of the brothers was very eloquent.
04:17 He said: “Well, just imagine a procession, a parade.
04:21 “So a ta’ita’i is the old man who sits
04:24 “on the side of the road barking out the orders:
04:27 “‘You should do it this way; you should do it that way.’
04:30 “The ta’imua, on the other hand,  is the one right in the front of the parade
04:35 taking the lead and everyone’s following him.”
04:38 Which word do you think we selected?
04:41 Doesn’t that summarize nicely just exactly what’s involved with being an elder?
04:46 It’s not a matter of sitting on the sidelines barking out orders
04:50 but getting involved,
04:52 setting the right example, and then others following.
04:55 And this is in harmony with one Greek lexicon
04:58 that describes this expression this way, it says,
05:01 “The concept of leading can be expressed
05:03 “by showing how to do something,
05:06 “demonstrating how we ought to do it,
05:09 and going ahead showing the way.”
05:11 Of course, on the other hand, some religions even view
05:15 the expression “elder” as a title.
05:18 You’ve probably heard of them introducing themselves,
05:21 “Good morning, I’m Elder Jackson.”
05:24 Well, of course, none of us would want to view
05:27 being an elder as a title in the sense of a position
05:31 that lords it over others.
05:33 And with that in mind, another subtlety to the revision
05:37 is seen in 1 Timothy chapter 3,
05:40 so please turn there with me,
05:43 1 Timothy 3:1.
05:46 These are well-known words
05:49 —particularly when brothers are considering the qualifications for elders—
05:54 but you may or may not have seen
05:57 the subtleties of the change here in this revision.
06:01 It says now: “This statement is trustworthy:
06:05 “If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,
06:09 he is desirous of a fine work.”
06:12 Do you remember before  the original New World Translation said:
06:17 ‘If someone is reaching out  for the office of being an overseer?’
06:22 And that reflected and no doubt was influenced
06:26 by the King James  and many of the older translations
06:30 that translated it that way.
06:32 But when we look at the rest of the verse,
06:35 we see that it’s not the office, or the position,
06:39 of being an overseer that someone reaches out for;
06:42 rather, it’s the work.
06:44 Yes, the hard work that needs  to be done by an overseer.
06:49 An overseer recognizes
06:52 that he needs to work hard at setting the right example,
06:57 and then others will follow
06:59 —rather than just telling everyone what they should do.
07:02 So when we look at these subtleties in the New World Translation,
07:06 it only helps us to appreciate it even more, doesn’t it?
07:09 So with this in mind,
07:11 what does our text this morning help us to keep in mind?
07:15 Well, as elders, what do we need to do?
07:19 Not sit on the sidelines barking out orders but, rather,
07:23 to take the lead, be in the forefront, do the work,
07:27 and then others will follow our example,
07:30 just as we follow the example of Jesus.

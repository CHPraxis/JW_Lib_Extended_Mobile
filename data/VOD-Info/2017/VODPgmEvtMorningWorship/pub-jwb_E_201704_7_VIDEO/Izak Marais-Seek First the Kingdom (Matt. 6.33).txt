00:01 Our text for discussion today,
00:03 here at Matthew 6:33,
00:06 contains two parts.
00:08 The first part is what we have to do;
00:12 it says:  “Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom
00:15 and his righteousness.”
00:18 The second part is what Jehovah will do:
00:21 “And all these other things  will be added to you.”
00:25 We think carefully about these words.
00:29 Jesus actually was educating his disciples
00:33 to make a dramatic change  in their lifestyle.
00:37 What do we mean by that?
00:39 Well, look at verse 31.
00:41 He says: “So never be anxious and say,
00:46 “‘What are we to eat?’  or, ‘What are we to drink?’
00:50 or, ‘What are we to wear?’”
00:52 Did Jesus say never?
00:55 Yes!
00:57 But those are the things we normally do.
00:59 We are anxious about our existence,
01:03 and Jesus recognizes  that most people are that way.
01:07 He says in verse 32:
01:09 “For all these are the things
01:11 the nations are eagerly pursuing.”
01:15 But then he says:
01:17 “Your heavenly Father knows  that you need all these things.”
01:23 Here in this chapter,
01:25 Jesus outlines a number  of very important principles
01:30 that actually change the way we look at life
01:34 and the way we see our existence
01:37 in relationship to Jehovah God.
01:39 He puts service to Jehovah
01:43 in the first place,
01:45 regardless of our circumstances.
01:48 Let us have a look  at two of these principles.
01:50 The one that’s here   at Matthew 6:24,
01:54 he says:
01:56 “No one can slave for two masters;
02:00 “for either he will hate the one  and love the other,
02:04 “or he will stick to the one  and despise the other.
02:08 “You cannot slave
02:10 for God and for Riches.”
02:13 It is just not possible.
02:15 Some have tried, but they’ve failed.
02:18 Satan approached Jesus and said to him:  ‘I will give you riches.
02:23 I’ll give you all the kingdoms  of the world and their glory.’
02:27 Of course, Jesus refused.  Why?
02:30 Because he knew  there was a price attached to it.
02:34 What is the price?
02:36 Worship
02:38 —divided worship— which is impossible.
02:40 He knew that it is impossible
02:42 to worship both Jehovah and Riches.
02:45 In verse 21, Jesus says:
02:49 “For where your treasure is,
02:51 there your heart will be also.”
02:58 The second principle is in verse 25:
03:03 “On this account I say to you:
03:07 “Stop being anxious about your lives
03:11 “as to what you will eat  or what you will drink,
03:14 or about your bodies  as to what you will wear.”
03:17 And here is the principle:
03:19 “Does not life mean more than food
03:23 and the body [more] than clothing?”
03:27 You can have a storehouse full of food;
03:29 if you don’t have life, you cannot eat it.
03:33 You can have a warehouse full of clothes;
03:36 but if there’s no body, you cannot wear it.
03:40 Jesus illustrated this principle  beautifully in Luke.
03:45 Turn to Luke
03:47 chapter 12
03:50 and from verse 16:
03:54 “With that he told them an illustration,  saying:
03:57 “‘The land of a rich man produced well.
04:00 “‘So he began reasoning within himself,
04:02 “‘“What should I do now  that I have nowhere to gather my crops?”
04:06 “‘Then he said, “I will do this:
04:08 “‘“I will tear down my storehouses  and build bigger ones,
04:12 “‘“and there I will gather  all my grain and all my goods,
04:17 “‘“and I will say to myself:
04:19 “‘“‘You have many good things  stored up for many years;
04:22 “‘“‘take it easy, eat,  drink, enjoy yourself.’”
04:26 “‘But God said to him,
04:28 “‘“Unreasonable one,
04:31 “‘“this night they are demanding  your life from you.
04:34 “‘“Who, then, is to have  the things you stored up?”
04:38 “‘So it goes with the man  who stores up treasure for himself
04:43 but is not rich toward God.’”
04:47 Jesus didn’t say this man was dishonest
04:51 or that he’d never thought about God.
04:54 The mistake the man made was
04:57 that his priorities were wrong.
05:00 He focused primarily on amassing wealth.
05:04 He did not do what it says in verse 21.
05:08 He did not store up treasure for himself—
05:11 He ‘stored up treasure for himself,’
05:13 but did not store up treasure  with God in heaven.
05:17 He was “not rich toward God.”
05:19 And that is the key element, isn’t it?
05:22 Our service to Jehovah God,
05:25 our life for Jehovah,
05:27 that is the key element.
05:29 And as Jesus says in verse 15,
05:32 the second part of verse 15:
05:34 “Because even when a person  has an abundance,
05:38 “his life does not result
05:41 from the things he possesses.”
05:43 So these are
05:45 the two very important principles  we’ve covered.
05:48 First of all,
05:50 make our service to God a priority
05:53 and not amassing wealth.
05:56 And the second one:
05:58 “Keep on, then,  seeking first the Kingdom
06:01 “and [God’s] righteousness,
06:03 and all these other things  will be added to you.”
06:07 We do not know precisely  when the end will come,
06:10 but we want to keep on  seeking first the Kingdom.
06:14 Rather than putting our trust  in the securities of this world,
06:18 we want to put our trust  in our heavenly Father.
06:23 Jehovah gives everything;
06:26 he gives more than what we need.
06:29 In Ecclesiastes 5:19,
06:33 it summarizes this whole principle.
06:36 It establishes the truth —the reality of the matter.
06:41 It says, Ecclesiastes 5:19:
06:46 “Also, when the true God  gives a man riches
06:50 “and material possessions
06:53 “along with the ability to enjoy them,
06:57 “he should take his reward
07:00 “and rejoice in his hard work.
07:02 This is the gift of God.”

00:02.285 --> 00:05.122
Our text, Ecclesiastes 7:8, 


00:05.122 --> 00:07.124
says in its entirety: 


00:07.123 --> 00:09.191
‘Better is the end of a matter 


00:09.192 --> 00:11.027
than the beginning.’ 


00:11.027 --> 00:13.630
But then it adds: 
‘Better to be patient


00:13.630 --> 00:16.298
than to show a haughty spirit.’ 


00:16.298 --> 00:18.368
Well, if we’re patient, 


00:18.368 --> 00:21.470
sometimes a very grim-looking circumstance 


00:21.470 --> 00:23.740
becomes much better in the end 


00:23.740 --> 00:26.675
than we could have ever imagined 
at the beginning. 


00:26.675 --> 00:29.378
Well, do we have a Bible example 


00:29.378 --> 00:32.115
where this principle 
actually plays out that way? 


00:32.115 --> 00:35.418
First Kings chapter 20, please


00:35.418 --> 00:38.053
—1 Kings 20. 


00:38.053 --> 00:42.758
King Ben-hadad of Syria 
and 32 other kings 


00:42.758 --> 00:44.860
are fighting against Israel. 


00:44.860 --> 00:49.598
So the beginning 
is not looking very good for Israel. 


00:49.598 --> 00:53.135
In fact, if you look at verse 7, 
1 Kings 20:7, 


00:53.135 --> 00:56.840
it says that “the king of Israel 
called all the elders of the land and said: 


00:56.840 --> 01:00.510
“‘Take note, please, 
and see that this man [Ben-hadad] 


01:00.510 --> 01:03.178
“‘is bent on bringing calamity, 


01:03.178 --> 01:07.083
“‘for he demanded my wives, 
my sons, my silver, and my gold, 


01:07.083 --> 01:09.885
and I did not refuse him.’” 


01:09.885 --> 01:13.823
Well, pretty bleak-looking circumstances. 


01:13.823 --> 01:16.191
But then after another interchange 
between the two kings, 


01:16.192 --> 01:19.429
it’s obvious that Ben-hadad 
was haughty. 


01:19.428 --> 01:23.500
In verse 10, you can almost see him 
swaggering when he says: 


01:23.500 --> 01:26.135
“So may the gods do to me and add to it 


01:26.135 --> 01:28.772
“if there is enough dust in Samaria 


01:28.772 --> 01:32.509
to give each of the people 
following me a handful!” 


01:32.508 --> 01:36.745
Well, again, 
the beginning looks grim. 


01:36.745 --> 01:40.015
But then Ahab, in response, 


01:40.015 --> 01:43.318
he basically uses 
the principle of our text for today. 


01:43.318 --> 01:46.021
In verse 11: 
“The king of Israel answered: 


01:46.022 --> 01:51.027
“‘Tell him, “The one who puts on his armor 
[you see, in the beginning] 


01:51.027 --> 01:53.129
“‘“should not boast about himself 


01:53.128 --> 01:56.966
like one who takes it off 
[in the end].”’” 


01:56.967 --> 02:00.069
Well, the end of the matter 
proved much better for Israel. 


02:00.068 --> 02:02.071
Verse 21 says that the king of Israel 


02:02.072 --> 02:05.542
“inflicted a great defeat on the Syrians.” 


02:05.542 --> 02:09.412
Better was the end of the matter 
than its beginning.


02:09.412 --> 02:13.584
Well, do we have another example 
where it states it very similarly? 


02:13.583 --> 02:16.485
Yes, Judges
—Judges 15. 


02:16.485 --> 02:18.755
This is one of the accounts 
about Samson, 


02:18.755 --> 02:21.290
and Samson wreaked havoc. 


02:21.290 --> 02:24.493
He wreaked destruction 
upon the Philistines. 


02:24.493 --> 02:26.695
So much so 
that they are now coming 


02:26.695 --> 02:29.032
to Judah in all-out revenge. 


02:29.032 --> 02:30.834
Well, the men of Judah realized this, 


02:30.833 --> 02:33.401
and they’re worried 
about being slaughtered. 


02:33.402 --> 02:35.505
So they caught up with Samson 


02:35.505 --> 02:38.642
and handed him 
over to the Philistines. 


02:38.642 --> 02:41.210
In 15:13 


02:41.210 --> 02:45.080
the situation appears grim 
for Samson at first. 


02:45.080 --> 02:47.150
Thirteen says in the last sentence: 


02:47.150 --> 02:51.753
“They bound him with two new ropes 
and brought him up from the crag.” 


02:51.753 --> 02:53.723
Well, the haughty Philistines were thrilled 


02:53.723 --> 02:56.391
to have him bound 
and just handed over to them. 


02:56.392 --> 02:59.562
In fact, in verse 14 it says: 
“When he came to Lehi, 


02:59.562 --> 03:02.999
the Philistines shouted triumphantly 
at meeting him.” 


03:02.998 --> 03:05.768
They couldn’t wait 
to get their hands on him. 


03:05.768 --> 03:09.871
Well, how did the situation for Samson 


03:09.872 --> 03:13.109
prove better in the end 
than at the beginning? 


03:13.108 --> 03:15.978
Well, the verse says 
that “Jehovah’s spirit empowered him” 


03:15.978 --> 03:18.480
and the fetters 
just “melted off his hands.” 


03:18.480 --> 03:20.517
And then in 15 and 16, 


03:20.517 --> 03:23.920
Samson finds the jawbone of a donkey 


03:23.920 --> 03:26.722
and he struck down 
a thousand Philistines. 


03:26.722 --> 03:31.294
For Samson, the end of the matter 
was better than the beginning.


03:31.293 --> 03:33.295
Well, how about Job? 


03:33.295 --> 03:35.298
Job 42


03:35.298 --> 03:37.666
—Job 42. 


03:37.667 --> 03:40.537
We’re all familiar with how Job’s tests 


03:40.537 --> 03:43.405
in the beginning were so trialsome


03:43.405 --> 03:46.142
—one tragic circumstance after another—


03:46.142 --> 03:48.712
and then he was humiliated 
with verbal abuse 


03:48.712 --> 03:50.647
from his false comforters. 


03:50.647 --> 03:53.950
It can’t get much worse than that. 


03:53.950 --> 03:56.752
But because 
of his endurance and patience, 


03:56.752 --> 03:58.722
how did it turn out in the end? 


03:58.722 --> 04:02.992
Well, verse 12 sounds very much 
like our text for today. 


04:02.992 --> 04:05.027
Job 42:12, it says: 


04:05.027 --> 04:09.065
“So Jehovah blessed 
the last part of Job’s life 


04:09.065 --> 04:11.433
more than the beginning.”


04:11.433 --> 04:15.170
Well, how has this scripture, 


04:15.170 --> 04:17.573
Ecclesiastes 7:8, 
been treated in our literature? 


04:17.573 --> 04:18.975
How has it been applied? 


04:18.975 --> 04:20.977
A couple of examples: 


04:20.977 --> 04:25.000
A 1998 Watchtower applied it 
to parents counseling their children. 


04:26.648 --> 04:30.185
Now, for some during their teen years, 


04:30.185 --> 04:32.222
they go through a phase in life 


04:32.222 --> 04:35.592
and their attitude 
is very frustrating to the parent. 


04:35.592 --> 04:38.829
In fact, during the teen years, 
sometimes a parent will think, 


04:38.828 --> 04:40.796
‘There’s no hope for this child.’ 


04:40.797 --> 04:44.367
But if they’re patient, 
what often results? 


04:44.367 --> 04:47.904
Oh, we’ve read countless experiences 
in our magazines 


04:47.903 --> 04:51.706
and heard them on JW Broadcasting 
of a wayward teen 


04:51.707 --> 04:55.000
who is now an adult 
faithfully serving Jehovah. 


04:56.312 --> 04:59.449
Better was the end of the matter 
than its beginning. 


04:59.448 --> 05:04.286
A 1994 Watchtower applied this 
to one who feels 


05:04.287 --> 05:06.822
that he’s being overlooked 
for privileges. 


05:06.822 --> 05:09.959
Well, instead of manifesting 
a prideful spirit, 


05:09.958 --> 05:12.261
how much better to wait patiently. 


05:12.262 --> 05:15.899
In time, when that privilege 
comes our way, 


05:15.898 --> 05:19.968
the end of the matter 
is much better than at first.


05:19.968 --> 05:22.005
Some years ago, 


05:22.005 --> 05:24.073
an older brother 
who had been serving as an elder 


05:24.073 --> 05:26.175
moved to a new congregation. 


05:26.175 --> 05:30.380
Well, the elders in the new congregation 
did not reappoint him right away. 


05:30.380 --> 05:33.115
A couple of years went by, 
and he was appointed 


05:33.115 --> 05:37.187
as a ministerial servant, 
not an elder. 


05:37.187 --> 05:39.422
Well, a couple more years went by, 


05:39.422 --> 05:43.192
and the former elder 
is now doing a slow burn inside. 


05:43.192 --> 05:46.029
And it manifested itself 
in his comments, 


05:46.028 --> 05:50.198
even being critical of some 
of the decisions of the elders. 


05:50.198 --> 05:53.000
Well, please find 
Philippians 2 with me. 


05:54.903 --> 05:59.508
One of the elders on that body 
spoke to the brother, 


05:59.508 --> 06:03.445
and he explained 
that with his current disturbed attitude, 


06:03.445 --> 06:08.183
it was very unlikely the body of elders
would welcome him aboard. 


06:08.183 --> 06:12.921
He explained that his attitude 
was rooted in his view of position. 


06:12.922 --> 06:16.292
And the elder used Philippians 2:5-9. 


06:16.292 --> 06:20.997
Now, verse 5 counsels that we’re to have 
the “mental attitude” of Jesus. 


06:20.997 --> 06:24.234
Well, what was Jesus’ attitude 
about position? 


06:24.233 --> 06:27.870
Verse 6
—it’s talking about position—


06:27.870 --> 06:32.508
it says that Jesus did not try 
to seize Jehovah’s position. 


06:32.508 --> 06:36.878
And verse 7, 
just the opposite of going up the ladder, 


06:36.878 --> 06:39.881
Jesus was willing 
to go down the ladder 


06:39.882 --> 06:43.285
to assume a lower position
—become a human. 


06:43.285 --> 06:45.822
And then verse 8 says: 


06:45.822 --> 06:50.359
“More than that, when he came as a man, 
he humbled himself 


06:50.358 --> 06:53.061
and became obedient to the point of death, 


06:53.062 --> 06:55.799
yes, death on a torture stake.” 


06:55.798 --> 06:58.366
And then the bottom line, 
in verse 9: 


06:58.367 --> 07:00.970
“For this very reason.” 


07:00.970 --> 07:02.972
For what reason? 


07:02.972 --> 07:05.909
Because of Jesus’ humble attitude 


07:05.908 --> 07:08.010
in accepting a lesser assignment 


07:08.010 --> 07:09.978
to do Jehovah’s further will. 


07:09.978 --> 07:11.180
And what was the result? 


07:11.180 --> 07:12.915
The verse continues: 


07:12.915 --> 07:16.485
“For this very reason, 
God exalted him to a superior position 


07:16.485 --> 07:19.488
and . . . gave him [a] name . . . 
above every other name.”


07:19.488 --> 07:22.125
Well, the elder 
asked the brother if he thought 


07:22.125 --> 07:26.628
that he was manifesting 
the “mental attitude” of Jesus, 


07:26.628 --> 07:29.498
and that brother said, “No.” 


07:29.498 --> 07:33.803
He said, “I’m too caught up 
in the position of being an elder.” 


07:33.803 --> 07:36.905
So the elder asked him, 
“Well, what are you going to do?” 


07:36.905 --> 07:38.908
The older brother said, 


07:38.908 --> 07:43.045
“I need to reach out 
for the office of overseer all over again 


07:43.045 --> 07:46.448
and stop sulking about my position.” 


07:46.448 --> 07:48.783
Well, what was the result? 


07:48.783 --> 07:51.953
For years he had not been reappointed 
as an elder. 


07:51.953 --> 07:55.056
Six months after that conversation, 


07:55.057 --> 07:57.527
the body of elders 
unanimously recommended 


07:57.527 --> 07:59.529
he be appointed as an elder. 


07:59.528 --> 08:01.530
Why? 


08:01.530 --> 08:03.732
Ecclesiastes 7:8:


08:03.732 --> 08:07.737
“Better to be patient than . . . 
haughty in spirit.” 


08:07.737 --> 08:11.140
Well, that older brother, 
he died some years later, 


08:11.140 --> 08:13.742
happily serving as an elder. 


08:13.742 --> 08:17.814
Better was the end of the matter 
than its beginning.


08:17.813 --> 08:20.000
Another application of the verse: 


08:22.652 --> 08:24.720
In the beginning, 
in the rebellion in Eden, 


08:24.720 --> 08:26.588
it looked very bleak 
for the human family. 


08:26.588 --> 08:29.325
But Jehovah had an arrangement 
to rectify matters, 


08:29.325 --> 08:31.993
Jesus cooperated, 
and what does that result in 


08:31.993 --> 08:34.296
for you and me if we remain faithful? 


08:34.297 --> 08:36.099
No question about it


08:36.098 --> 08:39.435
—our reward at the end of this system 


08:39.435 --> 08:48.428
will be better than at the first!

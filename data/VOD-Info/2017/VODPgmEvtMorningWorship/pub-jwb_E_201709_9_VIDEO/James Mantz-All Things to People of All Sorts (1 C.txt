00:01 “He was at ease
00:02 “with sophisticated intellectuals
00:04 “and with humble tentmakers.
00:07 “He was persuasive to Roman dignitaries
00:10 “and to Phrygian peasants.
00:13 “His writings were motivating  to liberal Greeks
00:16 and to conservative Jews.”
00:19 That’s how the December 1, 2005,  issue of The Watchtower
00:24 described the inspired writer  of today’s text.
00:28 Certainly,  the apostle Paul was a master
00:32 of becoming  “all things to people of all sorts.”
00:36 Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 20.
00:39 We’re going to read verse 21.
00:42 With these words,  Paul describes his commission as an apostle.
00:46 As we read Acts 20:21,
00:49 notice the broad scope of his territory
00:52 and also the purpose of his ministry.
00:57 He said:  “But I thoroughly bore witness
01:00 “both to Jews and to Greeks
01:02 “about repentance toward God
01:04 and faith in our Lord Jesus.”
01:09 Like the apostle Paul,
01:11 we too have a commission  to preach to people of all sorts.
01:15 But is it too much to ask us  to imitate Paul’s example?
01:20 Think about it.
01:22 Paul had the advantage  of being well-educated.
01:25 He was part of the privileged class  of Roman citizens.
01:29 He held a powerful position as a Pharisee.
01:33 None of us have those qualifications.
01:37 But are these the things that qualified Paul
01:40 as a minister of the good news?
01:43 It’s true,  his being a distinguished lawyer
01:46 no doubt helped him to defend  and legally establish the good news.
01:50 But on the other hand,
01:52 Paul’s background created obstacles  that he had to overcome.
01:57 Only then could he preach  to people of all sorts.
02:02 Paul was a Jewish Pharisee
02:05 and that name Pharisee  means “Separated Ones.”
02:09 This may refer to the fact  that the Pharisees
02:12 maintained a very strict separation  from Gentiles.
02:17 Then Jehovah picked Paul to be an apostle.
02:22 And to whom?
02:24 To the Gentiles.
02:25 No doubt,  Paul had to do a lot of soul-searching
02:28 to overcome his former prejudices
02:30 in order to carry out  his commission to preach.
02:35 Paul’s need to make major changes
02:38 reminds me of a man  in North Carolina some years ago.
02:42 He served as the minister  of a large Methodist church
02:45 for over 25 years;
02:48 then he came into the truth.
02:50 This man had preached hundreds,  if not thousands, of sermons.
02:54 With such a background,  you would think
02:56 that public speaking  would be easy for him.
03:00 And yet, he said  one of the hardest things he ever had to do
03:04 was to stand up in front  of the congregation in the Kingdom Hall
03:08 and deliver a five-minute Bible reading.
03:11 No doubt,  the apostle Paul’s example
03:14 was a source of encouragement  to this humble brother.
03:18 Truly,  the Kingdom good news
03:20 is a message for all peoples.
03:24 But when it comes  to preaching the good news,
03:27 unlike many baseball caps,
03:30 one size does not fit all.
03:33 Like Paul, to be effective,
03:36 we have to be adaptable in the way  that we present the good news.
03:40 So let’s consider three key qualities
03:43 that helped to make Paul  an effective minister.
03:47 Paul was attentive,
03:49 he was flexible,
03:51 and he was resourceful.
03:53 Consider how he was attentive.
03:56 Paul understood the background  and the beliefs of his audience.
04:01 Consider what happened when he was asked
04:04 to appear before King Agrippa II.
04:08 Please open your Bibles to Acts chapter 26.
04:12 We’re going to read verses 2 and 3,
04:15 and we notice from these verses
04:17 that Paul first commended Agrippa  on his being well-versed
04:22 in the background  of the people he was ruling.
04:26 Acts 26:2,3,  it says:
04:30 “Concerning all the things  of which I am accused
04:32 “by the Jews, King Agrippa,
04:34 “I consider myself happy  that it is before you
04:37 “I am to make my defense this day,
04:39 “especially because you are  an expert on all the customs
04:43 “as well as the controversies  among the Jews.
04:46 Therefore,  I beg you to hear me patiently.”
04:53 Paul was not trying to flatter the king.
04:57 He was simply using  his knowledge of his audience
05:01 to establish a common ground  on which he could begin to preach.
05:06 Paul was flexible.
05:08 Consider what happened  when he and Barnabas
05:11 entered the city of Lystra to preach.
05:13 The account is recorded  in Acts chapter 14.
05:18 The audience that they met there in Lystra
05:20 was totally different  from that of King Agrippa
05:24 and the one hundred dignitaries  who may have been in the group with him.
05:28 This crowd in Lystra
05:30 was made up of a less educated
05:32 and more superstitious part
05:36 of the population.
05:38 When they healed a man  who had been lame from birth,
05:41 the crowd cried out:
05:43 “The gods have become  like humans and have come down to us!”
05:46 They even wanted to offer up  sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas.
05:50 Obviously,  Paul could not reason with those people
05:54 on the basis of their superstitions.
05:58 Rather,  he told the crowd that he and Barnabas
06:01 were imperfect humans just like them.
06:03 And then he turned  their attention away from puny humans
06:08 and directed it  to the grand creation and our living God,
06:13 the one “who made the heaven and the earth
06:16 and the sea and all the things in them.”
06:20 And that was enough to restrain the crowd
06:23 from offering those sacrifices.
06:26 A third quality of Paul  was that he was resourceful.
06:30 If Paul had had the Ministry School book  back there in the first century,
06:34 we would probably say  that he did well on point number 46,
06:39 “Illustrations From Familiar Situations.”
06:43 Paul used common,  easily understood illustrations
06:47 to clarify complex spiritual matters.
06:52 For example,  the Romans were familiar with slavery.
06:56 In fact,  many recipients of his letter to the Romans
06:59 may have themselves been slaves.
07:02 So Paul used slavery to illustrate  the great change in ownership
07:07 that had taken place  when these individuals became Christians.
07:11 Romans 6:18 says:
07:13 “Yes, since you were set free from sin,
07:16 you became slaves to righteousness.”
07:21 Our brothers around the world
07:23 are showing themselves  to be attentive, flexible,
07:26 and resourceful as they preach  to people of every background imaginable.
07:31 For example,
07:33 many people in the Far East are concerned
07:35 about things that affect them personally,
07:37 such as health,  child training, and education.
07:41 So our brothers there  effectively use those subjects
07:44 to begin conversations.
07:46 However,  that may not work as well
07:49 in certain cities  in the United States
07:51 where people may be  more concerned with corruption,
07:54 traffic congestion, and crime.
07:58 But no matter what topic  we use to introduce the truth,
08:03 to be effective Bible teachers,
08:05 it is important for us  to remain positive and encouraging
08:10 and to stress the practical value
08:14 of applying Bible principles.
08:17 With the help of God’s holy spirit,
08:19 the apostle Paul was able to overcome
08:21 personal obstacles and prejudices
08:24 to become  an outstanding minister of the good news.
08:28 It’s true,  we may not meet a Roman dignitary
08:31 or a Phrygian peasant  as we go about our territory,
08:35 but with Jehovah’s help,
08:37 we can imitate Paul’s example  of an effective minister
08:40 by being attentive,  flexible, and resourceful.
08:45 Why do we make this effort?
08:48 We do it because we want  to “become all things to people of all sorts,
08:53 so that [we]  might by all possible means save some.”

00:01 You know,  there are many people today
00:03 who say that we’re not living  in the time of the end.
00:06 They say: “The world is just  the same as it’s always been.
00:10 There are no real changes  that have taken place.”
00:13 But, of course,  we know they’re deceiving themselves.
00:16 Never before have  so many people around the globe
00:20 openly practiced and flaunted
00:24 sexual immorality,
00:26 not just among themselves
00:28 but they’re seeing  that it’s brought into the homes
00:30 by means of Internet,  television, and other means.
00:35 Never before has man had the power
00:38 to decimate entire populations
00:41 by dropping just one bomb
00:44 or by means of chemical warfare.
00:49 Never before has there been
00:51 such widespread lack of love
00:54 and of natural affection
00:57 that results in the death of children.
01:01 It’s interesting that some calculate
01:04 that over one billion abortions
01:09 have taken place since 1980.
01:14 That’s really something.
01:16 That’s just about the population of China
01:19 —if you can imagine.
01:21 And that is something that’s accepted;
01:24 it’s commonplace in our day.
01:27 So some people think,  ‘Well, things haven’t changed.’
01:30 But is that true?
01:32 No, quite to the contrary.
01:34 And something else  that we’re fully aware of
01:36 is that people around the earth
01:38 are making a garbage dump  out of the planet that we live on
01:42 —polluting the air, the seas,
01:46 the land.
01:48 And yet, some still insist  that things haven’t changed.
01:52 Now, why is it?
01:53 Why do people have that attitude?
01:56 Well, part of it lies in  what the Scriptures tell us,
01:59 what Paul wrote  at 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4.
02:02 And there it says that Satan  ‘blinds the minds of the unbelievers.’
02:07 And the “unbelievers”  are not just atheists.
02:09 The “unbelievers” are found  throughout the churches of Christendom.
02:13 They don’t believe —really believe—
02:15 what the Bible has to say  about prophecy,
02:18 about morality,
02:20 or that God is really going to clean up this planet
02:23 and that it’s going to be a wonderful new world
02:26 of peace and happiness.
02:28 And so to help people  understand these things,
02:30 we go out and we preach.
02:32 We tell them  about what Matthew 24 says
02:35 and Mark 13  and Luke 21 and 2 Timothy 3
02:39 —that we’re living in the time of the end.
02:41 But there is something  we have to remember
02:43 if we get a little bit discouraged
02:45 when people don’t respond  as we feel they should
02:48 to all of the evidence  that we see and we appreciate.
02:53 The Bible indicates very clearly
02:56 that many people would not see the sign;
02:59 they would not accept  what the Bible has to say.
03:03 And what’s most interesting about that
03:05 is that the people who ignore
03:08 and who deny the sign  that we’re living in the time of the end
03:11 are part of the sign themselves
03:14 —what they do and the way they think.
03:17 Turn to Second Peter
03:23 —2 Peter chapter 3.
03:27 And we’ll read verses 3 and 4 and the first line in verse 5
03:32 —2 Peter 3:3, 4  and the first line in verse 5.
03:37 Peter wrote: “First of all know this,  that in the last days,”
03:41 so this is something Peter is saying  would happen during our time,
03:45 “ridiculers will come with their ridicule,
03:48 “proceeding according to their own desires
03:50 “and saying:  ‘Where is this promised presence of his?
03:53 “‘Why, from the day  our forefathers fell asleep in death,
03:56 “‘all things are continuing exactly
03:59 as they were from creation’s beginning.’”
04:02 And then the reason for it  is given in the next line:
04:05 “For they deliberately ignore this fact.”
04:08 Well, here the fact was that they  ignored the Flood of Noah’s day.
04:11 The fact for us today is that they  ignore what the Bible clearly says
04:15 or what Jesus said would be  the sign of the last days.
04:20 So they don’t realize it,  but they’re part of the fulfillment.
04:23 What contributes to an unbelieving attitude?
04:27 Well, one of the things  is what we could call gradualism.
04:31 The Watchtower  of January 15, 2014, paragraph 30,
04:36 or page 30,  paragraph 11 stated the following:
04:40 “It seems  that the more familiar a situation is,
04:43 “the less people  are inclined to pay attention to it.
04:46 “A steady decline in the morality
04:48 “of society in general  may seem less shocking
04:51 “than a sudden, unexpected change
04:53 in the behavior of a close acquaintance.”
04:55 And then it says:  “Nevertheless,
04:57 this gradual decay of morality is dangerous.”
05:01 And isn’t it true  that most of us were raised
05:05 in an environment  that was not so good?
05:08 There were immoral things  taking place around us, wars, crime.
05:13 And so people get to the point  where they accept it as normal.
05:16 And as it escalates,
05:18 it really doesn’t impress  on them that ‘No!
05:22 ‘Times have changed.
05:23 They’re becoming far worse than ever before.’
05:27 Gradual decay of morality is dangerous.
05:31 It makes me think of an illustration
05:34 about how to boil a frog.
05:37 If you heat up a pot
05:40 and you have the water boiling  and drop a frog into it,
05:43 what’s going to happen?
05:45 He’s out of there;  he’s not going to stay.
05:47 That frog isn’t stupid.
05:48 He hits the water,  and it’s terribly hot, and out he jumps.
05:52 But if you fill the pot with cool water,
05:55 drop the frog in,
05:57 and then  gradually (little by little) you heat it up
06:01 until it gets to the boiling point,
06:03 he’s cooked!
06:05 And that’s what’s happening  in the world today.
06:08 The gradualism is not perceived  by people in the world,
06:13 but they’re being cooked.
06:15 It’s getting hot.
06:17 And so we know that wicked men
06:19 are going to continue to increase
06:21 —impostors,  scoffing at the truth.
06:25 World conditions are escalating;  they’re getting worse constantly.
06:29 But they’re going to have to deal  with the Creator and his judgment.
06:33 And there are three Psalms  I’d like to just mention briefly
06:37 that I find very interesting  that tie in nicely
06:39 with the wickedness of the world  and what Jehovah will do.
06:43 Psalm 10:4:
06:45 “In his haughtiness, the wicked man makes no investigation;
06:50 “all his thoughts are:
06:52 ‘There is no God.’”
06:55 Psalm 12:8:
06:57 “The wicked walk around unrestrained
07:00 because the sons of men  promote depravity.”
07:03 That could’ve been  this morning’s headlines
07:06 in The New York Times.
07:08 And the last,  Psalm 92:7:
07:11 “When the wicked sprout like weeds
07:13 “and all the wrongdoers flourish,
07:16 it is that they  may be annihilated forever.”
07:20 And to that we say:
07:22 “Amen. So be it!”

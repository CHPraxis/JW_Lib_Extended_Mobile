00:01.583 --> 00:03.586
You know, 
there are many people today


00:03.587 --> 00:06.622
who say that we’re not living 
in the time of the end. 


00:06.622 --> 00:10.227
They say: “The world is just 
the same as it’s always been. 


00:10.227 --> 00:13.564
There are no real changes 
that have taken place.” 


00:13.563 --> 00:16.733
But, of course, 
we know they’re deceiving themselves. 


00:16.733 --> 00:20.803
Never before have 
so many people around the globe 


00:20.803 --> 00:24.073
openly practiced and flaunted 


00:24.073 --> 00:26.275
sexual immorality, 


00:26.275 --> 00:28.378
not just among themselves 


00:28.378 --> 00:30.680
but they’re seeing 
that it’s brought into the homes 


00:30.680 --> 00:35.252
by means of Internet, 
television, and other means. 


00:35.252 --> 00:38.287
Never before has man had the power 


00:38.287 --> 00:41.357
to decimate entire populations 


00:41.357 --> 00:44.694
by dropping just one bomb 


00:44.693 --> 00:48.000
or by means of chemical warfare. 


00:49.032 --> 00:51.034
Never before has there been 


00:51.033 --> 00:54.936
such widespread lack of love 


00:54.937 --> 00:57.374
and of natural affection 


00:57.373 --> 01:01.310
that results in the death of children.


01:01.310 --> 01:04.647
It’s interesting that some calculate 


01:04.647 --> 01:09.952
that over one billion abortions 


01:09.952 --> 01:14.090
have taken place since 1980. 


01:14.090 --> 01:16.292
That’s really something. 


01:16.292 --> 01:19.562
That’s just about the population of China


01:19.562 --> 01:21.564
—if you can imagine.


01:21.563 --> 01:24.500
And that is something that’s accepted; 


01:24.500 --> 01:27.303
it’s commonplace in our day. 


01:27.303 --> 01:30.071
So some people think, 
‘Well, things haven’t changed.’ 


01:30.072 --> 01:32.075
But is that true? 


01:32.075 --> 01:34.077
No, quite to the contrary. 


01:34.077 --> 01:36.212
And something else 
that we’re fully aware of 


01:36.212 --> 01:38.982
is that people around the earth 


01:38.982 --> 01:42.652
are making a garbage dump 
out of the planet that we live on


01:42.652 --> 01:46.122
—polluting the air, the seas, 


01:46.122 --> 01:48.224
the land. 


01:48.223 --> 01:52.395
And yet, some still insist 
that things haven’t changed. 


01:52.395 --> 01:53.663
Now, why is it? 


01:53.663 --> 01:56.598
Why do people have that attitude? 


01:56.598 --> 01:59.335
Well, part of it lies in 
what the Scriptures tell us, 


01:59.335 --> 02:02.838
what Paul wrote 
at 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4. 


02:02.838 --> 02:07.043
And there it says that Satan 
‘blinds the minds of the unbelievers.’ 


02:07.043 --> 02:09.945
And the “unbelievers” 
are not just atheists. 


02:09.945 --> 02:13.783
The “unbelievers” are found 
throughout the churches of Christendom. 


02:13.783 --> 02:15.785
They don’t believe
—really believe—


02:15.785 --> 02:18.688
what the Bible has to say 
about prophecy, 


02:18.688 --> 02:20.956
about morality, 


02:20.957 --> 02:23.927
or that God is really going
to clean up this planet 


02:23.927 --> 02:26.429
and that it’s going to be
a wonderful new world


02:26.428 --> 02:28.598
of peace and happiness. 


02:28.598 --> 02:30.700
And so to help people 
understand these things,


02:30.700 --> 02:32.268
we go out and we preach. 


02:32.268 --> 02:35.505
We tell them 
about what Matthew 24 says


02:35.505 --> 02:39.408
and Mark 13 
and Luke 21 and 2 Timothy 3


02:39.408 --> 02:41.543
—that we’re living in the time of the end. 


02:41.543 --> 02:43.546
But there is something 
we have to remember 


02:43.547 --> 02:45.382
if we get a little bit discouraged 


02:45.382 --> 02:48.284
when people don’t respond 
as we feel they should 


02:48.283 --> 02:52.000
to all of the evidence 
that we see and we appreciate.


02:53.790 --> 02:56.558
The Bible indicates very clearly 


02:56.558 --> 02:59.861
that many people would not see the sign; 


02:59.862 --> 03:03.634
they would not accept 
what the Bible has to say. 


03:03.633 --> 03:05.868
And what’s most interesting about that 


03:05.868 --> 03:08.136
is that the people who ignore 


03:08.137 --> 03:11.942
and who deny the sign 
that we’re living in the time of the end 


03:11.942 --> 03:14.377
are part of the sign themselves


03:14.377 --> 03:17.147
—what they do and the way they think. 


03:17.147 --> 03:20.000
Turn to Second Peter


03:23.987 --> 03:27.857
—2 Peter chapter 3. 


03:27.857 --> 03:32.695
And we’ll read verses 3 and 4
and the first line in verse 5


03:32.695 --> 03:37.467
—2 Peter 3:3, 4 
and the first line in verse 5. 


03:37.467 --> 03:41.204
Peter wrote: “First of all know this, 
that in the last days,” 


03:41.203 --> 03:45.641
so this is something Peter is saying 
would happen during our time, 


03:45.642 --> 03:48.010
“ridiculers will come with their ridicule, 


03:48.010 --> 03:50.613
“proceeding according to their own desires 


03:50.613 --> 03:53.850
“and saying: 
‘Where is this promised presence of his? 


03:53.850 --> 03:56.752
“‘Why, from the day 
our forefathers fell asleep in death, 


03:56.752 --> 03:59.622
“‘all things are continuing exactly 


03:59.622 --> 04:02.492
as they were from creation’s beginning.’” 


04:02.492 --> 04:05.160
And then the reason for it 
is given in the next line: 


04:05.160 --> 04:08.698
“For they deliberately ignore this fact.” 


04:08.698 --> 04:11.766
Well, here the fact was that they 
ignored the Flood of Noah’s day. 


04:11.767 --> 04:15.772
The fact for us today is that they 
ignore what the Bible clearly says 


04:15.772 --> 04:20.075
or what Jesus said would be 
the sign of the last days. 


04:20.075 --> 04:23.913
So they don’t realize it, 
but they’re part of the fulfillment.


04:23.913 --> 04:27.450
What contributes to an unbelieving attitude? 


04:27.450 --> 04:31.553
Well, one of the things 
is what we could call gradualism. 


04:31.553 --> 04:36.558
The Watchtower 
of January 15, 2014, paragraph 30, 


04:36.558 --> 04:40.296
or page 30, 
paragraph 11 stated the following: 


04:40.297 --> 04:43.399
“It seems 
that the more familiar a situation is, 


04:43.398 --> 04:46.335
“the less people 
are inclined to pay attention to it. 


04:46.335 --> 04:48.437
“A steady decline in the morality 


04:48.437 --> 04:51.240
“of society in general 
may seem less shocking 


04:51.240 --> 04:53.375
“than a sudden, unexpected change 


04:53.375 --> 04:55.578
in the behavior of a close acquaintance.” 


04:55.578 --> 04:57.580
And then it says: 
“Nevertheless, 


04:57.580 --> 05:01.283
this gradual decay
of morality is dangerous.”


05:01.283 --> 05:05.253
And isn’t it true 
that most of us were raised 


05:05.253 --> 05:08.290
in an environment 
that was not so good? 


05:08.290 --> 05:13.128
There were immoral things 
taking place around us, wars, crime. 


05:13.128 --> 05:16.931
And so people get to the point 
where they accept it as normal. 


05:16.932 --> 05:18.935
And as it escalates, 


05:18.935 --> 05:22.738
it really doesn’t impress 
on them that ‘No!


05:22.738 --> 05:23.840
‘Times have changed.


05:23.840 --> 05:27.465
They’re becoming
far worse than ever before.’


05:27.465 --> 05:31.713
Gradual decay of morality is dangerous.


05:31.713 --> 05:34.116
It makes me think of an illustration 


05:34.117 --> 05:37.587
about how to boil a frog. 


05:37.587 --> 05:40.089
If you heat up a pot 


05:40.088 --> 05:43.726
and you have the water boiling 
and drop a frog into it, 


05:43.727 --> 05:45.629
what’s going to happen? 


05:45.628 --> 05:47.630
He’s out of there; 
he’s not going to stay. 


05:47.630 --> 05:48.998
That frog isn’t stupid. 


05:48.998 --> 05:52.668
He hits the water, 
and it’s terribly hot, and out he jumps. 


05:52.668 --> 05:55.471
But if you fill the pot with cool water, 


05:55.472 --> 05:57.474
drop the frog in, 


05:57.473 --> 06:01.576
and then 
gradually (little by little) you heat it up 


06:01.577 --> 06:03.714
until it gets to the boiling point, 


06:03.713 --> 06:05.715
he’s cooked! 


06:05.715 --> 06:08.083
And that’s what’s happening 
in the world today. 


06:08.083 --> 06:13.088
The gradualism is not perceived 
by people in the world, 


06:13.088 --> 06:15.323
but they’re being cooked. 


06:15.323 --> 06:17.326
It’s getting hot. 


06:17.327 --> 06:19.995
And so we know that wicked men 


06:19.995 --> 06:21.997
are going to continue to increase


06:21.997 --> 06:25.134
—impostors, 
scoffing at the truth. 


06:25.133 --> 06:29.805
World conditions are escalating; 
they’re getting worse constantly. 


06:29.805 --> 06:33.877
But they’re going to have to deal 
with the Creator and his judgment.


06:33.877 --> 06:37.280
And there are three Psalms 
I’d like to just mention briefly 


06:37.280 --> 06:39.715
that I find very interesting 
that tie in nicely 


06:39.715 --> 06:43.052
with the wickedness of the world 
and what Jehovah will do. 


06:43.052 --> 06:45.822
Psalm 10:4: 


06:45.822 --> 06:50.325
“In his haughtiness,
the wicked man makes no investigation;


06:50.325 --> 06:52.728
“all his thoughts are:


06:52.728 --> 06:55.163
‘There is no God.’” 


06:55.163 --> 06:57.196
Psalm 12:8: 


06:57.197 --> 07:00.034
“The wicked walk around unrestrained 


07:00.033 --> 07:03.705
because the sons of men 
promote depravity.” 


07:03.705 --> 07:06.075
That could’ve been 
this morning’s headlines 


07:06.075 --> 07:08.210
in The New York Times. 


07:08.210 --> 07:11.113
And the last, 
Psalm 92:7: 


07:11.113 --> 07:13.983
“When the wicked sprout like weeds 


07:13.983 --> 07:16.485
“and all the wrongdoers flourish, 


07:16.485 --> 07:20.155
it is that they 
may be annihilated forever.” 


07:20.155 --> 07:22.458
And to that we say: 


07:22.458 --> 07:30.950
“Amen.
So be it!”

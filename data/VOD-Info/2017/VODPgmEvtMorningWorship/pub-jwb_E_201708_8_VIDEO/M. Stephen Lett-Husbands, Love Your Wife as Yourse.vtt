00:00.883 --> 00:04.386
My theme for this little discussion is


00:04.387 --> 00:09.000
“Husbands, Love Your Wife as Yourself.”


00:10.093 --> 00:12.095
What did Jesus say 


00:12.095 --> 00:14.230
was the second greatest commandment? 


00:14.230 --> 00:16.398
Well,
you’re familiar with it. 


00:16.398 --> 00:19.735
At Matthew 22:39, 
he said: 


00:19.735 --> 00:24.007
“You must love 
your neighbor as yourself.” 


00:24.007 --> 00:26.575
Now,
what an excellent illustration 


00:26.575 --> 00:29.312
is contained
in this second greatest commandment!


00:29.312 --> 00:32.115
If you think about it, 
we just naturally, 


00:32.115 --> 00:34.583
inherently, love ourselves, 
don’t we? 


00:34.583 --> 00:37.053
And we show 
love in many ways. 


00:37.053 --> 00:38.555
So Jesus is saying, 


00:38.555 --> 00:42.092
“Work hard to show
the same love for others


00:42.092 --> 00:44.127
you show for yourself.”


00:44.127 --> 00:46.195
But, now, thinking of husbands


00:46.195 --> 00:48.263
as addressed in our theme, 


00:48.263 --> 00:51.133
who is a husband’s closest neighbor? 


00:51.133 --> 00:53.135
Well, his wife.


00:53.135 --> 00:56.205
So especially must a husband work hard


00:56.205 --> 00:59.475
to show the love that he shows 
for himself just naturally and then 


00:59.475 --> 01:01.677
to show that love for his wife. 


01:01.677 --> 01:04.380
Now, what are some specific ways 


01:04.380 --> 01:07.550
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves? 


01:07.550 --> 01:09.418
Well, 
let’s talk about five. 


01:09.418 --> 01:11.821
And undoubtedly
you can think of many others 


01:11.822 --> 01:14.690
that could be discussed
during this discussion.


01:14.690 --> 01:16.725
But number one: 


01:16.725 --> 01:19.928
A husband feeds himself. 


01:19.928 --> 01:24.266
Ephesians 5:29 says in part: 


01:24.267 --> 01:27.637
“For no man ever hated his own body, 


01:27.637 --> 01:30.440
but he feeds . . . it.” 


01:30.440 --> 01:34.877
Well, what does loving our wife, 
now, as ourself require? 


01:34.877 --> 01:38.080
Well, for one thing, 
we certainly would make sure 


01:38.080 --> 01:41.985
we provide for the food 
and for other material needs 


01:41.985 --> 01:44.153
that our wife has. 


01:44.153 --> 01:46.488
And regarding this, 
I think of our brothers 


01:46.488 --> 01:50.326
in concentration camps 
in Nazi Germany. 


01:50.327 --> 01:52.395
Food was very scarce. 


01:52.395 --> 01:56.298
But our brothers, even then, 
from their meager food ration 


01:56.298 --> 01:59.435
would share food 
with other brothers, 


01:59.435 --> 02:02.072
even, in some cases, 
with worldly people. 


02:02.072 --> 02:05.775
Well, similarly, 
a husband would do without himself, 


02:05.775 --> 02:10.747
if necessary, in order to provide 
what his wife really needs. 


02:10.747 --> 02:14.817
But even more importantly, 
an extended application, 


02:14.817 --> 02:18.454
he would make sure 
that she is well-fed spiritually. 


02:18.453 --> 02:21.523
He must make sure 
that she has opportunity 


02:21.523 --> 02:24.526
to benefit from periods 
of personal study, 


02:24.527 --> 02:28.197
congregation meetings, 
assemblies, conventions, 


02:28.197 --> 02:30.367
and family worship.


02:30.367 --> 02:32.702
But now let’s talk 
about a second way 


02:32.702 --> 02:35.639
that a husband 
just naturally loves himself: 


02:35.638 --> 02:38.908
We cherish ourselves. 


02:38.908 --> 02:42.978
Ephesians 5:29 says in part: 


02:42.978 --> 02:46.548
“For no man ever hated his own body, 


02:46.548 --> 02:48.985
but he . . . cherishes it.” 


02:48.985 --> 02:52.188
Now, 
what does cherish mean? 


02:52.188 --> 02:54.190
Well, 
according to the dictionary, 


02:54.190 --> 02:57.627
it means to treat 
with affection and tenderness, 


02:57.627 --> 03:02.132
treasure, value, 
attach importance to. 


03:02.132 --> 03:05.535
See, because of this feeling 
we have toward ourselves, 


03:05.535 --> 03:10.240
we try to get rest 
when we’re sick or tired; 


03:10.240 --> 03:13.208
we try to be 
with friends and loved ones; 


03:13.208 --> 03:16.880
we play games; we exercise; 
we do things we enjoy. 


03:16.880 --> 03:20.182
Periodically, 
we treat ourselves, don’t we,


03:20.182 --> 03:22.985
because we cherish ourselves? 


03:22.985 --> 03:26.855
So, what does loving 
our wife as ourself require? 


03:26.855 --> 03:28.725
Well, it certainly means more


03:28.725 --> 03:30.927
than just being able 
to put up with our mate.


03:30.927 --> 03:33.395
It means cherishing her, 


03:33.395 --> 03:38.300
cultivating affection, 
or fondness, for her.


03:38.300 --> 03:42.172
Think of this: 
At Proverbs 8:31, 


03:42.172 --> 03:45.909
it says that Jesus 
in his prehuman existence 


03:45.908 --> 03:48.811
was fond of humans.


03:48.812 --> 03:51.747
Now, don’t you think 
that fondness he had for us 


03:51.747 --> 03:53.750
made it easier for him
to come to the earth,


03:53.750 --> 03:55.785
take the difficult assignment he took, 


03:55.785 --> 03:58.553
and even die for us 
because he was fond of us? 


03:58.553 --> 04:00.556
Well, similarly,


04:00.557 --> 04:04.694
if wives are cherished 
by their husbands


04:04.693 --> 04:06.895
—if husbands 
are fond of their wives—


04:06.895 --> 04:10.098
it’ll make it so much easier 
to forgive them,


04:10.098 --> 04:14.103
to even die for them, 
if necessary, in the future. 


04:14.103 --> 04:18.173
But if we’re going to have 
this proper feeling, like Jehovah, 


04:18.173 --> 04:23.011
we have to focus 
on the good qualities of our wife, see,


04:23.012 --> 04:25.882
not the flaws, the imperfections. 


04:25.882 --> 04:28.550
And as one 
of the brothers commented on 


04:28.550 --> 04:31.320
(I love the thoughts 
in The Watchtower comments): 


04:31.320 --> 04:35.392
“Love is best sensed 
when it is expressed. 


04:35.392 --> 04:37.427
“How vital that marriage mates 


04:37.427 --> 04:40.864
“not allow the activities of daily life 


04:40.863 --> 04:45.668
to rob them of exchanging 
expressions of affection!”


04:45.668 --> 04:47.670
But now let’s get a third way 


04:47.670 --> 04:50.840
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


04:50.840 --> 04:53.777
We adorn ourselves. 


04:53.777 --> 04:55.812
First Timothy 2:9 speaks 


04:55.812 --> 05:00.282
of women “adorn[ing] themselves 
in appropriate dress.” 


05:00.282 --> 05:02.285
Well, husbands 
try to do the same thing. 


05:02.285 --> 05:07.057
And in adorning ourselves,
we try to cover over


05:07.057 --> 05:10.025
and minimize our flaws 


05:10.025 --> 05:13.863
and cover our bulges, 
our blemishes. 


05:13.863 --> 05:16.898
We try to make ourselves 
look as good as possible, don’t we? 


05:16.898 --> 05:20.970
Well, what does loving 
our wife as ourself require? 


05:20.970 --> 05:24.740
For one thing, we certainly 
wouldn’t shine a spotlight on her flaws. 


05:24.740 --> 05:27.743
We wouldn’t do this 
in the presence of others. 


05:27.743 --> 05:31.213
We would try hard 
not to even do it in our own mind. 


05:31.213 --> 05:35.851
Rather, we seek to cover over 
minor sins and transgressions, 


05:35.852 --> 05:39.555
as encouraged at Proverbs 19:11, 
where it says: 


05:39.555 --> 05:43.860
“It is beauty . . . to overlook an offense.” 


05:43.860 --> 05:46.628
So we work hard
to adorn our wives


05:46.628 --> 05:49.031
—make her look 
as good as possible—


05:49.032 --> 05:52.602
in the eyes of others, 
even in our own mind.


05:52.602 --> 05:54.604
Well, let’s get a fourth way 


05:54.603 --> 05:57.940
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


05:57.940 --> 06:00.677
We take steps to heal ourselves 


06:00.677 --> 06:03.012
when we’re sick or injured. 


06:03.012 --> 06:05.047
Mark 5:26 


06:05.047 --> 06:08.050
talks about a woman 
who was very sick. 


06:08.050 --> 06:10.285
‘She suffered at the hands 
of many physicians; 


06:10.285 --> 06:11.987
‘she spent all her resources; 


06:11.987 --> 06:13.990
she didn’t get any better; 
she got worse.’ 


06:13.990 --> 06:15.992
But the point is, 


06:15.992 --> 06:18.094
she was really trying hard 
to heal herself. 


06:18.093 --> 06:20.563
Well, husbands 
try to do the same thing. 


06:20.563 --> 06:23.866
So if we’re sick or injured, 
we try to get extra rest, 


06:23.867 --> 06:27.870
we’ll buy medicine,
we’ll take vitamins,


06:27.870 --> 06:30.238
we’ll make an appointment 
with the doctor, 


06:30.238 --> 06:32.575
we’ll pursue therapy.


06:32.575 --> 06:35.377
See, we try to get well. 


06:35.377 --> 06:38.647
What does loving our wife 
as ourself require then? 


06:38.647 --> 06:40.884
Well, we would certainly 
do all within our power 


06:40.883 --> 06:42.885
if she’s sick or injured 


06:42.885 --> 06:44.887
to try to help her get well. 


06:44.887 --> 06:46.889
But even more importantly, 


06:46.888 --> 06:49.458
if she happens 
to be ailing somewhat spiritually, 


06:49.458 --> 06:52.428
we would do everything 
we can possibly do 


06:52.428 --> 06:54.896
to help her get well spiritually. 


06:54.897 --> 06:57.900
What would be something, 
perhaps, we could do? 


06:57.900 --> 07:00.235
Well, Proverbs 12:18 says: 


07:00.235 --> 07:03.605
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”


07:03.605 --> 07:07.110
—so the using of wise expressions. 


07:07.110 --> 07:09.278
Also, Proverbs 16:24: 


07:09.278 --> 07:11.713
“Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, 


07:11.713 --> 07:13.715
“sweet to the soul 


07:13.715 --> 07:16.785
and a healing to the bones.” 


07:16.785 --> 07:19.822
So, “pleasant sayings,” 
we would use these 


07:19.822 --> 07:23.225
to try to help her 
get well spiritually.


07:23.225 --> 07:25.762
But now here’s one more, 
a fifth way 


07:25.762 --> 07:28.664
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


07:28.663 --> 07:30.800
We make allowances,


07:30.800 --> 07:33.635
excuses, 
if we make mistakes. 


07:33.635 --> 07:36.272
Husbands who make mistakes 


07:36.272 --> 07:38.909
are often heard blaming it 


07:38.908 --> 07:41.043
on their heredity 


07:41.043 --> 07:43.511
or maybe the environment, 


07:43.512 --> 07:46.749
their blood-sugar level, 


07:46.748 --> 07:51.220
how much sleep they got 
or didn’t get the night before, 


07:51.220 --> 07:54.657
the weather, and so forth. 


07:54.657 --> 07:58.760
We tend to well understand 
our own limitations, don’t we? 


07:58.760 --> 08:00.763
And we allow for that. 


08:00.763 --> 08:03.031
Well, what about 
loving our wife as ourself? 


08:03.032 --> 08:05.234
We’d make the same allowances for her


08:05.233 --> 08:09.505
—being positive, 
imputing good motives to her. 


08:09.505 --> 08:13.675
If she speaks a little roughly 
or acts a little thoughtlessly, 


08:13.675 --> 08:16.178
we’ll try to discern the feelings 


08:16.178 --> 08:19.715
behind the words or actions. 


08:19.715 --> 08:23.352
We’ll make allowance, 
especially if we can discern 


08:23.352 --> 08:26.389
that she’s under some kind 
of emotional pressure. 


08:26.388 --> 08:30.191
We’ll make that allowance for her 
like we would for ourselves.


08:30.192 --> 08:32.195
Well, there we have five ways 


08:32.195 --> 08:34.797
that we as husbands 
show love for ourselves. 


08:34.797 --> 08:39.435
We feed, cherish, adorn, 


08:39.435 --> 08:41.503
try to heal ourselves; 


08:41.503 --> 08:44.340
and we make allowances, excuses, 


08:44.340 --> 08:46.075
when we make mistakes. 


08:46.075 --> 08:50.112
Let’s work hard 
to show the same love 


08:50.112 --> 08:54.917
in those five areas 
for our dear, beloved wives.


08:54.917 --> 08:57.887
And I’m sure, as we said, 
you can think of other ways 


08:57.887 --> 09:00.557
that husbands just naturally 
love themselves. 


09:00.557 --> 09:03.092
But what a rich illustration Jesus gave! 


09:03.092 --> 09:06.595
And interestingly, 
he took it even a step further. 


09:06.595 --> 09:09.432
He further expanded the illustration 


09:09.432 --> 09:12.269
at John 13:34. 


09:12.268 --> 09:14.970
You’re familiar with this, 13:34. 


09:14.970 --> 09:18.140
He said: 
“I am giving you a new commandment, 


09:18.140 --> 09:20.810
“that you love one another; 


09:20.810 --> 09:23.845
“just as I have loved you, 


09:23.845 --> 09:27.215
you also love one another.” 


09:27.215 --> 09:30.152
So he’s saying that we should have 


09:30.152 --> 09:32.187
even deeper love for our brothers


09:32.187 --> 09:35.257
—which would definitely 
include our Christian wives—


09:35.257 --> 09:37.760
a deeper love 
than we have for ourselves. 


09:37.760 --> 09:40.863
And that deeper love 
would move us to treat 


09:40.863 --> 09:44.233
our dear wives even better


09:44.233 --> 09:53.360
than we treat ourselves.

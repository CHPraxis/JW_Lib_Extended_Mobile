00:01 Have you ever made a bad decision?
00:05 Maybe a better question would be,
00:08 Do you remember  the last bad decision that you made?
00:13 Most of our decisions
00:16 don’t impact our lives greatly.
00:19 A young brother  mentioned to me some time ago
00:23 when he looked at my tie,
00:25 “You have some work to do, Brother Hyatt.”
00:28 Well, maybe that was a bad decision.
00:33 But some decisions
00:36 impact our sacred service
00:40 and our relationship with Jehovah,
00:44 and that’s highlighted in today’s text.
00:47 When viewed in their context,
00:49 we quickly discern  that the words of today’s text
00:53 were not given as commendation
00:56 or even as reassurance
00:59 but were given  in the context of corrective counsel.
01:03 Now, who was being counseled?
01:06 King Asa,
01:08 the great-great-grandson of King David,
01:12 the third king of the kingdom of Judah.
01:17 He ruled for 41 years,
01:20 and he has the distinction of being known
01:23 as one of the faithful kings of Judah.
01:27 So with that in mind,  the question arises,
01:32 Why would a faithful king  need corrective counsel?
01:38 To answer the question,  let’s turn in our Bibles
01:41 to 2 Chronicles 16:7:
01:44 “At that time Hanani the seer
01:47 “came to King Asa of Judah  and said to him:
01:52 “‘Because you relied on the king of Syria
01:57 and did not rely on Jehovah your God,’”
02:02 so there was the bottom line —the root of the problem,
02:07 “‘the army of the king of Syria  has escaped out of your hand.’”
02:12 And then Hanani reminds Asa
02:16 of an earlier event.
02:19 He asks:  “Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans
02:23 “a very great army  with many chariots and horsemen?
02:28 “But because you relied on Jehovah,
02:31 he gave them into your hand.”
02:34 Well, sometime earlier,  Asa and the nation of Judah
02:38 were confronted  by Zerah the Ethiopian
02:43 and 1,000,000 troops.
02:46 How did Asa handle that crisis?
02:51 Well, he humbly prayed to Jehovah
02:56 and put himself and the nation  in Jehovah’s hands.
02:59 And Jehovah was favorably impressed  with that approach,
03:03 and he gave Judah the victory.
03:08 Now, in this case,  when King Baasha came against Judah,
03:13 rather than relying on Jehovah,
03:16 Asa bribed Ben-hadad.
03:21 So it was Baasha who came from Israel.
03:24 He bribed King Ben-hadad,
03:27 and it seemed to be successful.
03:29 Ben-hadad came against Baasha;
03:32 Baasha withdrew from Judah.
03:34 All was well
03:36 —except that Jehovah wasn’t pleased.
03:40 Asa left Jehovah out of the equation.
03:45 So with that in mind,  in verse 9 we have the counsel, don’t we?
03:50 “For the eyes of Jehovah  are roving about through all the earth
03:54 “to show his strength in behalf of those
03:57 “whose heart is complete toward him.
04:00 “You have acted foolishly in this matter;
04:04 from now on there will be wars against you.”
04:07 So there was the reminder and the counsel.
04:13 Why when confronted with 1,000,000
04:17 did Asa depend on Jehovah?
04:20 But when confronted by King Baasha of Israel,
04:24 he depended on himself.
04:27 Isn’t it true that when we face a situation —a problem—
04:31 and a decision must be made
04:34 but the situation  is so much bigger than we are,
04:38 we turn to Jehovah
04:40 and we beg for his help
04:42 and for solace  and comfort and direction?
04:46 It may be a catastrophic illness
04:48 that we know isn’t going  to be resolved in this system.
04:52 It could be the death  of someone close to us.
04:56 Or perhaps a family member  or close friend is disfellowshipped.
05:01 We have no control over the situation,
05:04 and we lean on Jehovah.
05:07 But other decisions may seem  to be more within our grasp
05:12 —for example,  the selection of a marriage mate
05:16 or the choice of a career.
05:19 Maybe we came to work here.
05:24 And to help with construction,
05:26 we might have sold  our home and cut our ties.
05:29 And now a project is nearing completion,
05:33 and we have to make decisions.
05:35 Will we go back to where we came from?
05:38 We weren’t pioneering before we came.
05:41 But now after spending  some time here at Bethel,
05:45 we’re thinking about spiritual goals.
05:47 Can we pioneer?
05:49 Should we stay in this country?
05:52 Is it possible  we could move to another country?
05:57 If we’re not careful  as we make these decisions,
06:01 we could leave Jehovah  out of the equation.
06:06 So here’s a question,
06:08 How do we include Jehovah in the equation?
06:13 Well, there are three things that we can do.
06:16 The first is research.
06:19 What does Jehovah tell us in his Word
06:22 that has application  to the situation we’re facing?
06:27 What has “the faithful and discreet slave”
06:30 told us in the publications?
06:33 Has there been an article or some direction
06:37 that would be helpful to us?
06:40 A second ingredient is that of prayer,
06:45 talking with Jehovah  about the decision that we’re making.
06:49 And keeping in mind that we don’t expect
06:51 Jehovah to do our thinking for us,
06:55 but he will help us and direct us
06:58 so that we can make a good decision.
07:02 And finally,  here in the Bethel setting
07:06 and in the congregations,
07:08 we have a wealth  of experienced, faithful brothers and sisters
07:13 who would be more than happy
07:17 to help us benefit  from their experience in life.
07:22 So if we do these three things
07:24 —our research, prayer,
07:27 and talk with experienced, faithful ones—
07:31 then we can make a good decision.
07:34 Now, here’s the question,
07:36 What is a good decision?
07:40 Wouldn’t you agree  that ultimately a good decision
07:43 is one that Jehovah can bless?
07:46 And often we have a number of options,
07:49 and it’s not necessarily a question
07:52 of making a wrong or right decision
07:55 —but what decision.
07:57 What can we do that will enhance  our relationship with Jehovah
08:01 and give him something to bless?
08:05 Now, there’s one other point in the account
08:08 that can be very encouraging to us.
08:11 If you look back at 2 Chronicles 15
08:14 and the “b” portion of verse 17.
08:20 It says:  “Nevertheless, Asa’s heart
08:24 was complete all his life.”
08:28 That’s interesting, isn’t it?
08:31 Now, in our text for today,
08:33 we’re told that Jehovah is searching
08:35 for “those whose heart  is complete toward him.”
08:39 Ultimately, Jehovah viewed Asa
08:42 as one “whose heart [was] complete.”
08:46 It’s comforting to know  that Jehovah did not measure the man
08:50 because of one faulty decision;
08:54 He looked at the whole picture.
08:56 And evidently, Asa’s good qualities
08:59 and his zeal for pure worship
09:01 outweighed the bad decision  that he made in this case.
09:06 So when we make bad decisions
09:08 —and we will from time to time—
09:11 then we take comfort in knowing
09:13 that Jehovah will continue  to work with us.
09:16 And ultimately, what we want
09:19 is for Jehovah  to look at each of us and to say,
09:22 “His or her heart is complete with me.”

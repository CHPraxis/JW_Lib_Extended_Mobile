00:01 David’s prayer teaches us  an important lesson,
00:03 especially since we know
00:05 that David enjoyed Jehovah’s favor.
00:09 And the key point is:
00:11 It was his attitude.
00:13 In willingness,  he sacrificed to God.
00:17 His motive was good;  it was from the heart.
00:20 And when we study David’s life,  we realize that it was a constant.
00:24 Even when he sinned,  it still was a constant
00:26 that he would approach Jehovah  with an open heart,
00:30 willingly sacrificing to him.
00:32 Let’s read Psalm 54:6,  the entire verse.
00:37 Psalm 54:6,
00:40 it starts out  as we have already considered:
00:43 “I will sacrifice to you willingly.”
00:45 But then it says:
00:47 “I will praise your name,  O Jehovah, for it is good.”
00:53 More directly said, really, it’s:  Jehovah is good.
00:57 His name is good,  but he is good.
01:00 And everything he requires  of us is good.
01:03 There’s no command from God  for his servants that is bad.
01:08 It’s always for our benefit.
01:11 Even the elimination of the wicked, really, is good
01:15 because it shows love for those  who just want to live in peace
01:19 and worship their great God  in joy and happiness.
01:22 So that’s also something that’s very good —what he’s going to do.
01:26 So why wouldn’t we want  to offer sacrifices
01:29 to our great God willingly?
01:32 And as we know,  Jehovah looks at more
01:35 than what we offer to him
01:37 or what we give up for him.
01:40 In each case, it’s sacrifice.
01:42 He can see why  we’re making sacrifices to him.
01:46 And this is undoubtedly  one of the reasons
01:48 why Jehovah rejected  Cain’s sacrifice.
01:51 It wasn’t just  because it was a vegetable,
01:54 but the scripture says  he didn’t look with approval
01:57 on Cain and his sacrifice,
02:00 but on Cain, because Cain,  evidently, had a bad attitude.
02:04 There was something wrong  in his motive
02:07 and why he was offering  sacrifices to Jehovah.
02:11 And this ties in with what Amos  wrote about the Jews in his day.
02:15 If you’d like to look up the scripture,  it’s Amos chapter 5
02:18 and we’re going to read  verses 21-24,
02:24 Amos 5:21-24,
02:27 to see what Jehovah’s feelings were
02:29 about sacrifices  that the Jews were making
02:32 during the time of Amos.
02:34 Verse 21:
02:36 “I hate,  I despise your festivals,
02:41 and I take no pleasure in the aroma  of your solemn assemblies.”
02:45 Perhaps it was incense,  whatever it may have been.
02:48 Then he says in verse 22:
02:50 “Even if you offer me  whole burnt offerings and gift offerings,
02:54 “I will find no pleasure in them;
02:57 “and I will not look with favor
02:59 on your communion sacrifices  of fattened animals.”
03:05 So, what we learn here is  that it’s not what was offered to God.
03:08 The great God of the universe  doesn’t need
03:10 some dead animal on an altar.
03:12 It has more to do with the attitude
03:14 of people and their worship of Jehovah,
03:17 why they were honoring him  or doing these things.
03:19 And then what’s interesting  is the way verse 23
03:22 expresses the feelings of Jehovah.
03:25 He says:  “Spare me the din of your songs;
03:29 and let me not hear the melodies  of your stringed instruments.”
03:33 And then after that  he tells us what he wants:
03:36 “Let justice flow down like waters,”  well, that has to do with the people
03:40 and their attitude  and their service to God,
03:42 “and righteousness  like an ever-flowing stream.”
03:47 “The din of your songs”  and the music
03:50 —you know,  the word din means “loud.”
03:52 And it was apparently loud —the music that they played,
03:56 the din of their songs,  their musical instruments.
04:00 And The Watchtower made  an interesting comment on this.
04:03 Today, Christendom has a number
04:05 of celebrations where they use music,
04:08 and there’s the din of their songs.
04:11 They blend pagan customs  with the name of Jesus;
04:15 “we honor God.”
04:16 And what you think of almost immediately  is Christmastime,
04:21 the din of the music  in all the big stores everywhere.
04:24 And the owners of the stores most likely  are either nonbelievers, atheists,
04:29 or perhaps Jewish  or some other background;
04:32 that they have no concern  for the Lord Jesus
04:34 or honoring “the Mighty God.”
04:36 It’s all commercial.
04:38 And so it makes us think of those things.
04:40 An interesting item also
04:43 about sacrifice in the first century
04:46 was published  in The Watchtower of February 1, 2014.
04:50 And this is the point it made:
04:52 “God’s Law stated  that all the sacrifices offered
04:55 “at the temple were to be  of the best quality possible.
04:59 “According to the first-century C.E.
05:02 “Jewish writer Philo,
05:05 “[he stated that] priests at that time
05:07 “scrutinized animals ‘from head to foot’
05:10 “to ensure that they were sound  in all respects
05:12 and ‘without spot or defect of any kind.’”
05:15 So before they went  into the temple or they sold it
05:18 —the animal— the animal had to be sound.
05:20 Now, this is what scholar E. P. Sanders  has to say about it
05:24 —he states  that “possibly the temple officials
05:27 “‘authorized reliable sellers  of sacrificial victims
05:30 “‘to sell only animals and birds
05:33 “‘that priests had previously inspected.
05:36 “‘In this case,  the seller would have to give the buyer
05:40 “‘some kind of chit,  [or token, a guarantee]
05:44 indicating that the victim  [the sacrifice sold] was unblemished.’”
05:49 And then the article  goes on to say the following:
05:53 “In 2011, archaeologists found
05:56 “just such a chit, or token,
05:59 “in the vicinity of the temple
06:01 “—a coin-size clay seal dating
06:04 from between the first century B.C.E.  and 70 C.E.”
06:09 So it covered the period of time  when Jesus walked the earth.
06:12 It says: “Its two-word Aramaic inscription
06:15 “has been rendered ‘Pure for God.’
06:19 “[And] it is thought that temple officials  would have attached such tokens
06:24 “to products for ritual use
06:26 or to animals intended for sacrifice.”
06:30 That’s pretty interesting.
06:32 Hebrews 13:15 says  that we make sacrifices, doesn’t it,
06:37 praise from the lips,  sacrifices to Jehovah God?
06:41 So, what might be our chit, or token,
06:44 that says that our sacrifices  are pure for God?
06:50 Well, I’m not aware  that the chit has any antitype,
06:53 so I’m not going to go into that.
06:55 But we’re thankful that we do not have  to get a chit, or a token,
07:00 every time we put a few hours in service,
07:03 work at a construction site,
07:05 make a return visit,  or conduct a Bible study.
07:09 And remember,  no, your chit is not
07:11 your field service report  at the end of the month.
07:14 Not at all!
07:16 Isn’t it wonderful?  No human has been appointed
07:19 to scrutinize our sacrifices
07:22 and determine whether or not  we merit a chit of approval
07:27 stating that our sacrifice  was pure to God.
07:31 We just keep doing what David did;
07:33 willingly, we give of ourselves
07:36 to honor our great God, Jehovah.
07:38 And we acquire a good conscience that,
07:41 if properly trained in harmony  with the Scriptures,
07:45 in a sense, it might be considered the chit
07:48 in that we feel comfortable  because of a good conscience
07:51 and knowing that we’re giving  Jehovah God our best.
07:54 We are not worried  about some quota in itself,
07:57 feeling that that justifies us  or makes us holy or honorable,
08:00 no, just always  giving Jehovah God our best.
08:05 And The Watchtower of December 15, 2013,  said the following:
08:09 “When we live up to Bible standards,
08:13 “our sacrifices bring much joy  and satisfaction to us,
08:18 and they are ‘especially acceptable’  to Jehovah.”

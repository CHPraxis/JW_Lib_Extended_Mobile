00:01.050 --> 00:03.720
David’s prayer teaches us 
an important lesson, 


00:03.720 --> 00:05.755
especially since we know 


00:05.755 --> 00:09.758
that David enjoyed Jehovah’s favor. 


00:09.758 --> 00:11.761
And the key point is: 


00:11.762 --> 00:13.797
It was his attitude. 


00:13.797 --> 00:17.434
In willingness, 
he sacrificed to God. 


00:17.433 --> 00:20.536
His motive was good; 
it was from the heart. 


00:20.537 --> 00:24.240
And when we study David’s life, 
we realize that it was a constant. 


00:24.240 --> 00:26.977
Even when he sinned, 
it still was a constant 


00:26.977 --> 00:30.347
that he would approach Jehovah 
with an open heart,


00:30.347 --> 00:32.782
willingly sacrificing to him.


00:32.782 --> 00:37.154
Let’s read Psalm 54:6, 
the entire verse. 


00:37.153 --> 00:40.490
Psalm 54:6, 


00:40.490 --> 00:43.560
it starts out 
as we have already considered: 


00:43.560 --> 00:45.628
“I will sacrifice to you willingly.” 


00:45.628 --> 00:47.230
But then it says: 


00:47.230 --> 00:52.000
“I will praise your name, 
O Jehovah, for it is good.” 


00:53.268 --> 00:57.306
More directly said, really, it’s: 
Jehovah is good. 


00:57.307 --> 01:00.277
His name is good, 
but he is good. 


01:00.277 --> 01:03.980
And everything he requires 
of us is good. 


01:03.980 --> 01:08.818
There’s no command from God 
for his servants that is bad. 


01:08.818 --> 01:11.520
It’s always for our benefit. 


01:11.520 --> 01:15.492
Even the elimination of the wicked,
really, is good  


01:15.492 --> 01:19.329
because it shows love for those 
who just want to live in peace 


01:19.328 --> 01:22.965
and worship their great God 
in joy and happiness. 


01:22.965 --> 01:26.368
So that’s also something that’s very good
—what he’s going to do. 


01:26.368 --> 01:29.971
So why wouldn’t we want 
to offer sacrifices 


01:29.972 --> 01:32.842
to our great God willingly?


01:32.842 --> 01:35.212
And as we know, 
Jehovah looks at more 


01:35.212 --> 01:37.247
than what we offer to him 


01:37.247 --> 01:40.049
or what we give up for him. 


01:40.048 --> 01:42.518
In each case, it’s sacrifice. 


01:42.518 --> 01:46.421
He can see why 
we’re making sacrifices to him. 


01:46.422 --> 01:48.525
And this is undoubtedly 
one of the reasons 


01:48.525 --> 01:51.795
why Jehovah rejected 
Cain’s sacrifice. 


01:51.795 --> 01:54.597
It wasn’t just 
because it was a vegetable, 


01:54.597 --> 01:57.434
but the scripture says 
he didn’t look with approval 


01:57.433 --> 02:00.068
on Cain and his sacrifice,


02:00.068 --> 02:04.373
but on Cain, because Cain, 
evidently, had a bad attitude. 


02:04.373 --> 02:07.143
There was something wrong 
in his motive


02:07.143 --> 02:11.546
and why he was offering 
sacrifices to Jehovah.


02:11.547 --> 02:15.285
And this ties in with what Amos 
wrote about the Jews in his day. 


02:15.285 --> 02:18.788
If you’d like to look up the scripture, 
it’s Amos chapter 5 


02:18.788 --> 02:22.000
and we’re going to read 
verses 21-24, 


02:24.360 --> 02:27.330
Amos 5:21-24, 


02:27.330 --> 02:29.432
to see what Jehovah’s feelings were 


02:29.432 --> 02:32.002
about sacrifices 
that the Jews were making 


02:32.002 --> 02:34.037
during the time of Amos. 


02:34.037 --> 02:36.272
Verse 21: 


02:36.272 --> 02:41.277
“I hate, 
I despise your festivals, 


02:41.277 --> 02:45.682
and I take no pleasure in the aroma 
of your solemn assemblies.” 


02:45.682 --> 02:48.484
Perhaps it was incense, 
whatever it may have been. 


02:48.483 --> 02:50.686
Then he says in verse 22: 


02:50.687 --> 02:54.724
“Even if you offer me 
whole burnt offerings and gift offerings, 


02:54.723 --> 02:57.726
“I will find no pleasure in them; 


02:57.727 --> 02:59.829
“and I will not look with favor 


02:59.828 --> 03:03.000
on your communion sacrifices 
of fattened animals.”


03:05.033 --> 03:08.738
So, what we learn here is 
that it’s not what was offered to God. 


03:08.738 --> 03:10.806
The great God of the universe 
doesn’t need 


03:10.807 --> 03:12.809
some dead animal on an altar. 


03:12.808 --> 03:14.910
It has more to do with the attitude 


03:14.910 --> 03:17.013
of people and their worship of Jehovah, 


03:17.013 --> 03:19.815
why they were honoring him 
or doing these things. 


03:19.815 --> 03:22.652
And then what’s interesting 
is the way verse 23 


03:22.652 --> 03:25.322
expresses the feelings of Jehovah. 


03:25.322 --> 03:29.059
He says: 
“Spare me the din of your songs; 


03:29.058 --> 03:33.428
and let me not hear the melodies 
of your stringed instruments.” 


03:33.428 --> 03:36.731
And then after that 
he tells us what he wants: 


03:36.732 --> 03:40.169
“Let justice flow down like waters,” 
well, that has to do with the people 


03:40.168 --> 03:42.471
and their attitude 
and their service to God, 


03:42.472 --> 03:47.310
“and righteousness 
like an ever-flowing stream.” 


03:47.310 --> 03:50.380
“The din of your songs” 
and the music


03:50.380 --> 03:52.615
—you know, 
the word din means “loud.” 


03:52.615 --> 03:56.418
And it was apparently loud
—the music that they played, 


03:56.418 --> 04:00.490
the din of their songs, 
their musical instruments. 


04:00.490 --> 04:03.893
And The Watchtower made 
an interesting comment on this. 


04:03.893 --> 04:05.928
Today, Christendom has a number 


04:05.928 --> 04:08.831
of celebrations where they use music, 


04:08.832 --> 04:11.334
and there’s the din of their songs. 


04:11.333 --> 04:15.136
They blend pagan customs 
with the name of Jesus; 


04:15.137 --> 04:16.639
“we honor God.” 


04:16.638 --> 04:21.043
And what you think of almost immediately 
is Christmastime, 


04:21.043 --> 04:24.513
the din of the music 
in all the big stores everywhere. 


04:24.513 --> 04:29.151
And the owners of the stores most likely 
are either nonbelievers, atheists, 


04:29.152 --> 04:32.589
or perhaps Jewish 
or some other background; 


04:32.588 --> 04:34.890
that they have no concern 
for the Lord Jesus 


04:34.890 --> 04:36.658
or honoring “the Mighty God.” 


04:36.658 --> 04:38.560
It’s all commercial. 


04:38.560 --> 04:40.963
And so it makes us think of those things.


04:40.963 --> 04:43.431
An interesting item also 


04:43.432 --> 04:46.635
about sacrifice in the first century 


04:46.635 --> 04:50.973
was published 
in The Watchtower of February 1, 2014. 


04:50.973 --> 04:52.975
And this is the point it made: 


04:52.975 --> 04:55.812
“God’s Law stated 
that all the sacrifices offered 


04:55.812 --> 04:59.015
“at the temple were to be 
of the best quality possible. 


04:59.015 --> 05:02.318
“According to the first-century C.E. 


05:02.318 --> 05:05.020
“Jewish writer Philo, 


05:05.020 --> 05:07.723
“[he stated that] priests at that time 


05:07.723 --> 05:10.158
“scrutinized animals ‘from head to foot’ 


05:10.158 --> 05:12.628
“to ensure that they were sound 
in all respects 


05:12.628 --> 05:15.665
and ‘without spot or defect of any kind.’” 


05:15.665 --> 05:18.500
So before they went 
into the temple or they sold it


05:18.500 --> 05:20.637
—the animal—
the animal had to be sound. 


05:20.637 --> 05:24.340
Now, this is what scholar E. P. Sanders 
has to say about it


05:24.340 --> 05:27.177
—he states 
that “possibly the temple officials 


05:27.177 --> 05:30.847
“‘authorized reliable sellers 
of sacrificial victims 


05:30.847 --> 05:33.549
“‘to sell only animals and birds 


05:33.548 --> 05:36.785
“‘that priests had previously inspected. 


05:36.785 --> 05:40.088
“‘In this case, 
the seller would have to give the buyer 


05:40.088 --> 05:44.860
“‘some kind of chit, 
[or token, a guarantee] 


05:44.860 --> 05:49.998
indicating that the victim 
[the sacrifice sold] was unblemished.’” 


05:49.998 --> 05:53.001
And then the article 
goes on to say the following: 


05:53.002 --> 05:56.272
“In 2011, archaeologists found 


05:56.272 --> 05:59.075
“just such a chit, or token, 


05:59.075 --> 06:01.410
“in the vicinity of the temple


06:01.410 --> 06:04.647
“—a coin-size clay seal dating 


06:04.647 --> 06:09.252
from between the first century B.C.E. 
and 70 C.E.” 


06:09.252 --> 06:12.255
So it covered the period of time 
when Jesus walked the earth. 


06:12.255 --> 06:15.825
It says: “Its two-word Aramaic inscription 


06:15.825 --> 06:19.662
“has been rendered ‘Pure for God.’ 


06:19.662 --> 06:24.367
“[And] it is thought that temple officials 
would have attached such tokens 


06:24.367 --> 06:26.502
“to products for ritual use 


06:26.502 --> 06:30.574
or to animals intended for sacrifice.” 


06:30.573 --> 06:32.708
That’s pretty interesting.


06:32.708 --> 06:37.346
Hebrews 13:15 says 
that we make sacrifices, doesn’t it, 


06:37.347 --> 06:41.017
praise from the lips, 
sacrifices to Jehovah God? 


06:41.017 --> 06:44.920
So, what might be our chit, or token, 


06:44.920 --> 06:49.000
that says that our sacrifices 
are pure for God? 


06:50.627 --> 06:53.429
Well, I’m not aware 
that the chit has any antitype, 


06:53.428 --> 06:55.798
so I’m not going to go into that. 


06:55.798 --> 07:00.001
But we’re thankful that we do not have 
to get a chit, or a token, 


07:00.002 --> 07:03.105
every time we put a few hours in service, 


07:03.105 --> 07:05.475
work at a construction site, 


07:05.475 --> 07:09.112
make a return visit, 
or conduct a Bible study. 


07:09.112 --> 07:11.514
And remember, 
no, your chit is not 


07:11.513 --> 07:14.316
your field service report 
at the end of the month. 


07:14.317 --> 07:16.319
Not at all! 


07:16.318 --> 07:19.321
Isn’t it wonderful? 
No human has been appointed 


07:19.322 --> 07:22.825
to scrutinize our sacrifices 


07:22.825 --> 07:27.130
and determine whether or not 
we merit a chit of approval 


07:27.130 --> 07:31.133
stating that our sacrifice 
was pure to God. 


07:31.133 --> 07:33.936
We just keep doing what David did; 


07:33.937 --> 07:36.505
willingly, we give of ourselves 


07:36.505 --> 07:38.808
to honor our great God, Jehovah. 


07:38.808 --> 07:41.510
And we acquire a good conscience that, 


07:41.510 --> 07:45.380
if properly trained in harmony 
with the Scriptures, 


07:45.380 --> 07:48.818
in a sense,
it might be considered the chit 


07:48.818 --> 07:51.986
in that we feel comfortable 
because of a good conscience 


07:51.987 --> 07:54.324
and knowing that we’re giving 
Jehovah God our best. 


07:54.323 --> 07:57.091
We are not worried 
about some quota in itself, 


07:57.092 --> 08:00.764
feeling that that justifies us 
or makes us holy or honorable, 


08:00.763 --> 08:05.200
no, just always 
giving Jehovah God our best. 


08:05.200 --> 08:09.838
And The Watchtower of December 15, 2013, 
said the following: 


08:09.838 --> 08:13.341
“When we live up to Bible standards, 


08:13.342 --> 08:18.882
“our sacrifices bring much joy 
and satisfaction to us, 


08:18.882 --> 08:30.277
and they are ‘especially acceptable’ 
to Jehovah.”

00:01 In the printed comments on today’s text,
00:03 a reference is made to Matthew 25
00:06 and Luke 19.
00:08 In Matthew 25,
00:10 we have the illustration of the talents
00:13 —three slaves who received talents.
00:16 One slave receives five, another two,
00:19 and a third slave receives one talent.
00:22 And in Luke 19, the illustration is about ten slaves
00:26 with each slave receiving one mina.
00:30 These were all sums of money, you could say, talents or the minas.
00:35 Both illustrations were given some days before Jesus died,
00:40 and they were given in different places.
00:42 The illustration about the minas was given in Jericho.
00:46 The illustration about the talents that Jesus gave to his apostles
00:50 was on the Mount of Olives.
00:52 But there’s a key point in each illustration that we’ll focus on:
00:56 The slave in each account
00:59 who did nothing with his talent or his mina
01:02 is described as “wicked.”
01:05 That’s a powerful denunciation for someone to be called “wicked,”
01:10 particularly by the Master.
01:13 But to see how powerful it is,
01:15 at Matthew 6:13,
01:18 Jesus refers to Satan as “the wicked one.”
01:22 And Proverbs 10:7 says:
01:25 “The name of the wicked will rot.”
01:28 So that is a very strong term to apply to any human.
01:33 But why?
01:34 Why are these two slaves described as “wicked”?
01:38 Jesus didn’t say they broke any of the Ten Commandments.
01:42 No, but they did something that was extremely serious:
01:47 They failed to do something
01:49 with the talents or the minas that they were given;
01:53 they were guilty of sins of omission.
01:57 In Jesus’ parable, just to give you an example,
02:00 of the sheep and the goats at Matthew 25:41-46,
02:05 you remember in the account how the goats are condemned
02:08 to “everlasting cutting-off”
02:10 —not for doing something bad,
02:13 but because the scripture says that they didn’t help Christ’s brothers.
02:17 Again, it was a sin of omission
02:19 —not doing something that they should have done.
02:22 It’s also interesting to note that in Matthew’s account,
02:26 the talents were given to the slaves “according to [their] ability.”
02:30 So one received five, one received two,
02:33 and the third one, one talent.
02:35 Was the master being partial?
02:37 No, not at all.
02:39 The account explains clearly that the talents were given to the slaves
02:43 “according to [their] ability.”
02:45 So that was really being considerate on the part of the master
02:49 —the way he apportioned the responsibilities
02:51 to work for his interests,
02:53 to increase his belongings.
02:55 And, you know,  that’s a very comforting thought
02:58 for all of us:
02:59 to realize that Jehovah takes into account what we can do
03:03 —not comparing us with others in the congregation.
03:08 We have to be careful about feeling worthless
03:12 or devaluing our own worth, because that can happen.
03:16 We can feel we just can’t ever do enough  to please Jehovah God,
03:20 or there’s just too much going on.
03:22 No, we just have to do whatever we are able to do
03:25 and give our best to Jehovah God.
03:27 We never want to fall into the trap
03:30 that the sluggish and wicked slave fell into.
03:33 If you recall the account, he started to criticize the master:
03:36 “I know that you reap what you haven’t sowed.
03:39 “I know that you do this or that.
03:40 You’re harsh.”
03:42 He was really placing the blame on the master
03:45 for his own inactivity —for what he didn’t do.
03:48 But the master turned the tables on him,
03:50 and he said:  “You say that I’m that way.
03:52 Well, now ‘wicked slave.’ . . .”
03:53 And then he told him that he wasn’t going to receive anything.
03:56 He was categorized as “wicked”!
03:59 So as long as we give our best —we give from the heart—
04:03 Jehovah is going to bless us.
04:05 And there’s another interesting thing too with the slaves
04:08 —the one slave who received five talents
04:10 and the one who received two talents.
04:12 The one who received two talents  gained two talents.
04:14 The one who received five gained five.
04:17 But the one who had two  and gained only two
04:20 didn’t look at the one who gained five and say:
04:23 “I can’t do what he did.
04:25 I only received two talents.”
04:26 No, he was just happy with what he had.
04:30 Isn’t that a good lesson for us?
04:32 Be happy with you and with what you’re able to do.
04:35 If you can reach out and do more, wonderful!
04:38 Do it.
04:39 But we don’t want to start comparing,
04:41 “I can’t keep up with him or with her.”
04:44 That’s just a bad, bad idea,
04:47 and it will not benefit anyone.
04:50 What did the master say to the slave who gained five talents
04:54 —a total of ten talents?
04:56 And that was a fortune in those days.
04:59 Well, let’s see what the scripture says, Matthew 25
05:05 —Matthew 25:21.
05:08 And these are the words of the master to the slave who gained five talents,
05:11 verse 21:
05:13 “His master said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful slave!
05:18 “‘You were faithful over a few things.
05:20 “‘I will appoint you over many things.
05:23 Enter into the joy of your master.’”
05:26 What a reward from the master!
05:29 But what did he say to the slave
05:32 who gained only two talents?
05:34 Verse 23:
05:36 “His master said to him:
05:38 “‘Well done, good and faithful slave!
05:41 “‘You were faithful over a few things.
05:43 “‘I will appoint you over many things.
05:45 Enter into the joy of your master.’”
05:48 Same, same —isn’t that what it is?
05:51 It was according to each one’s ability.
05:54 The reward in each case was the same:
05:57 the approval of the master and,
05:59 undoubtedly, additional responsibilities.
06:02 Put simply, the Master is Jesus Christ.
06:05 The talents refer to the responsibility
06:09 that Jehovah gives to his anointed servants;
06:12 they have to preach and make disciples.
06:15 That commission was given to the anointed.
06:17 We of the other sheep,
06:19 we have the responsibility  to do the same thing,
06:21 but that illustration was directed, truly, to the anointed.
06:25 But there is a scripture that helps us to appreciate what we need to do,
06:29 and it’s in Revelation chapter 22
06:34 —Revelation 22:17.
06:38 It’s not directly connected to the talents,
06:41 but it does give us direction on what we all should do
06:45 —whether we’re of the anointed or of the other sheep.
06:48 Revelation 22:17 says:
06:50 “And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, ‘Come!’
06:54 and let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’”
06:57 Well, that would be “anyone hearing” —we of the other sheep.
07:00 Because the bride— We know who the bride is.
07:02 The bride is the anointed brothers of Christ.
07:05 And then it says: “And let anyone thirsting come;
07:08 let anyone who wishes take life’s water free.”
07:11 Well, “the spirit” says “Come!”
07:14 Yes, indeed!
07:16 At Pentecost, holy spirit was poured out upon 120 disciples.
07:20 They could go out and speak other languages.
07:22 They were sharing the good news —the hope—
07:25 with Jews in Jerusalem at that time.
07:27 The holy spirit inspired men to write the Scriptures;
07:31 holy spirit is behind the prophecies that we read in the Bible.
07:34 And the holy spirit is saying “Come!” —isn’t it?—
07:38 when you read a scripture to someone about the time of the end
07:41 (2 Timothy 3 or other scriptures)
07:43 and they say, “That’s what’s taking place today!”
07:47 “Come on, ‘Come!’”
07:49 The holy spirit is nudging, urging people when they read God’s Word
07:54 and they understand it and they accept what it says.
07:57 It says “Come!”
07:59 What about the bride?
08:01 Well, the bride’s been saying “Come!”  for a long time.
08:05 One hundred and twenty disciples at Pentecost went down,
08:09 they preached in different languages, and they were saying
08:12 to the Jews there, “Come!”
08:14 And then down through the centuries,
08:16 we know that the few there who may have been of the bride class
08:18 did their best to serve Jehovah  and honor him.
08:21 But in these last days
08:23 is when it has really expanded tremendously,
08:27 with the bride saying “Come!”
08:29 Think about it.
08:30 From 120 disciples at Pentecost
08:33 and preaching in one city —in this case, Jerusalem—
08:37 the work of the bride has increased
08:39 to 8,220,105 disciples
08:44 in 240 lands.
08:47 Has the bride been saying “Come!”?
08:49 Absolutely!
08:51 From one congregation at Pentecost
08:53 —you could call the 120 disciples a congregation—
08:58 to 118,016 congregations worldwide.
09:04 The Master, Jesus, must be very happy, joyful,
09:08 to see that his obedient slaves have truly covered the earth
09:13 with the Kingdom message.
09:15 What a privilege we have to share in that work!

00:01 And so we’re talking about technology today.
00:05 And as has been mentioned
00:07 by our commenters,
00:09 Jehovah’s organization is certainly making
00:12 good, positive use of technology
00:15 to get the good news preached.
00:18 Every week,  we receive letters of appreciation
00:21 from those who have been watching JWB —JW Broadcasting.
00:26 They just love to watch the programs.
00:29 And this morning,  I’d like to talk a little bit more
00:32 about our website —jw.org.
00:36 Did you know that many people
00:39 are first recognizing the sound of the truth
00:43 through jw.org
00:45 even before they have had  personal contact with a Jehovah’s Witness?
00:49 It’s true.
00:51 I’d like to share some experiences  with you this morning.
00:54 The first one has to do with Cadja.
00:57 She was dissatisfied with her church,
01:01 and so she decided  to investigate various religions.
01:05 Now in the old days,
01:07 people would just go  from one church to the other,
01:10 but modern-day people  go on the website;
01:13 and they want to know  what various churches teach.
01:17 And as she was investigating  the teaching of various religions,
01:21 she noticed that there were  a lot of negative comments
01:23 about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:25 Did that stop her?
01:28 No, because she was a fair-minded person.
01:30 So she went online and found our website,
01:35 and she found
01:37 the “Frequently Asked Questions” section  of the website,
01:41 and she loved it.
01:43 Every question was answered with the Bible,
01:47 and that’s what she wanted in a religion.
01:50 Well, she noticed on our website
01:52 that there was an invitation  to attend our meetings.
01:55 And so she talked a schoolmate  into going with her to the Kingdom Hall.
01:59 She was a schoolgirl.
02:01 Now, she loved what she heard  at the Kingdom Hall,
02:04 and she was so warmly welcomed.
02:07 But wouldn’t you know it?
02:09 Her parents were opposed.
02:12 And soon after she made  that one foray to the Kingdom Hall,
02:16 they moved to an isolated area
02:18 where there were none  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
02:21 and Cadja was cut off  from any association
02:26 with the Witnesses for one year.
02:29 But not to be deterred,
02:33 she studied all of our publications  on the website.
02:38 And she kept up-to-date with the truth.
02:41 In September of 2014,
02:44 she was again able to make contact  with the Witnesses
02:47 and she accepted a Bible study.
02:49 And in July 2015, she was baptized.
02:53 So she got the truth.
02:55 Her initial contact  with the truth was on jw.org.
03:00 Now, speaking of being cut off  from the Witnesses,
03:04 that’s Kenji’s problem.
03:06 He’s a fifteen-year-old boy in Japan.
03:08 He would love to attend meetings  at the Kingdom Hall,
03:11 but his father  forbids him from attending.
03:15 But here’s what Kenji has to say.
03:17 He says: “I watch JW Broadcasting
03:21 “and jw.org every day.
03:24 “I see brothers doing their best,  and that encourages me.
03:28 “One day I will become a great brother.
03:31 Please wait.”
03:34 Well, speaking of lifelines,
03:36 we were at a circuit assembly  in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend,
03:41 and a sister told me
03:43 that she had been  very gravely ill for a whole year
03:47 —so ill that she  couldn’t attend the meetings,
03:49 and she wasn’t able  to tie in to the meetings.
03:52 But she said her lifeline
03:54 was JW Broadcasting and jw.org.
03:59 So these technological innovations
04:04 are really accomplishing a good work.
04:07 Let’s talk about Alenka.
04:09 She’s a physics teacher.
04:11 And one day,  she was at the home of an acquaintance
04:14 and there was a strange man there —a man that she didn’t know.
04:18 But she was really impressed with this man.
04:20 He was so friendly —so warm and kind and balanced too.
04:25 And after he left,  she mentioned that to the householder.
04:28 And the householder said:  “It’s all true what you say.
04:31 “But there’s one problem.
04:33 He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
04:35 Another negative comment  about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
04:38 What did she do?
04:40 She went home and she went online
04:42 and she found our website.
04:45 For five months,
04:47 she carefully studied  all of the material on our website.
04:52 And at the end of five months,  she decided to go to the Kingdom Hall.
04:56 She made a very interesting comment,  something I hadn’t really thought about,
04:59 she said,  “Thanks to jw.org,
05:02 “nothing in the hall  seemed strange to me
05:05 —the program, the people— all of it was familiar.”
05:09 After she attended meetings for a month,
05:12 she asked for a Bible study.
05:14 So she was careful,  but she got the truth,
05:17 and her first encounter  after that man was our website.
05:22 Dregan was a Franciscan monk in Slovenia.
05:27 He’d been in the order for a number of years,
05:29 but there was something missing.
05:31 There was a void in his life.
05:32 He realized that his religion
05:34 was not satisfying his spiritual need.
05:37 So he went online
05:39 and he joined a chat room  with a bunch of evangelicals.
05:43 Well, as you can imagine,
05:45 eventually some negative comments  were made about Jehovah’s Witnesses.
05:49 Did that stop Dregan?
05:51 No, another fair-minded person.
05:55 He thought,
05:56 ‘It’s not fair to criticize  Jehovah’s Witnesses when,’
06:00 thankfully, ‘none of Jehovah’s Witnesses  are in that chat room.’
06:04 So he went online  and found our website.
06:08 And he was delighted  with the quality of the website.
06:12 Now, he was a monk,
06:14 and in the Franciscan Order,  that particular Franciscan Order,
06:18 the monks were only allowed  to leave the monastery on Mondays.
06:22 So one day, he found the address  of the branch office in Slovenia,
06:27 and on a Monday morning,  he went to the branch and got a tour.
06:30 The brothers received him very warmly.
06:33 He was very impressed with what he saw,
06:36 and he came away with a novel idea.
06:40 He came away with the thought
06:42 that he should be reading  the Bible every day.
06:46 And so he went back to the monastery, went online,
06:49 and started reading  the Bible online every day.
06:52 His fellow monks observed this,
06:55 and they thought this was hilarious.
06:57 What’s a Catholic monk doing  reading the Bible?
06:59 But he didn’t allow  their opposition to deter him.
07:03 He kept reading the Bible  and then kept consulting jw.org,
07:07 and he realized,  on consulting the website,
07:11 that the Memorial that year  was on a Monday.
07:15 So he was going to be able to attend,  and he did.
07:19 And that did it —that meeting.
07:24 He made the decision  to leave the Catholic Church
07:27 and to leave the monastery.
07:29 So now, there were a lot  of challenges to overcome.
07:32 It wasn’t so easy,  but he persevered.
07:35 And in June of 2014,  he left the church;
07:39 he left the monastery;
07:41 and then in the month of October  of that same year,
07:45 he was baptized as one  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
07:48 Since, he has served  as an auxiliary pioneer.
07:52 A sister in Finland is studying  with a Bulgarian woman,
07:57 and one day the woman asked her  to drive her to the hospital.
08:01 “Oh, are you ill?”
08:03 Well, the woman hemmed and hawed, and finally she admitted
08:05 she wanted to have an abortion.
08:08 Well, the sister said:  “I can’t.
08:10 My conscience won’t allow me  to drive you to the hospital for that.”
08:13 And then she shared  some scriptures with the woman
08:15 on God’s view of life.
08:18 But then she had an idea.
08:20 At the end of every study
08:22 —and here is something  that you might want to implement—
08:24 at the end of every study,
08:26 she shows the woman  something from the website.
08:30 And she remembered something.
08:32 Song number 88 —“Children Are a Trust From God”—
08:36 had come out in the Bulgarian language
08:39 as sung by a children’s chorus.
08:43 So she played song 88 to the woman  in the Bulgarian language.
08:48 The woman’s heart was touched,  and she canceled the abortion.
08:53 She said:  “I’m going to have the baby.
08:55 “If it’s a boy, his name will be Angel.
08:58 “If it’s a girl, Angelina
09:02 because God protected the child.”
09:05 And I think the children’s chorus  helped a little bit too.
09:11 Now, we have for years
09:14 been encouraging pioneers  and publishers who conduct Bible studies
09:18 to direct interest to the organization.
09:20 And we printed a brochure.
09:22 And then we printed  a simplified brochure with many pictures.
09:26 And these brochures have had some success.
09:29 But I think what has really opened  the eyes of the brothers
09:33 and our Bible students to the organization
09:36 has been JW Broadcasting and jw.org.
09:40 And you see now as you go  from one congregation to another
09:44 or one circuit to another
09:46 that the brothers are really talking  about the organization
09:48 as they never did before.
09:51 So it’s obvious that technology
09:53 has contributed  to the understanding of the brothers
09:57 and to the spread of the good news.
10:00 Now here’s a warning:
10:02 Technology has a place;  it has a big place.
10:06 But there is a danger.
10:09 Have you ever heard the term “phubbing”?
10:12 “Phubbing.”
10:13 P-H-U-B-B-I-N-G.
10:16 It’s a combination of phone and snubbing,
10:21 and it refers to the act  of ignoring real people
10:25 while consulting an electronic device.
10:28 So picture a man and a woman  in a restaurant,
10:30 and each one is online.
10:33 Each one is consulting  a different website or answering mail,
10:37 and they’re not talking to each other.
10:40 It’s a real problem  according to a study by Baylor University.
10:45 So, what we want to do  is stay connected,
10:48 not just to the Internet,
10:50 but to stay connected to real people,  to those around us.
10:54 Brother John Barr of the Governing Body  used to say
10:57 that if we shut out those around us
10:59 while consulting an electronic device,
11:02 we’re really not focusing  on the sounds of life.
11:06 We are missing the sounds of life.
11:09 And we’re also missing out on opportunities
11:12 to strengthen our bond with others.

00:00.850 --> 00:02.585
Let’s open our Bibles, please, 


00:02.585 --> 00:05.222
to Matthew chapter 26, 


00:05.222 --> 00:09.692
and we will begin at verse 36. 


00:09.692 --> 00:11.895
Matthew 26:36: 


00:11.895 --> 00:14.963
“Then Jesus came with them [his disciples] 


00:14.963 --> 00:16.966
“to the spot called Gethsemane, 


00:16.967 --> 00:18.369
“and he said to [his] disciples: 


00:18.368 --> 00:22.371
“‘Sit down here while I go over there 


00:22.372 --> 00:25.007
[to] pray.’”


00:25.007 --> 00:29.579
“While I go over there [to] pray.” 


00:29.578 --> 00:34.483
The eternal future of all mankind 
rested on Jesus’ shoulders. 


00:34.483 --> 00:37.620
His remaining faithful to God was essential. 


00:37.620 --> 00:41.257
He knew that if he did not remain faithful, 


00:41.257 --> 00:43.760
it would be a slap in the face of Jehovah. 


00:43.760 --> 00:46.628
It was prayer at this time in his life


00:46.628 --> 00:49.498
that was the most important thing. 


00:49.498 --> 00:51.768
‘Yes, I am perfect; 


00:51.768 --> 00:53.936
‘I have supernatural powers; 


00:53.937 --> 00:56.572
‘I can resurrect the dead; 
I can perform miracles; 


00:56.572 --> 00:58.842
‘I’m the second greatest personage 
in the universe; 


00:58.842 --> 01:00.844
‘I shared in the creation. 


01:00.843 --> 01:04.446
‘But no, I’m not depending on that 
at this time. 


01:04.447 --> 01:09.385
‘I’m not depending on supernatural powers 
and natural abilities. 


01:09.385 --> 01:12.355
‘I’m depending on my Father; 
I’m leaning on him. 


01:12.355 --> 01:14.823
‘It is prayer; 
it is supplication. 


01:14.823 --> 01:17.860
‘That’s what I am depending on 
at this time. 


01:17.860 --> 01:20.263
‘I need my Father’s help. 


01:20.263 --> 01:23.633
‘If I’m going to surrender 
my life today in a way 


01:23.633 --> 01:27.203
‘that brings honor to him 
and remain as an integrity keeper, 


01:27.203 --> 01:28.671
‘I need to pray. 


01:28.672 --> 01:32.809
So I’m going over there to pray.’


01:32.808 --> 01:35.711
The first valuable lesson 
we learn right here is 


01:35.712 --> 01:39.000
that we ‘work out our salvation’ today 
“with fear and trembling.” 


01:40.550 --> 01:44.053
We’re careful that overconfidence 
does not overtake us 


01:44.053 --> 01:46.455
or just thinking that years of service 


01:46.455 --> 01:49.992
or somehow past acts of loyalty 


01:49.992 --> 01:51.929
would be a license into the new world. 


01:51.928 --> 01:54.696
No! 
Now is the time to pray. 


01:54.697 --> 01:56.199
Now is the time. 


01:56.198 --> 02:00.436
As we come into the great tribulation
—it’s in the offing—


02:00.437 --> 02:02.772
now is the time 
to take stock of ourselves. 


02:02.772 --> 02:06.709
And if we find ourselves 
running any yellow lights 


02:06.708 --> 02:08.911
and we haven’t gotten 
in an accident yet, 


02:08.912 --> 02:10.847
now is the time 
to put on the brakes. 


02:10.847 --> 02:14.984
Now is the time 
to “go over there and pray.”


02:14.983 --> 02:18.688
Let’s read verse 37: 


02:18.688 --> 02:22.758
“And taking along Peter 
and the two sons of Zebedee, 


02:22.758 --> 02:26.461
he began to feel grieved 
and . . . greatly troubled.” 


02:26.462 --> 02:31.969
Verse 38, and He said: 
“I am deeply grieved, even to death.” 


02:31.968 --> 02:33.970
This was no act. 


02:33.970 --> 02:35.805
This was no show. 


02:35.805 --> 02:37.807
Jesus’ feelings were real. 


02:37.807 --> 02:40.177
He was deeply grieved, 
greatly troubled. 


02:40.177 --> 02:43.279
Why? 
Because he knew his death 


02:43.278 --> 02:46.415
as a criminal on a stake 


02:46.415 --> 02:49.952
would be a reproach
to his Father, Jehovah God. 


02:49.952 --> 02:51.620
That’s what he was concerned about


02:51.620 --> 02:55.090
—blaspheming his Father, 
being accused of cursing God. 


02:55.090 --> 02:57.760
It was just too much for him to bear. 


02:57.760 --> 03:00.230
This is what grieves him greatly, 


03:00.230 --> 03:04.167
not himself and his reputation 


03:04.167 --> 03:07.270
but his Father’s name and reputation.


03:07.270 --> 03:11.507
So again, think about the lesson
that we learn. 


03:11.507 --> 03:13.877
What is the most important thing in our life? 


03:13.877 --> 03:15.579
What are we deeply grieved about? 


03:15.578 --> 03:17.580
Being misunderstood 


03:17.580 --> 03:20.182
or not getting 
a particular privilege, and so forth? 


03:20.182 --> 03:21.952
No, that’s not what grieves us. 


03:21.952 --> 03:25.087
What grieves us is Jehovah’s name, 


03:25.087 --> 03:27.290
bringing reproach on that name. 


03:27.290 --> 03:30.025
We want to do everything 
we can to honor that name. 


03:30.025 --> 03:34.030
Here we are 
as the United States Bethel family.


03:34.030 --> 03:37.467
And we owe it to Jehovah, 
because of our privileges 


03:37.467 --> 03:39.669
and what he has allowed us to do, 


03:39.668 --> 03:42.038
to be here and to serve him


03:42.038 --> 03:45.040
—honoring his name 
and bringing no reproach, 


03:45.040 --> 03:47.610
whether in public or in private. 


03:47.610 --> 03:49.612
That’s our goal. 


03:49.612 --> 03:52.949
We should feel deeply grieved 
and sorely troubled 


03:52.948 --> 03:56.151
in just the thought 
of bringing reproach upon Jehovah. 


03:56.152 --> 03:58.755
And Jehovah is just as real to us 


03:58.755 --> 04:01.390
as the person sitting next to us.


04:01.390 --> 04:04.000
Now let’s read verse 39:


04:05.795 --> 04:07.930
“And going a little way forward, 


04:07.930 --> 04:11.900
“he fell facedown, 


04:11.900 --> 04:14.070
praying.” 


04:14.070 --> 04:18.173
He falls “facedown, praying.” 


04:18.173 --> 04:21.310
Think of the intensity that he was under. 


04:21.310 --> 04:23.178
“Facedown, praying.” 


04:23.178 --> 04:26.581
Luke reports that at this point, 


04:26.582 --> 04:28.752
He got “into an agony” 


04:28.752 --> 04:31.320
and “he continued praying 
more earnestly; 


04:31.320 --> 04:34.000
and his sweat 
became as drops of blood.” 


04:35.725 --> 04:37.927
“Facedown, praying.” 


04:37.927 --> 04:42.532
Facedown and his sweat 
becoming drops of blood. 


04:42.532 --> 04:46.769
He was keenly aware of the pain 
of what his Father would go through 


04:46.768 --> 04:48.536
as He would watch His beloved Son 


04:48.537 --> 04:52.242
put on a stake and treated 
in such a barbaric fashion. 


04:52.242 --> 04:54.044
He knew that. 


04:54.043 --> 04:56.478
No wonder, 


04:56.478 --> 04:58.781
no wonder that during his ministry 


04:58.782 --> 05:02.000
when he’s explaining to his disciples 
that he would have to die, 


05:03.252 --> 05:07.590
no wonder he reacted so strongly 
to Peter’s words 


05:07.590 --> 05:10.092
when Peter said: 
‘Be kind to yourself, Lord; 


05:10.092 --> 05:12.162
this isn’t going to happen to you.’ 


05:12.162 --> 05:15.699
‘Be kind to yourself; 
this isn’t going to happen to you.’ 


05:15.698 --> 05:17.766
‘What? 
“Be kind” to myself. 


05:17.767 --> 05:19.769
‘Here I am in this garden; 


05:19.768 --> 05:21.903
‘my sweat has become 
as drops of blood; 


05:21.903 --> 05:23.973
and you’re telling me 
“be kind” to myself.’ 


05:23.973 --> 05:27.343
No wonder He said: 
“Get behind me, Satan!” 


05:27.343 --> 05:29.345
What a strong rebuke. 


05:29.345 --> 05:31.380
Because in Jesus’ mind, 


05:31.380 --> 05:34.717
no, this is not a time 
to “be kind” to himself. 


05:34.717 --> 05:38.000
Those were words 
that could have caused a stumbling block.


05:39.622 --> 05:41.657
Now, let’s go further in verse 39: 


05:41.657 --> 05:43.694
“My Father, if it is possible, 


05:43.693 --> 05:46.000
let this cup pass away from me.” 


05:47.330 --> 05:49.965
Let the cup, the cup of reproach, 


05:49.965 --> 05:53.168
the cup of dishonoring your name
—I can’t handle that—


05:53.168 --> 05:56.038
let it pass away; 
but Jehovah didn’t. 


05:56.038 --> 05:58.573
Jehovah said: “No. 
This is the way I want it to be.” 


05:58.573 --> 06:03.000
So Christ lined up his will 
along with Jehovah’s will. 


06:04.813 --> 06:08.183
And he knew Jehovah was hearing him; 


06:08.183 --> 06:11.286
he knew this supplication 
was ascending to the heavens. 


06:11.287 --> 06:14.424
He knew because 
from his prehuman existence 


06:14.423 --> 06:16.858
he watched his Father answer prayers. 


06:16.858 --> 06:18.393
He watched it. 


06:18.393 --> 06:20.563
He saw evidence 
when he was the Firstborn 


06:20.563 --> 06:22.265
there in the heavens with his Father. 


06:22.265 --> 06:26.035
He watched his Father answer 
these supplications and pleadings 


06:26.035 --> 06:28.337
of whether it be 
Hannah or Ruth or David. 


06:28.337 --> 06:29.039
He saw that. 


06:29.038 --> 06:33.508
So he knew, ‘My Father is listening 
and will answer this prayer,’ 


06:33.508 --> 06:35.511
and He did, 


06:35.512 --> 06:40.015
because, again, 
the Gospel accounts that parallel this say 


06:40.015 --> 06:43.452
that an angel was sent 
to encourage Jesus at this time. 


06:43.452 --> 06:46.089
What an encouragement 
that angel must have been! 


06:46.088 --> 06:50.058
Obviously, Jesus would have known him 
from His prehuman existence. 


06:50.058 --> 06:51.593
He gave reassuring words,


06:51.593 --> 06:53.261
“You have your Father’s favor”; 


06:53.262 --> 06:58.234
he gave Him fresh strength 
to continue that night.


06:58.233 --> 07:02.138
And it is of interest that apparently 


07:02.138 --> 07:05.406
that angel was able to tell Jesus 


07:05.407 --> 07:09.912
that your death will not be of reproach 


07:09.912 --> 07:11.447
on your Father’s name. 


07:11.447 --> 07:14.884
In fact, your death is going 
to be the very thing 


07:14.883 --> 07:18.053
that Jehovah God uses to sanctify his name. 


07:18.053 --> 07:22.125
So the very thing that was weighing 
on Jesus so much, 


07:22.125 --> 07:25.662
Jehovah said: 
“No, it won’t reproach me. 


07:25.662 --> 07:28.597
I am going to use it to sanctify my name.” 


07:28.597 --> 07:32.269
So just think about 
how encouraged Jesus was by that. 


07:32.268 --> 07:35.805
And the lesson for you and for me, 


07:35.805 --> 07:37.907
again another vital lesson: 


07:37.907 --> 07:40.477
How do you know 


07:40.477 --> 07:45.280
how Jehovah uses our acts of loyalty 


07:45.280 --> 07:47.483
when we line up our will with his? 


07:47.483 --> 07:50.820
Even when it’s not easy, 
we do what Jehovah asks us to do. 


07:50.820 --> 07:53.522
These acts of loyalty are piling up,


07:53.522 --> 07:56.092
and it’s evidence that he can use 
against the Devil to say: 


07:56.092 --> 07:57.594
“Look! 
Look! 


07:57.593 --> 07:59.528
“That is sanctifying my name. 


07:59.528 --> 08:03.731
That Bethelite is sanctifying me, 
that Bethelite and that Bethelite.” 


08:03.732 --> 08:07.870
You see, that’s an honor 
that we never want to forget.


08:07.870 --> 08:10.000
Finally, verse 46: 


08:12.007 --> 08:15.645
“Get up, let us go. . . . 


08:15.645 --> 08:18.513
My betrayer has drawn near.” 


08:18.513 --> 08:21.250
“Get up.” 
What did he mean by those words? 


08:21.250 --> 08:24.487
Think of the power behind them: 
“Get up, let us go.” 


08:24.487 --> 08:27.657
The time for prayer is over; 
now it’s time for action. 


08:27.657 --> 08:29.692
It’s as if Jesus was saying: 


08:29.692 --> 08:31.960
“It’s time to rise from my knees 


08:31.960 --> 08:34.430
“and get up and go into the battle. 


08:34.430 --> 08:37.533
“Let me get up 
and be betrayed by Judas; 


08:37.533 --> 08:40.803
“let me get up 
and be subjected to an illegal trial; 


08:40.803 --> 08:44.506
“let me get up 
and be put on that torture stake, 


08:44.507 --> 08:48.177
“slapped, beaten, and even nailed 
in an excruciating manner. 


08:48.177 --> 08:49.945
“It’s time to do it. 
Let’s do it. 


08:49.945 --> 08:51.780
Get up. 
Let’s go.” 


08:51.780 --> 08:55.450
We kneel before God 
so that we may stand erect 


08:55.450 --> 08:58.387
to face our challenges. 


08:58.387 --> 09:01.990
So, what a powerful lesson 
that is, again, for you and me. 


09:01.990 --> 09:05.628
We pray, we pray, 
and then it’s time to get up. 


09:05.628 --> 09:07.630
We get up; 
go to work. 


09:07.630 --> 09:11.067
Get up; 
go hit the publications. 


09:11.067 --> 09:13.069
Get up; 
go in the field service. 


09:13.068 --> 09:18.040
In other words, we pray 
and we get up and we follow through.


09:18.040 --> 09:20.375
Christ Jesus proved faithful 


09:20.375 --> 09:24.447
because of supplication in prayer 
that he uttered to his Father, 


09:24.447 --> 09:34.074
and may Jehovah give us 
the strength to do the same.

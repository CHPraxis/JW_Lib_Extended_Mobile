00:00 Let’s open our Bibles, please,
00:02 to Matthew chapter 26,
00:05 and we will begin at verse 36.
00:09 Matthew 26:36:
00:11 “Then Jesus came with them [his disciples]
00:14 “to the spot called Gethsemane,
00:16 “and he said to [his] disciples:
00:18 “‘Sit down here while I go over there
00:22 [to] pray.’”
00:25 “While I go over there [to] pray.”
00:29 The eternal future of all mankind  rested on Jesus’ shoulders.
00:34 His remaining faithful to God was essential.
00:37 He knew that if he did not remain faithful,
00:41 it would be a slap in the face of Jehovah.
00:43 It was prayer at this time in his life
00:46 that was the most important thing.
00:49 ‘Yes, I am perfect;
00:51 ‘I have supernatural powers;
00:53 ‘I can resurrect the dead;  I can perform miracles;
00:56 ‘I’m the second greatest personage  in the universe;
00:58 ‘I shared in the creation.
01:00 ‘But no, I’m not depending on that  at this time.
01:04 ‘I’m not depending on supernatural powers  and natural abilities.
01:09 ‘I’m depending on my Father;  I’m leaning on him.
01:12 ‘It is prayer;  it is supplication.
01:14 ‘That’s what I am depending on  at this time.
01:17 ‘I need my Father’s help.
01:20 ‘If I’m going to surrender  my life today in a way
01:23 ‘that brings honor to him  and remain as an integrity keeper,
01:27 ‘I need to pray.
01:28 So I’m going over there to pray.’
01:32 The first valuable lesson  we learn right here is
01:35 that we ‘work out our salvation’ today  “with fear and trembling.”
01:40 We’re careful that overconfidence  does not overtake us
01:44 or just thinking that years of service
01:46 or somehow past acts of loyalty
01:49 would be a license into the new world.
01:51 No!  Now is the time to pray.
01:54 Now is the time.
01:56 As we come into the great tribulation —it’s in the offing—
02:00 now is the time  to take stock of ourselves.
02:02 And if we find ourselves  running any yellow lights
02:06 and we haven’t gotten  in an accident yet,
02:08 now is the time  to put on the brakes.
02:10 Now is the time  to “go over there and pray.”
02:14 Let’s read verse 37:
02:18 “And taking along Peter  and the two sons of Zebedee,
02:22 he began to feel grieved  and . . . greatly troubled.”
02:26 Verse 38, and He said:  “I am deeply grieved, even to death.”
02:31 This was no act.
02:33 This was no show.
02:35 Jesus’ feelings were real.
02:37 He was deeply grieved,  greatly troubled.
02:40 Why?  Because he knew his death
02:43 as a criminal on a stake
02:46 would be a reproach to his Father, Jehovah God.
02:49 That’s what he was concerned about
02:51 —blaspheming his Father,  being accused of cursing God.
02:55 It was just too much for him to bear.
02:57 This is what grieves him greatly,
03:00 not himself and his reputation
03:04 but his Father’s name and reputation.
03:07 So again, think about the lesson that we learn.
03:11 What is the most important thing in our life?
03:13 What are we deeply grieved about?
03:15 Being misunderstood
03:17 or not getting  a particular privilege, and so forth?
03:20 No, that’s not what grieves us.
03:21 What grieves us is Jehovah’s name,
03:25 bringing reproach on that name.
03:27 We want to do everything  we can to honor that name.
03:30 Here we are  as the United States Bethel family.
03:34 And we owe it to Jehovah,  because of our privileges
03:37 and what he has allowed us to do,
03:39 to be here and to serve him
03:42 —honoring his name  and bringing no reproach,
03:45 whether in public or in private.
03:47 That’s our goal.
03:49 We should feel deeply grieved  and sorely troubled
03:52 in just the thought  of bringing reproach upon Jehovah.
03:56 And Jehovah is just as real to us
03:58 as the person sitting next to us.
04:01 Now let’s read verse 39:
04:05 “And going a little way forward,
04:07 “he fell facedown,
04:11 praying.”
04:14 He falls “facedown, praying.”
04:18 Think of the intensity that he was under.
04:21 “Facedown, praying.”
04:23 Luke reports that at this point,
04:26 He got “into an agony”
04:28 and “he continued praying  more earnestly;
04:31 and his sweat  became as drops of blood.”
04:35 “Facedown, praying.”
04:37 Facedown and his sweat  becoming drops of blood.
04:42 He was keenly aware of the pain  of what his Father would go through
04:46 as He would watch His beloved Son
04:48 put on a stake and treated  in such a barbaric fashion.
04:52 He knew that.
04:54 No wonder,
04:56 no wonder that during his ministry
04:58 when he’s explaining to his disciples  that he would have to die,
05:03 no wonder he reacted so strongly  to Peter’s words
05:07 when Peter said:  ‘Be kind to yourself, Lord;
05:10 this isn’t going to happen to you.’
05:12 ‘Be kind to yourself;  this isn’t going to happen to you.’
05:15 ‘What?  “Be kind” to myself.
05:17 ‘Here I am in this garden;
05:19 ‘my sweat has become  as drops of blood;
05:21 and you’re telling me  “be kind” to myself.’
05:23 No wonder He said:  “Get behind me, Satan!”
05:27 What a strong rebuke.
05:29 Because in Jesus’ mind,
05:31 no, this is not a time  to “be kind” to himself.
05:34 Those were words  that could have caused a stumbling block.
05:39 Now, let’s go further in verse 39:
05:41 “My Father, if it is possible,
05:43 let this cup pass away from me.”
05:47 Let the cup, the cup of reproach,
05:49 the cup of dishonoring your name —I can’t handle that—
05:53 let it pass away;  but Jehovah didn’t.
05:56 Jehovah said: “No.  This is the way I want it to be.”
05:58 So Christ lined up his will  along with Jehovah’s will.
06:04 And he knew Jehovah was hearing him;
06:08 he knew this supplication  was ascending to the heavens.
06:11 He knew because  from his prehuman existence
06:14 he watched his Father answer prayers.
06:16 He watched it.
06:18 He saw evidence  when he was the Firstborn
06:20 there in the heavens with his Father.
06:22 He watched his Father answer  these supplications and pleadings
06:26 of whether it be  Hannah or Ruth or David.
06:28 He saw that.
06:29 So he knew, ‘My Father is listening  and will answer this prayer,’
06:33 and He did,
06:35 because, again,  the Gospel accounts that parallel this say
06:40 that an angel was sent  to encourage Jesus at this time.
06:43 What an encouragement  that angel must have been!
06:46 Obviously, Jesus would have known him  from His prehuman existence.
06:50 He gave reassuring words,
06:51 “You have your Father’s favor”;
06:53 he gave Him fresh strength  to continue that night.
06:58 And it is of interest that apparently
07:02 that angel was able to tell Jesus
07:05 that your death will not be of reproach
07:09 on your Father’s name.
07:11 In fact, your death is going  to be the very thing
07:14 that Jehovah God uses to sanctify his name.
07:18 So the very thing that was weighing  on Jesus so much,
07:22 Jehovah said:  “No, it won’t reproach me.
07:25 I am going to use it to sanctify my name.”
07:28 So just think about  how encouraged Jesus was by that.
07:32 And the lesson for you and for me,
07:35 again another vital lesson:
07:37 How do you know
07:40 how Jehovah uses our acts of loyalty
07:45 when we line up our will with his?
07:47 Even when it’s not easy,  we do what Jehovah asks us to do.
07:50 These acts of loyalty are piling up,
07:53 and it’s evidence that he can use  against the Devil to say:
07:56 “Look!  Look!
07:57 “That is sanctifying my name.
07:59 That Bethelite is sanctifying me,  that Bethelite and that Bethelite.”
08:03 You see, that’s an honor  that we never want to forget.
08:07 Finally, verse 46:
08:12 “Get up, let us go. . . .
08:15 My betrayer has drawn near.”
08:18 “Get up.”  What did he mean by those words?
08:21 Think of the power behind them:  “Get up, let us go.”
08:24 The time for prayer is over;  now it’s time for action.
08:27 It’s as if Jesus was saying:
08:29 “It’s time to rise from my knees
08:31 “and get up and go into the battle.
08:34 “Let me get up  and be betrayed by Judas;
08:37 “let me get up  and be subjected to an illegal trial;
08:40 “let me get up  and be put on that torture stake,
08:44 “slapped, beaten, and even nailed  in an excruciating manner.
08:48 “It’s time to do it.  Let’s do it.
08:49 Get up.  Let’s go.”
08:51 We kneel before God  so that we may stand erect
08:55 to face our challenges.
08:58 So, what a powerful lesson  that is, again, for you and me.
09:01 We pray, we pray,  and then it’s time to get up.
09:05 We get up;  go to work.
09:07 Get up;  go hit the publications.
09:11 Get up;  go in the field service.
09:13 In other words, we pray  and we get up and we follow through.
09:18 Christ Jesus proved faithful
09:20 because of supplication in prayer  that he uttered to his Father,
09:24 and may Jehovah give us  the strength to do the same.

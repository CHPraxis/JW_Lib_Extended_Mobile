00:01 It’s true, isn’t it?
00:02 When we look at this prophecy  in the book of Micah,
00:05 it’s very exciting  because it portrays to us
00:09 what’s actually happening  among God’s people today.
00:13 We know that although  in the new world
00:16 there will be a tremendous unity  displayed by God’s people,
00:20 chapter 4 of Micah
00:22 is actually portraying  what’s happening now,
00:25 and we’re involved with this.
00:27 We know that because  in verse 5 it says
00:29 that at the same time  that this unity would be evident:
00:32 “All the peoples will walk,  each in the name of its god.”
00:36 Well, that’s not talking  about the new world, is it?
00:38 It’s talking about the time  we are living in now.
00:42 Well, what is it that helps all  of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide
00:46 to be so united and not to be involved  with the wars of this world?
00:51 Well, one of the things that helps us  is our Christian neutrality.
00:56 What do we mean by neutrality?
00:59 We mean not taking sides  in political issues.
01:03 Of course, we take sides  with Jehovah and the Kingdom,
01:06 but with regard to worldly political debates  and issues that arise,
01:11 we don’t take sides.
01:14 Why is this so important?
01:16 Well, let’s turn our Bibles  to Revelation chapter 13.
01:21 Revelation 13:16, 17,
01:26 and here it tells us:
01:29 “It puts under compulsion all people —the small and the great,
01:32 “the rich and the poor,  the free and the slaves
01:35 “—that these should be marked  on their right hand or on their forehead,
01:40 “and that nobody can buy or sell  except a person having the mark,
01:45 the name of the wild beast  or the number of its name.”
01:50 What’s the point of this verse?
01:54 Well, of course,  we will look forward to seeing
01:57 how this may  turn out in the future
01:59 and what pressure is put  on God’s people at that time.
02:03 But even now,  we see the principle here
02:05 that the political system is wanting  to put its mark on us,
02:10 mentally as well as physically.
02:13 So we see the forehead  as well as the hand being involved.
02:17 So we need to be absolutely certain  that we remain neutral
02:22 with regard to political issues  in the world,
02:25 not only by  not being involved actively
02:29 in the political issues
02:31 but also mentally not allowing  ourselves to take sides.
02:35 What are some of the things  that perhaps could erode our neutrality?
02:40 Well, maybe we could mention  three things this morning.
02:44 One is the propaganda  that the world puts forward.
02:49 Now, we have seen what the media says  about Jehovah’s Witnesses, haven’t we?
02:53 How distorted some of their reports are
02:56 and how they can paint  a negative picture with regard to us.
03:00 Well, should we expect  that they are neutral
03:03 with regard to other events  that they report on,
03:07 particularly when there are conflicts  between two nations?
03:10 The media  in one particular nation may promote
03:14 certain ideas about the other nation.
03:17 We may be affected by that.
03:19 We may be surprised perhaps
03:21 to visit some other countries  that have a different political ideology
03:25 and be surprised to see  how things perhaps are a little different
03:29 in that country to how it’s portrayed  by the media in our country.
03:33 So we need to be careful  not to be influenced
03:36 by the propaganda of this world,
03:38 particularly media reports and so on.
03:42 What’s another thing perhaps  that could cause us
03:45 to lose a measure of neutrality?
03:47 Sporting events.
03:49 Sometimes sporting events  are able to achieve
03:53 certain goals  with regard to nationalism.
03:55 We see the national anthem  being played at many of these events.
03:59 It reminds me many years ago  when I was in a different country,
04:03 a friend of mine asked me  to record a certain sporting event.
04:07 I wasn’t particularly  interested in the event,
04:10 but because he made this request,  I recorded it.
04:13 And, of course, I wanted to make sure  that I got the last ten minutes of it.
04:17 I thought our friendship  may be strained
04:19 if I didn’t get  the actual last part of the game.
04:22 When I watched it,  it was absolutely exciting
04:26 —nail-biting finish.
04:28 Well, after the brother  gave me back the videotape,
04:32 I thought maybe  some of the other brothers
04:35 who would be interested  in this sporting event
04:37 may want to have it  rather than just wipe the tape.
04:39 So I offered it to several,  and each one of them said to me:
04:43 “No thanks.
04:45 If we had won,  perhaps it would be different.”
04:48 Now, what was the problem?
04:50 As I said to them,
04:51 “Were you watching the game  or were you taking sides?”
04:54 An interesting concept,
04:56 because here  two different nations were involved.
04:59 So we have to be careful  that even sporting events
05:03 don’t stir up within us  certain nationalistic feelings,
05:08 and perhaps we could take sides  with regard to certain events.
05:13 The third area that perhaps  could erode our neutrality:
05:18 the political promises being made,  particularly at election time.
05:23 Perhaps one of the candidates  is from our ethnic background
05:28 or perhaps  is the same gender as we are.
05:32 When we look at the political situation  these days with many elections,
05:36 it seems to be more in the form  of entertainment than anything else,
05:40 with music  and very colorful characters.
05:44 But if we were  to say in our heart,
05:47 ‘I hope that idiot  doesn’t get into power,’
05:51 are we neutral?
05:53 Or worse still, if we say,
05:55 ‘I hope the other person  gets into power,’
05:58 well, we need  to be careful, don’t we?
06:00 I remember many years ago  as a young pioneer in Australia,
06:03 I was facing  the conscription issue
06:07 —the national call-up  for the military.
06:09 At that time,  the Vietnam War was being fought.
06:12 And then there was  an election in Australia.
06:15 And at that time, the party  that was trying to get into power
06:19 said that if they got into power,  they would abolish conscription.
06:23 So now that affected me personally.
06:26 I remember how hard it was sitting there  watching the election results,
06:30 not to say in my heart,  ‘I hope they get in.’
06:34 And then, when they got in,  not to say, ‘Yes!’
06:39 You see, if we personally are affected  by some of these political promises,
06:44 we may violate our neutrality.
06:47 So brothers and sisters,  let’s work hard at remembering
06:51 that we’re no part of this world.
06:53 We support the best government  that could ever rule this earth.
06:57 And by doing so,  we will keep our neutrality,
07:00 and we will keep our unity.

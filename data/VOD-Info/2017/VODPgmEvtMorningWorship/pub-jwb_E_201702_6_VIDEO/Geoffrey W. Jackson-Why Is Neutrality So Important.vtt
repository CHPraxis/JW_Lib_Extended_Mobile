00:01.150 --> 00:02.852
It’s true, isn’t it? 


00:02.852 --> 00:05.722
When we look at this prophecy 
in the book of Micah, 


00:05.722 --> 00:09.192
it’s very exciting 
because it portrays to us 


00:09.192 --> 00:13.295
what’s actually happening 
among God’s people today. 


00:13.295 --> 00:16.700
We know that although 
in the new world 


00:16.700 --> 00:20.237
there will be a tremendous unity 
displayed by God’s people, 


00:20.237 --> 00:22.439
chapter 4 of Micah 


00:22.438 --> 00:25.175
is actually portraying  what’s happening now, 


00:25.175 --> 00:27.210
and we’re involved with this. 


00:27.210 --> 00:29.278
We know that because 
in verse 5 it says 


00:29.278 --> 00:32.381
that at the same time 
that this unity would be evident: 


00:32.382 --> 00:36.185
“All the peoples will walk, 
each in the name of its god.” 


00:36.185 --> 00:38.855
Well, that’s not talking 
about the new world, is it? 


00:38.855 --> 00:42.058
It’s talking about the time 
we are living in now. 


00:42.058 --> 00:46.896
Well, what is it that helps all 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide 


00:46.897 --> 00:51.869
to be so united and not to be involved 
with the wars of this world?


00:51.868 --> 00:56.205
Well, one of the things that helps us 
is our Christian neutrality. 


00:56.205 --> 00:59.275
What do we mean by neutrality? 


00:59.275 --> 01:03.647
We mean not taking sides 
in political issues. 


01:03.647 --> 01:06.750
Of course, we take sides 
with Jehovah and the Kingdom, 


01:06.750 --> 01:11.620
but with regard to worldly political debates 
and issues that arise, 


01:11.620 --> 01:14.457
we don’t take sides. 


01:14.457 --> 01:16.692
Why is this so important? 


01:16.692 --> 01:21.965
Well, let’s turn our Bibles 
to Revelation chapter 13. 


01:21.965 --> 01:25.000
Revelation 13:16, 17, 


01:26.235 --> 01:29.138
and here it tells us: 


01:29.138 --> 01:32.708
“It puts under compulsion all people
—the small and the great, 


01:32.708 --> 01:35.978
“the rich and the poor, 
the free and the slaves


01:35.978 --> 01:40.416
“—that these should be marked 
on their right hand or on their forehead, 


01:40.417 --> 01:45.255
“and that nobody can buy or sell 
except a person having the mark, 


01:45.255 --> 01:50.593
the name of the wild beast 
or the number of its name.” 


01:50.593 --> 01:54.463
What’s the point of this verse? 


01:54.463 --> 01:57.266
Well, of course, 
we will look forward to seeing 


01:57.267 --> 01:59.735
how this may 
turn out in the future 


01:59.735 --> 02:03.272
and what pressure is put 
on God’s people at that time. 


02:03.272 --> 02:05.342
But even now, 
we see the principle here 


02:05.342 --> 02:10.247
that the political system is wanting 
to put its mark on us, 


02:10.247 --> 02:13.415
mentally as well as physically. 


02:13.415 --> 02:17.387
So we see the forehead 
as well as the hand being involved. 


02:17.387 --> 02:22.259
So we need to be absolutely certain 
that we remain neutral 


02:22.258 --> 02:25.261
with regard to political issues 
in the world, 


02:25.262 --> 02:29.632
not only by 
not being involved actively 


02:29.632 --> 02:31.634
in the political issues 


02:31.633 --> 02:35.871
but also mentally not allowing 
ourselves to take sides.


02:35.872 --> 02:40.344
What are some of the things 
that perhaps could erode our neutrality? 


02:40.343 --> 02:44.346
Well, maybe we could mention 
three things this morning. 


02:44.347 --> 02:49.319
One is the propaganda 
that the world puts forward. 


02:49.318 --> 02:53.388
Now, we have seen what the media says 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses, haven’t we? 


02:53.388 --> 02:56.893
How distorted some of their reports are 


02:56.893 --> 03:00.763
and how they can paint 
a negative picture with regard to us. 


03:00.763 --> 03:03.866
Well, should we expect 
that they are neutral


03:03.867 --> 03:07.204
with regard to other events 
that they report on, 


03:07.203 --> 03:10.640
particularly when there are conflicts 
between two nations? 


03:10.640 --> 03:14.443
The media 
in one particular nation may promote 


03:14.443 --> 03:17.113
certain ideas about the other nation. 


03:17.113 --> 03:19.215
We may be affected by that. 


03:19.215 --> 03:21.517
We may be surprised perhaps 


03:21.517 --> 03:25.655
to visit some other countries 
that have a different political ideology 


03:25.655 --> 03:29.325
and be surprised to see 
how things perhaps are a little different 


03:29.325 --> 03:33.730
in that country to how it’s portrayed 
by the media in our country. 


03:33.730 --> 03:36.198
So we need to be careful 
not to be influenced 


03:36.198 --> 03:38.668
by the propaganda of this world, 


03:38.668 --> 03:42.305
particularly media reports and so on.


03:42.305 --> 03:45.040
What’s another thing perhaps 
that could cause us 


03:45.040 --> 03:47.310
to lose a measure of neutrality? 


03:47.310 --> 03:49.312
Sporting events. 


03:49.312 --> 03:53.082
Sometimes sporting events 
are able to achieve 


03:53.082 --> 03:55.719
certain goals 
with regard to nationalism. 


03:55.718 --> 03:59.621
We see the national anthem 
being played at many of these events. 


03:59.622 --> 04:03.760
It reminds me many years ago 
when I was in a different country, 


04:03.760 --> 04:07.663
a friend of mine asked me 
to record a certain sporting event. 


04:07.663 --> 04:10.165
I wasn’t particularly 
interested in the event, 


04:10.165 --> 04:13.202
but because he made this request, 
I recorded it. 


04:13.202 --> 04:17.207
And, of course, I wanted to make sure 
that I got the last ten minutes of it. 


04:17.207 --> 04:19.275
I thought our friendship 
may be strained 


04:19.275 --> 04:22.878
if I didn’t get 
the actual last part of the game. 


04:22.878 --> 04:26.848
When I watched it, 
it was absolutely exciting


04:26.848 --> 04:28.851
—nail-biting finish. 


04:28.852 --> 04:32.355
Well, after the brother 
gave me back the videotape, 


04:32.355 --> 04:35.023
I thought maybe 
some of the other brothers 


04:35.023 --> 04:37.126
who would be interested 
in this sporting event 


04:37.127 --> 04:39.962
may want to have it 
rather than just wipe the tape. 


04:39.962 --> 04:43.667
So I offered it to several, 
and each one of them said to me: 


04:43.667 --> 04:45.535
“No thanks. 


04:45.535 --> 04:48.070
If we had won, 
perhaps it would be different.” 


04:48.070 --> 04:50.205
Now, what was the problem? 


04:50.205 --> 04:51.373
As I said to them, 


04:51.373 --> 04:54.743
“Were you watching the game 
or were you taking sides?” 


04:54.743 --> 04:56.745
An interesting concept, 


04:56.745 --> 04:59.782
because here 
two different nations were involved. 


04:59.782 --> 05:03.585
So we have to be careful 
that even sporting events 


05:03.585 --> 05:08.057
don’t stir up within us 
certain nationalistic feelings, 


05:08.057 --> 05:13.664
and perhaps we could take sides 
with regard to certain events.


05:13.663 --> 05:18.366
The third area that perhaps 
could erode our neutrality: 


05:18.367 --> 05:23.272
the political promises being made, 
particularly at election time. 


05:23.272 --> 05:28.177
Perhaps one of the candidates 
is from our ethnic background 


05:28.177 --> 05:32.582
or perhaps 
is the same gender as we are. 


05:32.582 --> 05:36.852
When we look at the political situation 
these days with many elections, 


05:36.852 --> 05:40.022
it seems to be more in the form 
of entertainment than anything else, 


05:40.022 --> 05:44.260
with music 
and very colorful characters. 


05:44.260 --> 05:47.530
But if we were 
to say in our heart, 


05:47.530 --> 05:51.000
‘I hope that idiot 
doesn’t get into power,’ 


05:51.000 --> 05:53.035
are we neutral? 


05:53.035 --> 05:55.070
Or worse still, if we say, 


05:55.070 --> 05:58.107
‘I hope the other person 
gets into power,’ 


05:58.107 --> 06:00.477
well, we need 
to be careful, don’t we? 


06:00.477 --> 06:03.980
I remember many years ago 
as a young pioneer in Australia, 


06:03.980 --> 06:07.283
I was facing 
the conscription issue


06:07.283 --> 06:09.785
—the national call-up 
for the military. 


06:09.785 --> 06:12.822
At that time, 
the Vietnam War was being fought. 


06:12.822 --> 06:15.592
And then there was 
an election in Australia. 


06:15.592 --> 06:19.395
And at that time, the party 
that was trying to get into power


06:19.395 --> 06:23.733
said that if they got into power, 
they would abolish conscription. 


06:23.733 --> 06:26.168
So now that affected me personally. 


06:26.168 --> 06:30.773
I remember how hard it was sitting there 
watching the election results, 


06:30.773 --> 06:34.076
not to say in my heart, 
‘I hope they get in.’ 


06:34.077 --> 06:39.715
And then, when they got in, 
not to say, ‘Yes!’ 


06:39.715 --> 06:44.053
You see, if we personally are affected 
by some of these political promises, 


06:44.053 --> 06:47.423
we may violate our neutrality. 


06:47.423 --> 06:51.226
So brothers and sisters, 
let’s work hard at remembering 


06:51.227 --> 06:53.229
that we’re no part of this world. 


06:53.228 --> 06:57.800
We support the best government 
that could ever rule this earth. 


06:57.800 --> 07:00.837
And by doing so, 
we will keep our neutrality, 


07:00.837 --> 07:09.129
and we will keep our unity.

00:01 If you’d open your Bibles to Romans 12:1,
00:05 we’ll note that the apostle Paul,
00:08 as has been commented on,
00:10 talks about reasoning on matters.
00:15 That’s Romans 12:1, it says:
00:18 “Therefore, I appeal to you  by the compassions of God, brothers,
00:22 “to present your bodies  as a living sacrifice,
00:25 “holy and acceptable to God,
00:28 a sacred service  with your power of reason.”
00:33 Ah, so Paul says reasoning has power to it.
00:39 A synonym for power is influence.
00:44 And so if you reason something out,
00:46 you’ll be influenced to make  the proper decision, basically.
00:51 Now, he also introduced  something else in our text today.
00:55 Let’s go there.
00:55 It’s 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:58 and we’ll read verses 1 and 2:
01:05 “However, brothers,
01:07 “concerning the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
01:09 “and our being gathered together to him,
01:12 “we ask you not to be quickly shaken from your reason
01:17 “nor to be alarmed either by an inspired statement
01:22 “or by a spoken message or by a letter appearing to be from us,
01:27 to the effect that the day of Jehovah is here.”
01:32 So he introduces this aspect
01:35 of being quickly shaken
01:39 once you come to a conclusion on a matter
01:42 after reasoning it out.
01:45 Now, he says don’t be quickly shaken
01:47 once you come to a conclusion of the matter
01:50 as a result of reasoning the matter out.
01:54 And that’s what he was telling  the Thessalonica congregation here.
01:57 In the first letter,  he had talked about and warned them
02:01 that Jehovah’s day was imminent  and that it was coming,
02:06 and as a result,  some in the congregation went beyond that,
02:09 saying that it was here.
02:11 In fact, as verse 2 says,
02:13 there apparently was even a letter  that appeared to be from Paul
02:18 and saying that it’s not that it’s coming
02:22 —Jehovah’s day is here.
02:24 And so some got sidetracked
02:28 as a result of not thinking it through,
02:32 and their faith was shaken, apparently.
02:34 And then as you continue,
02:37 Paul then helped them  to reason further that no,
02:40 there are other things  that have to happen before Jehovah’s day.
02:46 So we’d like to talk about this matter
02:48 of quickly being shaken —that is our faith.
02:53 It’s important because we spend years
02:58 developing a relationship with Jehovah God
03:01 and developing a solid faith,
03:03 and just this idea that Paul introduces
03:06 that one’s faith can be quickly shaken
03:09 is a rather disconcerting thought.
03:13 It can happen to any of us, really.
03:15 I just think about Judas Iscariot, right?
03:18 John 6:64 says  that from the beginning Jesus knew
03:22 who was the one who would betray him —from the beginning.
03:25 From the beginning of what?
03:27 The Insight book says:
03:28 “‘From the beginning’  of when Judas started to go bad,
03:32 started to give in to imperfection  and sinful inclinations.”
03:36 Well, how long did that process take?
03:38 Well, it was less than a year  from the time he was appointed as an apostle.
03:42 Now, we know his appointment  was no mistake.
03:47 So within that short period of time,
03:50 this man went from an apostle  to an apostate.
03:55 That’s why it’s such good counsel  that Paul gave
04:00 for us not to be quickly shaken
04:03 from matters that we have established as a result of good reasoning.
04:09 Now, there are times  that we’re more susceptible
04:13 to our faith being quickly shaken than others.
04:18 And I’d like to talk  about that for just a moment.
04:21 What could some of those times be?
04:24 Well, it could be  when we’re going through stress,
04:28 depression, or anxiety.
04:32 The March 1, 2010, Watchtower,  makes this comment:
04:37 “Judgment may be clouded
04:39 when one is under great emotional stress.”
04:44 Now let me give you an example
04:46 —hypothetical, but here’s an example—
04:49 a brother has a deep relationship  with his parents;
04:53 his mother suddenly dies.
04:56 This is a great emotional blow to him;
05:01 he slips into a mild depression,
05:05 and as a result, his personal study
05:09 and his spiritual activities slow down.
05:14 Then a short time later,  a sibling is disfellowshipped.
05:20 This crushes him; he can’t sleep.
05:24 He wakes up; he gets to the computer;
05:28 he turns it on,
05:31 and he slips into watching something inappropriate.
05:36 Now, what’s just happened?
05:38 Well, his good reasoning ability was shaken.
05:41 It’s of note  that the November 15, 1992, Watchtower,
05:46 puts it this way:
05:48 “Severe and prolonged mental depression
05:51 “may have worn away
05:53 “some of the person’s normally  strong emotional fiber
05:58 or may have made it extremely difficult  to make wise decisions.”
06:02 So, what could the brother have done?
06:05 Well, when he first recognized  this mild depression
06:09 or slipping from the spiritual activities,
06:13 it would have been good for him to get someone to help him identify the cause.
06:17 Now, what is another circumstance
06:20 that could quickly shake our faith
06:25 if we’re not on guard?
06:28 Well, it has to do with the apostates.
06:32 Now, there is something  that the apostates are talking about
06:37 and trying to put forward.
06:40 The media has picked it up;  others have also picked it up.
06:45 And that is our Scriptural position
06:47 of having a two-witnesses requirement
06:50 for judicial action  if there is no confession.
06:53 Now, if you open your Bibles  to Deuteronomy 19:15,
06:55 our good reasoning is pretty solid on this.
06:58 At Deuteronomy 19:15,
07:01 the scripture is very, very clear.
07:06 It says:  “No single witness may convict another
07:10 “for any error or any sin that he may commit.
07:14 “On the testimony of two witnesses
07:16 “or on the testimony of three witnesses
07:18 the matter should be established.”
07:20 It’s very clear, isn’t it?
07:22 You cannot establish  a judicial committee based on one witness.
07:27 But now, listen,  here’s what they say:
07:29 “Well now, look,  the Old Testament
07:32 “also says that adulteresses  should be stoned.
07:37 “Now, since you’re not doing that,
07:39 why do you stick  to this two-witness rule?”
07:45 You see, if you’re not careful,  that can do some tricks on your mind
07:49 because you have to think it through.
07:52 Well, how might we do that?
07:54 Well, we go to Matthew 18:16
07:57 because obviously Christ Jesus
08:00 established the Christian arrangement,
08:03 and notice what he said.
08:05 Matthew 18:16, he says:
08:08 “But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more,
08:12 “so that on the testimony of two or three witnesses
08:16 every matter may be established.”
08:19 So Christ Jesus establishes the fact that there has to be two witnesses.
08:24 Now, it doesn’t mean  that if there is only one witness
08:28 that there are no consequences.
08:30 There might be,  depending upon the situation,
08:32 but the Scriptures are very clear.
08:35 Before a judicial committee can be convened,
08:39 there has to be a confession  or two witnesses,
08:43 so we will never change
08:46 our Scriptural position on that subject.
08:49 Jehovah has given us the ability  to reason things out, to think it through.
08:54 So let’s do our part
08:56 and not allow our faith to be quickly shaken.
09:00 Then we can have  the confidence that Paul spoke of
09:03 at 2 Thessalonians 3:5 when he said:
09:06 “May the Lord continue to guide your hearts successfully
09:10 to the love of God and to the endurance for the Christ.”

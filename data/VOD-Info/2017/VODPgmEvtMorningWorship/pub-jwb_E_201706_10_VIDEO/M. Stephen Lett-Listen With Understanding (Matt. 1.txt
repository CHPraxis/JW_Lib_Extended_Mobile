00:01 Sight, hearing, taste,
00:05 touch, smell:
00:08 Well, as you know,
00:09 those are the five primary senses
00:12 with which the Creator has endowed us.
00:14 But now,  which one of these five
00:17 is perhaps related the closest
00:20 to our being able to gain  the prize of everlasting life?
00:24 Well, is it not hearing?
00:26 It’s interesting that throughout history,
00:29 the churches of Babylon the Great  have put the main emphasis,
00:33 not on hearing,  but on seeing or perhaps touching
00:38 —seeing an image of their God,  maybe touching or kissing that image.
00:43 But Jehovah has always put the emphasis on hearing.
00:48 “Hear, O Israel.”
00:50 “Give ear and listen.”
00:52 With commanding calls such as this,
00:55 the Israelites were summoned together
00:57 to hear Jehovah’s words read and explained.
01:01 Well, similarly today,
01:03 we have many opportunities
01:05 to hear Jehovah’s words read and explained.
01:08 But now, here’s a question:
01:10 Is it sufficient that we just hear
01:13 the sounds of Jehovah’s words?
01:16 Well, you know that’s not sufficient.
01:18 Here’s an experience that illustrates this.
01:21 Many years ago,  I was working in service with a brother.
01:24 It was his turn to talk.
01:26 He was very nervous.
01:27 The lady came to the door.
01:29 He said, “How are you?”
01:30 She said, “Not very good.”
01:32 He said, “That’s good.”
01:34 And he proceeded with his presentation.
01:37 Well, he heard sounds  coming out of her mouth,
01:40 but he didn’t hear  so as to perceive what was said.
01:44 Well, obviously, Jehovah expects us to do
01:46 a whole lot better than that  when it comes to hearing his words.
01:50 At Matthew 13:16,  today’s scripture text,
01:55 Jesus commended his disciples  by saying:
01:58 “Happy are . . .  your ears because they hear.”
02:02 Now, he wasn’t commending them
02:04 for just hearing  sounds coming out of his mouth,
02:07 but he was commending them  because they heard with understanding.
02:11 They grasped the meaning,
02:13 and then they were in a position  to make application of what they had heard.
02:18 Well, do we want Jehovah and Jesus
02:21 to pronounce our ears happy?
02:24 Do we want figuratively happy ears?
02:27 We do, don’t we?
02:29 Well, then, we must listen —like those disciples—
02:32 in a way that we grasp the meaning
02:34 and are in a position to make application.
02:37 Open up to Mark chapter 4, please.
02:40 And here’s an interesting scripture  in this vein.
02:43 Notice the words of Jesus.
02:45 Mark chapter 4,  beginning in verse 23, he said:
02:50 “Whoever has ears to listen,
02:54 “let him listen.
02:56 “He further said to them:
02:58 ‘Pay attention to what you are hearing.’”
03:00 Now notice this:
03:02 “With the measure  that you are measuring out,
03:04 “you will have it measured out to you,
03:06 yes, you will have more added to you.”
03:09 So notice, Jesus was saying
03:12 that if you measure out little interest and attention,
03:16 don’t expect to gain much.
03:18 In contrast,  if you measure out
03:21 your full attention  and interest to what I am saying,
03:24 then I will give you generously,  even beyond your expectations.
03:29 Well, it works the same way today, doesn’t it?
03:31 We actually reap enlightenment  in direct proportion
03:35 to how much interest  and attention we measure out.
03:39 Go to Hebrews chapter 2.
03:41 Here’s another scripture—  very familiar scripture in this regard
03:45 —Hebrews chapter 2,
03:48 and notice that we’re not  to just pay casual attention
03:52 or even usual attention,
03:54 but notice how it’s worded.
03:56 Hebrews 2:1:
03:58 “That is why it is necessary for us to pay
04:03 “more than the usual attention
04:06 “to the things we have heard,
04:08 so that we never drift away.”
04:10 So it’s absolutely required
04:12 that if we’re not going to drift  away from Jehovah or the truth,
04:15 we’ve got  “to pay more than the usual attention.”
04:19 Now, let’s illustrate this point.
04:21 I’d like you to imagine
04:23 that you’re trapped in a building
04:26 that is engulfed in fire.
04:29 A fireman makes his way to you,  and he says:
04:32 “I only have time to tell you this once;  I’ve got to go help other people.
04:36 “But there’s only one way to escape:
04:38 “You’ve got to go  down the stairs very quickly.
04:41 “When you get to the bottom,
04:43 “drop down on your stomach  and begin crawling.
04:45 “You have to stay  within three feet of the floor
04:47 “because above that  there are poisonous gases.
04:50 “Crawl, though, to the right,
04:53 “and you will see a small hallway —a narrow hallway.
04:57 “Crawl through that hallway.
04:59 “When you get to the end,  you’ll be in the lobby.
05:01 Stand up, turn left,  run out the exit doors.”
05:04 Now,  while those instructions were being given,
05:08 would you allow your mind to wander?
05:12 Would you be thinking:  ‘I wonder what I’ll have for supper tonight?
05:16 I wonder what will be on TV?’
05:18 No,  your attention would be riveted
05:20 because one missed detail  could cost you your life.
05:25 And even after the fireman left,
05:28 you probably would still hear —ringing in your ears—
05:31 his words as you  reviewed them in your mind, see.
05:34 ‘Down the stairs,  crawl through the hallway,
05:37 go out the left of the lobby  through the exit doors.’
05:41 You’d be reviewing that information
05:43 with the idea that you  were truly going to make application.
05:47 Well, that’s how we want to listen.
05:50 And if you think about it,  we’re in a similar situation, aren’t we?
05:53 Satan’s world is on fire around us
05:57 and very soon it’s going to totally burn up.
06:00 But Jehovah is giving us escape instructions.
06:04 In fact, at 2 Peter 3:12  it says about this system
06:07 that it’s going to “be destroyed in flames
06:10 and the elements  will melt in the intense heat!”
06:14 But we want to survive.
06:16 We don’t even slightly want  to be like the idols
06:19 mentioned at Psalm 115:6
06:22 who ‘have ears but they don’t hear.’
06:25 Or like the cobra mentioned at Psalm 58:4
06:29 “that stops up its ear”
06:32 and refuses to hear  “the voice of [the] charmers.”
06:35 Or like the disobedient Israelites  described at Isaiah 6:10
06:40 as having “unresponsive” ears.
06:43 Or those disobedient Israelites  that are described at Jeremiah 6:10
06:48 in the literal Hebrew  as having ‘uncircumcised ears.’
06:52 We don’t even want to be  like the Hebrew Christians
06:56 who were described at Hebrews 5:11
07:00 as being “dull in [their] hearing.”
07:03 We want to do our very best  to ‘uncover our ear.’
07:07 Now,  that’s an interesting expression
07:09 in the literal Hebrew at Job 33:16.
07:13 And, apparently,  it comes from the fact
07:16 that the Orientals wore a headdress.
07:19 But to hear more clearly,  they would partially remove that headdress
07:24 and uncover the ear.
07:26 Well, we want to do that ourselves.
07:29 We want to “incline [our] ear,”  Psalm 78:1,
07:33 ‘awaken our ear,’  ‘open our ear,’ “give ear,”
07:36 as different verses in Isaiah say.
07:39 And all of that is pay attention  with a view of making application
07:43 of what we have heard.
07:45 Now, if we do this
07:47 —use our sense of hearing wisely  as we’ve discussed—
07:51 then we’ll be in a position to survive
07:54 the cataclysmic end  of this system of things.
07:59 As recorded at 2 Kings 21:12,
08:04 Jehovah said:
08:06 “Here I am bringing such a disaster  on Jerusalem and Judah
08:11 “that it will make both ears
08:13 of anyone who hears about it tingle.”
08:17 Well, it’s true.
08:18 During the great tribulation,  people of this world,
08:21 when they hear  about the calamitous events
08:24 of the great tribulation,
08:26 undoubtedly both of their ears
08:28 —figuratively for sure  but perhaps even literally—
08:32 will tingle.
08:34 But the ears of Jehovah’s people
08:37 will continue to be inclined
08:39 toward Jehovah’s directions  that will come at that time,
08:42 such as found at Isaiah 26:20,
08:45 where Jehovah will say:
08:47 “Go, my people, enter your inner rooms,
08:50 “and shut your doors behind you.
08:53 Hide yourself for a brief moment  until the wrath has passed by.”
08:58 And as Jesus declared
09:01 the ears of his disciples happy,
09:03 Jehovah and Jesus will be able to declare
09:07 the ears of the surviving great crowd happy.
09:12 They will say to them:
09:14 “Happy are your . . .  ears because they hear.”

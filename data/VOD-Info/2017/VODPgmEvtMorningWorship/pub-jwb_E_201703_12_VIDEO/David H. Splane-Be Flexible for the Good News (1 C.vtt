00:01.117 --> 00:03.119
Now, when you think of it, 


00:03.118 --> 00:06.990
the apostle Paul was a very humble man. 


00:06.990 --> 00:09.092
He was flexible. 


00:09.092 --> 00:12.695
He says: “To the Jews I became as a Jew,” 


00:12.695 --> 00:17.300
and “to those under law 
I became as under law.” 


00:17.300 --> 00:20.537
But there were limits to Paul’s flexibility, 


00:20.537 --> 00:23.807
and we’re going to talk 
about that in just a few moments.


00:23.807 --> 00:27.477
First of all, though, 
when Paul came down to Jerusalem,


00:27.477 --> 00:32.115
the elders explained that thousands of Jews 
had become believers 


00:32.115 --> 00:35.952
and they were all zealous for the Law. 


00:35.952 --> 00:39.455
Now, they’d heard a rumor about Paul. 


00:39.455 --> 00:42.558
They’d heard the rumor 
that Paul was telling the Jews 


00:42.558 --> 00:45.428
not to circumcise their children, 


00:45.428 --> 00:47.863
and the elders were worried about it. 


00:47.863 --> 00:49.831
They had a plan. 


00:49.832 --> 00:53.102
We read about that plan in Acts chapter 21, 


00:53.102 --> 00:56.305
if you would like to turn there, 


00:56.305 --> 01:01.000
Acts 21:23, 24. 


01:06.448 --> 01:09.951
Here’s their plan: 
“So do what we tell you:


01:09.952 --> 01:14.000
“We have four men 
who have put themselves under a vow. 


01:15.525 --> 01:17.793
“Take these men with you 


01:17.793 --> 01:21.596
“and cleanse yourself ceremonially 
together with them 


01:21.597 --> 01:23.667
“and take care of their expenses, 


01:23.667 --> 01:26.369
“so that they may have 
their heads shaved. 


01:26.368 --> 01:29.638
“Then everyone will know 
that there is nothing 


01:29.638 --> 01:31.908
“to the rumors 
they were told about you, 


01:31.908 --> 01:35.478
“but that you are walking orderly 


01:35.478 --> 01:40.000
and you are also keeping the Law.” 


01:42.052 --> 01:46.122
Now, it says they have heard 
a rumor about you,


01:46.122 --> 01:48.992
that you were telling Jews 
not to circumcise their children. 


01:48.992 --> 01:51.995
Paul was probably not telling Jews 


01:51.995 --> 01:54.997
not to circumcise their children. 


01:54.997 --> 01:57.200
As has already been mentioned, 


01:57.200 --> 02:00.337
Paul took Timothy and circumcised him 


02:00.337 --> 02:02.739
so as not to stumble the Jews. 


02:02.738 --> 02:06.141
Paul realized that there was nothing wrong 


02:06.142 --> 02:08.277
with circumcision per se. 


02:08.277 --> 02:11.680
It was when people 
proclaimed that circumcision 


02:11.680 --> 02:15.752
was necessary in order to gain salvation 
that the problem arose. 


02:15.752 --> 02:17.754
So this was a rumor. 


02:17.753 --> 02:21.423
But some brothers and sisters 
were willing to believe a rumor 


02:21.423 --> 02:25.895
about a faithful brother 
rather than to trust Paul. 


02:25.895 --> 02:29.898
Just as today, some believe 
everything they read in the newspaper 


02:29.898 --> 02:32.335
and they don’t even ask any questions.


02:32.335 --> 02:35.272
So now here’s the question: 


02:35.272 --> 02:37.740
What were they going to do about it? 


02:37.740 --> 02:39.742
The elders had a suggestion. 


02:39.742 --> 02:44.080
They said: “We have four men 
who have put themselves under a vow.” 


02:44.080 --> 02:47.317
And they wanted Paul 
to take these men to the temple 


02:47.317 --> 02:49.352
and pay their expenses. 


02:49.352 --> 02:51.354
Paul agreed. 


02:51.353 --> 02:53.421
Now, that took humility. 


02:53.422 --> 02:58.060
We all know how strongly Paul felt 
about keeping the Law, 


02:58.060 --> 03:02.498
and yet Paul was willing 
to see the bigger picture. 


03:02.498 --> 03:05.601
He had strong feelings, 
but at the same time, 


03:05.602 --> 03:08.237
these Jews were probably new in the truth, 


03:08.237 --> 03:11.507
and Paul wanted to go as far as he could go 


03:11.507 --> 03:15.110
so as not to stumble those new in the truth.


03:15.110 --> 03:18.513
Now the vow. 
What was the vow? 


03:18.513 --> 03:21.783
Most scholars agree that the vow 


03:21.783 --> 03:25.086
was probably a Nazarite vow. 


03:25.087 --> 03:28.257
And if it was, 
that was going to be tricky for Paul. 


03:28.257 --> 03:33.062
Because, you see, Nazarites 
were required to offer a sin offering 


03:33.062 --> 03:35.365
when their vow came to a completion. 


03:35.365 --> 03:37.800
Now, Paul would never have agreed to that. 


03:37.800 --> 03:38.968
It would have showed— 


03:38.968 --> 03:42.238
It would have shown disrespect 
for the sacrifice of Christ. 


03:42.238 --> 03:45.641
So Paul and those four men 
were going to have to be very careful 


03:45.642 --> 03:50.079
about how far they would go 
in the completion of this vow. 


03:50.078 --> 03:52.448
And we can be sure 
that they would never do anything 


03:52.448 --> 03:55.551
that would go against their conscience.


03:55.552 --> 03:58.154
Now, we can see that on this occasion 


03:58.153 --> 04:00.356
Paul went a long way 


04:00.357 --> 04:03.594
so as not to stumble the Jews. 


04:03.593 --> 04:05.695
But on another occasion, 


04:05.695 --> 04:08.898
he refused to cater to the Jews. 


04:08.898 --> 04:11.366
We read about that in Galatians chapter 2. 


04:11.367 --> 04:14.000
Let’s turn there. 


04:15.070 --> 04:18.000
Galatians chapter 2, 


04:21.543 --> 04:24.000
and we’ll read verses 11-14. 


04:26.815 --> 04:30.085
Galatians 2:11-14: 


04:30.085 --> 04:33.222
“However, when Cephas came to Antioch, 


04:33.222 --> 04:35.425
“I resisted him face-to-face, 


04:35.425 --> 04:38.227
“because he was clearly in the wrong. 


04:38.227 --> 04:42.165
“For before certain men from James arrived, 


04:42.165 --> 04:44.600
“he used to eat with people of the nations; 


04:44.600 --> 04:48.270
“but when they arrived, he stopped doing this 
and separated himself, 


04:48.270 --> 04:51.240
“fearing those of the circumcised class. 


04:51.240 --> 04:54.543
“The rest of the Jews also joined him 


04:54.543 --> 04:56.545
“in putting on this pretense, 


04:56.545 --> 05:00.048
“so that even Barnabas 
was led along with them in their pretense. 


05:00.048 --> 05:02.918
“But when I saw 
that they were not walking in step 


05:02.918 --> 05:04.953
“with the truth of the good news, 


05:04.953 --> 05:07.023
“I said to Cephas before them all: 


05:07.023 --> 05:11.393
“‘If you, though you are a Jew, 
live as the nations do and not as Jews do, 


05:11.393 --> 05:16.398
how can you compel people of the nations 
to live according to Jewish practice?’” 


05:16.398 --> 05:19.368
So we see what was happening here. 


05:19.368 --> 05:23.571
Up till the time when men from James 


05:23.572 --> 05:25.509
came down to Antioch, 


05:25.508 --> 05:29.478
Peter and Barnabas 
and the other Jewish Christians 


05:29.478 --> 05:32.115
were happily eating with the Gentiles. 


05:32.115 --> 05:34.883
But now men from James came down, 


05:34.883 --> 05:37.353
and suddenly Peter 


05:37.353 --> 05:39.855
starts to separate himself from the Gentiles. 


05:39.855 --> 05:42.125
And, following his lead, 


05:42.125 --> 05:46.595
other Jewish Christians 
begin doing the same thing.


05:46.595 --> 05:50.098
Now, who was probably new in the truth? 


05:50.098 --> 05:53.668
In this case, 
it was probably the Gentile Christians. 


05:53.668 --> 05:57.740
In Acts 21, it was probably 
the Jews who were newer in the truth 


05:57.740 --> 05:59.842
and Paul didn’t want to stumble the Jews. 


05:59.842 --> 06:03.914
But at this point, Paul could not be 
all things to all people. 


06:03.913 --> 06:06.015
He couldn’t please the Jews; 


06:06.015 --> 06:11.187
he couldn’t please the men from James 
and also please the Gentiles. 


06:11.187 --> 06:13.189
He was either going to have to stumble


06:13.188 --> 06:15.190
—if you will—
the men from James, 


06:15.190 --> 06:18.393
or he was going 
to have to stumble the Gentiles. 


06:18.393 --> 06:20.396
He had to make a choice. 


06:20.397 --> 06:22.832
And so Paul made his choice. 


06:22.832 --> 06:24.834
And what did he do about it? 


06:24.833 --> 06:27.336
He followed the advice 


06:27.337 --> 06:30.874
that he recorded 
in this same book of Galatians. 


06:30.873 --> 06:33.000
Can you think of what that was? 


06:34.477 --> 06:36.779
Galatians chapter 6


06:36.778 --> 06:39.215
—what is it saying? 


06:39.215 --> 06:43.753
“If a man takes a false step 
before he is aware of it.” 


06:43.753 --> 06:45.755
What did Paul say about Peter? 


06:45.755 --> 06:49.192
He was not walking in step 
with the good news. 


06:49.192 --> 06:52.295
So Peter was taking a false step. 


06:52.295 --> 06:56.965
“You who have spiritual qualifications,” 
that would be Paul, 


06:56.965 --> 07:01.170
“try to readjust such a man 
in a spirit of mildness.” 


07:01.170 --> 07:04.673
And that’s what the apostle Paul did.


07:04.673 --> 07:08.110
Now, we love to pick on Peter. 


07:08.110 --> 07:10.913
But let’s give the poor man a break. 


07:10.913 --> 07:14.116
Let’s give him credit 
for what he was doing right. 


07:14.117 --> 07:16.219
This was Antioch. 


07:16.218 --> 07:18.586
Now, what do we know about Antioch? 


07:18.587 --> 07:22.292
It was in Antioch when the whole matter 


07:22.292 --> 07:25.895
of keeping the Law blew up 
in the first place. 


07:25.895 --> 07:29.198
And who was it 
who were stirring things up in Antioch? 


07:29.198 --> 07:31.900
It was men from Jerusalem


07:31.900 --> 07:34.403
—men from James. 


07:34.403 --> 07:36.705
Now, up until this point


07:36.705 --> 07:39.675
—Peter and Barnabas and the others—
they’re happily eating with the Gentiles 


07:39.675 --> 07:43.578
until men from Jerusalem come down 


07:43.578 --> 07:46.515
and start stirring up trouble. 


07:46.515 --> 07:49.452
You kind of think 
that if they’d stayed home once in a while 


07:49.452 --> 07:52.755
there would have been a lot less trouble 
in the Christian congregation. 


07:52.755 --> 07:56.525
So Peter was doing the right thing 


07:56.525 --> 08:00.328
up until the men from James came down. 


08:00.328 --> 08:04.600
Now, Peter knew 
how critical men from James could be


08:04.600 --> 08:07.002
—or men from Jerusalem could be. 


08:07.002 --> 08:10.205
You might say, 
he’d seen that movie before 


08:10.205 --> 08:12.208
in 36 C.E., 


08:12.208 --> 08:15.578
just after the conversion of Cornelius. 


08:15.578 --> 08:20.000
Notice a detail at Acts 11:2, 3, 


08:22.117 --> 08:26.689
and this might help us 
to at least understand Peter’s concern, 


08:26.688 --> 08:29.191
and perhaps misguided effort, 


08:29.192 --> 08:31.860
not to stumble the men from James. 


08:31.860 --> 08:34.963
Acts 11:2, 3: 


08:34.963 --> 08:37.933
“So when Peter came up to Jerusalem,” 


08:37.933 --> 08:40.301
this is in 33 C.E., 


08:40.302 --> 08:44.207
“the supporters of circumcision 
began to criticize him, saying: 


08:44.207 --> 08:47.677
“‘You went into the house of men 
who were not circumcised 


08:47.677 --> 08:51.000
and ate with them.’” 


08:52.482 --> 08:55.652
Well, Peter knew how sensitive Jews were 


08:55.652 --> 08:57.854
about eating with the Gentiles, 


08:57.853 --> 09:00.623
but he was moved by the fear of man. 


09:00.623 --> 09:03.658
And the apostle Paul did right 


09:03.658 --> 09:07.263
to reprove him because, after all, 


09:07.263 --> 09:09.298
he was going to have to make a choice: 


09:09.298 --> 09:13.268
You stumble the Jews 
or you stumble the Gentiles.


09:13.268 --> 09:16.105
The lesson to take away: 


09:16.105 --> 09:19.708
There are times 
when you can’t please everyone. 


09:19.708 --> 09:24.013
There are times when you 
cannot be all things to all people. 


09:24.013 --> 09:27.283
Our young people have to realize that. 


09:27.283 --> 09:29.585
You have to take a stand for what is right 


09:29.585 --> 09:32.722
and let the chips fall where they may.


09:32.722 --> 09:35.024
Now, you have to appreciate the wisdom 


09:35.023 --> 09:37.926
that Jesus used in selecting Paul 


09:37.927 --> 09:40.162
as an apostle to the nations. 


09:40.162 --> 09:42.164
A note to the elders: 


09:42.163 --> 09:44.200
Paul was flexible. 


09:44.200 --> 09:47.002
He didn’t insist on his own ideas 


09:47.002 --> 09:49.672
even when he felt strongly about a matter, 


09:49.672 --> 09:53.542
and he didn’t create unnecessary issues. 


09:53.542 --> 09:56.645
Paul looked at the big picture. 


09:56.645 --> 09:59.482
What a marvelous example for us. 


09:59.482 --> 10:01.684
And we can say that humble Paul 


10:01.683 --> 10:10.543
was the right man for the job.

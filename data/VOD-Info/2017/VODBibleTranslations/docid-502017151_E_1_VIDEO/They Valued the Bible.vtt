00:32.260 --> 00:35.847
On October 26, 1553, 


00:35.847 --> 00:38.517
Michael Servetus was convicted of heresy 


00:38.517 --> 00:41.229
and sentenced to death by burning. 


00:41.228 --> 00:45.983
The following day, he was chained 
to a post in the city of Geneva. 


00:45.983 --> 00:50.000
Around his feet were placed 
piles of wood ready to be lit. 


00:51.405 --> 00:53.407
What was his crime? 


00:53.407 --> 00:57.410
Servetus loved Bible truth 
and was unable to reconcile 


00:57.410 --> 01:02.082
the teachings of the church 
with his own studies of the Bible. 


01:02.082 --> 01:05.585
Michael Servetus died slowly, 


01:05.585 --> 01:08.922
yet never once did he recant 


01:08.922 --> 01:12.000
his faith in the Bible 
as the Word of God. 


01:14.345 --> 01:18.223
This was by no means 
 the first time fire had been used 


01:18.223 --> 01:20.683
to dissuade 
or destroy individuals 


01:20.683 --> 01:23.228
who loved 
the Bible and its teachings. 


01:23.228 --> 01:25.230
Throughout history, 


01:25.230 --> 01:28.067
the Bible 
has faced repeated attacks. 


01:28.067 --> 01:31.070
Empires have tried 
to destroy it; 


01:31.070 --> 01:34.113
religious leaders 
have tried to hide it. 


01:34.113 --> 01:37.618
But despite opposition 
and the threat of death, 


01:37.618 --> 01:42.330
many have risked their lives 
and reputations to protect it. 


01:42.330 --> 01:47.168
The Bible was completed 
around the year 98 C.E. 


01:47.168 --> 01:50.130
At this point, 
most, if not all, 


01:50.130 --> 01:54.427
Christians lived in territory 
controlled by the Roman Empire.


01:54.427 --> 02:00.724
Roman Emperor Diocletian 
began ruling in 284 C.E. 


02:00.723 --> 02:03.685
Dr. Peter Williams 
works at Tyndale House, 


02:03.685 --> 02:05.980
a center for biblical studies.


02:05.980 --> 02:09.065
Rome didn’t have much time for people 


02:09.065 --> 02:11.068
who didn’t like the Roman religion.


02:11.068 --> 02:14.153
Diocletian instigated a persecution


02:14.153 --> 02:17.991
—a systematic persecution of the Christians.


02:17.992 --> 02:20.660
Probably the most systematic persecution 


02:20.660 --> 02:23.122
that any Roman emperor 
ever undertook. 


02:23.122 --> 02:27.000
He also was very much against 
the Christian books, 


02:27.000 --> 02:29.378
so he wanted 
to get rid of peoples’ Bibles


02:29.378 --> 02:31.588
and copies of books 
of the Bible.


02:31.588 --> 02:33.965
There’s a serious attempt 


02:33.965 --> 02:38.000
to destroy Christianity if possible.


02:43.642 --> 02:45.102
Given such extreme opposition, 


02:45.102 --> 02:49.272
the survival of the Bible and Christianity 
might have seemed impossible. 


02:49.272 --> 02:53.652
How did the Bible writings 
survive this intense opposition?


02:53.652 --> 02:57.239
Here in Dublin we will begin 
to find the answer. 


02:57.238 --> 03:01.035
I’m meeting Jessica Baldwin, 
the Head of Collections 


03:01.035 --> 03:03.787
at the Chester Beatty Library. 


03:03.787 --> 03:08.084
The Chester Beatty Library 
houses three important papyri 


03:08.083 --> 03:11.920
known as P45, P46, and P47. 


03:11.920 --> 03:16.092
It’s believed that these papyri 
 date back to the third century C.E., 


03:16.092 --> 03:18.469
making them some 
of the oldest known manuscripts 


03:18.468 --> 03:20.470
of the New Testament.


03:20.470 --> 03:23.223
This is Chester Beatty’s 
Biblical Papyrus No. 2, 


03:23.223 --> 03:25.975
which is also known as P46, 


03:25.975 --> 03:28.728
and it’s the earliest surviving copy 


03:28.728 --> 03:30.730
of the Pauline Epistles. 


03:30.730 --> 03:33.067
The term “papyrus” 
is used quite extensively, 


03:33.067 --> 03:35.319
but when you look 
at the manuscripts, 


03:35.318 --> 03:37.195
you can actually see 
the material that they’re made of. 


03:37.195 --> 03:40.490
So papyrus is made 
from the pith of the papyrus plant, 


03:40.490 --> 03:43.035
and it was made in Egypt.


03:43.035 --> 03:45.328
This is interesting 
because it appears there’s— 


03:45.328 --> 03:48.123
Is that a fold that’s 
down the middle of that?


03:48.123 --> 03:50.916
These were large manuscripts; 
they were substantial; 


03:50.917 --> 03:53.670
they weren’t single scrolls 
that were rolled and unrolled. 


03:53.670 --> 03:57.090
For a scholar
and for the community at the time 


03:57.090 --> 03:59.677
which these texts 
would have been so vital to, 


03:59.677 --> 04:01.679
to have it in a codex form 
which you could almost


04:01.678 --> 04:04.263
—you could turn to the section 
that you want to refer to. 


04:04.263 --> 04:08.476
You could really use it as a text 
to be read, thought about, understood.


04:08.477 --> 04:11.062
Professor McGing showed me 
these manuscripts 


04:11.062 --> 04:13.149
in further detail.


04:13.148 --> 04:16.901
These are real gold-standard texts. 


04:16.902 --> 04:20.905
They clearly are 
the four Gospels together and Acts. 


04:20.905 --> 04:23.033
The letters are 
all separated out beautifully. 


04:23.033 --> 04:26.703
It was smooth, elegant lines 


04:26.703 --> 04:29.288
neatly arrayed. 


04:29.288 --> 04:31.291
That in itself is, I suppose, 


04:31.292 --> 04:35.129
a tribute to the faith 
of the people doing it. 


04:35.128 --> 04:38.340
This was a task that was important


04:38.340 --> 04:42.760
—it was important to do properly, 
accurately, and beautifully.


04:42.760 --> 04:45.680
These have survived 
because they were contained 


04:45.680 --> 04:48.975
within a ceramic pot and buried.


04:48.975 --> 04:53.397
These were clearly, 
carefully tended for; 


04:53.397 --> 04:57.192
they couldn’t really survive 
in this form otherwise.


04:57.192 --> 05:00.737
Whoever it was 
that protected these manuscripts 


05:00.737 --> 05:03.000
showed that they loved the Bible. 


05:05.075 --> 05:07.077
As the centuries passed, 


05:07.077 --> 05:12.000
the Bible faced new challenges.


05:16.587 --> 05:19.130
William Tyndale 
was the first person to seek 


05:19.130 --> 05:21.758
to translate the Bible 
from the original languages 


05:21.758 --> 05:23.760
into English.


05:23.760 --> 05:27.013
Tyndale was born 
in the late 15th century. 


05:27.013 --> 05:30.391
He was born 
in the area of Gloucestershire 


05:30.392 --> 05:34.270
but had a chance to go to Oxford 
and became a priest.


05:34.270 --> 05:37.190
In the 15th century, 
there was a lot of resistance


05:37.190 --> 05:38.900
—the idea that the Word of God 


05:38.900 --> 05:42.195
could just simply be accessible 
by the general people.


05:42.195 --> 05:45.448
People knew the Latin Bible from church, 


05:45.448 --> 05:48.076
which was interpreted by the priest for them. 


05:48.077 --> 05:51.539
They never had direct access 
to the Bible themselves.


05:51.538 --> 05:54.708
Tyndale was not allowed 
to do this translation in England. 


05:54.708 --> 05:56.918
He went to the Bishop of London 


05:56.918 --> 06:00.838
asking for his permission 
to translate the New Testament 


06:00.838 --> 06:04.008
from the Greek
—the original text—


06:04.008 --> 06:08.000
into English 
but was not given that permission.


06:09.973 --> 06:12.516
Such was the opposition 
to Bible translation 


06:12.517 --> 06:14.895
that Tyndale later wrote 
that there was 


06:14.895 --> 06:17.355
no place to do it in all England. 


06:17.355 --> 06:21.277
And so with the help of merchants 
sympathetic to his cause, 


06:21.277 --> 06:24.822
Tyndale fled to Germany 
where he could more easily work 


06:24.822 --> 06:27.865
on his English translation 
of the New Testament. 


06:27.865 --> 06:29.993
By 1525, 


06:29.993 --> 06:32.870
his translation was complete 
and ready to be printed. 


06:32.870 --> 06:36.500
The British Library in London 
holds the answer 


06:36.500 --> 06:38.543
to what happened next. 


06:38.543 --> 06:42.088
Dr. Karen Limper-Herz, 
a lead curator at the library, 


06:42.088 --> 06:44.591
is going to help us find out.


06:44.592 --> 06:47.052
So we are looking 
at a unique copy of the first edition 


06:47.052 --> 06:50.764
of Tyndale’s New Testament, 
printed in Cologne in 1525. 


06:50.763 --> 06:53.266
The Cologne Fragment 
is the only known copy 


06:53.267 --> 06:56.270
of what exists of Tyndale’s first edition 
of the New Testament. 


06:56.270 --> 07:00.398
The fact that it is a fragment 
shows that it was a dangerous thing to do. 


07:00.398 --> 07:03.943
The printer had too much to drink
and mentioned that he 


07:03.943 --> 07:07.948
was printing 
this pro-Lutheran English New Testament 


07:07.948 --> 07:09.950
for somebody 
called William Tyndale. 


07:09.950 --> 07:12.743
The authorities found out about it, 
and the print shop was raided. 


07:12.743 --> 07:14.746
Tyndale and his partners ran


07:14.747 --> 07:16.749
—and this is all that survives today—


07:16.748 --> 07:18.833
and they went down the Rhine 
a bit further to Worms. 


07:18.833 --> 07:22.253
So the fact that they didn’t get much further 
than part way through Matthew 


07:22.253 --> 07:24.296
is quite indicative 
of how dangerous it was.


07:24.297 --> 07:27.842
The first complete copies 
of Tyndale’s translation 


07:27.842 --> 07:31.514
of the Christian Greek Scriptures 
were finally printed 


07:31.513 --> 07:34.140
in the city of Worms in Germany 


07:34.140 --> 07:36.183
in 1526. 


07:36.183 --> 07:41.000
Around 3,000 or more 
of these books were produced.


07:48.363 --> 07:50.365
After leaving Germany, 


07:50.365 --> 07:53.618
Tyndale moved to Antwerp. 


07:53.618 --> 07:56.871
This bustling city was ideal for Tyndale. 


07:56.872 --> 08:01.710
It had a thriving printing industry 
and its busy port 


08:01.710 --> 08:05.297
made it easy for his books 
to reach readers in England. 


08:05.297 --> 08:08.300
Professor Guido Latré 
has kindly offered to show me 


08:08.300 --> 08:11.803
around the very streets that Tyndale 
would have walked himself 


08:11.803 --> 08:14.138
some 500 years ago.


08:14.138 --> 08:17.975
What he saw around him here 
were ordinary people 


08:17.975 --> 08:20.478
having access 
to the Bible in Dutch. 


08:20.478 --> 08:24.398
He wanted the same 
for his own folk in England. 


08:24.398 --> 08:28.445
If you wanted to smuggle Bibles 
on a large scale into England, 


08:28.445 --> 08:32.573
this was Northern Europe’s 
biggest seaport. 


08:32.573 --> 08:35.660
You can’t easily smuggle 


08:35.660 --> 08:38.330
a big volume and a big format. 


08:38.330 --> 08:41.207
So tiny loose leaves 


08:41.207 --> 08:43.377
that were taken to places like this


08:43.377 --> 08:45.462
—these underground cellars, 
the warehouses—


08:45.462 --> 08:47.755
and between the leaves 


08:47.755 --> 08:50.133
of larger books 
that were not forbidden, 


08:50.133 --> 08:53.303
the tiny leaves of Tyndale’s translation 
would have been hidden. 


08:53.303 --> 08:56.390
In London, 
someone would have recognized:


08:56.390 --> 08:59.183
‘Aha! 
These are the stacks that are marked. 


08:59.183 --> 09:01.603
‘I must have a look at these 


09:01.603 --> 09:04.355
and find the loose leaves 
of Tyndale’s Bible.’ 


09:04.355 --> 09:09.110
There were about 30,000 copies 
of Tyndale’s Bible available 


09:09.110 --> 09:10.570
by the end of his life. 


09:10.570 --> 09:14.157
This was a brave man 
and a big man in terms of courage 


09:14.157 --> 09:16.494
and in terms of investment of time. 


09:16.493 --> 09:20.000
And the risks he took 
are not to be underestimated.


09:21.790 --> 09:23.875
William Tyndale was imprisoned 


09:23.875 --> 09:26.712
here in Vilvoorde, just north of Brussels. 


09:26.712 --> 09:29.547
As he languished 
in prison for over a year, 


09:29.547 --> 09:34.052
he no doubt contemplated the cruel death 
that inevitably awaited him. 


09:34.052 --> 09:38.265
Tyndale is often renowned 
for his influence on the English language, 


09:38.265 --> 09:42.393
but his work was more than 
that of just scholarly ambition. 


09:42.393 --> 09:44.728
Tyndale loved the Bible. 


09:44.728 --> 09:47.273
Maybe it can be said of him 


09:47.273 --> 09:50.651
that he shared the feelings of the psalmist 
who spoke of God’s Word 


09:50.652 --> 09:55.000
and said: 
“How I do love your law!”


10:09.880 --> 10:12.048
As news of Tyndale’s death 


10:12.048 --> 10:14.050
spread throughout Europe, 


10:14.050 --> 10:16.470
it no doubt concerned 
other truth seekers 


10:16.470 --> 10:18.972
who were making 
their own studies of the Bible. 


10:18.972 --> 10:22.017
One such man 
was Michael Servetus, 


10:22.017 --> 10:24.310
whom we mentioned 
at the outset. 


10:24.310 --> 10:28.523
He was born here, 
in the Aragon region of Northern Spain. 


10:28.523 --> 10:30.525
We have traveled to Villanueva de Sijena 


10:30.525 --> 10:34.070
to find out more about him. 


10:34.070 --> 10:37.032
Sergio Baches is the director 
of the Michael Servetus Institute, 


10:37.032 --> 10:39.492
which runs a museum in the house 


10:39.492 --> 10:42.000
where it is believed Servetus was raised.


10:43.497 --> 10:45.499
We have a young man 


10:45.498 --> 10:46.916
who is exposed 


10:46.917 --> 10:48.502
to the main religious problems 


10:48.502 --> 10:53.089
at that time that influenced 
his future thoughts 


10:53.088 --> 10:56.133
about some of the tricky issues 


10:56.133 --> 10:57.718
related to Christianity, 


10:57.718 --> 11:00.000
such as, for instance, 
the dogma of the Holy Trinity. 


11:01.682 --> 11:04.017
So he wanted to go to the sources. 


11:04.017 --> 11:08.439
And that’s what Servetus thought: 


11:08.438 --> 11:11.900
The truth must be found in the Bible.


11:11.900 --> 11:17.113
Doctor Marian Hillar 
has published work on Michael Servetus.


11:17.113 --> 11:19.156
He was sent, 


11:19.157 --> 11:21.994
probably upon the advice of his father, 


11:21.993 --> 11:25.038
to Toulouse to study the law. 


11:25.038 --> 11:27.456
In Toulouse, 
which was a very restrictive place 


11:27.457 --> 11:31.044
where reading of the Bible 
was forbidden, 


11:31.043 --> 11:34.005
he got involved 
in serious studies of the Bible. 


11:34.005 --> 11:36.007
He had intellectual curiosity. 


11:36.007 --> 11:38.844
At that time, 
the main issue which people 


11:38.843 --> 11:42.221
were really discussing in the streets 
and everywhere was religion.


11:42.222 --> 11:46.100
In 1531, 
Servetus published his first book 


11:46.100 --> 11:49.228
entitled On the Errors of the Trinity. 


11:49.228 --> 11:52.440
In his book, he questioned 
the teachings of the church 


11:52.440 --> 11:56.068
regarding the identity 
of God and Jesus. 


11:56.068 --> 11:59.321
He later wrote: 
“In the Bible, 


11:59.322 --> 12:01.324
“there is no mention of the Trinity. 


12:01.323 --> 12:03.368
“We get to know God, 


12:03.368 --> 12:06.328
“not through 
our proud philosophical concepts, 


12:06.328 --> 12:09.081
but through Christ.” 


12:09.082 --> 12:13.420
In his writings, 
Servetus quoted from or alluded to 


12:13.420 --> 12:17.173
at least 52 of the 66 books of the Bible. 


12:17.173 --> 12:21.051
It’s clear that Michael Servetus 
was a man who valued 


12:21.052 --> 12:24.472
the teachings 
of the Bible above all others.


12:24.472 --> 12:27.267
Servetus was arrested 


12:27.267 --> 12:30.062
and was accused of heresy.


12:30.062 --> 12:34.149
It’s a crystal clear example 


12:34.148 --> 12:38.403
of cruelty and religious bigotry.


12:38.403 --> 12:41.405
It was expressed 
that he has to be punished. 


12:41.405 --> 12:43.742
And at that time, the only punishment 


12:43.742 --> 12:46.077
which you could imagine was death.


12:46.077 --> 12:48.705
I guess his driving force 


12:48.705 --> 12:51.750
was the search of truth, 


12:51.750 --> 12:56.587
the need to restore 
Christianity to its origins.


12:56.587 --> 13:01.425
Although various views 
on Servetus’ conclusions have been raised, 


13:01.425 --> 13:06.305
it’s clear he was driven 
by a sincere thirst for Biblical truth. 


13:06.305 --> 13:10.018
He wrote: 
“A book has been given us from heaven, 


13:10.018 --> 13:14.896
so that in it we may search after God.” 


13:14.897 --> 13:19.860
History is full of accounts of those 
who have risked and given their lives 


13:19.860 --> 13:23.365
to read, to translate, 
or to understand the Bible. 


13:23.365 --> 13:26.993
Their overriding motivation 
must surely have been 


13:26.993 --> 13:30.038
the value they placed on the Bible. 


13:30.038 --> 13:34.041
The Bible has come to us 
through great opposition. 


13:34.042 --> 13:37.129
It has survived physical destruction. 


13:37.128 --> 13:41.006
The simple act of translating it 
has been outlawed 


13:41.007 --> 13:43.969
and those who have strived 
to read and understand it 


13:43.968 --> 13:46.345
have often been 
punished with death. 


13:46.345 --> 13:49.848
And yet, 
the Bible and the wisdom in it 


13:49.848 --> 13:51.976
survives to this day, 


13:51.977 --> 13:55.480
a faithful transmission 
of the original writers’ words. 


13:55.480 --> 14:26.657
No wonder so many 
have placed such value on the Bible.

00:01.050 --> 00:04.120
Knowing that Jehovah 
is personally involved 


00:04.120 --> 00:07.223
in preserving 
and making known his Word, 


00:07.223 --> 00:09.825
we can be confident 
that the Bible 


00:09.825 --> 00:13.430
is the only true means 
of drawing close to him. 


00:13.430 --> 00:15.432
As a child, 


00:15.432 --> 00:18.769
David Sibrey, from England, 
had not read the Bible. 


00:18.768 --> 00:22.771
Instead, he had been taught 
traditions of men. 


00:22.772 --> 00:26.000
What helped him see the truth?


00:28.778 --> 00:31.815
I was born in 1930. 


00:31.815 --> 00:33.817
We lived in Littlehampton, 


00:33.817 --> 00:36.052
which was a seaside town, 


00:36.052 --> 00:40.957
a very pleasant little place, 
quiet place.


00:40.957 --> 00:43.359
I would like to walk 
in the countryside. 


00:43.358 --> 00:45.661
Nature intrigued me. 


00:45.662 --> 00:48.465
My interest was in what I saw 
rather than what I read.


00:48.465 --> 00:50.367
Well, in 1939, 


00:50.367 --> 00:55.472
war broke out, and our road 
became the second line of defense. 


00:55.472 --> 00:57.840
And then, of course, 
you get the aircraft. 


00:57.840 --> 01:01.343
Well, there was a young boy 
(younger than myself), 


01:01.343 --> 01:05.348
and one Sunday morning 
an air raid took place, 


01:05.348 --> 01:07.516
and the house 
where he was living 


01:07.517 --> 01:09.519
was destroyed, 
and he was killed.


01:09.518 --> 01:12.321
But I remember 
saying to my mother, 


01:12.322 --> 01:14.957
“Why did he have to die?” 


01:14.957 --> 01:17.160
And her answer was: 


01:17.160 --> 01:19.162
“Well, he’s in a better place. 


01:19.162 --> 01:21.164
He’s with God in heaven,” 


01:21.163 --> 01:24.100
which didn’t quite 
add up to me. 


01:24.100 --> 01:26.335
I couldn’t understand 
how God 


01:26.335 --> 01:28.972
could be responsible 
for his death, 


01:28.972 --> 01:31.740
which meant 
He was responsible for war. 


01:31.740 --> 01:36.745
So it was—
The whole thing was depressing; 


01:36.745 --> 01:38.882
perhaps put it that way.


01:38.882 --> 01:41.785
As far as religion was concerned, 


01:41.785 --> 01:43.787
I accepted it was there, 


01:43.787 --> 01:46.000
but I couldn’t understand 
how it fit in with what was going on. 


01:47.357 --> 01:49.392
There was a gap somewhere, 


01:49.392 --> 01:51.527
and I couldn’t, I couldn’t, plug it. 


01:51.527 --> 01:53.530
Every time you went to church, 


01:53.530 --> 01:55.832
you had a hymnbook 
and a prayer book, 


01:55.832 --> 01:58.367
but a Bible was something 
you had personally. 


01:58.367 --> 02:00.904
And the only time 
I ever opened it 


02:00.903 --> 02:05.541
was when I began to study 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.


02:05.542 --> 02:09.145
I was 17 or 18 years of age 
when I started. 


02:09.145 --> 02:13.717
A brother named Joe Gladwin 
called upon me. 


02:13.717 --> 02:15.719
I knew nothing about the Bible. 


02:15.718 --> 02:17.753
The fact that he said it, 
fair enough. 


02:17.753 --> 02:19.955
He said it was in the Bible, OK. 


02:19.955 --> 02:21.958
But what do other people say? 


02:21.958 --> 02:24.726
I decided to look for myself. 


02:24.727 --> 02:29.232
I realized that what Joe 
was telling me was right. 


02:29.232 --> 02:31.467
He showed me 
that the Bible was true.


02:31.467 --> 02:34.470
I began to see that the Bible 


02:34.470 --> 02:36.572
told me things 
that I had never known. 


02:36.572 --> 02:38.642
Over the years, 
I’ve been privileged 


02:38.642 --> 02:41.912
to collect so many 
different translations of the Bible. 


02:41.912 --> 02:43.914
Reading through the different translations, 


02:43.913 --> 02:47.783
it’s clear that God’s Word never changes.


02:47.783 --> 02:52.521
I got baptized 
at the age of 20 in 1950. 


02:52.522 --> 02:55.792
Over the years, 
I’ve served first of all as a pioneer. 


02:55.792 --> 02:57.794
From then I came to Bethel. 


02:57.793 --> 03:02.165
Moving from Bethel 
to the circuit and district work, 


03:02.165 --> 03:06.535
and then finally, 
coming back to Bethel for the Writing Desk.


03:06.535 --> 03:08.705
The assignments I’ve had 


03:08.705 --> 03:12.275
have strengthened my conviction 
not only that Jehovah 


03:12.275 --> 03:16.378
is giving direction and his spirit 
can enable us to do 


03:16.378 --> 03:19.148
whatever he wants us to do 


03:19.148 --> 03:21.816
but that the organization has grown and, 


03:21.817 --> 03:25.355
with the development 
of the Governing Body’s direction, 


03:25.355 --> 03:28.725
is an organization 
which is second to none. 


03:28.725 --> 03:33.563
And, therefore, 
staying with it is the logical thing to do.


03:33.563 --> 03:37.200
In my life, 
I looked in many places 


03:37.200 --> 03:39.502
for answers 
to life’s questions, 


03:39.502 --> 03:43.472
but only the Bible 
has provided answers. 


03:43.472 --> 03:54.502
I am so thankful 
that Jehovah continues to teach us.

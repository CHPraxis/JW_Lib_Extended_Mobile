00:01.083 --> 00:03.118
Perhaps for us, 


00:03.118 --> 00:06.790
our past mistakes are keeping us 
from moving forward. 


00:06.790 --> 00:08.925
That was the challenge for Jim Loyd. 


00:08.925 --> 00:11.327
He was raised in the truth 


00:11.327 --> 00:13.730
but did not progress to baptism. 


00:13.730 --> 00:16.767
By his teen years, 
he was getting into trouble. 


00:16.767 --> 00:21.070
As he describes it, 
in his heart he had left Jehovah. 


00:21.070 --> 00:24.040
His later involvement 
with gangs and violence 


00:24.040 --> 00:27.243
put him in a place 
he never expected to be. 


00:27.243 --> 00:29.945
But you will be greatly encouraged 


00:29.945 --> 00:32.415
to see where he is now.


00:32.415 --> 00:35.618
Things that have happened to you, 
you can’t change


00:35.618 --> 00:39.021
—but your personality you can. 


00:39.022 --> 00:42.025
We can change our personality 
with Jehovah’s help.


00:42.025 --> 00:44.027
By the time I was 25, 


00:44.027 --> 00:47.164
I was associating with notorious criminals.


00:47.163 --> 00:49.698
I guess I was a criminal too


00:49.698 --> 00:52.201
—just took a wrong turn and kept going.


00:52.202 --> 00:57.000
I found myself a fugitive on the run. 


00:58.140 --> 01:01.643
I was sentenced to many years in prison. 


01:01.643 --> 01:05.781
At 25, I felt like it might as well 
have been a life sentence. 


01:05.782 --> 01:09.319
Isolation and lockdown 


01:09.318 --> 01:11.453
was a very lonely place, 


01:11.453 --> 01:15.000
and I thought, 
‘How did I get here?’


01:16.793 --> 01:19.561
I remember a happier time in my life. 


01:19.562 --> 01:22.232
My mom would take us to meetings. 


01:22.232 --> 01:26.135
I was in the Theocratic Ministry School. 


01:26.135 --> 01:30.173
All the friends were so loving. 


01:30.173 --> 01:34.176
My mom sent me subscriptions 
to The Watchtower and Awake! 


01:34.177 --> 01:37.280
I had a box under my bunk, 


01:37.280 --> 01:40.717
and I’d toss them in there


01:40.717 --> 01:42.585
—never opened them. 


01:42.585 --> 01:44.553
And I must have had a years’ worth. 


01:44.553 --> 01:47.190
You know, I never told her: 


01:47.190 --> 01:48.423
“Stop sending them, Mom. 


01:48.423 --> 01:51.000
I’m not reading them.”


01:52.262 --> 01:54.264
I found out through my mom


01:54.263 --> 01:56.000
that my dad had died. 


01:59.268 --> 02:03.000
I felt that I broke his heart. 


02:04.540 --> 02:07.000
I pulled out the box from under my bunk. 


02:08.110 --> 02:10.947
Right on top was a book,


02:10.947 --> 02:14.517
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. 


02:14.517 --> 02:17.720
And at that moment, I knew 


02:17.720 --> 02:20.000
Jehovah hadn’t forgotten me. 


02:21.590 --> 02:23.893
I remembered that book. 


02:23.893 --> 02:26.595
I remembered that book when I was a boy. 


02:26.595 --> 02:29.000
I placed that book out in service. 


02:30.767 --> 02:32.302
I opened it up. 


02:32.302 --> 02:36.072
And, of course, the theme scripture 
for that publication 


02:36.072 --> 02:38.775
was Revelation 21:3, 4: 


02:38.775 --> 02:41.710
“The tent of God is with mankind.” 


02:41.710 --> 02:44.347
I read it that night the whole night. 


02:44.347 --> 02:45.615
I read the whole book. 


02:45.615 --> 02:48.083
Of course, that little bell went off. 


02:48.083 --> 02:50.220
I couldn’t deny that this was the truth. 


02:50.220 --> 02:52.000
So what was I going to do about it?


02:54.457 --> 02:57.027
Shortly after that, I got transferred, 


02:57.027 --> 02:58.595
so I called my mom and told her. 


02:58.595 --> 03:00.230
It was funny; she asked, 


03:00.230 --> 03:02.098
“Do you think there are
any Jehovah’s Witnesses


03:02.098 --> 03:03.833
that go up there?”


03:03.833 --> 03:05.468
I told her: “I don’t think so. 


03:05.468 --> 03:06.568
“It’s way up in the mountains. 


03:06.568 --> 03:10.000
I don’t think they go up there; 
it’s a little fire camp.”


03:11.340 --> 03:13.508
I wasn’t a spiritual person yet. 


03:13.508 --> 03:17.013
All the magazines and books 


03:17.013 --> 03:22.000
went back into the box 
and back under my bunk. 


03:23.920 --> 03:25.322
I’d only been there five minutes,


03:25.322 --> 03:27.624
and a guard came in and said, 


03:27.623 --> 03:30.158
“Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?” 


03:30.158 --> 03:31.826
I couldn’t believe it. 


03:31.827 --> 03:36.199
And I told him, “I studied with, 
been studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


03:36.198 --> 03:38.668
And he said: 
“Oh, good. Follow me.” 


03:38.668 --> 03:40.836
And I followed him, 
and he took me 


03:40.837 --> 03:43.607
and introduced me to a brother 


03:43.607 --> 03:46.842
who had been coming up 
there regularly 


03:46.842 --> 03:49.879
to study the Bible 
with inmates there.


03:49.878 --> 03:52.148
And I realized 


03:52.148 --> 03:54.283
at that moment that once again 


03:54.283 --> 03:57.000
Jehovah had not forgotten me.


03:58.453 --> 04:02.191
That brother faithfully came up there


04:02.192 --> 04:05.995
for the next two years 
every Friday night. 


04:05.995 --> 04:08.632
He thought that it’d be 
a good idea to have 


04:08.632 --> 04:11.034
a Theocratic Ministry School, 
so he got it approved. 


04:11.033 --> 04:13.035
He would do the number one talk, 


04:13.035 --> 04:15.037
and the other brother 
that would come with him 


04:15.037 --> 04:17.940
would do the highlights,
and then the three of us inmates


04:17.940 --> 04:19.708
would do the other parts. 


04:19.708 --> 04:21.000
I was giving a talk every week.


04:22.378 --> 04:24.380
And he started making 


04:24.380 --> 04:26.915
tape recordings of the meetings. 


04:26.915 --> 04:28.317
I’d listen to them over and over, 


04:28.317 --> 04:31.620
until the next week. 


04:31.620 --> 04:35.023
I knew that if I was going 
to return to Jehovah, 


04:35.023 --> 04:38.026
I had to make some adjustments. 


04:38.027 --> 04:40.664
With Jehovah’s help
—I leaned on him more, 


04:40.663 --> 04:42.565
relied on his strength more—


04:42.565 --> 04:46.000
it was then that I really felt 
that I could do this.


04:47.370 --> 04:51.740
The beard became a goatee, 
and then it just became a mustache. 


04:51.740 --> 04:54.010
No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, 


04:54.010 --> 04:57.180
and I cleaned up my language. 


04:57.180 --> 05:00.082
Then I finally got released, 


05:00.082 --> 05:02.252
got a job as an electrician, 


05:02.252 --> 05:05.622
and was able to get my own place


05:05.622 --> 05:08.000
and started going to meetings. 


05:09.925 --> 05:14.030
I was listening to the Watchtower, 
and different ones were commenting. 


05:14.030 --> 05:16.032
‘Oh, that’s his wife’


05:16.032 --> 05:19.069
—one of the brothers 
who came up to visit me. 


05:19.068 --> 05:23.071
I kept looking to see, 
so I could finally put a face 


05:23.072 --> 05:25.975
to the voices
that I’d been listening to.


05:25.975 --> 05:28.610
I let Jehovah mold me


05:28.610 --> 05:32.000
into something good.


05:33.582 --> 05:37.454
There are many blessings 
since dedicating my life to Jehovah. 


05:37.453 --> 05:40.321
I’ve been an elder for ten years now. 


05:40.322 --> 05:42.325
One of my sons came into the truth. 


05:42.325 --> 05:44.660
I met my wonderful wife. 


05:44.660 --> 05:46.662
She’s helped me 


05:46.662 --> 05:51.000
to grow spiritually 
and to love Jehovah even more. 


05:51.000 --> 05:56.872
One thing I kept praying for and he’s blessed
me with is to forgive myself


05:56.872 --> 06:00.444
—to have a clean conscience 
and freeness of speech. 


06:00.443 --> 06:10.970
And he’s done that.

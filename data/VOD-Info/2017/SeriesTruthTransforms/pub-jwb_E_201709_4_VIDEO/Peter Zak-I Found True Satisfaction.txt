00:00 On the subject of punctuality,
00:03 we wanted to share an example
00:05 of how ingrained a problem can become
00:08 if we let it fester.
00:10 Meet Brother Peter Zak.
00:12 As he relates his story,
00:14 look for ways punctuality,
00:16 or promptly addressing matters,
00:19 could have helped him to minimize
00:21 the effects of the problem.
00:26 I was born in Poland,  and when I was about five years old,
00:30 my family immigrated to Canada.
00:32 I feel that from a young age  I really loved Jehovah.
00:36 I had a good relationship with him.
00:38 I enjoyed going in field service;  I enjoyed the congregation.
00:43 But like all youths,  I had my distractions, you could say.
00:48 And for me, in particular,  it was video games.
00:51 I remember in the beginning  even my parents would set some rules.
00:56 But as I kept progressing  in that game
00:58 and I started participating  in tournaments,
01:00 I started getting recognized  and admired.
01:02 It started becoming a temptation.
01:08 People would go to download  my previously played games
01:11 to study my techniques  and my strategies.
01:13 I was interviewed by different websites.
01:16 People wanted to be on my team.
01:18 I could see that this world  was slowly dragging me in.
01:22 For example, there was  a huge tournament that I participated in.
01:27 I finished very well —received many prizes.
01:30 And then after that tournament,  there was another tournament,
01:33 even bigger, with huge prizes —cash prizes—
01:36 a competition for all the best players  in the world.
01:38 At this time, also,  the website was growing.
01:41 We were just sponsored to produce our own tournament
01:44 with cash prizes for the players.
01:46 So I really thought that this would be  an opportunity for me
01:49 to maybe have a career  and maybe to support myself
01:52 in the future  if I wanted to pioneer.
01:55 And I thought  that this was a realistic goal.
01:58 But as the website also kept progressing  and as I got more involved with it,
02:03 I realized that what I was exposed to
02:05 was very, very, dangerous —very harmful.
02:10 They were immoral,  wicked, improper things.
02:16 I was going to the meetings,   and I was going in service;
02:19 but at the same time, all my other time  was spent on this video game.
02:22 But it was only slowly,  over time, I started realizing
02:25 that it was having  a very negative effect on my spirituality.
02:29 I noticed that when I was in service,
02:32 I would think only about the video game.
02:34 When the service was over,  I would rush home to play the video game.
02:38 Even at meetings—  I would attend all my meetings,
02:40 but I would sit there  and nothing was coming in.
02:42 I went there in person,  but my mind wasn’t there.
02:45 So that also started bothering me.
02:49 And at this time,  my older brothers
02:53 —who were always  a good example to me—
02:56 they quit playing games.
02:58 They were making improvement  in the congregation;
03:01 they were having privileges,
03:04 working hard for the brothers  and sisters in our congregation.
03:06 I could see they were so happy.
03:08 They had the real joy  and satisfaction.
03:11 But for me, I didn’t;
03:14 I was always feeling empty inside.
03:17 I needed to change.
03:19 And I remember, in particular,  one day at the back of the Kingdom Hall,
03:22 the brother—an elder—who studied  with me and my two brothers
03:25 approached me;
03:27 and he very reasonably talked to me
03:30 about my future.
03:33 He also helped me see  my brothers
03:36 and how they stopped,  and they were so happy.
03:38 And I could see the difference.
03:40 I was serving  two masters at the same time,
03:43 but I was really losing out  with Jehovah.
03:51 So I knew I had  to make drastic changes in my life.
03:55 Up until then, I did try a few times  to stop playing video games.
04:00 And it worked for a couple of days,  but I got right back into it.
04:02 I lacked self-control.
04:09 So I realized that for me—  If I wanted to stop this,
04:13 I needed to make  a complete stop of everything.
04:16 So I prayed about it.
04:18 I asked Jehovah  for help and for strength
04:20 to give me the courage  to take this action.
04:23 We took down the website,  deleted the games,
04:26 stopped playing the games,  and just made
04:29 a clean sweep—clean stop.
04:31 And I knew I needed that.
04:34 Right after,  I felt like a load was lifted.
04:41 I had all this time  now I could spend,
04:43 and I was spending it  more in the ministry
04:45 and in the congregation.
04:47 So, soon after,  I started auxiliary pioneering
04:49 and then regular pioneering.
04:51 I started doing a lot more  in the congregation.
04:53 I could see how happy I was.
04:55 It was bringing me real joy
04:57 —satisfaction.
04:59 So I remember  after pioneering for a few years,
05:02 I started learning a foreign language.
05:04 It was challenging,  but it was exciting.
05:06 I moved to another city to expand my ministry;
05:10 then I moved to another country.
05:12 And I remember just studying  with people
05:14 as a need-greater  and just seeing them
05:18 progress and seeing how they  made changes in their lives
05:21 and how they started  having a relationship with Jehovah.
05:24 And that I was being used  to help them to get to that point
05:27 was such an amazing feeling.
05:32 Now I have the privilege  of serving at Bethel.
05:35 And I can see  Jehovah’s hand in my life,
05:37 and also I’m able  to give every day to him.
05:54 This is the joy that I was looking for.
05:57 So I would definitely  encourage all young ones
06:01 to really test out Jehovah.
06:04 It’s like Ecclesiastes 12:1,
06:06 my favorite scripture growing up.
06:08 Just give to Jehovah;  test him out; give him your everything.
06:11 And you will see  that you’ll have no regrets.
06:14 You’ll have true satisfaction  from serving him.

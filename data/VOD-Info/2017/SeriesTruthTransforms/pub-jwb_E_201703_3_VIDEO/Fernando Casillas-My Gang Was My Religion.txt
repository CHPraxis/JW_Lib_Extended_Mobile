00:01 There is a saying
00:03 that experience  is the best teacher,
00:06 but that is not  really accurate.
00:08 Experience is often  the hard way to learn.
00:14 Brother Fernando Casillas  was born in Mexico,
00:19 but when he was a baby,
00:21 his family moved  to the United States.
00:25 The neighborhood he grew up in  had a lot of gang influence.
00:32 This had  a very negative impact on him.
00:35 But despite these circumstances,
00:39 notice how the truth attracted him.
00:46 I used to love violence;  I dreamed of violence.
00:50 My gang was my religion.
00:53 I got into the prison system  at a young age.
00:56 At first, they sent me  to a juvenile facility,
00:59 but I got kicked out of there  for a riot.
01:01 Basically, they deemed me a threat  to the safety and security
01:05 of the institution,  the guards, and other inmates.
01:09 And I was sent  to solitary confinement
01:11 to finish off my prison term.
01:13 Me thinking  I was violent back then
01:15 was nothing compared to  what I came out with.
01:19 Basically, what you try to come out to be
01:21 is the best killer out of all.
01:24 After my incarceration,
01:27 I was deported to Mexico.
01:32 I used to carry a weapon  with me everywhere I went.
01:34 After a while, we started getting involved  with bad people.
01:38 Eventually,  my girlfriend got in trouble.
01:41 Once that was over,
01:43 she saw a Kingdom Hall.
01:45 My girlfriend had been  to meetings as a child,
01:47 so she basically dragged me  to the Kingdom Hall.
01:50 They treated me nice.
01:52 And that’s when I started  to get to know Omar.
01:55 So I started hanging around  with him and his wife
01:57 —me and my girlfriend at the time— and going to meetings.
02:01 But it wasn’t till I found out  this guy
02:03 used to be one of my rivals
02:05 —I was very, very upset.
02:07 I felt betrayed because he never told me.
02:09 Everything that was going  through my head was,
02:12 ‘I’ve got to find a way to get him over here,
02:14 so I can hurt him.’
02:16 After thinking about all the things  that I wanted to do to him that night
02:19 —I’d been running it through my head  over and over again—
02:23 I decided to just stay friends with him.
02:26 And eventually,  we decided to start studying together.
02:30 Being the way I was,  I thought that there’s
02:33 no way a God can forgive me.
02:36 The scripture at Isaiah 55:7  really helped me,
02:39 where it says:
02:41 “Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his thoughts;
02:45 let him return to Jehovah,  who will have mercy on him.”
02:48 As time went by,  I started understanding clearly
02:51 that Jehovah does forgive.
02:54 By that time, I had already  kind of made a decision
02:58 that I was done with doing time in prison.
03:00 I just decided to cut all ties with everybody
03:02 that had anything to do  with anything illegal.
03:05 I felt like a free person.
03:07 And after progressing
03:09 and quitting the habits that I had  of smoking and drinking a lot,
03:12 I became  an unbaptized publisher.
03:15 But my father passed away;
03:17 I started hanging around  with bad association again,
03:20 and eventually  I had my privileges removed.
03:23 And as that was happening,  Satan attacked me again.
03:27 So one day, my wife was crossing the border
03:30 to go take care of some paperwork for the kids
03:32 and was surprised by the border patrol
03:35 telling her that there  were drugs in the vehicle.
03:38 We did not know  that the previous owner
03:40 had stashed drugs in the truck.
03:42 Even though later they proved
03:44 that the drugs were not my wife’s and she was released,
03:47 they still decided to keep my kids.
03:51 What I was thinking of doing  was going back to my old ways
03:55 —organizing a plot with my old friends
03:57 to bring my kids back to Mexico to me.
04:01 But I decided to rely
04:03 on Jehovah instead  and on the brothers
04:05 coming to visit me  on a regular basis
04:08 and giving me encouraging thoughts
04:10 of how Jehovah  will take care of everything.
04:13 Eventually, our kids were returned to us,
04:15 with Jehovah’s help.
04:17 After a little struggle,  of course, I had my privileges back.
04:21 A few months later, I was baptized.
04:24 I’m a lot happier now  than what I was back then.
04:29 One day as I was preaching in the rehab centers,
04:32 I ran into a person  I once knew before, growing up.
04:35 Once he found out who I was, he said:
04:38 “You’re the reason why I left town.
04:41 Every time you would see me,  you would shoot at me.”
04:44 So after a while,  I was able to convince him
04:46 that actually my purpose there
04:49 was not to hurt him anymore
04:51 but to teach him the truth
04:54 and how to gain everlasting life.
04:56 I’m no longer a violent person.
04:59 I enjoy the privileges  that Jehovah now gives me.
05:02 I have now been serving  as a ministerial servant
05:05 for the past two years.
05:07 I’m in charge of the accounting
05:09 for the Kingdom Hall,
05:11 instead of stealing money  as I used to do before.
05:14 What I do for a living  is I do gardening work.
05:17 Now I don’t carry around knives,
05:19 but I carry around my tools.
05:22 You could say that I did beat
05:24 my pistols into plowshares now
05:27 —or weed whacker or lawn mower.
05:31 I’m glad that I’m  now serving a great God
05:33 who is loving,  caring, and forgiving.
05:42 Fernando and his family are serving
05:45 in an English congregation in Mexico.
05:49 With everything  Brother Casillas went through,
05:53 he could see
05:55 that Jehovah is the best teacher.
05:58 If you listen to Jehovah,
06:01 you won’t have to learn  the hard way.
06:04 Jehovah is
06:06 “the One teaching you  to benefit yourself.”

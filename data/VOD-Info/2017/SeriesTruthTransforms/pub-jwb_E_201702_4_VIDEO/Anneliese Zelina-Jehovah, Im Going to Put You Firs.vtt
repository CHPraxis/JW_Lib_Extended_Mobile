00:06.235 --> 00:08.695
Growing up in the truth, 


00:08.695 --> 00:10.907
I felt like I fit in 


00:10.907 --> 00:12.992
more with my friends at school 


00:12.992 --> 00:15.035
or people who weren’t Witnesses. 


00:15.035 --> 00:17.830
I was living a double life 
and I knew it. 


00:17.830 --> 00:20.165
I was not baptized.


00:20.165 --> 00:23.918
I had always tried to make 
the truth fit in with the world. 


00:23.918 --> 00:26.463
And this time I decided 
that I just want to give 


00:26.463 --> 00:28.465
the world a shot 
and see what that’s like.


00:28.465 --> 00:30.508
I came right to my parents, 
and I said, 


00:30.508 --> 00:33.386
“I want to move to LA 
and pursue modeling.” 


00:33.387 --> 00:36.599
I had my first job within the week. 


00:36.598 --> 00:40.000
It looked so glamorous.


00:48.735 --> 00:50.737
There were a lot of parties


00:50.737 --> 00:55.000
—going to the coolest houses, 
getting to hang out with celebrities. 


00:56.993 --> 00:58.995
There are no rules. 


00:58.995 --> 01:01.000
You have the money 
to do whatever you want.


01:03.208 --> 01:08.130
That lifestyle was so far 
from what I was raised knowing as right 


01:08.130 --> 01:11.967
that I basically had 
no relationship with Jehovah.


01:11.967 --> 01:14.262
Once all the smoke 
and mirrors are gone, 


01:14.262 --> 01:16.264
you see these things 
for what they are.


01:16.263 --> 01:18.265
I remember I called my mom, 


01:18.265 --> 01:20.267
and I told her: 
“It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah. 


01:20.267 --> 01:22.269
I’m literally in the middle of it all.” 


01:22.268 --> 01:24.271
And I thought, like, this is it; 


01:24.272 --> 01:26.732
this is what everyone says is the best, 
and I’m not happy. 


01:26.732 --> 01:29.735
And I just felt so dull
—empty. 


01:29.735 --> 01:31.737
And I actually thought to myself: 


01:31.737 --> 01:34.155
‘I wish—
I wish I was never raised a Witness. 


01:34.155 --> 01:37.283
I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.’


01:37.283 --> 01:40.911
There were certain nights 
where I needed Him. 


01:40.912 --> 01:43.165
I was thinking, 
‘Just pray; just go to him.’ 


01:43.165 --> 01:45.625
And I couldn’t.


01:45.625 --> 01:48.000
I thought I would never be able to
come back to Jehovah.


01:53.217 --> 01:55.219
One of the jobs 
I got hired to do 


01:55.218 --> 01:58.013
was to work 
for this young fashion company. 


01:58.013 --> 02:01.766
In between different outfits and shoots, 
you would, you know, 


02:01.767 --> 02:03.000
talk with the photographer.


02:05.520 --> 02:07.522
So, what are you guys 
going to be for Halloween?


02:07.522 --> 02:09.525
Matt doesn’t celebrate Halloween. 


02:09.525 --> 02:11.527
He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


02:11.527 --> 02:13.112
So am I.


02:13.112 --> 02:14.322
It’s not a joke.


02:14.322 --> 02:16.324
No, I’m not kidding. 


02:16.323 --> 02:18.450
I was raised as a Witness.


02:18.450 --> 02:19.702
Yeah, I was raised as one as well.


02:19.702 --> 02:21.704
Do you, um—
do you go to meetings?


02:21.703 --> 02:23.205
No, I haven’t been in forever. 


02:23.205 --> 02:24.623
What about you?


02:24.623 --> 02:26.000
No, no, I haven’t.


02:27.625 --> 02:29.628
I got a last-minute job to New York. 


02:29.628 --> 02:32.088
I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge. 


02:32.088 --> 02:35.841
I knew Bethel was there, 
and I’d never been to Bethel.


02:35.842 --> 02:40.305
This sister stopped me on my tour, 
and she invited me up to her office. 


02:40.305 --> 02:43.475
There were different paintings 
of the resurrection.


02:43.475 --> 02:46.687
She asked me, “Do you know why 
the people are waiting on the balcony?” 


02:46.687 --> 02:49.524
And I was like, 
“I—I don’t know. Why?” 


02:49.523 --> 02:54.000
And she said, “Because they’re waiting 
for their loved ones to be resurrected.”


02:56.905 --> 02:59.700
It was as if something 
just went straight to my heart. 


02:59.700 --> 03:02.327
I’ve never felt something like that.


03:02.327 --> 03:06.624
I had for the first time actually seen 
the resurrection and believed it. 


03:06.623 --> 03:09.291
It wasn’t just this thing that might happen
—it was for sure. 


03:09.292 --> 03:11.295
I knew exactly 
what it was going to look like. 


03:11.295 --> 03:13.797
I would be standing there 
on that balcony 


03:13.797 --> 03:16.000
looking for my loved ones 
to come back, 


03:18.760 --> 03:20.762
and I wanted to be there. 


03:20.762 --> 03:25.392
The resurrection was so real to me.


03:25.392 --> 03:27.812
And the second I got out of Bethel, 


03:27.812 --> 03:31.649
I—I called my mom, 
and I told her, and I said: 


03:31.648 --> 03:36.070
“Mom, Mom, I’m coming back. 


03:36.070 --> 03:38.780
“I know exactly what I need to do. 


03:38.780 --> 03:42.743
I’m coming back to Jehovah.”


03:42.743 --> 03:46.371
I had made up my mind, you know, 
I’m going to give Jehovah a chance. 


03:46.372 --> 03:48.707
But, you know, 
I’m coming back to the truth. 


03:48.707 --> 03:50.250
I’m going to do it right.


03:50.250 --> 03:53.628
There was an elder 
who was doing the Watchtower, 


03:53.628 --> 03:55.630
and he just came off so kind 


03:55.630 --> 03:58.383
that I thought, you know, 
when this meeting ends, 


03:58.383 --> 04:01.178
I want to talk with him, and I’m going 
to explain to him why I’m here. 


04:01.178 --> 04:03.638
I knew I had so many changes to make.


04:03.638 --> 04:06.933
Matthew 6:33 is so important to me, 


04:06.933 --> 04:09.520
‘Seek first the Kingdom.’ 


04:09.520 --> 04:13.523
My entire life I sought 
everything else before Jehovah. 


04:13.523 --> 04:17.485
I never put him first, 
and I for the first time was saying, 


04:17.485 --> 04:20.488
“OK, Jehovah, I’m going to put you first.”


04:20.488 --> 04:24.868
The job I have right now 
isn’t necessarily my dream job, 


04:24.868 --> 04:27.996
but it allows me to do exactly 
what I want to do for Jehovah


04:27.997 --> 04:30.082
—and that’s pioneer.


04:30.082 --> 04:32.584
I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard 


04:32.583 --> 04:35.128
going from casting to casting 
with my portfolio in hand, 


04:35.128 --> 04:38.840
and now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard 
with the cart in my hand. 


04:38.840 --> 04:41.385
Out in the ministry, 
I see models that I used to work with, 


04:41.385 --> 04:44.012
and I love getting to show 
them that this is my new life, 


04:44.012 --> 04:46.014
and this has changed my life. 


04:46.013 --> 04:47.181
I am so happy.


04:47.182 --> 04:49.852
I know what it’s like 
to superficially feel good. 


04:49.852 --> 04:54.940
But to literally have the joy, 
the happiness


04:54.940 --> 04:57.000
—I want to share that with everybody.


05:00.528 --> 05:24.156
Jehovah completely changed my life.

00:10.405 --> 00:13.000
You get so happy 
when you sing with others!


00:18.747 --> 00:21.167
Jehovah created us like that. 


00:21.167 --> 00:22.710
The birds also sing.


00:22.710 --> 00:25.000
I feel that Jehovah is proud of me.


00:29.758 --> 00:32.636
The Scandinavia branch office 
supervises nine languages 


00:32.637 --> 00:34.930
in audio and video production. 


00:34.930 --> 00:38.725
In the three largest languages
—Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish—


00:38.725 --> 00:41.103
there are also three children choruses 


00:41.103 --> 00:43.688
that help us 
with the recordings of the songs 


00:43.688 --> 00:47.316
for the Become Jehovah’s Friend series.


00:47.317 --> 00:50.279
First, I listen very carefully 


00:50.278 --> 00:54.198
to the American adult chorus. 


00:54.198 --> 00:57.661
I try to spot where they breathe, 
where they pause, 


00:57.662 --> 01:00.000
and the overall mood
in their way of singing.


01:01.123 --> 01:05.000
Then, I listen 
to the music we have received.


01:07.797 --> 01:11.425
I have a piano at home 
to practice the voices and figure out 


01:11.425 --> 01:13.843
where the high notes and low notes are, 


01:13.843 --> 01:17.000
where the challenging parts are, 
and how I can pass this on to the children. 


01:18.390 --> 01:21.185
I also think about what the goal
with the recording is


01:21.185 --> 01:23.520
—how other children who listen to the song 


01:23.520 --> 01:25.647
can feel the same joy as we feel


01:25.647 --> 01:28.000
when we are singing and recording it.


01:30.318 --> 01:32.905
Before the children arrive,


01:32.905 --> 01:37.575
we make sure that all the equipment 
is prepared and tested 


01:37.575 --> 01:40.000
so that everything 
is ready when they come here.


01:42.080 --> 01:44.708
When we receive 
the assignment to participate 


01:44.708 --> 01:46.751
in the recordings of a new song, 


01:46.752 --> 01:50.505
I feel that our girls have been 
full of initiative to practice. 


01:50.505 --> 01:55.000
And we have made it our custom
to sing the songs at our family worship. 


01:56.553 --> 01:58.721
When we are driving, 
like to the RTO 


01:58.722 --> 02:01.184
for the recordings and on other occasions, 


02:01.183 --> 02:03.000
we usually sing in the car.


02:04.562 --> 02:07.690
I like to sing the songs
because they are good


02:07.690 --> 02:09.900
and have nice melodies.


02:09.900 --> 02:14.070
I especially like the new songs


02:14.070 --> 02:16.157
because they are so different.


02:16.157 --> 02:19.910
One has African drums in it,
and the next is a bit Irish


02:19.910 --> 02:22.000
and like you are walking
in a valley and on a mountain.


02:24.832 --> 02:29.252
Alma plays the cello
and has asked to get the sheet music


02:29.252 --> 02:33.000
for the new Kingdom songs,
which are her favorites right now.


02:34.800 --> 02:37.678
It’s been a challenge for André and me


02:37.678 --> 02:40.000
because we are not that musical.


02:41.848 --> 02:45.851
There is also a serious part,


02:45.852 --> 02:48.230
so we start with a prayer to Jehovah.


02:48.230 --> 02:51.567
Then, we watch the video and talk


02:51.567 --> 02:53.819
about the point of the video


02:53.818 --> 02:56.113
and how other children and families


02:56.113 --> 02:59.240
can benefit when listening to them.


02:59.240 --> 03:03.828
Then, we need to loosen up a bit,
so we warm up with some exercises,


03:03.828 --> 03:06.000
and then we’re ready to sing.


03:32.817 --> 03:35.485
It is clear to us that they appreciate 


03:35.485 --> 03:37.487
their privilege more and more. 


03:37.487 --> 03:41.742
They actually see it as praise to Jehovah.


03:41.742 --> 03:45.329
The joy they have of singing for Jehovah 


03:45.328 --> 03:48.998
rubs off on us who work with them.


03:48.998 --> 03:51.543
When the children sing with joy


03:51.543 --> 03:54.546
and express themselves freely,


03:54.547 --> 03:56.590
it has an effect on us as parents


03:56.590 --> 03:59.552
and the ones in the congregation.


03:59.552 --> 04:02.054
Jehovah becomes happy when he sees it,


04:02.053 --> 04:03.971
and also many brothers and sisters


04:03.972 --> 04:05.974
and children become happy.


04:05.973 --> 04:08.018
It is fun to make the recordings.


04:08.018 --> 04:09.770
You get so happy,
and then it’s more fun


04:09.770 --> 04:12.000
to sing at the meetings.


04:14.942 --> 04:18.570
I see more clearly why we sing


04:18.570 --> 04:21.000
and why it is a part of our worship.


04:22.282 --> 04:24.284
We don’t go there just
to spend time with our friends;


04:24.283 --> 04:26.286
we go there to sing.


04:26.287 --> 04:28.747
It is a part of praising Jehovah


04:28.747 --> 04:31.000
Singing is like a prayer to him.


04:33.127 --> 04:35.337
I have been humming the songs,


04:35.337 --> 04:38.674
and people around me wonder
what it is I am always humming.


04:38.673 --> 04:42.000
So it has helped me,
and it is an easy way to give a witness.


04:43.762 --> 04:46.932
My faith in Jehovah is stronger now.


04:46.932 --> 04:50.519
I think that I am happier
knowing Jehovah


04:50.518 --> 04:52.728
after I began singing.


04:52.728 --> 04:55.981
You understand that singing
is a huge part of our worship,


04:55.982 --> 05:09.935
and Jehovah wants us to use it.

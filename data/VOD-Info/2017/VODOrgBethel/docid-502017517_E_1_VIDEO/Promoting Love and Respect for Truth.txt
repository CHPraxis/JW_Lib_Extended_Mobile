00:04 In today’s media,  much of what’s presented as fact
00:08 is often colored by emotion  and personal opinion.
00:16 Jehovah’s Witnesses, however,
00:19 remain committed  to defending God’s Word,
00:21 the Bible, as the standard for truth.
00:24 As Jesus said at John 17:17:
00:27 “Your word is truth.”
00:30 The wide-ranging subject matter
00:32 contained in the publications  of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:35 is painstakingly researched  by their Writing Research Department.
00:39 Their research methods are modeled  after that of Bible historians
00:42 such as Luke and Jeremiah
00:45 —reliance on reputable first-hand sources.
00:51 We’re not looking just for someone’s opinions
00:53 or what someone believes about a topic.
00:54 If the material is socially
00:56 or politically biased, for example,
00:59 we can’t rely on it.
01:00 We look for objective material.
01:02 We cover everything
01:04 from historical, scientific, geographical
01:07 to flora, fauna, space.
01:10 So before the script is even written,
01:12 we’ll provide a research package,
01:15 and we’ll follow the project until final delivery
01:18 to make sure that everything that is said
01:20 and everything that is shown
01:22 is solidly based on fact
01:23 and is well-researched.
01:24 There’s a lot more research than what
01:27 the viewer  or the reader will ever see.
01:30 You have a one-page article on the otter;
01:32 you end up with like 12 references
01:34 to back up every statement that’s made.
01:37 It seems very simple,
01:38 the height of Mont Blanc.
01:39 And with the height of Mont Blanc,
01:41 we found out, number one,  that it was 4,807 meters;
01:45 then we found another source —4,810 meters;
01:48 let’s check a third one —4,808 meters.
01:52 So, what is now real?
01:53 In that case, we had to consult
01:55 the French National Institute  of Geographic and Forest Information.
02:00 One of our main research tools
02:02 is our own library system.
02:04 We have about 65,000 books  and other research materials.
02:10 If we’re researching something  about ancient history
02:13 or archaeology,
02:15 we may consult  a specialized encyclopedia,
02:19 like an encyclopedia  of archaeological discoveries, for example.
02:23 Museum websites usually have pictures
02:26 of what they have in the museum.
02:27 And we can find these visuals and then send  those off to production teams
02:30 as well and say,  “This is a good example
02:33 of a first-century lamp.”
02:34 Things that you think are true
02:36 because they are “commonly known”
02:39 may not actually be totally accurate.
02:42 Quotes need to be verified.
02:44 We want to go to the first-hand source,
02:48 the original source, for that quote.
02:50 That’s one thing.
02:51 And secondly, context matters;  we want to quote things properly.
02:56 When Gandhi and Lord Irwin came together,
03:00 Gandhi said, ‘When your country  and mine come together
03:03 ‘on the teachings of Christ  and on the Sermon on the Mount,
03:06 then we will have solved the problems  of our countries and the world.’
03:10 So we researched it.
03:11 No one could confirm  that those two men ever met.
03:14 So it’s a great quote.
03:16 Now, it doesn’t mean  that he didn’t refer to Jesus
03:18 or even the Sermon on the Mount,  but that particular one, we couldn’t use.
03:22 So the research work we’re doing,
03:24 sometimes it takes a lot of time,  a lot of effort.
03:28 Sometimes we don’t find  what we are expecting to find.
03:33 But it’s very gratifying  because we’re helping produce
03:37 accurate information  that our readers can rely on.
03:40 Reliable information will help us  make good informed decisions.
03:44 Anyone who reads our journals  and who sees our videos
03:47 can be confident that this  was thoroughly researched.
03:51 These are facts; this is the truth.
03:54 So when you consider  the printed publications
03:56 of Jehovah’s Witnesses
03:58 or peruse the jw.org website,
04:01 you can be confident that the material
04:03 is carefully researched and accurate.
04:05 Why?
04:07 Because Jehovah’s Witnesses
04:09 are a people who love and respect
04:12 the truth.

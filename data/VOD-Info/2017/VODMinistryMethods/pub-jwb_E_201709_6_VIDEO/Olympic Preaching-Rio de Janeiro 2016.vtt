00:01.685 --> 00:05.455
Our brothers and sisters in Brazil 
experienced an opportunity 


00:05.455 --> 00:08.157
to make special efforts 
in their preaching work 


00:08.157 --> 00:12.062
when the Olympic 
and Paralympic Games were held there 


00:12.062 --> 00:15.332
in August and September of 2016. 


00:15.332 --> 00:18.167
Close to 15,000 athletes 


00:18.167 --> 00:21.004
from approximately 205 countries 


00:21.003 --> 00:25.000
were present along with many visitors.


00:33.148 --> 00:35.285
More than one million tourists 


00:35.285 --> 00:37.820
were present at the Olympic Games 
in Rio de Janeiro, 


00:37.820 --> 00:42.000
and among them 
were around 410,000 foreigners. 


00:43.660 --> 00:46.162
In an effort to teach 
these ones about the Bible, 


00:46.162 --> 00:51.000
Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged 
in a special public witnessing campaign.


00:52.835 --> 00:57.307
To reach as many people as possible, 
we set up 268 carts, 


00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
not only where the games were held 


00:59.308 --> 01:01.878
but also throughout the city 
of Rio de Janeiro. 


01:01.878 --> 01:03.913
That way, we were able to reach people 


01:03.913 --> 01:07.083
from even faraway islands like Vanuatu, 


01:07.083 --> 01:09.918
which is one of the islands of the Pacific. 


01:09.918 --> 01:12.000
Delegates from that island picked up 
publications from our witnessing carts.


01:23.065 --> 01:25.635
We made efforts to put the stands and carts 


01:25.635 --> 01:28.000
as close as possible to the places 
where the brothers would work. 


01:29.838 --> 01:33.743
Thanks to Jehovah, we were able 
to get a strategic location near the entrance 


01:33.743 --> 01:38.000
to the arenas, 
which we didn’t think would be possible.


01:40.850 --> 01:43.720
We planned to have 1,500 volunteers, 


01:43.720 --> 01:46.422
but we got 4,000 volunteers. 


01:46.422 --> 01:48.424
We asked for help from other cities, 


01:48.423 --> 01:51.000
other states, and also 
from foreign-language congregations. 


01:52.528 --> 01:56.000
So for us, 
this was beyond our expectations.


01:58.433 --> 02:00.703
During the Olympics, 
more than one million people 


02:00.703 --> 02:02.705
passed through the harbor here. 


02:02.705 --> 02:05.073
And thanks to Jehovah, 
we were able to set up 


02:05.073 --> 02:07.976
more than 40 carts 
in the immediate harbor area 


02:07.977 --> 02:11.247
and placed almost 
20,000 pieces of literature. 


02:11.247 --> 02:13.617
To refill the carts, we used a quadricycle 


02:13.617 --> 02:16.452
that picked up the publications 
at the support hub 


02:16.452 --> 02:22.359
and took them to the brothers 
at the carts.


02:22.358 --> 02:24.426
The media provided extensive coverage 


02:24.427 --> 02:27.730
with more than 26,000 
press professionals involved, 


02:27.730 --> 02:29.732
and security was also reinforced 


02:29.732 --> 02:32.635
with more than 22,000 military personnel. 


02:32.635 --> 02:36.000
The work of our brothers 
certainly did not go unnoticed.


02:39.975 --> 02:43.212
We were at the cart 
when suddenly a police car 


02:43.212 --> 02:45.349
full of officers stopped in front of us. 


02:45.348 --> 02:48.785
I was worried they were going 
to ask us questions or make us leave. 


02:48.785 --> 02:51.955
But then they got out of the car 
and came towards us. 


02:51.955 --> 02:54.290
And one of them 
picked up the Bible Teach book, 


02:54.290 --> 02:57.693
and without saying anything to us, 
he told the others: 


02:57.693 --> 03:00.430
“Didn’t I tell you 
I was going to find them here? 


03:00.430 --> 03:03.533
“You can take these publications; 
they’re free. 


03:03.533 --> 03:06.000
These books will teach you 
amazing things!”


03:13.375 --> 03:16.178
This campaign helped 
to overcome prejudices, 


03:16.178 --> 03:19.081
both with the authorities 
and people in general, 


03:19.082 --> 03:22.419
because they were able to see 
the international scope of our work. 


03:22.418 --> 03:25.721
And this became especially clear 
when it came to the officials 


03:25.722 --> 03:27.924
because they allowed 
the brothers to put the carts 


03:27.923 --> 03:29.791
as close as possible to the arenas 


03:29.792 --> 03:32.000
where the games were being held.


03:33.528 --> 03:37.633
In all, more than 85,000 publications 


03:37.633 --> 03:41.000
in more than ten languages 
were distributed by means of the 268 carts 


03:42.005 --> 03:44.407
scattered throughout the city. 


03:44.407 --> 03:47.210
Over a year of planning 
went into preparing for this event, 


03:47.210 --> 03:50.580
and it produced excellent results. 


03:50.580 --> 03:52.448
Our international preaching work 
was made known 


03:52.448 --> 03:54.550
to thousands present at the Olympic Games, 


03:54.550 --> 03:56.552
and most important, 


03:56.552 --> 04:13.120
it gave a great shout of praise 
to our God, Jehovah.

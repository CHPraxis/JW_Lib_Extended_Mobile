00:01 Our brothers and sisters in Brazil  experienced an opportunity
00:05 to make special efforts  in their preaching work
00:08 when the Olympic  and Paralympic Games were held there
00:12 in August and September of 2016.
00:15 Close to 15,000 athletes
00:18 from approximately 205 countries
00:21 were present along with many visitors.
00:33 More than one million tourists
00:35 were present at the Olympic Games  in Rio de Janeiro,
00:37 and among them  were around 410,000 foreigners.
00:43 In an effort to teach  these ones about the Bible,
00:46 Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged  in a special public witnessing campaign.
00:52 To reach as many people as possible,  we set up 268 carts,
00:57 not only where the games were held
00:59 but also throughout the city  of Rio de Janeiro.
01:01 That way, we were able to reach people
01:03 from even faraway islands like Vanuatu,
01:07 which is one of the islands of the Pacific.
01:09 Delegates from that island picked up  publications from our witnessing carts.
01:23 We made efforts to put the stands and carts
01:25 as close as possible to the places  where the brothers would work.
01:29 Thanks to Jehovah, we were able  to get a strategic location near the entrance
01:33 to the arenas,  which we didn’t think would be possible.
01:40 We planned to have 1,500 volunteers,
01:43 but we got 4,000 volunteers.
01:46 We asked for help from other cities,
01:48 other states, and also  from foreign-language congregations.
01:52 So for us,  this was beyond our expectations.
01:58 During the Olympics,  more than one million people
02:00 passed through the harbor here.
02:02 And thanks to Jehovah,  we were able to set up
02:05 more than 40 carts  in the immediate harbor area
02:07 and placed almost
20,000 pieces of literature.
02:11 To refill the carts, we used a quadricycle
02:13 that picked up the publications  at the support hub
02:16 and took them to the brothers  at the carts.
02:22 The media provided extensive coverage
02:24 with more than 26,000  press professionals involved,
02:27 and security was also reinforced
02:29 with more than 22,000 military personnel.
02:32 The work of our brothers  certainly did not go unnoticed.
02:39 We were at the cart  when suddenly a police car
02:43 full of officers stopped in front of us.
02:45 I was worried they were going  to ask us questions or make us leave.
02:48 But then they got out of the car  and came towards us.
02:51 And one of them  picked up the Bible Teach book,
02:54 and without saying anything to us,  he told the others:
02:57 “Didn’t I tell you  I was going to find them here?
03:00 “You can take these publications;  they’re free.
03:03 These books will teach you  amazing things!”
03:13 This campaign helped  to overcome prejudices,
03:16 both with the authorities  and people in general,
03:19 because they were able to see  the international scope of our work.
03:22 And this became especially clear  when it came to the officials
03:25 because they allowed  the brothers to put the carts
03:27 as close as possible to the arenas
03:29 where the games were being held.
03:33 In all, more than 85,000 publications
03:37 in more than ten languages  were distributed by means of the 268 carts
03:42 scattered throughout the city.
03:44 Over a year of planning  went into preparing for this event,
03:47 and it produced excellent results.
03:50 Our international preaching work  was made known
03:52 to thousands present at the Olympic Games,
03:54 and most important,
03:56 it gave a great shout of praise  to our God, Jehovah.

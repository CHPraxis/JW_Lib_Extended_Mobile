00:01.217 --> 00:05.322
How do we know 
that Jehovah really sees each one of us, 


00:05.322 --> 00:07.490
no matter where we are? 


00:07.490 --> 00:09.525
Consider an example: 


00:09.525 --> 00:12.028
Thousands of refugees who faced 


00:12.028 --> 00:14.530
severe hardships in their home countries 


00:14.530 --> 00:17.967
have sought shelter in parts of Europe. 


00:17.967 --> 00:21.972
Watch how Jehovah 
has lovingly assured them 


00:21.972 --> 00:27.000
that they’re not alone 
by satisfying their spiritual thirst.


00:29.945 --> 00:31.982
Welcome to Greece!


00:31.982 --> 00:35.819
We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us 


00:35.818 --> 00:37.820
by opening a large door 


00:37.820 --> 00:41.423
of opportunities to preach the good news 


00:41.423 --> 00:45.000
to the many refugees 
who are streaming into the country.


00:47.530 --> 00:52.435
For this reason, the brothers 
immediately informed us of the situation 


00:52.435 --> 00:55.105
and we directed the bodies of elders 


00:55.105 --> 00:58.842
to concentrate on the harbors, 
especially in Chios.


00:58.842 --> 01:02.012
The brothers were willing to work in shifts


01:02.012 --> 01:06.000
—24 hours a day.


01:07.783 --> 01:11.420
The refugee shelters in our area 
only have families with children 


01:11.420 --> 01:14.423
and are located near a military airport.


01:14.423 --> 01:16.993
Whenever military planes flew overhead 


01:16.993 --> 01:18.995
and the children would see and hear them, 


01:18.995 --> 01:22.865
they would immediately run 
and try to hide because they were afraid.


01:22.865 --> 01:25.435
They sought protection 
from the tragic conditions 


01:25.435 --> 01:27.637
they had experienced during warfare. 


01:27.637 --> 01:29.772
This impressed upon us 
how greatly they needed 


01:29.772 --> 01:31.942
the comforting message of the good news, 


01:31.942 --> 01:34.000
so we felt the urge to approach them.


01:36.012 --> 01:40.049
Therefore, 
the Service Department arranged 


01:40.048 --> 01:43.000
for four language classes 
to be held for the brothers.


01:45.155 --> 01:47.157
We try to speak to people 


01:47.157 --> 01:49.392
in a language quite different from our own. 


01:49.392 --> 01:50.694
At times, we might think: 


01:50.693 --> 01:52.795
‘Will these people understand us? 


01:52.795 --> 01:56.000
Will we be able to reach 
their heart with these basic truths?’


01:58.367 --> 02:00.069
Something that helped me not to hesitate 


02:00.068 --> 02:01.370
to approach these people 


02:01.370 --> 02:03.105
despite the language barrier 


02:03.105 --> 02:05.208
is what our teachers told us 
in the language class: 


02:05.208 --> 02:07.210
“Go and talk to them. 


02:07.210 --> 02:08.945
“Show them things from the Bible. 


02:08.945 --> 02:10.247
“Even if you don’t say things perfectly, 


02:10.247 --> 02:13.517
they will understand you.”


02:13.517 --> 02:15.519
After we received permission 


02:15.518 --> 02:18.821
from the branch office, 
we also printed thousands of tracts, 


02:18.822 --> 02:20.857
since we did not have enough. 


02:20.857 --> 02:24.000
This whole effort created 
an atmosphere of enthusiasm.


02:27.215 --> 02:29.865
I’m deeply moved when I see how lovingly


02:29.865 --> 02:31.600
Jehovah cares for these people 


02:31.600 --> 02:33.002
who have never had the opportunity 


02:33.002 --> 02:34.437
to hear the Kingdom message 


02:34.437 --> 02:37.000
that gives them a future and a hope.


02:38.508 --> 02:40.543
It was exciting 


02:40.543 --> 02:42.545
for them to hear that we have 


02:42.545 --> 02:45.000
a Bible-based video in their language. 


02:46.215 --> 02:49.085
We told them that the problems, calamities, 


02:49.085 --> 02:51.487
and the terrible war they had experienced 


02:51.487 --> 02:53.489
were not punishment from God, 


02:53.488 --> 02:55.491
but the result of the influence 


02:55.492 --> 02:58.060
Satan the Devil exercises 
over this system of things. 


02:58.060 --> 03:02.000
And this provided 
a good answer to their question.


03:03.198 --> 03:05.201
On a return visit, 


03:05.202 --> 03:09.172
after two days, 
a refugee girl said something very touching: 


03:09.172 --> 03:11.875
“Now I understand why 
we have to go through all this. 


03:11.875 --> 03:14.877
It’s very difficult, 
but it’s not God’s fault.”


03:14.877 --> 03:18.682
On another occasion, 
Gardinia, a refugee woman 


03:18.682 --> 03:20.684
who showed interest, told us: 


03:20.683 --> 03:22.885
“Since meeting you, 
I have a purpose in life. 


03:22.885 --> 03:24.887
“I have a reason to live. 


03:24.887 --> 03:27.000
Until now, I was just waiting to die.”


03:32.128 --> 03:34.130
A refugee approached 
the Arabic witnessing cart, 


03:34.130 --> 03:37.833
and we read Revelation 21:4 to him. 


03:37.833 --> 03:40.570
He said, “Please, 
could you read that to me once again?” 


03:40.570 --> 03:42.572
So we read it a second time. 


03:42.572 --> 03:43.439
He replied, 


03:43.438 --> 03:45.441
“May I have a Bible of my own?” 


03:45.442 --> 03:47.110
So we gave him a Bible. 


03:47.110 --> 03:48.745
Then he said, 
“Would you please show me 


03:48.745 --> 03:51.113
the sentence you read in my Bible?” 


03:51.113 --> 03:53.115
So we marked the verse for him.


03:53.115 --> 03:54.950
And on the way back 


03:54.950 --> 03:57.153
to our home at about 11 o’clock at night, 


03:57.153 --> 03:59.155
on the same road, at a well-lit point, 


03:59.155 --> 04:01.023
we saw that same refugee 


04:01.023 --> 04:04.993
sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.


04:04.993 --> 04:08.000
About two and a half years ago, 
I met Moustafa. 


04:09.165 --> 04:11.935
He attended the meetings 
and made speedy progress. 


04:11.935 --> 04:13.970
Moustafa was baptized a few months 


04:13.970 --> 04:16.372
before the refugees started pouring in. 


04:16.372 --> 04:18.942
We do not believe 
that this was a coincidence. 


04:18.942 --> 04:22.345
He would say, 
“I want to speak about Jehovah, 


04:22.345 --> 04:24.000
but I can’t do that 
in the Greek language.”


04:25.515 --> 04:28.550
When I can speak to people who are refugees


04:28.550 --> 04:30.653
—just as I am a refugee—


04:30.653 --> 04:32.688
in my own language, 


04:32.688 --> 04:35.891
this is a great opportunity for me. 


04:35.892 --> 04:40.195
And when I see that they listen 
to the truth and are loving it, 


04:40.195 --> 04:42.198
it makes my heart beat faster. 


04:42.198 --> 04:44.333
It touches my heart.


04:44.333 --> 04:46.335
By expanding my ministry, 


04:46.335 --> 04:48.337
I’m sharing in a form of service 


04:48.337 --> 04:50.674
that could even be described 
as missionary work, 


04:50.673 --> 04:52.941
since I’m helping 
people hear about Jehovah  


04:52.942 --> 04:54.944
for the very first time. 


04:54.943 --> 04:59.000
I’m living what I have only read 
about in experiences.


05:00.950 --> 05:03.820
Many were
—perhaps for the first time—


05:03.820 --> 05:07.423
discovering new skills in themselves, 


05:07.423 --> 05:11.826
indicating how Jehovah 
through his spirit can enable certain ones 


05:11.827 --> 05:15.000
to cultivate qualities they didn’t realize 
they had to such an extent.


05:19.268 --> 05:21.270
We are so grateful to Jehovah 
for opening a door 


05:21.270 --> 05:23.505
leading to such wonderful activity. 


05:23.505 --> 05:28.000
It gives us great joy, 
and we praise him daily for this.


05:30.880 --> 05:33.348
At the time this report was prepared, 


05:33.348 --> 05:36.685
over 100 Bible studies had been started. 


05:36.685 --> 05:38.955
One refugee told the brothers: 


05:38.955 --> 05:42.958
“You are the best thing 
that has happened to us here in Greece. 


05:42.958 --> 05:45.795
We thank Jehovah for meeting you.” 


05:45.795 --> 05:48.865
Another said: 
“We do not need material things. 


05:48.865 --> 05:50.667
“We need hope, 


05:50.667 --> 05:59.392
and you are giving this 
to us through the Bible.”

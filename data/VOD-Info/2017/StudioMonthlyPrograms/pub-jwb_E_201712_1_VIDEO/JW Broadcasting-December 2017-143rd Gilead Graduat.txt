00:01 We welcome all of you  to the December program
00:03 of JW Broadcasting!
00:23 This month  we have something different
00:26 to share with you.
00:27 The Governing Body has decided
00:29 that Gilead graduations
00:31 and the spiritual portion
00:32 of the annual meeting programs
00:34 will be featured as monthly  JW Broadcasting programs each year.
00:40 At this time, you will be able  to watch the first part
00:43 of the graduation  of the 143rd class of Gilead.
00:47 You will enjoy listening  to the five Scriptural talks
00:50 that will each be introduced to you
00:52 by Brother Herd of the Governing Body.
00:55 Most languages  that our monthly program is produced in
00:59 did not have  the resources to also translate
01:02 and produce  the Gilead graduation.
01:05 Now, by using the graduation  as the monthly program,
01:09 many more of our brothers and sisters  around the world
01:12 will be able to enjoy  this rich spiritual banquet.
01:16 We now invite you to enjoy  Part One of the graduation
01:20 of the 143rd class of Gilead!
01:25 It’s graduation day
01:28 for this 143rd class of Gilead.
01:32 And it’s been a long time coming
01:35 with a lot of work, worry, sweat,
01:39 and nerve-racking parts given
01:41 in front of your instructors  and fellow classmates.
01:45 Wow! Ooh.
01:49 But none of you received
01:53 a failing grade —not one.
01:56 You’re going to graduate today.
01:58 This is your day.
02:00 And it’s a joyful day, isn’t it?
02:02 A very joyful day for you,
02:06 and a joyful day  for each and every one of us.
02:10 We’re glad you came to Gilead school,
02:13 and it saddens us a bit  to know you are leaving us.
02:18 You’re not going to be here much longer.
02:21 Your fine spiritual instructors
02:24 —Brothers Cauthon, Lippold,
02:27 Noumair, Samuelson, and Stovall
02:31 —they would like to cry,  but they’re good manly men,
02:36 and it’s hard for good manly men  to cry in public.
02:41 Of course, there is a host of others
02:45 —too many to name—
02:47 such as Sam Herd.
02:50 Oops, it just slipped out  beyond my control.
02:55 Your instructors have done  a fine job of helping you
02:58 to open your eyes  to see your “Grand Instructor”
03:03 mentioned at Isaiah 30:20.
03:06 After all, he is the one  who has been teaching
03:10 by giving his holy spirit
03:12 to all these brothers that I’ve mentioned.
03:17 Look at what is stated at Isaiah 66:1
03:23 —66:1—it says:  “This is what Jehovah says:
03:27 ‘The heavens are my throne,  and the earth is my footstool.’”
03:32 For the last five months,  you’ve been sitting at Jehovah’s feet
03:37 and you have been taught  by your Grand Instructor.
03:41 What you have learned  is much more than you knew
03:45 when you first sat down five months ago.
03:49 Without a doubt,  the knowledge you have taken in
03:53 has brought you closer to Jehovah.
03:56 You have really drawn close to Jehovah,
04:00 and he has drawn close to you.
04:03 However, you’ve only scratched the surface.
04:09 Job said: . . .
04:11 [Indiscernible whispering]
04:17 Did you hear what I said?
04:21 Of course you didn’t.
04:23 Now let’s read the scripture,
04:26 Job 26:14:
04:29 “Look!  These are just the fringes of his ways;
04:32 only a faint whisper has been heard of him!”
04:41 This is just about as much as we have learned
04:45 compared to what Jehovah knows.
04:50 Who knows all that Jehovah knows?
04:53 No one —not even Jesus,
04:56 and he knows quite a bit more than we do.
05:01 He’s been around longer, hasn’t he?
05:05 Much longer.
05:07 In fact, Jesus was present  when the earth was created.
05:10 When was that?
05:12 Well, if you’ve been listening  to morning worship,
05:14 you’ll know that one member  of the Governing Body
05:16 told us that in Proverbs chapter 8
05:18 —he says take a look at that—
05:20 verses 29 and 30, and he read it to us,  he said: “This is what it says.”
05:25 “When he established  the foundations of the earth,
05:27 then I was beside him  as a master worker.”
05:31 Do you remember that?
05:33 You don’t if you didn’t hear  today’s text or read it.
05:37 But we are convinced  that you heard it and you read it.
05:42 Well, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
05:44 The earth —foundations of the earth—
05:46 how long?
05:48 Well, based on the very old zircon rock  from Australia,
05:52 some scientists say we know that the earth
05:55 is at least four  and one-half billion years old,
05:59 give or take a hundred million years.
06:02 Well, no one really knows down here on earth,
06:05 but we have to listen  to some of these so-called wise men.
06:11 Jesus, in his prehuman existence, was there.
06:14 There’s no doubt about that.
06:16 Colossians chapter 1 shows that,  that he was there.
06:19 He was at Jehovah’s side way before then
06:24 —listening and learning.
06:25 And he’s at Jehovah’s side today, isn’t he?
06:27 You know that.
06:29 He’s right there seated beside Jehovah,
06:31 doing the work that Jehovah  has outlined that should be done.
06:37 When measured by Jesus,  we’re newborn infants.
06:42 We barely have our eyes open, barely.
06:49 What we see is not what we’re going to see
06:52 in the years to come.
06:55 We’re just looking; we’re just learning;
06:57 we’re touching things —and for the first time.
07:02 Just think, in the past ten years
07:04 how many things  we’ve touched for the first time.
07:07 Even though we’ve read the Bible  over and over again,
07:10 and we’ve listened to it  being read to us over and over again,
07:12 but we’ve just touched a few things
07:17 —like the generation,
20 years ago, the generation.
07:22 And now we know  all about that generation, right?
07:25 And so many other things —dragnet—
07:30 many other things,
07:32 like the sanctification of God’s name,
07:35 vindication of his sovereignty —touch, touch, touch.
07:39 You Gilead students,  you’ve touched a few things,
07:42 but not everything,
07:47 not everything.
07:49 But what you have learned,
07:54 put to good use in your assignments.
07:57 Keep in mind that you don’t know it all.
08:01 And here’s something else: You never will.
08:06 No matter how long we live,  we’ll never know it all.
08:09 Jehovah will still be revealing things to us,
08:13 and they’re always good things.
08:15 We benefit from what Jehovah gives us.
08:19 He knows exactly what we need,  and he gives it to us.
08:27 So always keep that in mind.
08:29 We’re students under Jehovah,
08:34 and that’s where we’ll always be.
08:40 But we’re happy.
08:43 We’re glad to be here.
08:46 We’re glad to be here with you students,
08:50 every one of you,  and you’re good students too.
08:55 Now it’s true, not all of you  are A-plus students.
09:01 I’m not either.
09:04 I was happy to get a good C-plus in school.
09:11 Well, we’re going to get started now  with a major part of our meeting.
09:17 “Being Happy Despite Challenges”
09:21 is the theme of Brother Gerrit Lösch’s talk.
09:25 Brother Lösch is a member  of the Governing Body.
09:27 He is the senior member  of the Governing Body.
09:33 Now, I mean by that,  he’s been a member of the Governing Body
09:36 longer than the rest of us.
09:39 I’m the oldest one on the Governing Body.
09:44 We all face challenges of some sort.
09:46 So let’s listen carefully  to what he has to say, Brother Lösch.
10:13 “Oh happy day.”
10:18 These are the first words of the gospel song.
10:21 And it goes on to say,
10:23 “Oh happy day,  when Jesus washed my sins away.”
10:28 And we can agree
10:30 with these music lyrics
10:33 from the 18th century.
10:36 We agree that forgiveness of sins  makes us happy, doesn’t it?
10:41 But for many others,
10:44 the happy day is the payday  at the end of the month.
10:50 Now, what is a happy day for you students?
10:53 Graduation day.
10:56 But you are not happy because it’s over,
10:59 but because you had  the privilege to attend Gilead.
11:04 Many in the world believe  that if they had more money,
11:07 they would be happier.
11:09 However, many who made gaining of wealth
11:13 the chief goal in life  now suffer disappointment.
11:16 Some have lost their house,
11:18 being unable to pay the mortgage  when they were laid off from work.
11:24 Wealth does not bring happiness.
11:26 Rather, lasting happiness  comes from doing Jehovah’s will.
11:31 What is happiness?
11:33 Happiness is a state of well-being,
11:36 contentment, even deep and intense joy.
11:41 But in the world, many are unhappy.
11:43 In 2015, there were more than  twice as many suicides
11:48 in the United States
11:50 —namely 44,193—
11:55 more than homicides,
11:59 where there were only 17,000 of those.
12:02 Up to 120 people take their life
12:06 in the United States each day.
12:09 How sad.
12:13 Though very rare, due to depression
12:15 even some true Christians  have taken their life,
12:18 but generally we are a happy people,  aren’t we?
12:22 And here are 12 reasons for our happiness.
12:26 For one, we can be happy  because we worship a happy God.
12:31 Psalm 33:12:
12:33 “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah.”
12:38 Secondly, because we have our sins forgiven,
12:42 as mentioned in the introduction.
12:44 Romans 4:7 says:
12:46 “Happy are those whose lawless deeds
12:49 have been pardoned  and whose sins have been covered.”
12:54 Number three, we can be happy
12:56 because we’re being loved  by Jehovah and Jesus.
13:01 Four, we’re happy because of being united
13:04 with our worldwide brotherhood.
13:07 Five, we can be happy  because of living in a spiritual paradise,
13:12 having peace with Jehovah,  with our brothers,
13:15 and also having plenty of spiritual food.
13:19 Six, in the Sermon on the Mount,
13:22 Jesus emphasized spirituality when he said:
13:25 “Happy are those conscious  of their spiritual need.”
13:30 In this sermon, he mentioned nine things  that make us happy.
13:33 What things?
13:35 Well, you’ll find out  by rereading this sermon.
13:40 Number seven, we are happy  because our life has meaning,
13:43 namely, according to Ephesians 1:12,
13:46 to “serve for the praise of his glory.”
13:51 Number eight, at Revelation 1:3,
13:54 Jesus showed that  reading God’s Word makes us happy.
13:58 He says:  “Happy is [he] who reads aloud
14:03 and those who hear  the words of this prophecy.”
14:07 Do you want to be happy every day?
14:10 Read the Bible every day.
14:14 In the book of Revelation,  Jesus proclaims seven happinesses.
14:18 Which ones?
14:19 Find out by rereading Revelation.
14:24 Number nine, we are also happy
14:26 because we serve in the spiritual temple.
14:29 In Revelation 7,  not just the anointed
14:32 but also the great crowd  are shown serving,
14:35 not near or before,  but in the temple.
14:41 David called the Levites happy.
14:43 He said at Psalm 65:4:
14:45 “Happy is the one whom you choose
14:48 [to] bring near to reside  in your courtyards.”
14:52 David arranged the Levites
14:54 so that they could serve at the temple  twice a year for one week.
14:58 However, in contrast,  all of God’s people serve him
15:01 in the spiritual temple all year long,  every day.
15:06 How happy we can be.
15:09 Number ten, Psalm 40:4 says:
15:12 “Happy is the man who trusts in Jehovah.”
15:17 Trust is a must to maintain happiness.
15:21 When you arrive in your assignment,
15:24 trust that Jehovah will support you.
15:27 Trust in Jehovah’s strength
15:29 rather than in your Gilead training  and your abilities.
15:33 If low on funds, trust in Jehovah.
15:37 He will care for you.
15:39 If you have to learn a new language, trust.
15:44 When you are being accused wrongly,
15:47 trust that matters will be clarified in time.
15:51 When you are discouraged,  trust in better times.
15:56 There is light at the end of each tunnel.
16:00 Number 11, we are happy  because we practice giving,
16:04 and Jesus said:
16:06 “There is more happiness in giving  than there is in receiving.”
16:10 Words well-known —Acts 20:35.
16:14 And 12, we are happy  because of the wonderful promise
16:19 of a heavenly paradise for some
16:22 and an earthly paradise for billions.
16:25 We are happy because this is tied  to the promise of everlasting life.
16:32 How does happiness show?
16:34 It shows by a spirit of appreciation  and expressions of appreciation.
16:40 So beware of a complaining spirit.
16:43 When Jehovah liberated Israel,  the people were happy.
16:47 However, within just a few weeks,
16:49 they complained and even wanted  to return to slavery in Egypt.
16:54 To stay happy, have a positive outlook.
16:58 Don’t complain  about the thorns on rosebushes,
17:01 but be glad  that some thornbushes have roses on it.
17:07 Number two, when you go to your assignment,
17:09 radiate the happiness you feel.
17:11 Let others see it in your eyes,
17:14 in your face, in your smile;
17:16 but smile, not like a salesperson,  but smile from the heart.
17:22 Happiness is also shown by enjoying singing.
17:27 Happy people often sing.
17:30 Do we sing from time to time?
17:32 singing in the rain?
17:34 or maybe in the shower?  or wherever?
17:39 How can we deepen our happiness?
17:42 What others do affects our happiness,
17:45 and what we do  affects the happiness of others.
17:48 We simply cannot escape  the fact that our happiness
17:52 is intertwined with the lives  of many other people
17:56 —our families, our friends, and others.
18:00 Happiness is often in small things,
18:04 and unhappiness is the result  of neglecting small things.
18:10 Happiness is not the absence of challenges,
18:13 but the ability to overcome them.
18:17 Happiness does not depend  on outside circumstances,
18:20 but on your inner thoughts
18:22 and your relationship with our happy God.
18:26 Happiness is connected with joy,
18:28 and joy is part  of the fruitage of the spirit.
18:31 So avail yourself of the holy spirit,
18:33 and you will be happier.
18:36 You can be happy though hungry.
18:39 That was the title of a special talk.
18:42 Of course, you can be happy  if you’re not hungry.
18:45 Perhaps you take advantage  of the “happy hour”
18:48 in a restaurant where prices are reduced.
18:53 You can be happy though single.
18:56 You can be happy because of being married
19:00 and sometimes despite being married.
19:03 You can be happy without children,
19:07 and you can be happy despite children.
19:11 You can be happy though  you’re only 15 years old,
19:15 and you can be happy  although you’re 85 years of age.
19:20 You can be happy though you are sick
19:23 and even more happy,  of course, if you’re healthy.
19:26 You can even be happy  though you lost loved ones in death.
19:30 You will see them again.
19:33 You can be happy  though persecuted for Christ’s sake.
19:37 Jesus said at Luke 6:22, 23:
19:40 “Happy are you whenever men hate you . . .
19:43 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy.”
19:48 You can be happy if you lost your job.
19:52 You can be happy if you lost your wallet.
19:56 You can be happy if you lost your heart
19:59 in San Francisco
20:02 —according to one song— or somewhere else.
20:07 You cannot be happy if you lost your mind,
20:11 or maybe you can be even happier then
20:13 because of not being aware  of all the problems
20:16 around you and affecting you.
20:24 If you are happy, you make others happy.
20:26 If you are unhappy, you make others unhappy.
20:31 If you are not happy with others,
20:33 others will not be happy with you.
20:36 Humor adds to happiness.
20:39 It makes pain and problems more bearable.
20:43 Find happiness in small things
20:46 —the sunset, the clouds in the sky,  the birds chirping,
20:50 the butterfly on the flower,  the dog chasing its tail.
20:56 Maintain happiness by meditating  on the Paradise to come.
21:01 Keep it in expectation.
21:03 Daniel 12:12 says:
21:05 “Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.”
21:10 In Paradise, there will be no more tears,
21:14 no emotional pain, no unhappiness.
21:17 Everyone will be happy every day,  all the time.
21:22 So let us maintain and deepen  our happiness despite challenges
21:27 by praising our happy God, Jehovah,
21:30 and making others and ourselves  ever more happy.
21:48 We certainly want to thank you,  Brother Lösch.
21:51 You made all of us happy  with that wonderful talk.
21:55 Our next speaker is Brother Gary Breaux,
21:58 a helper to the Service Committee  of the Governing Body
22:02 and a Branch Committee member.
22:04 His theme is
22:05 “Continue to Give Jehovah  Reasons Not to Forget.”
22:14 Well, we usually don’t think of Jehovah  as forgetting.
22:18 After all, he’s all-knowing,
22:22 and surely he doesn’t forget anything.
22:26 But you know, when it comes to humans,
22:28 it is possible to forget.
22:30 You remember the account in Deuteronomy.
22:33 Moses in this case  was giving caution to the Israelites
22:38 about life once they entered  into the Promised Land.
22:41 And we have Deuteronomy 6:12,
22:46 he says:  “Be careful not to forget Jehovah,
22:50 who brought you out of the land of Egypt,  [and] out of the house of slavery.”
22:54 So it’s possible for servants of God  to forget Jehovah.
22:58 But you know,  that street goes both ways, so to speak.
23:02 The apostle Paul introduces the idea
23:07 that Jehovah God can forget too.
23:10 It’s at Hebrews 6:10.
23:16 Hebrews 6:10,
23:19 notice Jehovah’s ability to forget here,
23:22 it says: “For God is not unrighteous  so as to forget your work
23:27 “and the love you showed for his name
23:32 by ministering and continuing to minister  to the holy ones.”
23:38 So he says there are two things
23:40 that Jehovah God says  that he will never forget.
23:43 What are they?
23:44 Well, it’s work and love.
23:48 Now, remember the theme  of this talk that I chose.
23:52 It’s not “Give Jehovah Reasons Not to Forget”
23:55 because that would imply  that you haven’t been doing that,
23:58 and that’s not the case.
24:01 But the theme is
24:03 “Continue to Give Jehovah  Reasons Not to Forget.”
24:08 And so it will be good for us  to look a little deeper
24:11 into these simple words of Paul
24:14 because it’s going to help us  not to forget about Jehovah.
24:18 And hopefully, he will not forget about us.
24:22 So we’re going to talk first about work,
24:24 and then we’ll come back and talk about love.
24:28 Now, it is interesting that Paul did not say
24:32 that God would not forget your assignment.
24:36 Jehovah says:  ‘Oh, you’re a Branch Committee member.
24:40 ‘Oh, I’ll never forget that.
24:42 ‘Or you’re a pioneer;  you’re a special pioneer;
24:46 ‘you’re an elder.
24:48 ‘Or you’re at a service desk  in a service department.
24:51 I’ll never forget that.’
24:53 That’s not what Paul said in this verse.
24:56 What did he say?
24:58 He said it’s the work  that He will never forget.
25:04 Now, it’s true,  we need Branch Committee members,
25:06 we need elders,  we need pioneers, and so forth.
25:08 But what Jehovah is not going to forget
25:12 is the work that we do  and the various assignments
25:16 and the various ways  that we serve Jehovah God,
25:18 giving him whole-souled service.
25:22 I’d like to tell you about a brother  that really understands
25:26 this part of Hebrews 6:10 well.
25:28 A few years ago, we had five members
25:31 on an Assembly Hall Committee
25:34 and we were directed  to bring it down to three,
25:37 so we had to remove two members  of every committee.
25:39 And the Branch Committee decided
25:41 who was going to be removed  from the committee.
25:44 So the oldest brother
25:46 —one of the oldest brothers serving  and age wise—
25:49 it was decided  that he would come off the committee.
25:52 So we had to send someone to tell him.
25:54 We were not going to write a letter to him.
25:56 So guess what?  I was chosen to go tell him.
25:59 So I was sitting at the table —conference table—
26:02 with the Assembly Hall Committee,  and I was nervous,
26:04 and I was using the Scriptures,  trying to get to their heart.
26:07 Finally, it got to the point  that I had to say,
26:09 “Now, you two brothers  are being relieved of your assignment.”
26:12 Immediately,  the elderly brother raised his hand and said,
26:16 “Can I read you a scripture?”
26:18 And I said, “Yeah, please do.”
26:21 And he read Hebrews 6:10.
26:24 And he said:  “Brothers, I’m here not for a title;
26:28 “I’m here to work.
26:30 Just give me work to do.”
26:34 It affects me every time  I tell that story because, really,
26:38 his comment captures what Paul is saying:
26:41 ‘Jehovah will not forget your work.’
26:46 Well, let’s go back to Hebrews 6:10
26:49 because it talks about the second thing.
26:52 It says:  ‘He is not going to forget the love.’
26:56 Well, what kind of love is he talking about?
26:59 ‘Oh Jehovah, we love you.’
27:00 Jehovah looks down: ‘Thank you very much.
27:02 I’ll never forget you love me.’
27:04 Well, that’s true,  but that’s not what Paul is saying.
27:07 Let’s read it again.
27:10 Verse 10, after he says  He won’t forget the work, he says:
27:13 “And the love you showed for his name
27:17 by ministering and continuing to minister  to the holy ones.”
27:22 So there are a couple of words here
27:25 that are important to understand.
27:27 It’s “you showed” and “ministering.”
27:32 In other words,  ‘Your love for your brother,’
27:36 Jehovah says,  ‘ah, look at that, I’ll never forget it.’
27:44 You see, it’s not an intellectual love.
27:47 Now, you’ve been in class for what,  five months?
27:50 I would imagine you’ve read every scripture;
27:52 you’ve heard all kinds of examples  about showing love;
27:55 you have every reason to show love.
27:59 And now we encourage you: Go out and do it.
28:03 Practice what you have learned.
28:06 Remember if it’s only words,  what did Paul say?
28:08 It’s like a cymbal —clashing cymbal.
28:12 So love means action;
28:16 it doesn’t just mean words.
28:20 I’d like to tell you another little story
28:25 about a brother that had  somewhat of a difficulty with this.
28:29 When I was a young circuit overseer,
28:31 the district overseer I had was— I was afraid of him.
28:36 Everybody else was scared of him too.
28:39 At one circuit assembly,  his wife wasn’t there,
28:43 so he didn’t tell anybody  why she wasn’t there,
28:48 and we’d never ask.
28:50 And so anyway,  the closing talk on Sunday,
28:53 I decided,  without getting his permission,
28:55 to let everyone know what was going on.
28:57 And I said: “Now you notice  that his wife isn’t with him.
29:01 “I just wanted you to know that tomorrow  she’s going to have a major operation,
29:05 and so we should all keep them  in our prayers, OK?”
29:09 Then they introduced him.  He didn’t come out.
29:13 He was back behind the stage  and for a long time.
29:17 I didn’t know what to do, frankly.
29:19 Soon, this man comes out
29:22 very, very slowly,
29:24 and he gets to the microphone;  his voice is cracking.
29:28 He starts talking a little bit,
29:30 and he gives his whole talk  in this very low tone.
29:33 At the end of the program, you know,
29:35 we always have this heartwarming song.
29:38 Then he had to pray.  He couldn’t pray.
29:41 He started crying.
29:44 Finally, after a long time,  he said a word or two,
29:48 “In Jesus’ name, Amen.”
29:49 You know what happened next?
29:52 The circuit surrounded him.
29:54 They were hugging him.
29:56 Everybody was crying.
29:59 He told me later, he said:
30:01 “Gary, I love the brothers.
30:04 I just don’t know how to show it.”
30:10 Now if you relate to that experience,
30:13 learn how to show love.
30:16 You know, what can you do?
30:19 You know, it might be a need  to change your face.
30:21 Well, not your face, but have a softer face.
30:25 Maybe you need to soften your voice.
30:30 Maybe you need to develop  a more inviting personality.
30:36 Do things for people;
30:39 take care of the old brothers and sisters  in the congregations you’re going to be with.
30:44 Even if it’s not natural for you  and you feel awkward about it,
30:48 do it anyway because in time  it will become part of you.
30:53 Because when you walk in that front door  of your Kingdom Hall
30:57 or the front door of your branch,
31:00 the brothers should be drawn to you,
31:02 not because of your assignment,
31:06 but because you have worked hard  to show love.
31:11 So as you go to your assignments,
31:14 always remember that Jehovah knows  the work you have done
31:17 and the love you have shown,
31:20 and he will never forget it.
31:37 Thank you very much, Brother Breaux,  and we’ll keep those reasons in mind
31:42 if we don’t forget.
31:47 “Who am I, O Jehovah God?”
31:51 Do you know who asked that question?
31:53 I don’t.
31:55 So let’s give our attention  to Brother Patrick LaFranca,
31:58 a helper to the Personnel Committee  of the Governing Body
32:01 and a member of the Branch Committee.
32:04 He will give us the answer.
32:07 Gilead students,
32:09 have you ever asked yourself,
32:12 ‘Who am I to have been invited  to Gilead school?’
32:18 That’s a good question, isn’t it?
32:21 Because very few of God’s people,
32:23 relatively speaking, have had that privilege.
32:26 So why you?
32:29 Was it because you were  smarter or better looking
32:33 than the average servant of Jehovah?
32:35 No, it was  because of your spiritual qualities.
32:40 And foremost among those was humility.
32:45 You have been humble.
32:48 But maintaining humility
32:51 is a definite spiritual challenge
32:54 —not just for you but for all of us, really.
32:57 We’ve all inherited the tendency  to exalt ourselves.
33:01 You think of Adam and Eve.
33:04 In the act of profound arrogance,
33:09 they wanted to put themselves in God’s place.
33:12 They seemed to forget who they were
33:15 —creatures made of dust.
33:19 So we all have to fight  against prideful tendencies.
33:24 Humility is elusive.
33:27 As soon as we think we are humble,  we’ve lost it.
33:31 However, Jehovah gives us help.
33:34 In the Bible, there are many examples  of those who did maintain humility,
33:39 and one of these is David.
33:41 Let’s just follow David’s life a bit
33:45 —different stages of his life— and see, did he maintain humility?
33:50 Well, was he humble as a young man?
33:54 You remember how Jehovah  directed the prophet Samuel
33:59 to go to Jesse’s house  and annoint one of Jesse’s sons
34:03 as the future king of Israel.
34:06 Well, seven of his sons were there,
34:10 but not one of them was chosen.
34:13 And finally, Samuel said, ‘Are these all your sons?’
34:17 ‘No, there’s David out in the fields  shepherding the sheep.’
34:23 So they called David,
34:25 and Samuel anoints this young man
34:28 to be the future king of Israel.
34:33 David must have been surprised  at this singular privilege that he had.
34:40 Now, did he become high-minded?
34:44 How would he have treated his brothers
34:47 —his older brothers— had he become prideful?
34:52 Well, he could have said to Eliab:
34:55 ‘Well, I guess you got taken down  a peg or two, didn’t you?
34:59 ‘You better start respecting me.
35:02 ‘And Abinadab,
35:05 ‘isn’t it time for you to go out now  and shepherd the sheep?
35:08 ‘I have a more important assignment.
35:11 ‘I have to learn to be king.
35:14 Hmm, how can I get into the king’s court?’
35:18 No, nothing indicates  that David felt that way about himself.
35:24 He was content to wait on Jehovah  for future privileges.
35:28 Is there a lesson here for us?
35:30 Yes, you may get future privileges,
35:34 but you may have to wait for them.
35:36 Go back to your pastures;  shepherd the sheep.
35:41 So after some time,  David is still in the pastures,
35:44 and what happens?
35:45 An attendant of King Saul
35:48 recommends that David serve  in the king’s court.
35:52 Listen to this recommendation
35:55 at 1 Samuel 16:18:
36:02 “One of the attendants said:
36:04 “‘Look! I have seen how a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite
36:09 “‘plays skillfully,
36:11 “‘and he is a courageous, mighty warrior.
36:14 “‘He can speak well, and he is handsome,
36:17 and Jehovah is with him.’”
36:20 My, what an impressive recommendation!
36:23 So, humble David goes from the sheepfold
36:27 to the king’s court as a court musician.
36:31 But more privileges followed.
36:33 You’ll see in verse 21b  that he became Saul’s armor bearer.
36:38 And later, David had many exploits in war.
36:43 He became famous.
36:45 Women sang about his victories.
36:47 So fame, good looks,
36:51 youth, eloquence,
36:53 musical skills,  military prowess, divine favor
36:57 —David had it all, didn’t he?
36:59 And any one of those things  could have made him arrogant and prideful,
37:04 but it seems that they did not.
37:07 Note David’s reaction when King Saul
37:10 offered David his daughter in marriage.
37:14 That is at 1 Samuel 18:18:
37:20 “At this David said to Saul:
37:23 “‘Who am I and who are my relatives,
37:26 “‘my father’s family in Israel,
37:28 for me to become son-in-law to the king?’”
37:32 Yes, being related to the king
37:35 might have given David reason to boast,
37:38 but his words “who am I” resonate with us.
37:43 David felt unworthy  of being related to the king.
37:47 Is there any lesson, perhaps, in this for us?
37:50 Well, we may work with and come into contact
37:53 with prominent brothers  in God’s organization.
37:57 In conversations with others,  do we drop their names,
38:02 trying to make ourselves, perhaps, seem more important?
38:07 But now we come  to another period in David’s life.
38:12 He is now the king of Israel  with his capital in Jerusalem,
38:16 and he’s dwelling in a royal palace.
38:20 And he’s being— He’s feeling very embarrassed
38:24 because here he is in a royal palace  and the ark of Jehovah,
38:29 who is the real king of Israel,  is in a tent.
38:33 And so he says to the prophet Nathan,
38:37 ‘I want to build Jehovah a worthy house —a temple.’
38:42 But Jehovah says,  ‘No, not you,
38:45 but one of your sons will do that.’
38:47 However, then Jehovah did something
38:51 that took David completely by surprise.
38:56 God tells him,  ‘Instead of you building me a house,
39:01 I am going to build a house for you.’
39:04 And he makes a covenant with David
39:07 so that the kingship would remain
39:10 in the family line of David forever.
39:15 Well, how did David react?
39:18 Please open to 1 Chronicles 17:16-18:
39:25 “At that King David came in  and sat down before Jehovah and said:
39:30 “‘Who am I, O Jehovah God?
39:33 “‘And what is my house  that you have brought me this far?
39:37 “‘As if this were not enough, O God,
39:40 “‘you also speak  about the house of your servant
39:43 “‘down to a distant future time,
39:45 “‘and you have looked on me  as if I were a man
39:49 “‘who should be further exalted,  O Jehovah God.
39:52 “‘What more can your servant David say to you
39:56 “‘about the honor given me
39:58 when you know your servant so well?’”
40:02 So this marvelous promise
40:04 that Jehovah made to David touches his heart,
40:08 and he sits before Jehovah in humility,
40:12 feeling so unworthy and insignificant.
40:17 And later, David made  an enormous contribution
40:21 for the building of the temple
40:23 that by today’s standards
40:25 would amount to over 1,200,000,000 dollars.
40:31 But in prayer to Jehovah, he says,
40:34 as recorded at 1 Chronicles 29:14:
40:37 “And yet, who am I . . .
40:40 “For everything is from you,
40:43 and what we have given to you  comes from your own hand.”
40:48 What a humble spirit.
40:50 And it’s true, isn’t it?
40:52 Whatever we give to Jehovah,
40:54 it’s something  that he has already given to us.
40:58 It’s no wonder that Jehovah God loved David.
41:03 He was a man really agreeable  to God’s own heart.
41:07 How can we cultivate and maintain  such a humble heart?
41:12 It’s not simply by saying,
41:15 “I am determined to be humble.”
41:17 No, but do as David did.
41:21 Once in a while, sit down,  take a long look at your life,
41:25 and see what blessings,  what undeserved kindnesses,
41:30 Jehovah has extended to you.
41:33 Ponder over his awesomeness.
41:36 And when we do so,  we will be moved to say to Jehovah:
41:40 ‘Who am I, Jehovah God,  that you’ve honored me,
41:44 ‘making me one of your fellow workers  despite my many flaws?
41:49 ‘Who am I, Jehovah,
41:51 ‘that you’ve given me health and strength
41:54 ‘to serve in my assignment?
41:57 ‘Who am I, O God,  to have this special privilege of service
42:01 when I know there are many more  and more deserving than I?’
42:05 Of course, there is a wholesome pride
42:09 in having the privilege  of being one of God’s servants,
42:12 but it is an unhealthy pride
42:15 that makes one feel superior.
42:17 And if we are looking down on others,
42:20 we cannot be looking up at Jehovah.
42:23 And that really is the secret  of maintaining humility
42:27 —to know what we really are.
42:30 We always keep Jehovah before us  as David did.
42:34 So students, we have every confidence
42:38 that you will keep your eyes  on your awesome God,
42:42 and that he will use you and he will bless you
42:45 even more than he has on this day of your graduation.
43:03 Well, I don’t know about you,  but I was enlightened
43:07 by “Who Am I, O Jehovah God?”
43:10 That was David that said that.
43:13 Well, live and learn.
43:16 Brother James Cauthon,
43:18 one of our Theocratic Schools instructors,
43:21 will speak on the theme  “Sympathetic Strings.”
43:27 Imagine that you had the means
43:30 to give everyone in your life
43:33 an expensive gift.
43:35 You know what would happen?
43:37 They would be happy.
43:39 You would be happier  because you would experience
43:42 what Jesus said is a greater happiness —giving.
43:48 Actually, you can give others
43:50 something that is very special
43:54 —something they really need— and it won’t cost you a cent.
43:58 What is it?
44:00 It’s your attention.
44:02 Romans 12:15,
44:07 the apostle Paul wrote this, he said:
44:11 “Rejoice with those who rejoice;  weep with those who weep.”
44:15 We need to learn to understand  and share another person’s feelings
44:20 whether it’s joy or sadness.
44:22 But why?
44:24 We need to understand it
44:25 because we’re living  in “critical times hard to deal with.”
44:29 And so when the Bible says  to “weep with those who weep,”
44:33 we can sum that up in two words:
44:36 Show sympathy.
44:38 Why should we do that?
44:40 Well, going back to Romans 12,  and this time in verse 5,
44:45 notice what we’re reminded of.
44:49 Paul wrote: “So we, although many,  are one body in union with Christ,
44:54 but individually we are members  belonging to one another.”
44:59 Now this, of course, was written  with those of the new covenant in mind,
45:04 but in reality all of us as Jehovah’s people
45:07 belong to one another.
45:09 Now, you might find it interesting to know  that in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
45:14 there are some 50 “one another” commands:
45:18 Love one another, encourage one another,
45:22 incite one another,  pray for one another, and other things.
45:27 The Watchtower said this, it said:
45:30 “We should be sensitive to the pains  and heartaches of our brothers and sisters.
45:34 “Often, we can bring much relief  to fellow believers
45:37 “who are suffering emotional pain
45:39 “if we take the time to listen to them
45:43 with a truly sympathetic ear.”
45:45 Sympathy is entering in
45:49 and sharing in the pain of others.
45:52 Now, sometimes in English we say “empathy.”
45:55 It’s also translated “fellow feeling”  or even “feel pity.”
46:00 But it’s in times of crisis, grief,  and doubt
46:03 when we need one another the most.
46:06 So how can we show that we care?
46:09 The answer is simple: Listen sympathetically.
46:13 The effect can be likened  to the sympathetic strings that are used
46:18 to enhance the sound and harmony  of certain musical instruments.
46:31 Now, all of these have strings  that are not played,
46:36 but they react  to the strings that are struck
46:39 or plucked, if you would,
46:42 thus they become sympathetic.
46:45 They produce a unique harmony.
46:47 It’s a oneness, really.
46:49 The effect of this
46:51 is something that is very special.
46:55 But now, how this actually works  can be demonstrated with the use
46:59 of two tuning forks.
47:03 Notice the one reacts to being struck.
47:07 The second, although not being struck,
47:11 reacts to the feelings of the first.
47:14 So the first fork is no longer alone.
47:17 It has become joined by a second fork
47:20 that is now also picking up the vibrations
47:23 and is said to be sympathetic.
47:26 It’s a harmony, really.
47:28 After the loss of a loved one,  one sister said:
47:33 “Tears became the language of my heart.
47:35 I so appreciated it when the friends  came over and just cried with me.”
47:42 Sure, it’s a oneness —a harmony.
47:45 She felt it.
47:47 We recognize, though,  that there is a certain caution here
47:51 because sharing joy is one thing,
47:55 but sympathetically listening  to another’s pain of heart
47:59 can be emotionally taxing
48:01 and time-consuming.
48:07 As our illustration demonstrates,
48:11 even after the original fork is removed,
48:13 the sympathetic one  is still feeling the effects,
48:17 isn’t that right?
48:19 And that’s why,  whether we like it or not,
48:22 our actions will reveal  what’s really in our hearts
48:25 when it comes to our brothers and sisters.
48:28 Going back to Romans again,
48:31 this time Romans 12:10,
48:35 we’re reminded of this.
48:37 It says: “In brotherly love  have tender affection for one another.”
48:43 Listening is a simple gesture of affection.
48:47 Often the problem, of course,  is that we’re in such a hurry to fix things
48:52 that we feel that we can’t take the time
48:55 to listen to someone else  or to sympathize with them.
48:59 Or sometimes we’re so preoccupied  with our own hurts
49:03 that we’re caught up in that.
49:06 But self-pity will smother sympathy  for others.
49:11 And we need to be careful, frankly,
49:14 because sometimes we feel
49:16 that we just have to solve  the problem right away,
49:18 so we make statements
49:21 that are not helpful  to the person that is suffering.
49:25 ‘You know, you need to just toughen up.’
49:30 Or here’s one of my favorites:
49:33 ‘Others suffered, now it’s your turn.’
49:38 Or comparisons:  ‘Well, at least you can walk.’
49:45 Well, we don’t mean those things  to be malicious,
49:49 but how do they come across?
49:51 You see, they come across as condescending.
49:55 And it’s another way of saying,
49:59 “I don’t care” or “I don’t care enough.”
50:03 Job tried ten times
50:07 to explain to his comforters his feelings.
50:10 And finally, after the tenth time, he said,
50:13 ‘Oh, if someone would but listen to me.’
50:16 His hurt, his pain, was enhanced
50:19 because of his companions’ failure to listen.
50:23 How sad that is.
50:25 They neither cared about Job,
50:28 nor did they want to understand his feelings.
50:36 They shut him down.
50:43 Could we ever do
50:45 the same thing or something similar?
50:47 How sad that would be.
50:50 To share in someone’s grief and pain,  you must be willing to listen,
50:55 you must be willing to take the time,
50:57 and you must care more about them  than you do yourself.
51:00 We need to learn to take ourself  out of the equation.
51:04 Romans 12:10 continues:
51:07 “In showing honor to one another,  take the lead.”
51:10 We honor others by being nonjudgmental,
51:14 by taking them seriously,
51:16 and by giving sincere heartfelt attention  and consideration
51:20 to their words and their feelings.
51:23 We need to remember this point:
51:27 That is, that our relationship with God
51:31 and our relationship with our brothers  is one and the same.
51:37 Let me repeat that.
51:39 Our relationship with God
51:41 and our relationship with our brothers  is one and the same.
51:45 Jehovah cares deeply  about how we interact with one another.
51:52 Jehovah wants his people to be known
51:54 for their love for one another  more than anything else.
51:58 So your gift
52:00 of sympathetic concern
52:02 will be a powerful means of showing love
52:05 and restoring a measure of harmony  into the lives of others.
52:29 With talks like that,  I can see why I’m not one of the instructors.
52:34 The illustration of the two forks  just drove the point home, didn’t it?
52:39 Well, here’s another,
52:41 “The Glowing Coal” is the theme  Brother Mark Noumair has chosen.
52:46 He’s also one  of the Theocratic Schools instructors
52:49 and a helper to the Teaching Committee  of the Governing Body.
52:53 Brother Noumair,  we are burning with anticipation.
52:59 On joyous occasions as today,
53:02 your love burns strong, and rightly so.
53:07 Remember this day.
53:09 Etch indelibly in your minds  how you feel right now
53:13 because this love  that is burning brightly within you
53:17 will be tested.
53:20 When we undergo trials,
53:23 reviewing Bible accounts  of faithful men and women
53:27 can bolster our own faith.
53:29 And we can hear their words  ringing in our minds.
53:34 But what about those  who have never spoken a word
53:38 recorded in the Bible?
53:41 Can their silent examples of faith help us?
53:46 Let’s consider one.
53:48 Her name is Rizpah.
53:50 We know very little about her.
53:53 She is first introduced to us  as a concubine of King Saul.
53:56 No doubt, she must have been very beautiful  to catch the attention of the king.
54:01 However, her life was not an easy one.
54:05 In time,
54:07 Saul —the father of her children—
54:09 is killed in battle.
54:10 She now becomes the property  of Saul’s son, Ishbosheth.
54:14 He too is killed.
54:16 Unfortunately, Rizpah’s most painful test
54:20 was yet to come.
54:24 Long after Saul’s death,  Jehovah tells King David
54:28 that bloodguilt remains on Saul’s house
54:31 because of his attempt  to annihilate the Gibeonites,
54:35 which violated an ancient covenant.
54:38 Thus, the entire nation of Israel is guilty
54:42 of shedding innocent blood.
54:45 How does David resolve this issue?
54:48 Second Samuel 21:3
54:52 shows what David did.
54:54 Second Samuel 21:3,  David asks the Gibeonites:
54:59 “What should I do for you?”
55:02 Verse 6, they answer:
55:04 “Let seven of [Saul’s] sons be given to us.
55:08 We will hang their dead bodies  before Jehovah.”
55:11 Verse 6 continues, David said:
55:14 “I will hand them over.”
55:16 Who does David hand over?
55:18 He hands over, in verse 8,  Rizpah’s two sons,
55:24 “the two sons of Rizpah,”
55:26 the two people in the whole world  that she loved most.
55:29 What a heartbreaking tragedy for Rizpah,
55:33 but she could do nothing about it.
55:35 The decision was made;  it was out of her control.
55:39 Eventually, all seven men are hung.
55:42 Now, under the Mosaic Law,  those executed upon a stake
55:46 should have been taken down  before nightfall and buried.
55:50 Burial would have brought closure  to this mother’s crushed soul.
55:54 And above all, it would conform
55:56 to Jehovah’s requirements  for the dignity of life
56:00 and that proper disposal of the dead body
56:03 would have been according  to Jehovah’s instructions.
56:06 Undoubtedly, Rizpah knows this,
56:10 but it didn’t happen that way.
56:13 So can you feel her anguish  as night approaches
56:17 and no one comes to take those bodies down?
56:20 And Rizpah could have been thinking:
56:22 ‘But the Mosaic Law,  no one is following the Law.
56:26 It’s not right.’
56:28 But there was a catch.
56:31 It seems that the Gibeonites
56:33 were allowed to follow  a different procedure in this instance
56:37 because a national sin  had been committed by King Saul.
56:42 Now did Rizpah know that?
56:44 We don’t know.
56:46 But what we do know, one day goes by;
56:49 the Law is not followed.
56:51 The bodies are not taken down.
56:53 Two days go by; three days go by.
56:58 What does she do?
57:00 Well, according to verse 10,
57:03 Rizpah continues day after day
57:05 in the blaze of that scorching summer sun.
57:08 In fact, verse 10 says what she did do.
57:11 It says that “she did not allow  the birds of the heavens
57:14 “to land on [those bodies] by day
57:17 nor the wild beasts of the field  to come near by night.”
57:21 There she was out there, day after day,  shooing those birds away
57:26 —not to draw attention to herself,  not to get justice for her sons, no.
57:31 She understood, she appreciated,
57:34 and she upheld Jehovah’s view of human life.
57:39 She allowed Jehovah’s values  to shape her behavior
57:43 even at great personal cost.
57:46 You must love this woman.
57:49 Although Rizpah probably didn’t understand  exactly why things were happening this way
57:54 —why was it turning out in this way—
57:56 this different procedure  of not burying her sons
58:01 had a major impact on her personal life.
58:05 Yet, her conduct showed her love for Jehovah
58:09 and the loyalty that she had  for his arrangements
58:13 —that this love and loyalty  burned brightly within her.
58:17 Here’s your big lesson.
58:20 Now, at times, you might feel  that your life is outside of your control.
58:26 You may go through a trial
58:28 that allows Jehovah’s standards  and decisions to shape you,
58:33 perhaps at great personal cost.
58:37 For example,  you’re familiar with theocratic procedure;
58:42 you’re familiar with theocratic policies.
58:44 We know that.
58:46 But there might come a time  when an organizational direction
58:50 —an organizational procedure—
58:52 is modified for reasons  that you are not fully aware of,
58:57 and that decision affects you personally.
59:01 What will you do?
59:03 Like Rizpah, keep doing what you can  under your circumstances.
59:08 Shoo those birds away —those negative thoughts.
59:10 Stir up that fire.
59:12 Don’t allow your warmth and glow  for Jehovah God to burn out.
59:18 Now, days go by,
59:20 according to verse 9 and verse 10:
59:24 ‘from the start of the harvest to the rain.’
59:29 Now this implies that this may have been  five to six months
59:32 that she kept vigil over her sons’ bodies.
59:36 What could she have been thinking  about during this time
59:39 that may have been close to half a year?
59:42 What would she have been thinking about?
59:44 ‘How could David be so uncaring  as not to command
59:48 ‘to give my boys a proper burial.
59:51 ‘And Jehovah,
59:53 ‘after all that I’ve been through,
59:56 where are you, Jehovah?’
59:59 Now these might have been  natural thoughts, true.
1:00:02 Yet, if she did have them,
1:00:04 she did not allow these thoughts  to put out the fire
1:00:08 of her love for God or to make her bitter.
1:00:13 Perhaps others even tried  to discourage her saying:
1:00:15 ‘Go home. Give up.’
1:00:18 But she didn’t.
1:00:20 Nor did she start a campaign  by gathering others to her side.
1:00:24 There’s no record of her bad-mouthing David,
1:00:26 criticizing his decision as unfair.
1:00:30 Nor did she presume  to take the bodies down herself.
1:00:33 ‘Well, if nobody is going to do it,  I’ll do it.’
1:00:36 No, in spite of all of these difficulties
1:00:39 —imagine— that Rizpah was suffering,
1:00:42 she still had embers of love
1:00:45 for Jehovah God glowing brightly
1:00:48 that moved her to stay loyal,
1:00:51 remain in her place,
1:00:53 and wait on David to make the decision.
1:00:58 Did her faithful endurance really matter?
1:01:03 Did anyone notice her plight?
1:01:07 Verse 11:
1:01:09 “David was told
1:01:11 what Saul’s concubine Rizpah . . . had done.”
1:01:16 So imagine someone goes to David:
1:01:18 ‘David, there’s this Rizpah;  she’s up there near these bodies.
1:01:20 She’s shooing these birds away.’
1:01:23 So, what did David do?
1:01:25 Did he now, finally,  give Rizpah’s sons a decent burial?
1:01:30 Actually, he did more.
1:01:34 Verses 12 through 14
1:01:37 show how David had the bones of Saul
1:01:40 and the bones of Jonathan brought  all the way from Jabesh-gilead
1:01:43 —which might have taken a journey  of about 100 miles (160 km)—
1:01:47 and buried those bones  with the bones of Rizpah’s sons
1:01:51 in Saul’s family plot in Benjamite territory.
1:01:55 So in the end,  Rizpah got more than she expected.
1:02:01 She saw the bones of her sons
1:02:04 and their father buried together.
1:02:07 Rizpah didn’t see that coming,
1:02:11 but it was worth the wait.
1:02:14 So, what’s the big lesson  we want you to remember here?
1:02:18 Rizpah’s love and loyalty and endurance
1:02:21 provides an example worth imitating.
1:02:24 When you go through a trial,
1:02:28 remember that others  are observing your conduct
1:02:31 —they’re watching.
1:02:33 And out of frustration, you might feel:
1:02:36 ‘Well, why haven’t,  why haven’t the elders done anything?
1:02:40 ‘Why aren’t the overseers  taking care of this situation?
1:02:43 Jehovah, why don’t you do something?’
1:02:47 And Jehovah is saying:  ‘I am doing something.
1:02:51 ‘I’m using your silent example
1:02:55 ‘to show others that  when you endure a situation,
1:02:58 ‘I will reward them.
1:03:00 ‘I’ll reward them more than  they ever anticipated,
1:03:03 ‘and it will be worth the wait.
1:03:05 Because I, Jehovah,  I love being a rewarder.’
1:03:11 What a noble and honorable way  to be used by Jehovah God.
1:03:17 Now, Rizpah was not a victim  of her circumstances.
1:03:22 Rather, she became a victor  over her adversities.
1:03:28 The intense heat of her trials  did not break her as a person
1:03:31 nor crush her desire  to please Jehovah God.
1:03:36 So little is known about her,
1:03:40 and yet we learn so much from her.
1:03:43 She never had one spoken word  recorded in the Bible,
1:03:47 yet Jehovah must have been very impressed  with this remarkable woman.
1:03:52 Her name and example earned a place  in his sacred Book
1:03:57 and is worthy of our examination.
1:03:59 She teaches you
1:04:01 —she teaches you  how to take life’s indignities with dignity.
1:04:07 So, what helped her endure successfully?
1:04:11 Perhaps a clue is in her name.
1:04:15 It literally means “Glowing Coal.”
1:04:19 Now, we don’t know why  she was given that name, true.
1:04:22 But like a piece of coal  glowing warm and bright,
1:04:25 Rizpah kept her thoughts focused  on love for her sons’ loyalty to Jehovah,
1:04:30 loyalty to his arrangements,
1:04:32 confident that relief would eventually come.
1:04:36 She was industrious.
1:04:38 She actively guarded her sons’ bodies  from being eaten by animals.
1:04:42 She didn’t allow negative feelings  to shut her down and extinguish her love.
1:04:48 Rather, in the face of what  she might have felt to be an injustice,
1:04:52 she did what she could.
1:04:55 So, what do we want you to remember?
1:04:57 What do we want you to go away with  to your assignments thinking about?
1:05:03 In the face of a perceived injustice,  keep working;
1:05:07 keep carrying out  your assigned work assignments;
1:05:10 keep doing what you can.
1:05:12 Shoo away those birds.
1:05:13 Stoke up the fire of your love  for Jehovah God and the brothers.
1:05:18 And wait on Jehovah  to resolve any pending issues,
1:05:22 confident that relief will come now  or in the new world.
1:05:27 It will be worth that wait.
1:05:30 And yet, above all, above all, be a Rizpah.
1:05:36 Under all circumstances,
1:05:38 keep your love for God  burning brightly like a glowing coal.
1:05:48 Those talks were inspiring  to the students of the 143rd class,
1:05:53 and I am sure that you feel much  the same way after viewing them.
1:05:57 But you probably are wondering,  ‘What about the rest of the program?’
1:06:01 Wonder no longer.
1:06:03 Part 2 and Part 3 will be posted  on the Video on Demand section
1:06:08 of JW Broadcasting later this month.
1:06:11 In fact, Part 2 is a video entitled The Inside Story.
1:06:15 It is scheduled to be posted next Monday, December 11.
1:06:19 You will enjoy hearing experiences  from some of the graduates of the class.
1:06:23 Until the next monthly program,  this is JW Broadcasting
1:06:27 coming to you from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting!
00:04 Here is what we can look forward to  on the program this month.
00:07 Why do we need to be quick  to address problems when they arise?
00:11 We will highlight the benefits.
00:14 And our music video will encourage us  to reach out to expand our ministry.
00:20 We will also find out how our brothers  and sisters reached out to the visitors
00:24 that came to the Olympic Games  in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, last year.
00:28 This is the September program of JW Broadcasting!
00:50 The theme selected  for my comments this month
00:53 is “Punctuality—A Godly Quality.”
00:56 You might remember the opening paragraph
00:59 in a 1990 Watchtower article  on the subject of punctuality.
01:04 It said that an elder’s closest friends
01:07 jokingly called him Armageddon.
01:10 Why?
01:11 They replied: “We know he’s coming,  but only God knows when!”
01:16 The elder had a problem with punctuality.
01:19 Punctuality has nothing  in common with procrastination.
01:24 To procrastinate means
01:26 “to intentionally put off  the doing of something
01:30 that should be done.”
01:32 The saying,  “Tomorrow is the busiest day of the year”
01:36 reflects the human tendency  to procrastinate.
01:40 How appropriate then  is the inspired encouragement
01:43 concerning the present —today.
01:46 Galatians 6:10 says:
01:48 “As long as we have the opportunity,
01:51 let us work what is good toward all.”
01:54 “As long as we have the opportunity”
01:57 does not sound like procrastination to me.
02:00 No, the Bible encourages just the opposite —punctuality.
02:05 Punctuality refers to the characteristic
02:08 of being prompt in keeping appointments.
02:11 Punctuality is a godly quality.
02:13 In fact, Matthew 6:33
02:17 prioritizes our pursuit of Kingdom interests.
02:21 It says:
02:22 “Keep on, then, seeking first  the Kingdom and his righteousness,
02:26 and all these other things  will be added to you.”
02:30 It said to ‘seek the Kingdom first,’
02:34 not second, not third or fourth —first.
02:39 When we put the Kingdom first in our life,
02:42 we do not put it off
02:45 in favor of some trivial pursuit.
02:49 If it is time for a Christian meeting,
02:51 we are there well before it starts.
02:55 Perhaps you have heard some say:
02:58 “At least I made it to the meeting.
03:00 Better late than never!”
03:03 But the godly way is:  “Better never late!”
03:07 Jehovah is a punctual God.
03:09 He sets the example for us.
03:12 When Jehovah decided to destroy  the ungodly world in a deluge,
03:17 he said to Noah at Genesis 6:14:
03:21 “Make for yourself an ark.”
03:24 Then, at Genesis 7:4,
03:26 Jehovah told Noah  to enter into the ark and informed him:
03:31 “For in just seven days,
03:33 I will make it rain on the earth  for 40 days and 40 nights.”
03:38 What happened?
03:40 A “better late than never” attitude?
03:42 No, that is not acceptable to Jehovah.
03:46 Instead, Genesis 7:10 says:
03:49 “And seven days later
03:52 the floodwaters came upon the earth.”
03:55 Right on time.
03:57 Punctuality is a godly quality.
04:00 By means of a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9,
04:04 Jehovah indicated  hundreds of years in advance
04:07 when Jesus would fulfill  his role as Messiah and Savior.
04:12 When did Jesus present  himself for that role?
04:15 “Better late than never?”
04:17 No, precisely on time in 29 C.E.,
04:22 Jesus was anointed as Christ.
04:25 In fact, Romans 5:6 says:
04:28 “Christ died for ungodly men
04:31 at the appointed time.”
04:34 Jehovah is punctual.
04:37 What about in our time?
04:39 The Bible tells us to keep in expectation
04:41 of Jehovah’s future day of judgment.
04:44 When will it happen?
04:46 Well, to us it may seem that it has delayed.
04:51 But what do we know about Jehovah?
04:53 He is punctual.
04:55 And so it is that Habakkuk 2:3 tells us:
05:01 “For the vision  is yet for its appointed time,
05:06 “and it is rushing toward its end,
05:09 “and it will not lie.
05:11 “Even if it should delay,  keep in expectation of it!
05:15 “For it will without fail come true.
05:19 It will not be late!”
05:21 Punctuality is Jehovah’s way.
05:24 Unlike the elder cited earlier,
05:27 this Armageddon will be on time.
05:31 The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14
05:34 was specifically discussing what happens
05:37 at Christian gatherings.
05:39 In verse 26, he said:
05:41 “When you come together, . . .
05:43 Let all things take place for building up.”
05:47 Then, at 1 Corinthians 14:40,
05:51 he concludes by saying:
05:53 “But let all things take place decently
05:57 and by arrangement.”
05:59 Look at the words again.
06:01 When speaking about Christian meetings,
06:03 he said:  ‘Let things take place decently.’
06:06 In Greek,  it literally means “well-behavedly.”
06:10 Paul also used a Greek word  translated here “by arrangement.”
06:15 The literal meaning of the Greek word  is “according to order.”
06:20 If we are to be well-behaved,  according to order at our meetings,
06:25 what would be one aspect of that?
06:28 Being punctual —on time—
06:30 for the start of the meeting.
06:32 While the lack of punctuality  affects all cultures
06:36 to one degree or another,
06:38 it is true that some cultures
06:40 are more punctual  than others as a whole.
06:43 A missionary reported  that in one town where he served,
06:48 his wife would be  the only person in the audience
06:52 when he announced the opening song  at the beginning of the meeting.
06:56 But when he announced the closing song,
06:59 70 people would be there.
07:02 On the other hand,  in a Western European country,
07:06 about a thousand people were asked:
07:08 “If you were invited  to dinner at 7:00 p.m.,
07:13 “should you arrive  five or ten minutes early,
07:17 or five or ten minutes late,  or exactly on time?”
07:21 The majority responded
07:23 that “courtesy requires  scrupulous respect for the host
07:27 and arriving at the exact minute.”
07:31 Each culture would likely think  that the other is extreme.
07:36 However, being punctual is more  than a matter of regional preference.
07:41 It is a godly quality
07:43 that true Christians of every culture
07:46 want to cultivate.
07:48 Punctuality must become a habit —a way of life.
07:52 It is similar to some countries
07:55 that do not have  a habit of good hygiene, or cleanliness.
08:00 That may be true,  but it is expected that Jehovah’s people
08:04 in those lands will excel  in good hygiene and clean habits.
08:09 In the same way,  no matter what our background,
08:13 culture, or upbringing,
08:15 it is expected  that we as imitators of our God
08:19 will develop  the godly habit of being punctual.
08:24 What helps us to be punctual?
08:27 The Bible encourages advance planning.
08:30 Proverbs 21:5 says:
08:32 “The plans of the diligent  surely lead to success,
08:36 but all who are hasty  surely head for poverty.”
08:41 So being punctual is not just a matter
08:44 of hastily fulfilling  an obligation or an appointment.
08:49 It involves thinking in advance  about our responsibilities.
08:54 Yes, planning to be prepared for them
08:56 and to be prompt in carrying them out.
09:00 Well, what are some activities
09:02 that we would want  to be punctual in fulfilling?
09:07 It can be the everyday things in life,
09:10 such as arriving at work  or at school on time;
09:15 being punctual for appointments,  such as a visit to the doctor or dentist;
09:21 arriving at the designated time  when invited to another’s home for a meal.
09:27 What is our habit like  when it comes to these areas of life?
09:33 Even more important is punctuality
09:35 when attending  our Christian meetings and assemblies.
09:38 This means being present
09:40 before the opening song and prayer.
09:44 The apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22
09:47 when he wrote Hebrews 2:12.
09:50 Of Jesus he said:
09:53 “I will declare your name to my brothers;
09:56 in the midst of the congregation  I will praise you with song.”
10:01 If that was true of Jesus,
10:03 it is a great incentive  for us to participate
10:08 in singing the first song  with our congregation.
10:12 And the opening prayer  is important for us.
10:15 In ancient times,  Jehovah called the temple
10:19 his “house of prayer.”
10:21 It’s true that the opening prayer
10:24 requests Jehovah’s guidance  and holy spirit on the program,
10:28 however, it also prepares
10:31 our minds and hearts
10:33 to receive the information to be considered.
10:37 Of course, there may be times when one
10:40 is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting.
10:43 Public transportation may be delayed
10:46 or our car may break down.
10:49 That’s understandable on occasion.
10:52 But what is our habit?
10:56 In the past,  it was suggested that we consider
10:59 arriving 15 or 20 minutes  before a meeting started.
11:03 One brother with six siblings
11:06 said his father made a goal  of being at the Kingdom Hall
11:10 20 minutes before the program began.
11:13 That certainly took advance planning.
11:16 His father’s byline  for meeting attendance was:
11:21 “If you’re 5 minutes early,
11:24 then your 15 minutes late.”
11:27 In most cases, the whole family arrived
11:30 20 minutes before the meeting
11:35 for wholesome association.
11:37 Another opportunity for punctuality
11:40 is arriving on time  for a meeting for service.
11:43 This is challenging for some.
11:45 However, with a little advanced planning,
11:48 we can be successful.
11:50 Punctuality is particularly important
11:53 since the actual meeting  is only about ten minutes long.
11:58 If we’re late,  not only is it disruptive
12:02 but it could force  the one taking the lead
12:05 to redo the arrangements  made for the group.
12:10 And speaking of our ministry,
12:12 what is an opportunity  to be punctual every month?
12:16 Yes, you guessed it,
12:18 turning in our field service report  at the end of the month.
12:22 Do you have a way  of reminding yourself of this?
12:27 In some lands,  it is almost as if it is a custom
12:30 for the start  of a wedding talk to be delayed.
12:34 Often this is because  of mistakenly gauging how much time
12:39 the bride needs  to get dressed and made up
12:43 for her grand appearance.
12:45 However,  being considerate of those invited
12:49 should move those involved  to allow extra time
12:53 to complete the task of preparation.
12:57 A 1990 Watchtower  commented on being punctual
13:01 in starting a wedding.
13:03 The very next sentence stated:
13:07 “You may like to have your egg boiled
13:11 for just so many minutes.”
13:13 I am not sure exactly how  that applies to a wedding,
13:17 but I think we get the point,  don’t we?
13:21 We should have calculated  the timing in advance
13:26 so that the ceremony begins on time.
13:31 Do we have yet another example  of being punctual,
13:35 not procrastinating?
13:38 How about when there is a difference
13:40 between you and a fellow believer
13:43 or a family member?
13:45 Of course, if it is simply a minor issue
13:50 because of imperfection,
13:52 often the best thing to do  is forgive and forget.
13:57 But if it was more serious
14:00 or we cannot simply let it go,
14:04 what should we do?
14:06 We need to settle the matter  and restore the peace.
14:10 When should we take this step?
14:12 Do not procrastinate.
14:15 If we do,  the problem may fester and get worse.
14:20 What kind of a priority  did Jesus establish
14:24 for restoring peace  between fellow believers?
14:27 At Matthew 5:23, 24,
14:31 note his clear indication of punctuality:
14:35 “If, then, you are bringing  your gift to the altar
14:39 “and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
14:43 “leave your gift there in front  of the altar, and go away.
14:47 “First make your peace with your brother,
14:50 and then come back and offer your gift.”
14:52 Did you pick up on the timing
14:55 that Jesus recommended for reconciliation?
15:00 He said:
15:02 “[First] First make your peace  with your brother.”
15:06 It is a high priority  and should be treated as such.
15:11 But remember  the scripture we shared earlier,
15:14 Proverbs 21:5?
15:16 This principle should be implemented.
15:20 The last part of the verse
15:23 warns us not to be “hasty.”
15:26 Hasty is not synonymous with punctuality.
15:31 Instead,  the first part of the verse indicates
15:34 we should prepare or plan the visit first.
15:39 Then follow through without procrastinating.
15:43 It said this approach will “lead to success.”
15:48 What is the success we are seeking?
15:52 Jesus did not say to justify our position
15:56 or to point out the flaw
15:59 in the other person’s words or actions.
16:02 No, he said you would be successful
16:06 if you  “make your peace with your brother.”
16:10 Punctuality is a godly quality
16:13 that we should strive to cultivate.
16:16 Another aspect of punctuality
16:19 is ending an assignment on time.
16:22 In the interest of punctuality,
16:24 let’s move on  to the next segment of our program.
16:28 Thank you, Brother Herd.
16:30 You are teaching by example —we appreciate that!
16:34 And— On the subject of punctuality,
16:36 we wanted to share an example
16:38 of how ingrained a problem can become
16:41 if we let it fester.
16:43 Meet Brother Peter Zak.
16:45 As he relates his story,
16:48 look for ways punctuality,
16:50 or promptly addressing matters,
16:53 could have helped him to minimize
16:55 the effects of the problem.
17:00 I was born in Poland,  and when I was about five years old,
17:04 my family immigrated to Canada.
17:06 I feel that from a young age  I really loved Jehovah.
17:10 I had a good relationship with him.
17:12 I enjoyed going in field service;  I enjoyed the congregation.
17:17 But like all youths,  I had my distractions, you could say.
17:22 And for me, in particular,  it was video games.
17:25 I remember in the beginning  even my parents would set some rules.
17:29 But as I kept progressing  in that game
17:32 and I started participating  in tournaments,
17:34 I started getting recognized  and admired.
17:36 It started becoming a temptation.
17:41 People would go to download  my previously played games
17:44 to study my techniques  and my strategies.
17:47 I was interviewed by different websites.
17:49 People wanted to be on my team.
17:51 I could see that this world  was slowly dragging me in.
17:56 For example, there was  a huge tournament that I participated in.
18:00 I finished very well —received many prizes.
18:04 And then after that tournament,  there was another tournament,
18:07 even bigger, with huge prizes —cash prizes—
18:10 a competition for all the best players  in the world.
18:12 At this time, also,  the website was growing.
18:15 We were just sponsored to produce our own tournament
18:18 with cash prizes for the players.
18:20 So I really thought that this would be  an opportunity for me
18:23 to maybe have a career  and maybe to support myself
18:26 in the future  if I wanted to pioneer.
18:28 And I thought  that this was a realistic goal.
18:32 But as the website also kept progressing  and as I got more involved with it,
18:37 I realized that what I was exposed to
18:39 was very, very, dangerous —very harmful.
18:43 They were immoral,  wicked, improper things.
18:50 I was going to the meetings,  and I was going in service;
18:52 but at the same time, all my other time  was spent on this video game.
18:56 But it was only slowly,  over time, I started realizing
18:59 that it was having  a very negative effect on my spirituality.
19:03 I noticed that when I was in service,
19:05 I would think only about the video game.
19:08 When the service was over,  I would rush home to play the video game.
19:12 Even at meetings—  I would attend all my meetings,
19:14 but I would sit there  and nothing was coming in.
19:16 I went there in person,  but my mind wasn’t there.
19:19 So that also started bothering me.
19:23 And at this time,  my older brothers
19:27 —who were always  a good example to me—
19:29 they quit playing games.
19:32 They were making improvement  in the congregation;
19:35 they were having privileges,
19:37 working hard for the brothers  and sisters in our congregation.
19:40 I could see they were so happy.
19:42 They had the real joy  and satisfaction.
19:45 But for me, I didn’t;
19:48 I was always feeling empty inside.
19:51 I needed to change.
19:53 And I remember, in particular,  one day at the back of the Kingdom Hall,
19:56 the brother—an elder—who studied  with me and my two brothers
19:58 approached me;
20:00 and he very reasonably talked to me
20:03 about my future.
20:06 He also helped me see  my brothers
20:10 and how they stopped,  and they were so happy.
20:12 And I could see the difference.
20:14 I was serving  two masters at the same time,
20:16 but I was really losing out  with Jehovah.
20:24 So I knew I had  to make drastic changes in my life.
20:29 Up until then, I did try a few times  to stop playing video games.
20:33 And it worked for a couple of days,  but I got right back into it.
20:36 I lacked self-control.
20:43 So I realized that for me—  If I wanted to stop this,
20:46 I needed to make  a complete stop of everything.
20:50 So I prayed about it.
20:52 I asked Jehovah  for help and for strength
20:54 to give me the courage  to take this action.
20:56 We took down the website,  deleted the games,
21:00 stopped playing the games,  and just made
21:02 a clean sweep—clean stop.
21:05 And I knew I needed that.
21:07 Right after,  I felt like a load was lifted.
21:14 I had all this time  now I could spend,
21:17 and I was spending it  more in the ministry
21:19 and in the congregation.
21:21 So, soon after,  I started auxiliary pioneering
21:23 and then regular pioneering.
21:25 I started doing a lot more  in the congregation.
21:27 I could see how happy I was.
21:29 It was bringing me real joy
21:31 —satisfaction.
21:33 So I remember  after pioneering for a few years,
21:35 I started learning a foreign language.
21:38 It was challenging,  but it was exciting.
21:40 I moved to another city to expand my ministry;
21:44 then I moved to another country.
21:46 And I remember just studying  with people
21:48 as a need-greater  and just seeing them
21:51 progress and seeing how they  made changes in their lives
21:54 and how they started  having a relationship with Jehovah.
21:58 And that I was being used  to help them to get to that point
22:00 was such an amazing feeling.
22:06 Now I have the privilege  of serving at Bethel.
22:09 And I can see  Jehovah’s hand in my life,
22:11 and also I’m able  to give every day to him.
22:28 This is the joy that I was looking for.
22:31 So I would definitely  encourage all young ones
22:35 to really test out Jehovah.
22:38 It’s like Ecclesiastes 12:1,
22:40 my favorite scripture growing up.
22:42 Just give to Jehovah;  test him out; give him your everything.
22:45 And you will see  that you’ll have no regrets.
22:48 You’ll have true satisfaction  from serving him.
22:56 When should Peter  have considered limiting
22:58 his preoccupation  with video games?
23:01 Video and computer games  in themselves are not wrong
23:04 unless they are  about things Jehovah hates.
23:07 But did you notice that Peter  explained that there was a point
23:11 when the games  became a temptation?
23:13 That is, the games were no longer  merely occasional entertainment
23:18 but started to become  the center of his life.
23:21 That was the warning  for him to sit down
23:24 and review how much time and effort  he should be spending on video games.
23:29 But he didn’t.
23:31 He did not address the matter promptly.
23:33 As a result,  he later had to admit that all he thought of,
23:38 even at the meetings or in the ministry,  was video games.
23:42 Despite the mistake,
23:44 Peter wisely applied  the words of Matthew 5:30:
23:48 “Also, if your right hand  is making you stumble,
23:52 cut it off  and throw it away from you.”
23:54 While he did not need to literally cut off  his mouse-clicking right hand,
23:59 he got rid of anything that caused  the temptation in the first place.
24:05 If you are a parent,  you have a responsibility
24:09 to help your children  address any concerns that may arise.
24:13 You need to know  what they are doing,
24:15 and then lovingly guide them  based on Biblical principles.
24:21 Acting promptly when you  sense a problem is building up
24:24 is equally important  in other aspects of life.
24:28 This dramatization highlights  how we can do so when married.
24:41 We do have good friends  in our congregation,
24:46 but there is so much work!
24:59 Why is Jessica so upset?
25:03 OK, maybe I should’ve asked  before turning down that dinner invite,
25:08 but she knows how busy I am.
25:11 I’ve got elder’s meetings, work,
25:14 pioneering.
25:20 But she just says  we never do anything fun anymore.
25:30 Maybe she’s right.
25:33 Sometimes even when we’re together,
25:38 we’re not really together.
25:58 Our lives are filled  with spiritual activities
26:08 but our family worship  hasn’t exactly been regular.
26:24 Maybe I fooled myself  into thinking
26:26 that because we’re busy  doing things for Jehovah,
26:29 it’s OK to skip it sometimes.
26:42 We argued again tonight
26:47 and then went to bed angry
26:50 —something we said we’d never do.
27:14 The next morning  I told Jessica how sorry I was,
27:18 and she admitted  that she felt bad too.
27:22 We decided to research  Ephesians chapter 4
27:25 that night for family worship.
27:27 One article mentioned:
27:29 “How sad it would be  if marriage mates spoke to each other
27:33 with less respect than . . .  total strangers!”
27:35 That really struck us.
27:39 Then we read  Ephesians 4:31, 32:
27:44 “Put away from yourselves  every kind of malicious bitterness,
27:48 “anger, wrath, screaming,  and abusive speech,
27:51 “as well as everything injurious.
27:53 “But become kind to one another,
27:56 “tenderly compassionate,  freely forgiving one another
28:00 just as God also by Christ  freely forgave you.”
28:05 We both promised to work  on making our words and tone
28:09 more loving and kind.
28:13 We also studied the Bible accounts of Aquila and Priscilla,
28:17 who were a beautiful example  of what it means
28:19 for a married couple  to be “one flesh.”
28:21 They were together at home,  at work,
28:25 and in the ministry.
28:37 That’s when we realized  we needed to draw closer as a couple.
28:51 Since then,  we do as much as we can together.
29:03 We’re still busy  in spiritual activities,
29:08 but they’re never an excuse  to neglect our relationship.
29:14 And now we aren’t just marriage mates;
29:19 we’re once again best friends.
29:25 As this dramatization  and the example of Peter Zak showed,
29:30 whenever you sense a problem,  address it!
29:33 Do not procrastinate.
29:35 Be punctual.
29:37 At times,  world events may highlight
29:39 the importance of being punctual.
29:41 In May of last year,  a wildfire overtook
29:45 the Canadian city of Fort McMurray,  in the province of Alberta.
29:49 The brothers and sisters  there benefited from promptly
29:53 following the direction  they had received
29:55 from their local congregations.
30:06 There was a local needs part,
30:08 and we try to do it every year,
30:10 and this year  it was at the perfect time
30:12 because the next week  we had the fire.
30:14 And when the brother  was reviewing,
30:16 he was saying it was  a high fire-hazard year,
30:19 so be prepared.
30:21 And it was nice  that the brothers were so obedient
30:23 and took that to heart and were ready.
30:27 It happened so quickly,
30:30 from being fine and safe  to ‘We got to get out of here.’
30:32 We started to hear  the municipality saying
30:35 there are mandatory evacuations
30:37 for different neighborhoods.
30:39 So within noon, two o’clock, four o’clock,
30:43 90,000 people are in motion.
30:46 When you were standing outside,  you could hear the helicopters going,
30:48 the sirens going.
30:49 The smoke was so thick and intense.
30:51 Both the left and the right  were all in flames;
30:54 it was totally in flames.
30:57 Ugh, it was chaotic.
30:59 People running to their cars,  seeing and looking
31:01 at the big cloud of smoke  approaching them
31:04 and just the fright in their eyes.
31:07 It just came to mind:
31:09 During the local needs,  the brothers said,
31:12 “If in case of an emergency,  you have to follow directions.
31:14 “Listen to the local authorities
31:16 and listen to your local elders.”
31:20 Each elder  for the field service groups
31:23 had to care  for a small amount of people.
31:27 I was calling  all the brothers and sisters
31:29 that I could to find out
31:31 where they were and if they were safe.
31:33 Every group overseer knew exactly
31:36 where everybody in his group  was at all times.
31:38 One brother came  to help my wife and the kids
31:41 to evacuate while I was at work.
31:44 So I felt very indebted  to this brother
31:48 —that he acted in my behalf  to get my family to a safe place.
31:51 To see the brothers OK and calm,  it makes me calm.
31:59 It’s all gone,
32:01 and it went away overnight.
32:04 If we are to put  our trust in such things—
32:07 Where are they now?
32:12 Although we’ve lost all this,
32:15 our relationship with Jehovah —we haven’t lost that.
32:22 We can’t salvage nothing .
32:25 Yeah.
32:26 Everything is gone. Gone—everything is gone.
32:29 Yeah, this is our basement.
32:31 People are always asking us, like,  “Did you lose your home?”
32:36 And we’re like, “Yeah, we did.”
32:37 Seeing how quickly things can go,  how things can disappear,
32:43 it helps you appreciate the things  that are most important.
32:47 And not only  do we have our own lives
32:49 but we still have  our brothers and sisters
32:51 there with us.
32:56 When we escaped
32:58 and moved to Edmonton,
33:01 which is about  a four-and-a-half-hour drive from here,
33:04 the friends opened their homes to us
33:07 in the middle of the night —2:30 a.m.—
33:09 and welcomed us.
33:10 They gave us food;  they gave us clothing;
33:12 they gave us a place to stay.
33:15 That kind of hospitality  really touched our heart.
33:17 We realized that we  hadn’t missed anything.
33:32 Some of the friends,  we haven’t seen them
33:34 since the disaster occurred
33:36 and to meet the friends again
33:38 —you know, about a month  and a half after the disaster—
33:41 at the convention  was really, really encouraging.
33:45 We see brothers that are working  with different departments
33:47 here at the convention  and also with the disaster relief committee
33:51 who have no home to go back to.
33:53 Yet, they’re so concerned  about someone else
33:55 that they don’t even think about  what they’ve really lost.
33:59 Although we’ve lost  everything materially,
34:02 we have everything spiritually.
34:05 What is gone is gone.
34:08 What is important is our lives  and our relationship with Jehovah.
34:31 The local needs part  proved very helpful
34:34 for our brothers and sisters  in Fort McMurray.
34:37 The part included direction  about having a “go bag”
34:40 and keeping the gas tanks  of their vehicles full.
34:44 Because of the distance  to the nearest town
34:46 and the heavy traffic  during the evacuation,
34:49 having a full tank of gas  proved to be very timely advice.
34:53 Instead of procrastinating,
34:55 our brothers and sisters  in Alberta followed the direction,
34:59 to their benefit.
35:01 Although our circumstances  may not be as extreme,
35:05 we all experience  challenging situations every now and then.
35:09 The need to be punctual always applies.
35:13 For example,
35:15 there is no need to wait  for perfect circumstances
35:18 before expanding our ministry.
35:20 For some,  expanding our ministry
35:23 could mean taking the leap  into full-time service.
35:27 Two families did just that
35:29 in this music video  entitled Let’s Take the Leap.
35:45 To serve full-time, That’s been our goal.
35:52 It opens up More ways to serve whole-souled.
35:58 So if not now And if not here,
36:05 This chance might slip away And disappear.
36:11 Let’s take the leap; Let’s not hold back.
36:17 Let’s not give in to doubt; Let’s not miss out.
36:24 We’ll go in faith, Not looking back, not behind.
36:30 Let’s look ahead With peace of mind.
36:50 Jehovah knows; Jehovah sees.
36:56 Before we ask, He knows the needs of each.
37:03 Though it might seem Beyond our reach,
37:09 Let’s put our trust in him And take the leap.
37:15 Let’s take the leap; Let’s not hold back.
37:22 Let’s not give in to doubt; Let’s not miss out.
37:28 We’ll go in faith, Not looking back, not behind.
37:35 Let’s look ahead With peace of mind.
37:48 So let’s go through This open door.
37:54 Things left behind Will be replaced and more,
38:01 Not only now But all that God has in store—
38:08 The life to come Forevermore.
38:13 Let’s take the leap; Let’s not hold back.
38:19 Let’s not give in to doubt; Let’s not miss out.
38:26 We’ll go in faith, Not looking back and not behind.
38:33 Let’s look ahead With peace of mind.
38:46 Let’s take the leap; Let’s not hold back.
38:52 Let’s not give in to doubt; Let’s not miss out.
38:59 We’ll go in faith, Not looking back and not behind.
39:05 Let’s look ahead With peace of mind.
39:24 Let’s take the leap.
39:34 Expanding our ministry  in whatever form
39:37 can bring us great joy  as servants of Jehovah.
39:41 Even if your circumstances today
39:43 do not allow you  to enter the full-time service,
39:45 there is plenty to do.
39:48 Our brothers and sisters in Brazil  experienced an opportunity
39:52 to make special efforts  in their preaching work
39:55 when the Olympic  and Paralympic Games were held there
39:59 in August and September of 2016.
40:02 Close to 15,000 athletes
40:05 from approximately 205 countries
40:08 were present along with many visitors.
40:20 More than one million tourists
40:22 were present at the Olympic Games  in Rio de Janeiro,
40:24 and among them  were around 410,000 foreigners.
40:30 In an effort to teach  these ones about the Bible,
40:33 Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged  in a special public witnessing campaign.
40:39 To reach as many people as possible,  we set up 268 carts,
40:44 not only where the games were held
40:46 but also throughout the city  of Rio de Janeiro.
40:49 That way, we were able to reach people
40:51 from even faraway islands like Vanuatu,
40:54 which is one of the islands of the Pacific.
40:57 Delegates from that island picked up  publications from our witnessing carts.
41:10 We made efforts to put the stands and carts
41:12 as close as possible to the places  where the brothers would work.
41:16 Thanks to Jehovah, we were able  to get a strategic location near the entrance
41:20 to the arenas,  which we didn’t think would be possible.
41:27 We planned to have 1,500 volunteers,
41:30 but we got 4,000 volunteers.
41:33 We asked for help from other cities,
41:35 other states, and also  from foreign-language congregations.
41:39 So for us,  this was beyond our expectations.
41:45 During the Olympics,  more than one million people
41:47 passed through the harbor here.
41:49 And thanks to Jehovah,  we were able to set up
41:52 more than 40 carts  in the immediate harbor area
41:55 and placed almost
20,000 pieces of literature.
41:58 To refill the carts, we used a quadricycle
42:00 that picked up the publications  at the support hub
42:03 and took them to the brothers  at the carts.
42:09 The media provided extensive coverage
42:11 with more than 26,000  press professionals involved,
42:14 and security was also reinforced
42:16 with more than 22,000 military personnel.
42:19 The work of our brothers  certainly did not go unnoticed.
42:27 We were at the cart  when suddenly a police car
42:30 full of officers stopped in front of us.
42:32 I was worried they were going  to ask us questions or make us leave.
42:35 But then they got out of the car  and came towards us.
42:39 And one of them  picked up the Bible Teach book,
42:41 and without saying anything to us,  he told the others:
42:44 “Didn’t I tell you  I was going to find them here?
42:47 “You can take these publications;  they’re free.
42:50 These books will teach you  amazing things!”
43:00 This campaign helped  to overcome prejudices,
43:03 both with the authorities  and people in general,
43:06 because they were able to see  the international scope of our work.
43:09 And this became especially clear  when it came to the officials
43:12 because they allowed  the brothers to put the carts
43:15 as close as possible to the arenas
43:16 where the games were being held.
43:20 In all, more than 85,000 publications
43:24 in more than ten languages  were distributed by means of the 268 carts
43:29 scattered throughout the city.
43:31 Over a year of planning  went into preparing for this event,
43:34 and it produced excellent results.
43:37 Our international preaching work  was made known
43:39 to thousands present at the Olympic Games,
43:41 and most important,
43:43 it gave a great shout of praise  to our God, Jehovah.
43:56 We wanted to share a portrayal of life
43:58 as a Witness back in the early 1900’s.
44:01 This unique dramatization
44:04 about the endurance needed  as a Kingdom proclaimer
44:07 was previously shown to delegates  at some international conventions
44:11 held in one city in 2014.
44:14 This is a gift video that we received.
44:16 The title is  Knock! Knock!
50:30 Where are the dead?
50:32 Would you wish that question  answered according to man’s theory
50:36 or to have the answer  as pointed out in the Bible?
50:38 You will say that man’s answer  would be only a guess.
50:42 And yet there is no truth  more clearly taught in the Bible
50:46 than that of the resurrection of the dead.
50:49 If the dead are to live again,
50:52 then they must be resurrected,
50:54 and God has provided  that there shall be a resurrection.
50:57 The resurrection of Jesus Christ  is a guarantee
51:01 that all who have died  must be awakened out of death
51:04 and given a knowledge of the truth.
51:08 All mankind were born in sin,
51:11 and the death of the perfect man Jesus
51:13 provided the purchase price  for the right of man to live again,
51:16 and in due time Jesus  will awaken them out of death.
51:20 All of the dead in God’s due time  shall be awakened out of death.
51:26 “And God shall wipe away  all tears from their eyes;
51:28 “and there shall be no more death,
51:30 “neither sorrow, nor crying,  neither shall there be any more pain:
51:33 for the former things are passed away.”
51:37 The resurrection  will bring boundless joy to those
51:41 who obey God under Christ’s Kingdom.
51:43 The obedient ones on earth  during the reign of Christ
51:47 will be given everlasting life on the earth  in complete happiness and joy.
51:53 Jehovah’s way is always right and true.
51:56 Learn that way and live.
52:04 The word “resurrection”  means “a standing up again” to life.
52:08 If, as claimed by the clergy,
52:10 the dead are alive in purgatory  or some other place,
52:13 then it follows  that there could be no resurrection;
52:16 and yet there is no truth more clearly taught  in the Bible than that of the . . .
53:05 The brother was blessed  for his perseverance in the ministry.
53:09 His attitude showed  that he felt the urgency of the message.
53:13 As God’s people,  we do not procrastinate.
53:17 Instead, we are prompt;  we are punctual!
53:21 Yes, being punctual is a godly quality.
53:25 We would like to conclude  the broadcast with greetings
53:28 from Uganda
53:30 —specifically the town of Fort Portal,  in western Uganda.
53:35 The 120 publishers there preach  to almost 60,000 people
53:39 who live in Fort Portal.
53:41 They conduct  approximately 300 Bible studies.
53:46 There are two congregations —one English and one Rutoro—
53:51 and also two rural groups
53:53 some 60 kilometers,  or approximately 37 miles, away.
53:58 Brothers are taking turns  visiting the two groups
54:01 and supporting them  in the field ministry.
54:05 In the past,  the main challenge
54:07 was the lack of literature  in the Rutoro language.
54:10 However,  thanks to increased translation efforts,
54:13 the number of publishers  has increased dramatically.
54:17 As a result, a Rutoro congregation  was formed in 2014.
54:22 Next, a remote translation office  was established in 2015.
54:27 And as of February of this year,
54:29 the publishers receive the study edition  of The Watchtower in Rutoro.
54:35 We love our brothers and sisters  in Fort Portal very much.
54:39 And they send their love  to all of God’s people worldwide.
54:44 This is JW Broadcasting
54:46 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

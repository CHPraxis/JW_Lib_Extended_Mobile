00:01.583 --> 00:03.586
Greetings! 


00:03.587 --> 00:06.790
We’re so happy you could join us 
for this broadcast. 


00:06.790 --> 00:10.127
And I’m very happy 
because my cohost this month 


00:10.127 --> 00:14.130
is a good friend of mine 
and a fellow worker, Brother Jim Mantz. 


00:14.130 --> 00:17.300
Now, Jim and I work together 
in the Writing Department, 


00:17.300 --> 00:20.237
and Jim helps the Writing Department
—Jim and his team. 


00:20.237 --> 00:22.239
They help the Writing Department 


00:22.238 --> 00:25.241
to keep track of all the projects 
that we have to work on. 


00:25.242 --> 00:28.110
And do you have any idea how many that is? 


00:28.110 --> 00:31.948
Two hundred and forty-one at any given time. 


00:31.948 --> 00:35.118
And Jim does a lot of other things as well. 


00:35.118 --> 00:38.220
Well, Jim, 
we’ve got another project on hand this month, 


00:38.220 --> 00:40.757
and that’s to get this broadcast under way. 


00:40.757 --> 00:45.629
So why don’t you tell the folks at home 
just what they have to look forward to?


00:45.628 --> 00:49.365
Well, David, this month 
we’ll get acquainted with a family 


00:49.365 --> 00:53.000
that raised their children 
to put Jehovah first in their lives. 


00:54.070 --> 00:57.000
Let’s look for points 
we can apply in our families. 


00:58.273 --> 01:00.610
Later, our music video 
will emphasize the need 


01:00.610 --> 01:05.715
to take the time to marvel 
at Jehovah’s creation. 


01:05.715 --> 01:09.085
And we’ll visit 
the Writing Research Department. 


01:09.085 --> 01:11.087
The brothers and sisters there 


01:11.087 --> 01:14.224
help us to ensure that all our articles 


01:14.223 --> 01:16.525
and videos are accurate.


01:16.525 --> 01:18.695
You’re going to enjoy this program, 


01:18.695 --> 01:22.465
and this is the November 2017 program 


01:22.465 --> 01:25.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:42.852 --> 01:45.789
This month I’d like to talk about the efforts 


01:45.788 --> 01:47.790
Jehovah’s organization is making 


01:47.790 --> 01:51.193
to produce literature, publications, 


01:51.193 --> 01:55.365
articles that are as accurate as possible. 


01:55.365 --> 02:00.370
We’re going to talk about accuracy
—accuracy of statement. 


02:00.370 --> 02:06.008
Now, first, what’s the responsibility 
of the writer of the article? 


02:06.008 --> 02:09.045
When a writer submits 
an article for publication, 


02:09.045 --> 02:13.717
he is expected to supply references 
from reputable sources 


02:13.717 --> 02:16.485
to back up the facts 
that he’s included in his article. 


02:16.485 --> 02:19.255
And our Research Department 
will use those references 


02:19.255 --> 02:22.192
to check the accuracy of everything.


02:22.192 --> 02:25.595
Reliable, respected sources. 


02:25.595 --> 02:29.032
What do we mean by a reliable source? 


02:29.032 --> 02:32.335
Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias, 


02:32.335 --> 02:37.340
books, magazines, and then newspapers


02:37.340 --> 02:39.475
—basically in that order. 


02:39.475 --> 02:42.745
We prefer encyclopedias over books, 


02:42.745 --> 02:45.348
books over magazines, 


02:45.348 --> 02:47.383
and magazines over newspapers


02:47.383 --> 02:50.953
—generally because newspaper editors 
have a hard time checking their facts. 


02:50.953 --> 02:54.890
They have a very limited time 
in which to check their facts. 


02:54.890 --> 02:58.695
Even encyclopedias and books get updated, 


02:58.695 --> 03:02.098
so we have to go 
with the latest edition of those. 


03:02.098 --> 03:06.101
We have to make sure 
that our sources are reliable.


03:06.102 --> 03:09.172
Now, when a writer quotes an expert, 


03:09.172 --> 03:12.775
our researchers will ask: 
“Who’s this expert? 


03:12.775 --> 03:14.777
“What’s his reputation? 


03:14.777 --> 03:17.980
“Is he working for a particular organization? 


03:17.980 --> 03:21.217
“Does this organization have an agenda? 


03:21.217 --> 03:23.419
Is it a special-interest group?” 


03:23.418 --> 03:27.490
If we find that the goals 
of the organization are questionable, 


03:27.490 --> 03:32.000
we won’t use the quote
—even if it’s a really good quote.


03:33.062 --> 03:37.167
Now, suppose that a writer 
wants to quote something from a book. 


03:37.167 --> 03:39.202
In the reference material, 


03:39.202 --> 03:42.405
he’ll supply a photocopy 
of the quote in the book, 


03:42.405 --> 03:46.408
but very often he’ll give us 
two or three pages before the quote 


03:46.408 --> 03:49.311
and two or three pages after as well. 


03:49.312 --> 03:52.515
And that way, 
our researchers can examine the quote 


03:52.515 --> 03:56.618
in context to make sure 
that what we’re saying in print 


03:56.618 --> 04:00.323
is really what the author 
of the quote had in mind.


04:00.323 --> 04:03.626
For example, 
an evolutionist might make a statement 


04:03.627 --> 04:05.629
which on the surface 


04:05.628 --> 04:09.298
appears to confirm his support of creation. 


04:09.298 --> 04:11.566
Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement 


04:11.567 --> 04:15.070
that seems to indicate 
that he believes in God. 


04:15.070 --> 04:17.473
But when you examine 
the quote in context, 


04:17.473 --> 04:21.443
you realize that that isn’t what 
the author had in mind at all. 


04:21.443 --> 04:25.715
We would never 
deliberately distort a quotation. 


04:25.715 --> 04:30.000
We try very hard to use all 
of our quotations in context.


04:31.520 --> 04:35.190
Now, it’s important to keep up 
with the very latest research. 


04:35.190 --> 04:39.828
Something that was stated years ago 
as a fact may have been disproved. 


04:39.828 --> 04:41.863
And the reason why is obvious. 


04:41.863 --> 04:44.033
Someone may spend his entire life 


04:44.033 --> 04:47.870
researching a very limited point in history


04:47.870 --> 04:49.872
—a very small point in history—


04:49.872 --> 04:52.075
and, of course, 
if he spends so much time researching, 


04:52.075 --> 04:54.077
he’s going to uncover things. 


04:54.077 --> 04:56.579
And so it’s not surprising 
that from time to time 


04:56.578 --> 05:00.716
we have to adjust our view 
of some historical points. 


05:00.717 --> 05:03.219
We have to check, check, check. 


05:03.218 --> 05:07.490
And later on in this discussion, 
we’re going to consider some examples of it. 


05:07.490 --> 05:10.192
It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!


05:10.192 --> 05:14.464
Now, someone might ask, 
‘Why is it necessary to be so picky, 


05:14.463 --> 05:18.200
to be so fussy, about accuracy?’ 


05:18.200 --> 05:21.437
And in answer, 
I’d like to give an experience 


05:21.437 --> 05:23.605
that I heard about a few years ago. 


05:23.605 --> 05:25.775
In Northern Europe, 
there was a man 


05:25.775 --> 05:28.845
who accepted a Bible study 
from Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


05:28.845 --> 05:30.847
And when he was asked 


05:30.847 --> 05:33.649
what motivated him 
to want to study, he said: 


05:33.648 --> 05:37.320
“I read an article 
in your Awake! magazine on trees. 


05:37.320 --> 05:40.557
“Now, I happen to be 
a bit of an expert on trees. 


05:40.557 --> 05:43.827
“And after I read the article, 
I said to myself: 


05:43.827 --> 05:47.097
“‘That article was so well-documented. 


05:47.097 --> 05:49.199
“‘It was so precise. 


05:49.198 --> 05:53.401
“‘Any organization that is that careful 
when writing about trees 


05:53.402 --> 05:56.905
is going to be just as careful 
when teaching me the Bible.’” 


05:56.905 --> 06:00.000
And on that basis, 
he accepted a Bible study.


06:02.010 --> 06:05.280
Now, an area where great care 
needs to be taken 


06:05.280 --> 06:07.650
is when we’re quoting statistics. 


06:07.650 --> 06:10.987
A newspaper may report on a disaster 
in a certain country 


06:10.987 --> 06:15.759
and say that 10,000 people 
were killed in the disaster. 


06:15.758 --> 06:18.693
Immediately, 
our researchers are going to ask, 


06:18.693 --> 06:21.130
“Where did they get that statistic?” 


06:21.130 --> 06:24.167
They might phone the newspaper 
and ask for the source. 


06:24.167 --> 06:27.170
And if the reporter 
can’t confirm the statistic, 


06:27.170 --> 06:30.172
our researchers will go to another source


06:30.172 --> 06:34.977
—a more official source—
to get the correct statistic.


06:34.977 --> 06:38.882
Care is also taken 
when quoting personalities of the past. 


06:38.882 --> 06:43.787
Now, suppose we want to quote 
something that Napoleon Bonaparte said


06:43.787 --> 06:45.789
—the French general. 


06:45.788 --> 06:49.458
Well, being French, 
Napoleon spoke French. 


06:49.458 --> 06:51.460
So if we’re quoting it in English, 


06:51.460 --> 06:56.132
that means that somebody translated 
the quote from French into English. 


06:56.132 --> 06:59.935
But did they translate the quote correctly? 


06:59.935 --> 07:04.140
Our researchers will probably go 
to the target language 


07:04.140 --> 07:08.677
and research the quote 
in French or in another language. 


07:08.677 --> 07:13.649
And more often than not, 
they find that what is presented in English 


07:13.648 --> 07:18.000
doesn’t accurately represent 
what the individual said at all.


07:19.188 --> 07:22.825
Now, as we age, 
our memory can play tricks on us. 


07:22.825 --> 07:25.000
And our researchers are aware of that. 


07:26.295 --> 07:29.132
Suppose that an elderly brother 
writes in his life story 


07:29.132 --> 07:33.904
that he was baptized 
at a circuit assembly on a certain date. 


07:33.903 --> 07:36.771
Our researchers may look at the date. 


07:36.772 --> 07:38.774
They may check the date, 


07:38.773 --> 07:43.011
and suppose they find that the date 
the brother gave fell on a Tuesday. 


07:43.012 --> 07:47.550
Now, what are the chances that there was 
a circuit assembly on a Tuesday? 


07:47.550 --> 07:50.285
There may have been, 
but they’re going to check. 


07:50.285 --> 07:53.288
Is the brother’s memory failing him? 


07:53.288 --> 07:55.323
If they can’t confirm the date, 


07:55.323 --> 07:57.560
they may ask someone to help the brother 


07:57.560 --> 08:00.730
to remember the date 
more correctly, more accurately. 


08:00.730 --> 08:04.667
Perhaps someone was baptized 
at the same circuit assembly as he was, 


08:04.667 --> 08:08.000
and perhaps that person 
has an accurate note of the date.


08:09.605 --> 08:12.508
Our translators also go to great lengths 


08:12.508 --> 08:16.945
to present accurate information 
to the brothers and sisters. 


08:16.945 --> 08:19.748
Some time ago, 
the Awake! magazine published an article 


08:19.748 --> 08:23.151
on a very rare species of butterfly. 


08:23.152 --> 08:25.922
Now, with all animals and insects, 


08:25.922 --> 08:28.190
we provide our translators 


08:28.190 --> 08:31.293
with the Latin name 
of the animal or the insect. 


08:31.293 --> 08:33.661
And so our translators had the Latin name. 


08:33.662 --> 08:35.665
But in one large country, 


08:35.665 --> 08:38.600
they were unable to find 
the name in the vernacular. 


08:38.600 --> 08:40.603
So, what did they do? 


08:40.603 --> 08:43.838
They phoned the country’s leading university, 


08:43.838 --> 08:46.841
and they were transferred 
to the Biology Department, 


08:46.842 --> 08:48.912
and there an expert gave them 


08:48.912 --> 08:52.782
the name in the vernacular 
of that particular butterfly. 


08:52.782 --> 08:56.085
But then he said: 
“Why is it that you’re worrying so much 


08:56.085 --> 08:58.320
“about the correct name of this butterfly? 


08:58.320 --> 09:00.790
“If you got it wrong, 
there are only two of us 


09:00.790 --> 09:03.692
in the whole country 
who would’ve known the difference.” 


09:03.692 --> 09:08.000
Well, that opened the way 
to give a witness to this expert.


09:09.132 --> 09:11.134
Well, now, how well would you do 


09:11.133 --> 09:13.801
in spotting a statement that is slightly off 


09:13.802 --> 09:16.072
and making it more accurate? 


09:16.072 --> 09:18.074
Would you like to find out? 


09:18.073 --> 09:20.576
Of course you would! 
It’ll be fun. 


09:20.577 --> 09:22.779
So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call 


09:22.778 --> 09:24.880
You Be the Editor. 


09:24.880 --> 09:27.817
We’re going to put 
a number of statements on the screen, 


09:27.817 --> 09:30.452
and there’s a problem 
with each one of them. 


09:30.452 --> 09:33.455
Now your job 
is to figure out what’s wrong, 


09:33.455 --> 09:37.460
why it is wrong, 
and then suggest how to fix it. 


09:37.460 --> 09:39.462
It’s going to be fun.


09:39.462 --> 09:41.464
Here’s the first statement: 


09:41.463 --> 09:45.533
“According 
to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia, 


09:45.533 --> 09:47.570
“the Egyptian Sphinx 


09:47.570 --> 09:51.940
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 


09:51.940 --> 09:54.577
“The Egyptian Sphinx 


09:54.577 --> 09:58.914
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 


09:58.913 --> 10:00.950
Well, the problem 


10:00.950 --> 10:03.418
is with the date 2550 B.C.E. 


10:03.418 --> 10:05.420
The global Flood occurred 


10:05.420 --> 10:08.323
about 200 years after that date. 


10:08.323 --> 10:12.761
So, what are the chances 
that the Sphinx survived the Flood? 


10:12.762 --> 10:16.765
Unless, of course, you think 
that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose. 


10:16.765 --> 10:19.868
Now, these dates 
are good for you school children 


10:19.868 --> 10:21.970
to keep in mind 
when you’re writing reports. 


10:21.970 --> 10:24.540
Sometimes you copy something 
from an encyclopedia, 


10:24.540 --> 10:26.542
and it gives a certain date. 


10:26.542 --> 10:29.879
But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,


10:29.878 --> 10:34.000
so that what you put in your report 
is as accurate as possible.


10:36.318 --> 10:38.953
Now let’s go on to the next one: 


10:38.953 --> 10:40.956
“In 29 C.E., 


10:40.957 --> 10:44.527
“Jesus was baptized by a close relative, 


10:44.527 --> 10:47.000
John the Baptizer.” 


10:48.130 --> 10:50.667
Well, 29 C.E., that looks right. 


10:50.667 --> 10:52.669
And we know that Jesus 


10:52.668 --> 10:54.836
was baptized by John; that’s right. 


10:54.837 --> 10:56.872
So the problem must be 


10:56.872 --> 10:59.975
“close relative,” and it is. 


10:59.975 --> 11:02.345
Now, both of Jesus’ parents 


11:02.345 --> 11:07.048
were of the tribe of Judah, 
and their parents were of the tribe of Judah. 


11:07.048 --> 11:10.720
But, what about John’s parents, 
Zechariah and Elizabeth? 


11:10.720 --> 11:12.922
They were both of the tribe of Levi. 


11:12.922 --> 11:15.590
So Elizabeth and Mary 
couldn’t have been sisters. 


11:15.590 --> 11:17.627
Could they have been cousins? 


11:17.627 --> 11:18.727
Maybe. 


11:18.727 --> 11:20.730
We can’t even confirm that. 


11:20.730 --> 11:24.900
And if they were, that would make 
Jesus and John second cousins. 


11:24.900 --> 11:28.170
Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”? 


11:28.170 --> 11:30.740
Some would say yes; 
some would say no. 


11:30.740 --> 11:33.308
So it’s safer just to say, 


11:33.308 --> 11:37.613
“In 29 C.E., 
Jesus was baptized by a relative, 


11:37.613 --> 11:40.315
John the Baptizer.”


11:40.315 --> 11:41.417
Here’s one. 


11:41.417 --> 11:44.187
Let’s see if you can spot 
the error in this one: 


11:44.187 --> 11:46.189
“While most of the early Christians 


11:46.188 --> 11:48.956
“were held in little esteem in the community, 


11:48.957 --> 11:52.360
“a few enjoyed an elevated social status. 


11:52.360 --> 11:57.900
For example, Luke was a respected physician.” 


11:57.900 --> 11:59.568
Well, the word we need 


11:59.568 --> 12:02.270
to look at is “respected.” 


12:02.270 --> 12:05.007
We respect our doctors today, 


12:05.007 --> 12:08.410
and our doctors have 
a very, very fine education. 


12:08.410 --> 12:11.247
But was that the case in the first century? 


12:11.247 --> 12:15.717
A reference work says this 
about first-century physicians: 


12:15.717 --> 12:19.222
“Many doctors were freed Greek slaves, 


12:19.222 --> 12:23.725
“hence the social standing 
of doctors was quite low. 


12:23.725 --> 12:26.628
“Because recovery rates were so low, 


12:26.628 --> 12:30.398
many people were skeptical 
or even scornful of doctors.” 


12:30.398 --> 12:33.268
Note this statement from the first century: 


12:33.268 --> 12:36.871
“Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor; 


12:36.872 --> 12:39.709
“now he is an undertaker. 


12:39.708 --> 12:41.976
“He is still doing as an undertaker, 


12:41.977 --> 12:44.980
what he used to do as a doctor.” 


12:44.980 --> 12:46.982
Not very flattering, is it? 


12:46.982 --> 12:51.220
Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use 
a different example.


12:51.220 --> 12:52.755
Here’s one: 


12:52.755 --> 12:55.825
“In 325 C.E., 


12:55.825 --> 12:57.827
“the Roman Emperor Constantine 


12:57.827 --> 12:59.862
“established Christianity 


12:59.862 --> 13:01.864
“as the official religion 


13:01.863 --> 13:04.833
of the Roman Empire.” 


13:04.833 --> 13:08.170
Well, 325 C.E., that looks right. 


13:08.170 --> 13:11.173
And Constantine, that looks right. 


13:11.173 --> 13:13.541
But look at the word “official”


13:13.542 --> 13:16.745
—“official religion.” 


13:16.745 --> 13:19.782
Constantine never established Christianity 


13:19.782 --> 13:23.052
as the official religion 
of the Roman Empire. 


13:23.052 --> 13:26.822
In 313 B.C.E., 
he did make it legal to be a Christian, 


13:26.822 --> 13:29.725
but paganism was still 
one of the official religions. 


13:29.725 --> 13:33.695
Apostate Christianity 
didn’t become the official religion 


13:33.695 --> 13:36.998
until 391 C.E.


13:36.998 --> 13:39.000
This one is tricky. 


13:39.000 --> 13:41.370
See how you do with this one: 


13:41.370 --> 13:43.372
“Imagine the apostle Paul 


13:43.372 --> 13:46.175
“during his first imprisonment in Rome, 


13:46.175 --> 13:48.443
“writing his letter to the Colossians 


13:48.443 --> 13:51.000
from a dark prison cell.” 


13:52.113 --> 13:54.416
Well, if you look in the back 
of the New World Translation, 


13:54.417 --> 13:58.087
you’ll find that Paul did write his letter 
to the Colossians while in Rome, 


13:58.087 --> 14:01.690
and he was imprisoned at the time. 


14:01.690 --> 14:04.058
So, what’s the problem? 


14:04.058 --> 14:06.361
“Dark prison cell.” 


14:06.362 --> 14:09.199
Where was Paul 
during his first imprisonment? 


14:09.198 --> 14:11.833
In his own rented house. 


14:11.833 --> 14:14.101
So the statement “dark prison cell,” 


14:14.102 --> 14:18.207
it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.


14:18.207 --> 14:20.775
Here’s an old one: 


14:20.775 --> 14:22.778
“While Paul generally preached 


14:22.778 --> 14:24.780
“to people of the nations, 


14:24.780 --> 14:26.848
“Peter was sent to the Jews. 


14:26.848 --> 14:29.418
“Contrary to popular belief, 


14:29.418 --> 14:32.320
Peter was never in Rome.” 


14:32.320 --> 14:34.990
Some scholars used to make that statement, 


14:34.990 --> 14:37.158
and they made it 60 years ago: 


14:37.158 --> 14:40.061
“Peter was never in Rome.” 


14:40.062 --> 14:42.064
But can we really say that? 


14:42.063 --> 14:44.266
Can we be that dogmatic? 


14:44.267 --> 14:46.835
Can we say that he didn’t even spend 


14:46.835 --> 14:49.137
vacation time or have a short visit in Rome? 


14:49.137 --> 14:51.174
No, we cannot. 


14:51.173 --> 14:53.241
So it would be more accurate to state: 


14:53.242 --> 14:58.580
“There is no record 
that Peter ever lived in Rome.”


14:58.580 --> 15:00.382
Here’s one: 


15:00.382 --> 15:03.085
“We can have confidence in the Bible


15:03.085 --> 15:06.588
—it is mankind’s oldest book.” 


15:06.588 --> 15:10.425
“Mankind’s oldest book.” 


15:10.425 --> 15:13.195
Years ago, some scholars believed 


15:13.195 --> 15:16.832
that texts written 
by Adam, Noah, and others 


15:16.832 --> 15:19.302
survived the Flood 
and became part of the Bible. 


15:19.302 --> 15:21.304
And if that were true, 


15:21.303 --> 15:25.941
then we could say that the Bible 
is mankind’s oldest book. 


15:25.942 --> 15:28.177
Now, here’s a quote 
from Insight on the Scriptures, 


15:28.177 --> 15:30.212
our Bible encyclopedia. 


15:30.212 --> 15:34.517
It says: 
“There is no way to establish definitely 


15:34.517 --> 15:37.319
“that some of the histories 
mentioned in the book of Genesis 


15:37.318 --> 15:40.588
were committed to writing 
before the Flood.” 


15:40.588 --> 15:44.860
So, today we might call the Bible 
one of mankind’s oldest books 


15:44.860 --> 15:48.363
or the world’s oldest modern book, 


15:48.363 --> 15:50.898
as we do in one of our videos.


15:50.898 --> 15:53.001
Here’s the last one: 


15:53.002 --> 15:55.204
“In 1517, 


15:55.203 --> 15:58.640
“Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses 


15:58.640 --> 16:02.000
on the door of a church 
in Wittenberg, Germany.” 


16:03.678 --> 16:05.846
Well, we’ve highlighted “95,” 


16:05.847 --> 16:08.784
but there are questions 
about the entire statement. 


16:08.783 --> 16:11.420
Some modern scholars have done 


16:11.420 --> 16:14.423
a tremendous, exhaustive study 
of the life of Martin Luther, 


16:14.423 --> 16:17.125
and they claim 
that he couldn’t have compiled 


16:17.125 --> 16:21.797
all 95 of his theses by 1517. 


16:21.797 --> 16:25.567
Others go so far as to claim 
that it never happened


16:25.567 --> 16:29.472
—that he never did nail his theses 
on the door of the church. 


16:29.472 --> 16:32.875
Still others are just as adamant 
that it’s all true


16:32.875 --> 16:34.910
—that it all happened. 


16:34.910 --> 16:37.178
So there’s no consensus. 


16:37.178 --> 16:39.648
We would have to modify the statement


16:39.648 --> 16:42.516
—“some believe” or “it is believed”—


16:42.517 --> 16:44.520
in order to make it more accurate 


16:44.520 --> 16:48.000
and to acknowledge the fact 
that there are differences of opinion.


16:49.825 --> 16:52.728
Well, how did you do on the quiz? 


16:52.728 --> 16:57.465
If you’re like me, you’ve probably made 
some of those statements yourself at times. 


16:57.465 --> 17:01.303
The statements were based 
on the best research we had at the time. 


17:01.303 --> 17:04.740
But this is to illustrate 
the fact that times change; 


17:04.740 --> 17:07.743
research facilities improve. 


17:07.743 --> 17:12.413
A scholar does exhaustive research 
on one point of history, 


17:12.413 --> 17:15.716
and he uncovers things 
that were previously unknown. 


17:15.717 --> 17:17.720
So we have to keep up. 


17:17.720 --> 17:20.188
We have to check, check, check. 


17:20.188 --> 17:24.325
And when credible research 
reveals that we have to adjust 


17:24.325 --> 17:26.962
or tweak a statement 
that we made in the past, 


17:26.962 --> 17:29.499
we do so without hesitation. 


17:29.498 --> 17:34.503
Our goal is to provide information 
that is as accurate as possible 


17:34.503 --> 17:37.840
because we know that you 
brothers and sisters use this information. 


17:37.840 --> 17:39.842
You quote it in the field ministry. 


17:39.842 --> 17:41.910
You use it in your public talks. 


17:41.910 --> 17:44.447
So we want to make sure 
that our brothers are fed 


17:44.447 --> 17:48.584
with the most accurate 
spiritual food possible.


17:48.583 --> 17:52.286
We’re imperfect, of course, 
and we are going to make mistakes. 


17:52.287 --> 17:55.057
And when we do, 
we have to correct them. 


17:55.057 --> 18:00.000
Our goal is to do the best we can 
in all our imperfection.


18:01.297 --> 18:03.632
Well, how does it make you feel? 


18:03.632 --> 18:06.135
I know how it makes me feel. 


18:06.135 --> 18:11.140
I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization 
takes accuracy so seriously. 


18:11.140 --> 18:13.342
It gives me confidence. 


18:13.342 --> 18:17.212
And, you know, I’m reminded 
of the description of another researcher, 


18:17.212 --> 18:23.752
as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10. 


18:23.752 --> 18:25.754
You know who this is. 


18:25.753 --> 18:30.191
Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10: 


18:30.192 --> 18:33.829
“Not only had the congregator become wise 


18:33.828 --> 18:37.698
“but he continually taught 
the people what he knew, 


18:37.698 --> 18:40.035
“and he pondered 


18:40.035 --> 18:43.372
“and made a thorough search 


18:43.372 --> 18:46.342
“in order to compile many proverbs. 


18:46.342 --> 18:49.210
“The congregator sought 
to find delightful words 


18:49.210 --> 18:54.883
and to record accurate words of truth.”


18:54.883 --> 18:59.086
Now, let’s give our attention 
to my good friend Jim. 


18:59.087 --> 19:02.157
And I think Jim is ready 
to take us on a field trip 


19:02.157 --> 19:04.627
so we can meet 
some of the researchers at Bethel.


19:04.627 --> 19:05.627
Thank you, David. 


19:05.627 --> 19:09.965
And, yes, our researchers take very seriously 


19:09.965 --> 19:11.967
their task of maintaining 


19:11.967 --> 19:14.000
a high standard of accuracy.


19:17.940 --> 19:22.143
In today’s media, 
much of what’s presented as fact 


19:22.143 --> 19:26.000
is often colored by emotion 
and personal opinion.


19:30.452 --> 19:32.855
Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, 


19:32.855 --> 19:35.657
remain committed 
to defending God’s Word, 


19:35.657 --> 19:38.327
the Bible, as the standard for truth.


19:38.327 --> 19:41.029
As Jesus said at John 17:17: 


19:41.028 --> 19:43.000
“Your word is truth.”


19:44.165 --> 19:46.167
The wide-ranging subject matter 


19:46.167 --> 19:49.137
contained in the publications 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


19:49.137 --> 19:53.042
is painstakingly researched 
by their Writing Research Department. 


19:53.042 --> 19:56.645
Their research methods are modeled 
after that of Bible historians 


19:56.645 --> 19:59.380
such as Luke and Jeremiah


19:59.380 --> 20:02.000
—reliance on reputable first-hand sources.


20:05.287 --> 20:07.022
We’re not looking just for someone’s opinions 


20:07.022 --> 20:08.690
or what someone believes about a topic.


20:08.690 --> 20:10.692
If the material is socially 


20:10.692 --> 20:12.827
or politically biased, for example, 


20:12.827 --> 20:14.697
we can’t rely on it. 


20:14.697 --> 20:16.299
We look for objective material.


20:16.298 --> 20:18.166
We cover everything 


20:18.167 --> 20:21.704
from historical, scientific, geographical 


20:21.703 --> 20:24.205
to flora, fauna, space.


20:24.205 --> 20:26.207
So before the script is even written, 


20:26.207 --> 20:29.477
we’ll provide a research package,


20:29.477 --> 20:31.780
and we’ll follow
the project until final delivery


20:31.780 --> 20:33.815
to make sure
that everything that is said


20:33.815 --> 20:35.783
and everything that is shown


20:35.783 --> 20:37.285
is solidly based on fact


20:37.285 --> 20:38.553
and is well-researched.


20:38.553 --> 20:41.221
There’s a lot more research than what 


20:41.222 --> 20:44.092
the viewer 
or the reader will ever see.


20:44.092 --> 20:46.362
You have a one-page article on the otter; 


20:46.362 --> 20:48.230
you end up with like 12 references 


20:48.230 --> 20:50.865
to back up every statement that’s made.


20:50.865 --> 20:52.033
It seems very simple, 


20:52.033 --> 20:53.601
the height of Mont Blanc. 


20:53.602 --> 20:55.404
And with the height of Mont Blanc, 


20:55.403 --> 20:59.306
we found out, number one, 
that it was 4,807 meters; 


20:59.307 --> 21:02.410
then we found another source
—4,810 meters; 


21:02.410 --> 21:05.913
let’s check a third one
—4,808 meters. 


21:05.913 --> 21:06.915
So, what is now real? 


21:06.915 --> 21:09.117
In that case, we had to consult 


21:09.117 --> 21:14.422
the French National Institute 
of Geographic and Forest Information.


21:14.422 --> 21:16.224
One of our main research tools 


21:16.223 --> 21:18.426
is our own library system. 


21:18.427 --> 21:23.000
We have about 65,000 books 
and other research materials.


21:24.132 --> 21:27.102
If we’re researching something 
about ancient history 


21:27.102 --> 21:29.570
or archaeology, 


21:29.570 --> 21:32.000
we may consult 
a specialized encyclopedia, 


21:33.342 --> 21:36.912
like an encyclopedia 
of archaeological discoveries, for example.


21:36.912 --> 21:39.782
Museum websites usually have pictures 


21:39.782 --> 21:41.484
of what they have in the museum. 


21:41.483 --> 21:44.251
And we can find these visuals and then send 
those off to production teams 


21:44.252 --> 21:46.789
as well and say, 
“This is a good example 


21:46.788 --> 21:48.323
of a first-century lamp.”


21:48.323 --> 21:50.658
Things that you think are true 


21:50.658 --> 21:53.195
because they are “commonly known” 


21:53.195 --> 21:56.465
may not actually be totally accurate.


21:56.465 --> 21:58.667
Quotes need to be verified. 


21:58.667 --> 22:02.204
We want to go to the first-hand source, 


22:02.203 --> 22:04.205
the original source, for that quote. 


22:04.205 --> 22:05.507
That’s one thing. 


22:05.507 --> 22:09.812
And secondly, context matters; 
we want to quote things properly.


22:09.812 --> 22:14.149
When Gandhi and Lord Irwin came together, 


22:14.148 --> 22:17.285
Gandhi said, ‘When your country 
and mine come together


22:17.285 --> 22:20.188
‘on the teachings of Christ 
and on the Sermon on the Mount, 


22:20.188 --> 22:23.958
then we will have solved the problems 
of our countries and the world.’ 


22:23.958 --> 22:25.560
So we researched it. 


22:25.560 --> 22:28.363
No one could confirm 
that those two men ever met. 


22:28.363 --> 22:30.331
So it’s a great quote. 


22:30.332 --> 22:32.700
Now, it doesn’t mean 
that he didn’t refer to Jesus 


22:32.700 --> 22:36.103
or even the Sermon on the Mount, 
but that particular one, we couldn’t use.


22:36.103 --> 22:38.706
So the research work we’re doing, 


22:38.707 --> 22:42.210
sometimes it takes a lot of time, 
a lot of effort. 


22:42.210 --> 22:47.048
Sometimes we don’t find 
what we are expecting to find. 


22:47.048 --> 22:51.118
But it’s very gratifying 
because we’re helping produce 


22:51.118 --> 22:54.655
accurate information 
that our readers can rely on. 


22:54.655 --> 22:58.493
Reliable information will help us 
make good informed decisions.


22:58.493 --> 23:01.195
Anyone who reads our journals 
and who sees our videos 


23:01.195 --> 23:05.433
can be confident that this 
was thoroughly researched. 


23:05.433 --> 23:07.901
These are facts; this is the truth.


23:07.902 --> 23:10.439
So when you consider 
the printed publications 


23:10.438 --> 23:11.873
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


23:11.873 --> 23:14.910
or peruse the jw.org website, 


23:14.910 --> 23:17.012
you can be confident that the material


23:17.012 --> 23:19.714
is carefully researched and accurate. 


23:19.713 --> 23:21.281
Why? 


23:21.282 --> 23:23.519
Because Jehovah’s Witnesses 


23:23.518 --> 23:26.588
are a people who love and respect 


23:26.588 --> 23:29.000
the truth.


23:31.993 --> 23:34.830
As Psalm 31:5 expresses, 


23:34.830 --> 23:38.933
we worship “Jehovah, the God of truth.” 


23:38.933 --> 23:42.836
So it would only make sense 
that we try to imitate him 


23:42.837 --> 23:45.074
to the best of our ability 


23:45.073 --> 23:49.576
by being truthful 
in all the materials that we publish. 


23:49.577 --> 23:52.414
He, no doubt, finds this very pleasing, 


23:52.413 --> 23:55.250
especially since throughout history, 


23:55.250 --> 23:58.687
many have tried to twist his teachings.


23:58.687 --> 24:03.425
Although the organization makes efforts 
to publish accurate information, 


24:03.425 --> 24:07.728
there are many things 
that we can do as individuals. 


24:07.728 --> 24:12.733
This dramatization highlights 
how our view of celebrations 


24:12.733 --> 24:15.000
can be pleasing to Jehovah.


24:25.847 --> 24:26.682
Hey, Buddy! 


24:26.682 --> 24:28.000
How was school?


24:31.787 --> 24:33.822
That’s my Dad, Grayson, 


24:33.822 --> 24:36.000
and my older brother, Dylan.


24:38.227 --> 24:39.060
Hey, Bro! 


24:39.060 --> 24:40.328
We’re going to play ball. 
You want to come?


24:40.328 --> 24:42.000
No thanks.


24:43.465 --> 24:45.100
Is he OK?


24:45.100 --> 24:47.602
He normally loves to talk about school. 


24:47.602 --> 24:50.000
He didn’t want to talk about school today.


24:52.373 --> 24:57.000
It wasn’t my worst day at school
—but pretty close. 


24:58.213 --> 25:02.416
It all started first thing this morning. 


25:02.417 --> 25:06.487
Everyone was signing a birthday card 
for one of our classmates, Lucas.


25:06.487 --> 25:08.324
Do you want to sign 
the birthday card for Lucas?


25:08.323 --> 25:11.158
He just got home from being 
at the hospital for cancer treatments.


25:11.158 --> 25:12.126
No thanks. 


25:12.127 --> 25:15.064
I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, 
and I don’t celebrate birthdays.


25:15.063 --> 25:15.930
What? 


25:15.930 --> 25:16.732
Hum? 


25:16.732 --> 25:17.499
That’s rude. 


25:17.498 --> 25:20.000
Come on, sign it!


25:21.570 --> 25:24.472
You guys, you guys, Aiden—


25:24.472 --> 25:29.177
My teacher said that Lucas 
may not come back to school for a long time. 


25:29.177 --> 25:32.000
I felt so bad he was sick.


25:40.288 --> 25:44.000
Aiden, Aiden, can you think about it?


25:49.697 --> 25:53.000
The thing is, I did want to sign the card. 


25:56.137 --> 26:00.975
Lucas was one of the nicest people 
in my class. 


26:00.975 --> 26:03.000
Maybe I can just sign it. 


26:04.778 --> 26:08.000
I mean, it’s not like I’m going
to a birthday party.


26:13.688 --> 26:16.000
Hey, little man. 
How are you doing?


26:17.158 --> 26:17.991
Yeah? 


26:17.992 --> 26:19.894
Mom said you had a rough day today.


26:19.893 --> 26:23.000
When Dad came in, 
I told him everything that happened. 


26:25.167 --> 26:29.939
I know from the Bible 
that it’s wrong to celebrate birthdays. 


26:29.938 --> 26:32.000
But is signing the card really a big deal? 


26:34.542 --> 26:37.000
Dad said my question was a good one. 


26:38.212 --> 26:40.015
Then he showed me a scripture.


26:40.015 --> 26:41.215
Do you want to get your Bible for me? 


26:41.215 --> 26:42.850
Let’s look in Ephesians 5.


26:42.850 --> 26:44.918
Ephesians 5:10: 


26:44.918 --> 26:50.758
“Keep on making sure 
of what is acceptable to the Lord.”


26:50.758 --> 26:53.328
He said, 
“We all have to keep making sure 


26:53.328 --> 26:56.030
“of what’s acceptable to Jehovah 


26:56.030 --> 27:00.702
because Satan is a master at tricking us.” 


27:00.702 --> 27:03.000
Then he used the example of Aaron.


27:08.042 --> 27:12.000
The Israelites asked Aaron 
to make them a god.


27:16.017 --> 27:18.587
So Aaron made a golden calf, 


27:18.587 --> 27:22.090
thinking that it could represent Jehovah. 


27:22.090 --> 27:24.225
He told the people: 


27:24.225 --> 27:28.697
“There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.” 


27:28.697 --> 27:33.034
But true worship 
was being mixed with false worship, 


27:33.033 --> 27:36.503
and Jehovah was not happy. 


27:36.503 --> 27:39.000
And many were punished.


27:41.408 --> 27:44.000
That example helped me a lot. 


27:46.213 --> 27:49.450
I know birthdays are wrong 
because the Bible teaches 


27:49.450 --> 27:52.000
that they are not approved by Jehovah. 


27:53.722 --> 27:56.290
But we don’t want to be confused like Aaron 


27:56.290 --> 27:59.293
and try to mix true and false worship.


27:59.293 --> 28:01.295
All right, let’s go talk to Mom.


28:01.295 --> 28:04.000
We want to make Jehovah happy.


28:06.433 --> 28:10.605
So Dad said, 
“It’s always good to ask, 


28:10.605 --> 28:13.273
How would Jehovah feel if I did this?”


28:13.273 --> 28:17.000
I still didn’t sign the card, 
but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.


28:39.367 --> 28:41.369
Can I go see Lucas?


28:41.368 --> 28:42.270
Yeah. 
Go ahead, Buddy. 


28:42.270 --> 28:43.000
He’s right over there.


28:53.548 --> 28:55.350
How have you been feeling?


28:55.350 --> 28:58.152
A little better.


28:58.152 --> 29:00.855
And then I realized something: 


29:00.855 --> 29:03.592
Instead of celebrating one day, 


29:03.592 --> 29:05.960
I could share with Lucas our hope 


29:05.960 --> 29:09.663
of living forever 
on a beautiful paradise earth.


29:09.663 --> 29:13.000
So there will be no sickness ever again. 


29:14.402 --> 29:18.000
They will build houses and have food.


29:20.142 --> 29:24.712
I enjoyed seeing how we can show 
love and concern for others, 


29:24.712 --> 29:27.849
even if we do not share their beliefs. 


29:27.848 --> 29:32.520
The best way to do so 
is by simple acts of kindness 


29:32.520 --> 29:37.425
and by sharing our hope with them, 
just as Aiden did.


29:37.425 --> 29:41.728
And did you notice 
how the good training by Aiden’s parents 


29:41.728 --> 29:45.466
helped him make decisions 
that were pleasing to God? 


29:45.467 --> 29:49.970
It made me think of Abilio and Ulla Amorim 
from Portugal. 


29:49.970 --> 29:53.307
Both of them endured difficult childhoods, 


29:53.307 --> 29:59.000
but they did not allow that to affect 
how they raised their own children.


30:07.222 --> 30:10.592
Since I was very young,
I was religiously inclined


30:10.592 --> 30:15.297
and my dream was to get married
to a man that worshipped God


30:15.297 --> 30:21.002
and that together we would worship God
and live a peaceful life. 


30:21.002 --> 30:24.305
That didn’t happen with my parents. 


30:24.305 --> 30:29.000
We often had a better relationship
with the maid than with my mother.


30:32.747 --> 30:35.149
My father was a very distant person. 


30:35.148 --> 30:39.000
He was always very busy
with his work and friends. 


30:40.288 --> 30:45.926
We wed in 1971 in Paris, France.


30:45.927 --> 30:48.764
We were baptized in 1974.


30:48.763 --> 30:53.000
I realized I really didn’t know
how to raise children,


30:54.135 --> 30:56.137
and then I started applying some things


30:56.137 --> 30:58.940
mentioned in the Bible. 


30:58.940 --> 31:01.108
If I wanted to teach them right, 


31:01.108 --> 31:04.245
I first had to understand
things better myself 


31:04.245 --> 31:09.550
so that I could explain them
in a way that God would want us to.


31:09.550 --> 31:13.888
In 1976, we moved to Portugal


31:13.888 --> 31:16.000
to serve where there was more need. 


31:18.025 --> 31:22.030
By then, our oldest son
was four and a half years old, 


31:22.030 --> 31:27.135
Maria was three and a half,
and Benjamin, one and a half.


31:27.135 --> 31:32.407
I remember when we arrived; 
we lived in a rural area.


31:32.407 --> 31:34.475
It was a very small congregation, 


31:34.475 --> 31:37.312
so we really had to participate 


31:37.312 --> 31:39.047
from a very early age.


31:39.047 --> 31:40.482
They wanted to put, 


31:40.482 --> 31:43.919
for sure, the spiritual interests
first in their life, 


31:43.918 --> 31:46.000
and they wanted not only to tell us


31:47.722 --> 31:50.000
to put the Kingdom interests first
but they wanted to show us


31:51.325 --> 31:52.593
how to do it.


31:52.593 --> 31:56.230
And it was not only that we
sat down for family study 


31:56.230 --> 31:59.100
that we talked about Jehovah
and spiritual things. 


31:59.100 --> 32:01.668
I remember walking back home 


32:01.668 --> 32:04.038
from meetings
and then my parents would help us


32:04.038 --> 32:07.541
to look for a star constellation; 


32:07.542 --> 32:09.777
it started a conversation about Jehovah.


32:09.777 --> 32:12.880
In Deuteronomy chapter 6,


32:12.880 --> 32:14.882
it says that we 
must always talk to our children. 


32:14.882 --> 32:16.000
But it’s good to talk about God


32:17.752 --> 32:20.020
and help them to see God as a real person


32:20.020 --> 32:22.857
—a person that is linked
to everything around us. 


32:22.857 --> 32:26.194
So now I wanted to teach them very much, 


32:26.193 --> 32:27.628
and not that things about God 


32:27.628 --> 32:30.765
were sad or boring,
but were joyful.


32:30.765 --> 32:33.067
Of course, we were imperfect. 


32:33.067 --> 32:36.337
Many times I did the wrong things. 


32:36.337 --> 32:39.907
I never remember, “You have to do it
because you have to do it.” 


32:39.907 --> 32:42.000
They always tried to explain the reasons


32:43.110 --> 32:44.878
—Bible reasons.


32:44.878 --> 32:46.380
I was brought up this way. 


32:46.380 --> 32:49.717
My parents dictated laws:
“You have to do this. 


32:49.717 --> 32:52.820
You must. 
This is the way I want it to be.” 


32:52.820 --> 32:56.257
But I came to understand that God,
even in the Bible,


32:56.257 --> 32:59.927
instead of only giving or dictating laws,
he explains them. 


32:59.927 --> 33:03.564
He gives so many reasons; 
he gives reasons for everything. 


33:03.563 --> 33:08.235
By teaching my children,
I have to say that I have learned a lot too.


33:08.235 --> 33:11.572
We never felt that we must go to meetings; 


33:11.572 --> 33:14.842
we must go in service
because you have to do it. 


33:14.842 --> 33:18.179
And we were always 
motivated to do things.


33:18.178 --> 33:22.616
I remember, for example, 
when he gave me a new Bible,


33:22.617 --> 33:26.587
and he wrote to me in that Bible,


33:26.587 --> 33:31.592
“May this book always be
the motivating force in your life.”


33:31.592 --> 33:34.329
Several times he told me:


33:34.328 --> 33:36.930
“Please never,


33:36.930 --> 33:40.668
“never give up in your service. 


33:40.668 --> 33:45.000
“Jehovah is your Father,
and you have to serve him


33:48.542 --> 33:51.645
all your life.”


33:51.645 --> 33:55.000
The Almighty has children
that failed to respond, 


33:56.650 --> 33:59.000
much like any other parent. 


34:00.120 --> 34:03.623
God does not force anyone. 


34:03.623 --> 34:07.461
He respects our free will very much. 


34:07.462 --> 34:11.000
So we wanted them
to build their own future. 


34:12.700 --> 34:16.403
I always felt 
that my children were not my own,


34:16.403 --> 34:21.175
but it was Jehovah
who kindly put them into our hands. 


34:21.175 --> 34:25.000
He entrusted them to us
so that we could care for them. 


34:26.080 --> 34:30.000
And then when we have done our part,
let them fly.


34:42.163 --> 34:44.498
My parents always encouraged us


34:44.498 --> 34:47.135
to pursue full-time service,


34:47.135 --> 34:50.000
even if that meant
moving far away from home.


34:52.607 --> 34:57.112
My husband and I are serving
as field missionaries in Klaipeda, Lithuania. 


34:57.112 --> 34:59.180
I know I will be grateful for all eternity


34:59.180 --> 35:02.650
that I used my youth to serve Jehovah,


35:02.650 --> 35:07.455
and that I didn’t waste
my years of my young age


35:07.455 --> 35:09.000
doing things for this world.


35:12.293 --> 35:15.696
My wife and I serve
in the Portugal branch office.


35:15.697 --> 35:20.000
If Jehovah is happy,
if my parents are happy, I’m happy too. 


35:20.000 --> 35:22.737
I’m really sure
that they like what we’re doing. 


35:22.737 --> 35:24.000
They are happy with that.


35:25.840 --> 35:29.010
We rejoice that our children
are giving their best


35:29.010 --> 35:31.345
to their Creator and making him happy. 


35:31.345 --> 35:34.000
Jehovah deserves that.


35:36.083 --> 35:37.985
Of course, we miss our children, 


35:37.985 --> 35:40.187
and we would like to have them around,


35:40.187 --> 35:43.524
but we are very happy for them


35:43.523 --> 35:47.000
for having the privilege
of serving Jehovah the way they are.


35:50.965 --> 35:54.202
Yes, the truths found in the Bible 


35:54.202 --> 35:58.439
can provide practical help 
in raising a family. 


35:58.438 --> 36:01.475
But although Jehovah 
has given the responsibility 


36:01.475 --> 36:04.078
of raising children to the parents, 


36:04.078 --> 36:08.281
other members of the family 
can also play an important role 


36:08.282 --> 36:11.285
in encouraging spiritual progress. 


36:11.285 --> 36:15.155
These three fleshly sisters 
looked after one another 


36:15.155 --> 36:19.000
while learning about Jehovah.


36:24.932 --> 36:28.702
I was the first to start studying the Bible.


36:28.702 --> 36:32.172
After that, I started studying too.


36:32.172 --> 36:34.175
After watching them for a year, 


36:34.175 --> 36:36.177
I began studying too.


36:36.177 --> 36:39.214
Since our parents had stopped studying,


36:39.213 --> 36:43.650
only three of us went to the meetings.


36:43.650 --> 36:46.653
We saved our allowance 
to take the bus to meetings. 


36:46.653 --> 36:49.356
But sometimes
when we were short of money—


36:49.357 --> 36:52.159
My sisters let me ride the bus, 


36:52.158 --> 36:55.863
since I’m the youngest,
and they would walk.


36:55.863 --> 36:59.000
We used to walk
an hour and a half each way.


37:01.535 --> 37:05.305
Meetings were so important to us 
that we never felt it was a burden.


37:05.305 --> 37:08.075
May 2007.


37:08.075 --> 37:11.145
For me, it was October 2006.


37:11.145 --> 37:16.550
I was baptized in October 2005.


37:16.550 --> 37:19.020
Three years later,
I spent a week 


37:19.020 --> 37:23.357
with a special pioneer 
who was serving in the countryside. 


37:23.357 --> 37:26.027
We prayed together every night 


37:26.027 --> 37:29.197
and read life stories from The Watchtower. 


37:29.197 --> 37:34.602
I told Jehovah
that I wanted to be just like her.


37:34.602 --> 37:38.405
Although my relatives 
were unhappy with my decision, 


37:38.405 --> 37:42.277
with Jehovah’s help,
I decided to become a pioneer.


37:42.277 --> 37:46.747
I followed her example,
and I became a pioneer too.


37:46.747 --> 37:50.117
I was working six days a week 
to support my family, 


37:50.117 --> 37:54.455
so I prayed to Jehovah 
for the opportunity to become a pioneer. 


37:54.455 --> 37:57.425
After my boss reduced
my work to five days a week,


37:57.425 --> 38:00.000
I started pioneering.


38:01.628 --> 38:04.231
Pioneer service gives you the opportunity


38:04.232 --> 38:06.467
to serve Jehovah more fully.


38:06.467 --> 38:11.000
Working closely with Jehovah,
I really feel part of his family.


38:12.138 --> 38:15.876
My relationship with Jehovah
has gotten stronger.


38:15.877 --> 38:19.914
When I pray now,
it feels like I’m talking to my close friend.


38:19.913 --> 38:22.783
It allows you to expand your ministry.


38:22.783 --> 38:27.086
I became a special pioneer in June 2013.


38:27.087 --> 38:31.959
I’ve served at Bethel since September 2013.


38:31.958 --> 38:36.000
In April 2014,
I was appointed a special pioneer.


38:37.665 --> 38:40.668
Now I can serve Jehovah more fully.


38:40.668 --> 38:44.438
My appreciation for Jehovah has deepened.


38:44.438 --> 38:49.143
Our mother, who had opposed us,
became a pioneer too.


38:49.143 --> 38:50.811
Full-time service is—


38:50.812 --> 38:54.000
—really awesome!


38:55.917 --> 38:58.919
Whether we are parents or siblings, 


38:58.918 --> 39:01.188
applying Bible principles 


39:01.188 --> 39:04.625
helps us to create a strong family bond. 


39:04.625 --> 39:07.828
It can also help us before we have children, 


39:07.828 --> 39:10.596
even before we are married. 


39:10.597 --> 39:12.767
The world tries to tempt us 


39:12.767 --> 39:17.337
with deceptive lies 
about what is important in life. 


39:17.337 --> 39:20.709
But our own careful research of the Bible 


39:20.708 --> 39:25.000
can protect and guide us 
when we are planning a wedding.


39:30.550 --> 39:34.000
Juliana and I have been friends 
for a few years, 


39:35.155 --> 39:39.093
and we have been getting to know 
each other better for several months.


39:39.093 --> 39:42.896
Things were going really well between us. 


39:42.897 --> 39:46.100
I must say, when Nick asked me 
to join some friends 


39:46.100 --> 39:48.102
for a little get-together at the park, 


39:48.102 --> 39:50.304
I was getting suspicious 


39:50.303 --> 39:53.473
when both our families were there. 


39:53.473 --> 39:56.000
I said, “Yes!”


39:58.945 --> 40:01.000
I couldn’t believe she didn’t see it coming. 


40:02.683 --> 40:06.000
We were both so excited, 
and word spread fast!


40:07.688 --> 40:11.691
At the meeting the next day, 
everyone was congratulating us


40:11.692 --> 40:14.027
—my friend Natalie especially. 


40:14.027 --> 40:17.932
She was full of ideas.


40:17.932 --> 40:20.000
I couldn’t wait to start making plans.


40:22.368 --> 40:25.705
I never realized 
how much goes into a wedding. 


40:25.705 --> 40:28.775
And everyone had 
their own ideas of what we needed


40:28.775 --> 40:30.778
—even Dad! 


40:30.778 --> 40:33.280
We had to think about who we would invite, 


40:33.280 --> 40:36.017
pick out flowers, decorations, 


40:36.017 --> 40:40.054
a suit for Nick and, of course, a dress! 


40:40.053 --> 40:42.055
This was going to be 


40:42.055 --> 40:46.000
so much fun
—or so I thought.


40:47.027 --> 40:51.665
I soon found out there’s 
a whole wedding-related industry out there. 


40:51.665 --> 40:56.337
They were trying to be helpful but, 
at the same time, 


40:56.337 --> 40:58.672
this is how they make money. 


40:58.672 --> 41:02.677
It seemed like nothing they had was modest. 


41:02.677 --> 41:07.180
And the cost for something 
I would only wear for one day


41:07.180 --> 41:09.517
—I couldn’t afford that! 


41:09.517 --> 41:12.052
Everyone was so happy for me, 


41:12.052 --> 41:16.000
but inside I was really starting 
to feel the pressure.


41:17.992 --> 41:20.194
When we met back at Juliana’s home, 


41:20.193 --> 41:22.730
I was pretty confused. 


41:22.730 --> 41:25.432
She had been so happy a few days ago, 


41:25.432 --> 41:28.069
but now she was so stressed out. 


41:28.068 --> 41:31.705
It was like nobody 
was listening to what we wanted. 


41:31.705 --> 41:33.707
But to be honest, 


41:33.707 --> 41:36.000
I’m not sure we knew
what we wanted either. 


41:37.612 --> 41:41.015
I thought it would be good 
if maybe we could just take some time 


41:41.015 --> 41:45.000
and think about what a Christian wedding 
should really be like.


41:46.920 --> 41:49.890
We had a meeting with Brother Grey 
and Brother Sharp the next day 


41:49.890 --> 41:52.458
to discuss using the Kingdom Hall 
for our wedding. 


41:52.458 --> 41:54.361
They gave us some helpful reminders, 


41:54.362 --> 41:57.064
and I’m so glad they did. 


41:57.063 --> 41:59.966
First Corinthians 10:31 says: 


41:59.967 --> 42:04.305
“Whether you are eating 
or drinking or doing anything else, 


42:04.305 --> 42:07.642
do all things for God’s glory.” 


42:07.642 --> 42:11.812
Brother Sharp helped us to see 
that a wedding is a spiritual occasion, 


42:11.812 --> 42:13.914
and we need to keep 
Jehovah’s standards in mind 


42:13.913 --> 42:17.000
when we plan for what we will 
or won’t choose to include.


42:18.818 --> 42:23.423
Brother Grey showed us 1 John 2:15, 16: 


42:23.423 --> 42:27.628
“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world.


42:27.628 --> 42:30.396
“. . . Because everything in the world


42:30.397 --> 42:34.134
“—the desire of the flesh
and the desire of the eyes


42:34.133 --> 42:36.936
“and the showy display
of one’s means of life—


42:36.937 --> 42:39.740
. . . originates with the world.”


42:39.740 --> 42:43.443
He reminded us that what
the world views as normal


42:43.443 --> 42:46.513
is far different from Christian standards 


42:46.513 --> 42:49.416
and that we can be a good example 


42:49.417 --> 42:52.854
by making sure our choices please Jehovah.


42:52.853 --> 42:57.356
They even gave us a few articles 
about wedding arrangements to review. 


42:57.357 --> 43:01.000
They wanted to make sure we would have 
a happy occasion with nothing to regret. 


43:02.930 --> 43:06.433
I asked Brother Sharp 
if he would be our director of the feast 


43:06.433 --> 43:08.435
to help keep things coordinated, 


43:08.435 --> 43:12.000
and he suggested that we talk 
about it over dinner that night.


43:13.540 --> 43:17.845
On the way there, 
we passed by a photography studio. 


43:17.845 --> 43:21.715
I couldn’t believe how lavish 
and showy some weddings are. 


43:21.715 --> 43:24.518
It looked more like an excuse to party 


43:24.518 --> 43:28.221
instead of something 
that’s supposed to honor God.


43:28.222 --> 43:30.224
It reminded me of the book of Galatians: 


43:30.223 --> 43:32.693
“Now the works of the flesh are . . .


43:32.693 --> 43:36.463
drunkenness, wild parties, 
and things like these.” 


43:36.463 --> 43:40.033
We didn’t want to do anything like that. 


43:40.033 --> 43:42.903
We each took the time
to prayerfully consider


43:42.903 --> 43:45.973
the material the brothers gave us.


43:45.973 --> 43:49.510
We saw that Scriptural principles 
can even help us plan a wedding 


43:49.510 --> 43:53.047
that’s affordable, 
enjoyable for everyone, 


43:53.047 --> 43:56.000
and a day that honors Jehovah. 


43:57.685 --> 44:00.553
It looked like we needed 
to make some adjustments. 


44:00.553 --> 44:03.890
We couldn’t include 
everything we originally thought


44:03.890 --> 44:06.000
—some things were just too expensive.


44:07.393 --> 44:09.596
And we wanted to make sure 
that none of our choices 


44:09.597 --> 44:12.000
reflected the spirit of the world.


44:14.702 --> 44:17.537
So we decided to start over 


44:17.537 --> 44:20.774
and make sure we
were doing things Jehovah’s way.


44:20.773 --> 44:24.945
First Timothy 2:9 says that a Christian 


44:24.945 --> 44:29.583
“should adorn themselves 
in appropriate [or “respectable”] dress, 


44:29.583 --> 44:32.285
with modesty and soundness of mind.” 


44:32.285 --> 44:34.287
It took some work, 


44:34.287 --> 44:38.192
but we were able 
to find something affordable, 


44:38.192 --> 44:40.927
appropriate, 


44:40.927 --> 44:43.000
and beautiful.


44:45.798 --> 44:48.568
I was able to find a nice suit


44:48.568 --> 44:51.805
—something I could even wear later. 


44:51.805 --> 44:54.207
And of course, the girls came by 


44:54.207 --> 44:57.000
to make sure that everything matched.


44:58.145 --> 45:00.000
Time went by so fast. 


45:01.715 --> 45:03.950
I called Brother Sharp 
so he could help us follow through 


45:03.950 --> 45:06.000
on the day of the wedding.


45:08.388 --> 45:11.225
Before we knew it, 
we were sending out invitations 


45:11.225 --> 45:14.000
and finalizing all the details.


45:16.997 --> 45:20.234
When my dad walked me 
down the aisle that day, 


45:20.233 --> 45:22.335
I was so excited.


45:22.335 --> 45:25.000
Juliana was so beautiful! 


45:26.973 --> 45:31.000
And the ceremony was just perfect. 


45:35.115 --> 45:39.000
After all that planning we did, 
we were sure to make it legal.


45:41.188 --> 45:43.623
When looking back at our photos, 


45:43.623 --> 45:46.593
it brings back so many good memories.


45:46.593 --> 45:49.000
I was so happy 
with how nice everything turned out. 


45:51.132 --> 45:53.700
And when we saw 
what a great job our friends had done 


45:53.700 --> 45:57.703
decorating the reception, 
I couldn’t believe my eyes.


45:57.703 --> 46:00.506
It was perfect
—simple, 


46:00.507 --> 46:03.177
dignified. 


46:03.177 --> 46:07.815
Our friends all told us that it was 
one of the nicest weddings they’ve been to. 


46:07.815 --> 46:10.950
Everything that day
was just what we wanted. 


46:10.950 --> 46:13.000
It even stayed on budget.


46:14.353 --> 46:17.991
And most importantly, 
we got our marriage off to a good start 


46:17.992 --> 46:20.000
with Jehovah’s help.


46:21.362 --> 46:23.730
I’m so happy we found each other.


46:23.730 --> 46:26.000
I’m so happy I found you too, Love. 


46:27.300 --> 46:31.000
And I know we’ll stay happy 
if we keep Jehovah first.


46:35.175 --> 46:38.745
The couple’s ability to reason 
on Scriptural principles 


46:38.745 --> 46:42.115
helped them to make 
the right decisions. 


46:42.115 --> 46:46.853
Good reasoning ability 
is an essential quality of a true Christian. 


46:46.853 --> 46:51.691
But what does it really mean 
to reason on matters? 


46:51.692 --> 46:56.000
This morning worship program 
by Gary Breaux will show us.


46:57.105 --> 47:01.202
If you’d open your Bibles to Romans 12:1, 


47:01.202 --> 47:04.104
we’ll note that the apostle Paul, 


47:04.103 --> 47:06.340
as has been commented on, 


47:06.340 --> 47:10.710
talks about reasoning on matters. 


47:10.710 --> 47:14.515
That’s Romans 12:1, it says: 


47:14.515 --> 47:17.985
“Therefore, I appeal to you 
by the compassions of God, brothers, 


47:17.985 --> 47:21.188
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice, 


47:21.188 --> 47:23.823
“holy and acceptable to God, 


47:23.823 --> 47:28.000
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.” 


47:29.162 --> 47:34.835
Ah, so Paul says reasoning has power to it. 


47:34.835 --> 47:39.707
A synonym for power is influence. 


47:39.707 --> 47:42.542
And so if you reason something out, 


47:42.542 --> 47:46.880
you’ll be influenced to make 
the proper decision, basically.


47:46.880 --> 47:50.550
Now, he also introduced 
something else in our text today. 


47:50.550 --> 47:51.352
Let’s go there. 


47:51.352 --> 47:54.254
It’s 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,


47:54.253 --> 47:58.000
and we’ll read verses 1 and 2:


48:00.660 --> 48:02.662
“However, brothers, 


48:02.662 --> 48:05.399
“concerning the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ


48:05.398 --> 48:07.633
“and our being gathered together to him,


48:07.633 --> 48:12.638
“we ask you not to be
quickly shaken from your reason


48:12.638 --> 48:17.676
“nor to be alarmed
either by an inspired statement


48:17.677 --> 48:22.682
“or by a spoken message
or by a letter appearing to be from us,


48:22.682 --> 48:27.989
to the effect
that the day of Jehovah is here.”


48:27.988 --> 48:31.123
So he introduces this aspect


48:31.123 --> 48:34.795
of being quickly shaken


48:34.795 --> 48:38.198
once you come to a conclusion on a matter 


48:38.198 --> 48:40.566
after reasoning it out.


48:40.567 --> 48:43.337
Now, he says don’t be quickly shaken 


48:43.337 --> 48:46.307
once you come to a conclusion of the matter 


48:46.307 --> 48:49.610
as a result of reasoning the matter out. 


48:49.610 --> 48:53.513
And that’s what he was telling 
the Thessalonica congregation here. 


48:53.513 --> 48:56.883
In the first letter, 
he had talked about and warned them 


48:56.883 --> 49:01.655
that Jehovah’s day was imminent 
and that it was coming, 


49:01.655 --> 49:04.858
and as a result, 
some in the congregation went beyond that, 


49:04.858 --> 49:06.893
saying that it was here. 


49:06.893 --> 49:08.895
In fact, as verse 2 says, 


49:08.895 --> 49:13.833
there apparently was even a letter 
that appeared to be from Paul 


49:13.833 --> 49:17.603
and saying that it’s not that it’s coming


49:17.603 --> 49:20.406
—Jehovah’s day is here. 


49:20.407 --> 49:24.210
And so some got sidetracked 


49:24.210 --> 49:27.813
as a result of not thinking it through, 


49:27.813 --> 49:29.983
and their faith was shaken, apparently. 


49:29.983 --> 49:32.651
And then as you continue, 


49:32.652 --> 49:36.457
Paul then helped them 
to reason further that no, 


49:36.457 --> 49:41.000
there are other things 
that have to happen before Jehovah’s day.


49:42.162 --> 49:44.497
So we’d like to talk about this matter 


49:44.497 --> 49:48.000
of quickly being shaken
—that is our faith. 


49:49.068 --> 49:54.073
It’s important because we spend years


49:54.073 --> 49:56.643
developing a relationship with Jehovah God


49:56.643 --> 49:59.011
and developing a solid faith, 


49:59.012 --> 50:01.549
and just this idea that Paul introduces 


50:01.548 --> 50:04.985
that one’s faith can be quickly shaken 


50:04.985 --> 50:07.000
is a rather disconcerting thought. 


50:09.355 --> 50:11.458
It can happen to any of us, really. 


50:11.458 --> 50:13.926
I just think about Judas Iscariot, right? 


50:13.927 --> 50:18.399
John 6:64 says 
that from the beginning Jesus knew 


50:18.398 --> 50:21.401
who was the one who would betray him
—from the beginning. 


50:21.402 --> 50:23.404
From the beginning of what? 


50:23.403 --> 50:24.536
The Insight book says: 


50:24.537 --> 50:27.840
“‘From the beginning’ 
of when Judas started to go bad, 


50:27.840 --> 50:32.012
started to give in to imperfection 
and sinful inclinations.” 


50:32.012 --> 50:34.447
Well, how long did that process take? 


50:34.447 --> 50:38.519
Well, it was less than a year 
from the time he was appointed as an apostle. 


50:38.518 --> 50:43.190
Now, we know his appointment 
was no mistake. 


50:43.190 --> 50:46.393
So within that short period of time, 


50:46.393 --> 50:51.398
this man went from an apostle 
to an apostate. 


50:51.398 --> 50:55.601
That’s why it’s such good counsel 
that Paul gave 


50:55.602 --> 50:59.139
for us not to be quickly shaken 


50:59.138 --> 51:05.045
from matters that we have established
as a result of good reasoning.


51:05.045 --> 51:09.248
Now, there are times 
that we’re more susceptible 


51:09.248 --> 51:13.686
to our faith
being quickly shaken than others. 


51:13.687 --> 51:16.857
And I’d like to talk 
about that for just a moment. 


51:16.857 --> 51:19.860
What could some of those times be? 


51:19.860 --> 51:24.097
Well, it could be 
when we’re going through stress, 


51:24.097 --> 51:28.469
depression, or anxiety. 


51:28.468 --> 51:32.971
The March 1, 2010, Watchtower, 
makes this comment: 


51:32.972 --> 51:35.442
“Judgment may be clouded 


51:35.442 --> 51:39.780
when one is under great emotional stress.” 


51:39.780 --> 51:42.448
Now let me give you an example


51:42.448 --> 51:45.485
—hypothetical, but here’s an example—


51:45.485 --> 51:49.522
a brother has a deep relationship 
with his parents; 


51:49.522 --> 51:52.525
his mother suddenly dies. 


51:52.525 --> 51:56.663
This is a great emotional blow to him; 


51:56.663 --> 52:01.535
he slips into a mild depression, 


52:01.535 --> 52:05.072
and as a result, his personal study 


52:05.072 --> 52:09.675
and his spiritual activities slow down. 


52:09.675 --> 52:14.000
Then a short time later, 
a sibling is disfellowshipped. 


52:15.682 --> 52:19.854
This crushes him; he can’t sleep. 


52:19.853 --> 52:23.000
He wakes up; he gets to the computer; 


52:24.490 --> 52:26.893
he turns it on, 


52:26.893 --> 52:30.000
and he slips into watching
something inappropriate.


52:31.665 --> 52:33.667
Now, what’s just happened? 


52:33.667 --> 52:37.137
Well, his good reasoning ability was shaken. 


52:37.137 --> 52:41.809
It’s of note 
that the November 15, 1992, Watchtower, 


52:41.808 --> 52:43.810
puts it this way: 


52:43.810 --> 52:47.013
“Severe and prolonged mental depression 


52:47.013 --> 52:49.248
“may have worn away 


52:49.248 --> 52:53.586
“some of the person’s normally 
strong emotional fiber 


52:53.587 --> 52:57.990
or may have made it extremely difficult 
to make wise decisions.” 


52:57.990 --> 53:00.660
So, what could the brother have done? 


53:00.660 --> 53:04.932
Well, when he first recognized 
this mild depression 


53:04.932 --> 53:08.569
or slipping from the spiritual activities, 


53:08.568 --> 53:13.240
it would have been good for him to get
someone to help him identify the cause.


53:13.240 --> 53:16.375
Now, what is another circumstance 


53:16.375 --> 53:21.180
that could quickly shake our faith


53:21.180 --> 53:23.983
if we’re not on guard?


53:23.983 --> 53:26.000
Well, it has to do with the apostates. 


53:28.388 --> 53:33.393
Now, there is something 
that the apostates are talking about 


53:33.393 --> 53:35.828
and trying to put forward. 


53:35.828 --> 53:40.600
The media has picked it up; 
others have also picked it up. 


53:40.600 --> 53:42.902
And that is our Scriptural position 


53:42.902 --> 53:45.572
of having a two-witnesses requirement 


53:45.572 --> 53:48.609
for judicial action 
if there is no confession. 


53:48.608 --> 53:51.443
Now, if you open your Bibles 
to Deuteronomy 19:15, 


53:51.443 --> 53:54.513
our good reasoning is pretty solid on this. 


53:54.513 --> 53:57.516
At Deuteronomy 19:15,


53:57.517 --> 54:02.189
the scripture is very, very clear. 


54:02.188 --> 54:06.525
It says: 
“No single witness may convict another 


54:06.525 --> 54:09.828
“for any error or any sin that he may commit. 


54:09.828 --> 54:11.998
“On the testimony of two witnesses 


54:11.998 --> 54:14.066
“or on the testimony of three witnesses 


54:14.067 --> 54:16.069
the matter should be established.” 


54:16.068 --> 54:17.736
It’s very clear, isn’t it? 


54:17.737 --> 54:22.642
You cannot establish 
a judicial committee based on one witness. 


54:22.642 --> 54:25.445
But now, listen, 
here’s what they say: 


54:25.445 --> 54:27.713
“Well now, look, 
the Old Testament 


54:27.713 --> 54:31.000
“also says that adulteresses 
should be stoned.


54:32.818 --> 54:35.455
“Now, since you’re not doing that, 


54:35.455 --> 54:40.000
why do you stick 
to this two-witness rule?” 


54:41.260 --> 54:45.498
You see, if you’re not careful, 
that can do some tricks on your mind 


54:45.498 --> 54:48.133
because you have to think it through. 


54:48.133 --> 54:50.203
Well, how might we do that? 


54:50.203 --> 54:53.038
Well, we go to Matthew 18:16


54:53.038 --> 54:56.308
because obviously Christ Jesus


54:56.308 --> 54:58.645
established the Christian arrangement,


54:58.645 --> 55:00.647
and notice what he said.


55:00.647 --> 55:04.284
Matthew 18:16, he says: 


55:04.283 --> 55:08.053
“But if he does not listen,
take along with you one or two more,


55:08.053 --> 55:12.325
“so that on the testimony
of two or three witnesses


55:12.325 --> 55:15.495
every matter may be established.”


55:15.495 --> 55:20.533
So Christ Jesus establishes the fact
that there has to be two witnesses.


55:20.533 --> 55:23.836
Now, it doesn’t mean 
that if there is only one witness 


55:23.837 --> 55:25.839
that there are no consequences. 


55:25.838 --> 55:28.140
There might be, 
depending upon the situation, 


55:28.140 --> 55:31.410
but the Scriptures are very clear. 


55:31.410 --> 55:34.647
Before a judicial committee can be convened, 


55:34.647 --> 55:38.685
there has to be a confession 
or two witnesses, 


55:38.685 --> 55:41.722
so we will never change 


55:41.722 --> 55:45.125
our Scriptural position on that subject.


55:45.125 --> 55:50.030
Jehovah has given us the ability 
to reason things out, to think it through. 


55:50.030 --> 55:52.032
So let’s do our part 


55:52.032 --> 55:55.869
and not allow our faith
to be quickly shaken.


55:55.868 --> 55:59.271
Then we can have 
the confidence that Paul spoke of 


55:59.272 --> 56:02.042
at 2 Thessalonians 3:5 when he said: 


56:02.042 --> 56:05.712
“May the Lord continue to guide
your hearts successfully


56:05.712 --> 56:09.000
to the love of God
and to the endurance for the Christ.”


56:10.783 --> 56:13.786
Even when difficult circumstances arise, 


56:13.787 --> 56:15.855
such as judicial matters, 


56:15.855 --> 56:19.958
we cling to our accurate understanding 
of the Bible. 


56:19.958 --> 56:24.696
Yes, Jehovah is the God of truth. 


56:24.697 --> 56:27.567
And our desire for accurate knowledge 


56:27.567 --> 56:31.004
motivates us to draw 
ever closer to Jehovah 


56:31.003 --> 56:34.773
and to learn more 
about his perfect qualities. 


56:34.773 --> 56:38.310
Just think of everything 
we can learn about him 


56:38.310 --> 56:42.648
when we take the time 
to study his works of creation. 


56:42.648 --> 56:46.418
Psalm 104:24 reads: 


56:46.418 --> 56:50.021
“How many your works are, O Jehovah! 


56:50.022 --> 56:52.692
“You have made all of them in wisdom. 


56:52.692 --> 56:56.000
The earth is full of what you have made.” 


56:57.097 --> 57:00.634
In harmony with that, 
our music video for this month 


57:00.633 --> 57:05.738
is entitled Inspired by Your Wonders.


57:05.738 --> 57:10.000
I hear the birds singing out
to the sunrise.


57:13.145 --> 57:20.000
I see the stars fading away
in the morning light.


57:24.923 --> 57:30.000
Golden sun shines on down
through the treetops,


57:32.132 --> 57:41.574
Where there is a summer breeze
that whispers so soft.


57:41.573 --> 57:45.978
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,


57:45.978 --> 57:50.983
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 


57:50.983 --> 57:59.000
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.


58:01.193 --> 58:08.000
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.


58:11.270 --> 58:19.845
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.


58:19.845 --> 58:22.000
I sing to you.


58:27.220 --> 58:33.000
These wondrous, moving,
breathing creations—


58:34.327 --> 58:43.000
Oh, in the night, in the day—
can you hear what they say?


58:46.305 --> 58:52.000
From mountaintops
to the bottoms of oceans,


58:53.747 --> 59:03.255
Let ev’ry living thing
sing out to your praise.


59:03.255 --> 59:07.427
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,


59:07.427 --> 59:12.332
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 


59:12.332 --> 59:21.909
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.


59:21.908 --> 59:31.000
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.


59:32.018 --> 59:41.793
I see your wonders, 
and I sing to you.


59:41.793 --> 59:44.000
I sing to you.


59:45.765 --> 59:51.000
Looking past what we 
can see with our eyes,


59:54.307 --> 1:00:03.000
We will come to know more 
about the One who gave us life.


1:00:05.250 --> 1:00:10.055
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,


1:00:10.055 --> 1:00:14.993
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 


1:00:14.993 --> 1:00:23.000
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.


1:00:25.070 --> 1:00:33.913
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.


1:00:33.913 --> 1:00:42.000
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.


1:00:43.488 --> 1:00:52.000
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.


1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:01.000
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.


1:01:03.342 --> 1:01:11.000
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.


1:01:12.685 --> 1:01:16.000
I sing to you.


1:01:17.990 --> 1:01:21.693
When we take time to reflect 
on the beauties of creation, 


1:01:21.693 --> 1:01:25.565
it becomes clear 
that there is a higher intelligence 


1:01:25.565 --> 1:01:28.100
who made all these things. 


1:01:28.100 --> 1:01:30.503
Well, David, it’s hard to imagine 


1:01:30.503 --> 1:01:34.073
that we’ve already come to the end 
of another monthly broadcast.


1:01:34.073 --> 1:01:37.943
And, Jim, I want to thank you very much 
for all your help with this program. 


1:01:37.943 --> 1:01:40.480
I really, really appreciate it. 


1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.515
Now, before we conclude, 


1:01:42.515 --> 1:01:45.852
we’d like to visit the city of Cuzco in Peru, 


1:01:45.852 --> 1:01:50.890
where we have 
a Remote Translation Office, or RTO.


1:01:50.890 --> 1:01:54.000
The city of Cuzco is a stopover 
for travelers to Machu Picchu, 


1:01:55.795 --> 1:01:59.932
a historic sanctuary 
of the former Inca Empire, 


1:01:59.932 --> 1:02:02.435
located high up in the mountains. 


1:02:02.435 --> 1:02:06.272
Machu Picchu is an architectural marvel. 


1:02:06.272 --> 1:02:09.442
The design is earthquake resistant. 


1:02:09.442 --> 1:02:12.379
Giant stones were cut so precisely 


1:02:12.378 --> 1:02:15.581
that in many places a piece of paper 


1:02:15.582 --> 1:02:18.084
cannot fit in between them. 


1:02:18.083 --> 1:02:21.586
At such high altitudes, 
you can also see llamas, 


1:02:21.587 --> 1:02:24.890
which are raised 
in the Andes Mountains. 


1:02:24.890 --> 1:02:27.127
The Inca people spoke Quechua, 


1:02:27.127 --> 1:02:29.129
a language that is spoken 


1:02:29.128 --> 1:02:32.063
by millions of Peruvians today.


1:02:32.063 --> 1:02:35.000
There has been a translation office in Cuzco 


1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.303
since 2004, 


1:02:37.303 --> 1:02:39.305
but as the work grew, 


1:02:39.305 --> 1:02:41.807
so did the need for more office space. 


1:02:41.807 --> 1:02:46.812
So in 2016, a new RTO was dedicated. 


1:02:46.812 --> 1:02:50.884
The blessings of the translation work 
have been evident. 


1:02:50.883 --> 1:02:55.521
Since the Bible Teach book 
was released in Quechua in 2007, 


1:02:55.522 --> 1:02:57.857
the number of publishers increased 


1:02:57.857 --> 1:03:00.125
from about 700 


1:03:00.125 --> 1:03:04.163
to nearly 1,700 last year. 


1:03:04.163 --> 1:03:06.098
In addition to The Watchtower 


1:03:06.098 --> 1:03:08.100
and the Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook, 


1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:11.637
videos are translated at this office, 


1:03:11.637 --> 1:03:15.709
ranging from JW Broadcasting 
monthly programs 


1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:19.845
to episodes of Become Jehovah’s Friend.


1:03:19.845 --> 1:03:23.482
There are several regions in Peru 
where Quechua is spoken, 


1:03:23.482 --> 1:03:27.052
all with slightly different dialects 
and expressions. 


1:03:27.052 --> 1:03:30.289
Hence, 
each translation team 


1:03:30.288 --> 1:03:33.926
has representatives from these areas 


1:03:33.927 --> 1:03:36.062
in order to ensure that the translation 


1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:38.430
is universally understood 


1:03:38.430 --> 1:03:40.500
among Quechua speakers. 


1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:45.203
Approximately 40 brothers 
and sisters work at the RTO, 


1:03:45.203 --> 1:03:48.573
of which 15 are full-time. 


1:03:48.573 --> 1:03:50.676
In the Cuzco area, 


1:03:50.677 --> 1:03:54.647
there are 28 congregations and 38 groups, 


1:03:54.647 --> 1:03:58.150
with about 2,000 publishers.


1:03:58.150 --> 1:04:02.053
We love our brothers and sisters 
in Cuzco very much indeed. 


1:04:02.053 --> 1:04:03.621
And they want you to know 


1:04:03.622 --> 1:04:05.625
how much they love you. 


1:04:05.625 --> 1:04:07.793
Well, until next time, 


1:04:07.793 --> 1:04:10.630
this is JW Broadcasting 


1:04:10.630 --> 1:04:21.323
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

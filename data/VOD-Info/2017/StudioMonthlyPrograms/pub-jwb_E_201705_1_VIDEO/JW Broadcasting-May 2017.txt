00:01 Welcome, brothers and sisters!
00:03 Here are some of this month’s highlights:
00:06 How should we view counsel?
00:09 Does it apply to us  even if we don’t like
00:11 the way it was given?
00:14 In times of crisis,
00:16 how does the organization  respond to help our brothers and sisters?
00:21 And we will go behind the scenes  of last year’s convention drama
00:25 about King Hezekiah.
00:28 This is the May program  of JW Broadcasting!
00:51 Let’s begin by visiting a family  in Stockholm, Sweden.
00:55 The parents, Usama and Kristina,  have two daughters,
00:59 Talita and Isabella.
01:01 When Talita was born,
01:03 the doctor found cataracts  in both of her eyes.
01:07 A cataract is a clouding  of the eye’s natural lens.
01:11 So the doctor had to operate
01:13 so that Talita wouldn’t lose  her sight completely
01:16 —a terrifying situation  for any parent.
01:21 Today, Talita is seven years old
01:23 and almost blind in one eye
01:25 but completely blind in the other.
01:29 Teaching a child about Jehovah
01:31 in this system of things  is already a challenge
01:33 even without physical ailments involved.
01:36 But let’s find out how Talita’s parents  rose to the challenge,
01:41 making sure that she received  a proper spiritual education
01:45 despite her poor vision.
01:52 I look forward to not having  poor sight anymore
01:56 and that I can play  with a bear and a lion
01:59 and to sit  on the back of a tiger.
02:03 Jehovah gives us  a fantastic promise at Isaiah 35:5:
02:08 “The eyes of the blind will be opened.”
02:12 It’s been a challenge  to get to where we are today.
02:17 We thank Jehovah  for all the help he has given us.
02:21 As soon as Talita was able  to leave the house after the operation,
02:25 we made sure  to go to the meetings.
02:29 It helped us a lot to be able  to throw our burden on Jehovah.
02:34 We prayed together;
02:36 we cried a lot together  because it was so hard.
02:44 One of the challenges
02:46 is that we have to give  Talita audio description constantly.
02:50 We have to tell her who is coming in  and what is happening.
02:55 We get so many amazing materials  on jw.org
02:59 and also through the congregation.
03:03 She really loves to read  Learn From the Great Teacher.
03:07 It has questions  which make her a part of the story.
03:14 She has a very good memory,
03:15 and therefore she remembers  a lot of what she reads.
03:19 So when we are with friends,  she often quizzes them.
03:53 I really like to sing  the songs in my songbook.
03:58 Talita’s spiritual goal
04:00 is to learn more  of our Kingdom songs.
04:04 We get so much help
04:06 from the beautiful music  on the website
04:09 and also  from the Caleb and Sophia videos.
04:15 She knows many of the stories from My Book of Bible Stories,
04:19 so she can answer in her own words.
04:21 We will ask a question like,  Do you know this about David?
04:25 And if she knows the answer,
04:27 then we encourage her  to answer at the meeting.
04:36 When I give an answer  at the meetings,
04:38 Jehovah becomes happy
04:39 because he loves children.
04:42 She often asks the friends,
04:45 “Do you love Jehovah?”
04:46 So she feels very united with them.
04:53 One of the best moments where we saw
04:55 that Talita’s spirituality had grown
04:57 was when she came home from a sleepover
05:00 at her grandparents’ house.
05:02 My parents are not Jehovah’s Witnesses,
05:04 and her grandmother had said
05:06 that God doesn’t exist.
05:08 So when Talita came home, she said,
05:11 “And then when I was going to sleep,  I prayed to Jehovah,
05:14 “‘Would you please help Grandmother
05:15 to realize that you do exist —that you are real?’”
05:23 We try to keep  our wonderful hope alive,
05:27 so we often talk  about  what we will do
05:30 in Paradise.
05:32 We really look forward to when Talita  will be able to see again
05:36 and live in a paradise  with all our friends.
05:39 It’s going to be wonderful!
05:43 I think that Jehovah  looks forward to looking at me
05:46 when I play with a tiger.
05:52 I’ll have to make sure that I remember  the names of Joseph’s brothers
05:56 in case I meet Talita  and she decides to quiz me!
06:00 Her parents have done a good job  in raising such a fine young sister.
06:05 And together with them,
06:07 we eagerly look forward  to the benefits of the new system.
06:11 Isaiah 35:5 says:
06:14 “At that time the eyes  of the blind will be opened.”
06:20 Such divine reminders  can truly warm our heart.
06:24 And Jehovah’s reminders  not only provide us comfort
06:27 but can also help us  make important decisions
06:31 in our everyday life.
06:33 This brings us to our music video  which is entitled
06:37 I Keep Your Reminders.
06:56 What should I do?  Who should I look to?
07:07 This could just be harmless,  could be respectable.
07:14 There may be no need  for me to reject it all.
07:20 Oh, what is the right course for me?  Which path will it be?
07:32 What should I do?  Take which point of view?
07:43 It could be excessive,  with many dangers there—
07:50 All the kinds of things  that could prove to be a snare.
07:56 Oh, what is the right course for me?  Jehovah, give ear to my plea.
08:06 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
08:13 I’ll treasure them every day,  monthly, yearly.
08:19 All the things I have heard in accord  with your Word, help me understand.
08:33 I know what’s required.  I’d better inquire.
08:46 I don’t want to act  in a way to cause offense,
08:51 But it sounds like  there likely would be consequence.
08:58 It’s clear what’s the right course for me —the key, the guarantee.
09:08 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
09:14 They strengthen my heart  and help me to see clearly.
09:21 All the things I have heard in accord with your Word, help me understand.
09:53 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
10:00 They strengthen my heart  and help me to see clearly.
10:06 As I read day and night,  my life fills up with light.
10:12 I’ve got you by my side  as I think of your might.
10:19 All the things I have heard in accord  with your Word, help me understand.
10:33 Did you notice  that it was a Bible-trained conscience
10:36 that helped our sister  make a wise decision?
10:39 She knew what potential danger  lay ahead.
10:43 Yes, the reminders  from God’s Word guided her.
10:47 The theme for our program this month is
10:50 “Treasure Jehovah’s Reminders.”
10:53 And it’s based on Psalm 19:7,
10:58 where we’re told:
11:00 “The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,
11:04 making the inexperienced one wise.”
11:09 In the original language,  the word here translated as “reminder”
11:13 comes from a root word meaning  “to go over again, to repeat.”
11:19 Reminders have always been  an essential part of Jehovah’s teaching.
11:23 In ancient Israel,  God’s people continually received
11:27 commandments,  regulations, and reminders.
11:31 In fact, Jehovah tells us
11:33 that he sent  his prophets “again and again”
11:36 to repeatedly remind his people  of their responsibilities.
11:42 The apostle Peter  felt the need to give reminders
11:45 even to those  who were “well-established in the truth.”
11:48 Notice how he describes this
11:50 at 2 Peter 1:12, 13:
11:54 “For this reason I intend always
11:58 “to remind you of these things,
12:00 “although you know them  and are well-established
12:03 “in the truth that is present in you.
12:05 “But I consider it right,
12:07 “as long as I am in this tabernacle,
12:09 to stir you with reminders.”
12:13 In verse 15,  he goes on to give the reason
12:16 why he felt the need  to give the brothers reminders.
12:19 He says:
12:21 “I will always do my utmost  so that after my departure,
12:26 you may be able to recall  these things for yourselves.”
12:31 So Peter was determined  to help the brothers and sisters
12:34 in his day to remember, or recall,
12:37 the teachings they had already learned.
12:40 It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then,
12:42 if today a lot of our teaching  involves reminders.
12:46 It follows the pattern set  by Jehovah in ancient Israel
12:50 and with the first-century Christians.
12:53 But why do we need reminders?
12:56 Let’s consider three reasons.
12:59 First, let’s look at Psalm 103:2.
13:04 There it says:
13:06 “Let me praise Jehovah;
13:08 may I never forget all that he has done.”
13:12 Why, then, do we need reminders?
13:14 Simply put, because we forget.
13:17 If we had perfect memories,
13:19 we wouldn’t need so many reminders.
13:22 Even in everyday life,  many of us use little notes
13:25 to remind ourselves  of what we need to do.
13:28 And who of us  hasn’t seen the need
13:30 for a list of reminders  when going shopping,
13:33 only to realize when we returned
13:36 that we forgot to get one  of the important items
13:39 we needed to purchase?
13:41 If reminders are important  in everyday life,
13:44 how much more so in matters
13:46 that involve our relationship  with Jehovah.
13:49 Let’s read Luke 10:39, 40.
13:55 Speaking of Martha, we are told:
13:57 “She also had a sister called Mary,
14:00 “who sat down at the feet of the Lord
14:03 “and kept listening to what he was saying.
14:05 “Martha, on the other hand,
14:07 was distracted with attending to many duties.”
14:12 What was Martha’s problem?
14:14 She was distracted.
14:16 So the second reason  why we need reminders
14:19 is that, like Martha,  at times we too become distracted.
14:24 Although we may already know  a vital fact,
14:27 that fact might get put  into the back of our mind,
14:30 figuratively speaking,
14:31 because other matters  are demanding our attention.
14:36 Satan is the great Distracter.
14:39 He tries to turn our attention away  from the true issues of our day.
14:43 People in general have become  more and more distracted
14:47 by entertainment  and other nonessential matters.
14:51 No wonder that Satan  has succeeded in misleading so many.
14:55 They don’t even realize  what has happened.
14:59 Reason number three  is alluded to
15:03 at Matthew 24:45:
15:06 “Who really  is the faithful and discreet slave
15:09 “whom his master appointed  over his domestics,
15:12 to give them their food  at the proper time?”
15:16 Notice that the spiritual food  is given to us “at the proper time.”
15:21 Our circumstances in life  are continually changing.
15:25 How often do we hear,
15:27 “That was just what I needed?”
15:29 We’ve all experienced that,  haven’t we?
15:33 So, what are three of the reasons  why we need reminders?
15:36 One,  because we tend to forget things.
15:40 Two,  we often become distracted.
15:43 Three,  our changed circumstances
15:47 may require a reminder  of something we already knew
15:50 but didn’t fully need at that time.
15:54 So that brings us to the next question:
15:57 What will help us to remember?
15:59 It’s interesting to note  that Jehovah has used many ways
16:04 to remind his people  of what they should do.
16:07 At Numbers 10:10, we’re told
16:10 that the various festivals  were given as reminders,
16:14 especially the celebration  of the Passover.
16:17 That means  that every time the Israelites
16:20 prepared and celebrated  one of these festivals,
16:23 they were reminded  of important matters,
16:26 such as how Jehovah  provides for his people
16:29 and how he has saved them  in the past.
16:32 Something similar happens today
16:35 at the commemoration  of the Lord’s Evening Meal.
16:37 Not only do we hear  the reminders from God’s Word
16:41 but the act of passing  the bread and wine
16:44 also serves as an action that reminds us
16:47 of what Jesus did in our behalf.
16:51 But what do we need to do in order for those reminders
16:54 to have a beneficial impact  on our lives?
16:58 Notice what Psalm 119:99 says.
17:03 It tells us:
17:05 “I have more insight than all my teachers,
17:08 because I ponder over your reminders.”
17:12 Yes, we need to ponder  over these reminders.
17:15 That means not just  listening to or reading them,
17:19 but it involves thinking deeply  about them—
17:22 meditating on their value.
17:24 Just to listen or read  without meditating
17:28 is like looking through the lens  of a movie camera
17:31 without pressing the record button.
17:34 We see things and hear things,
17:36 but nothing is recorded.
17:39 So we need  to meditate, visualize,
17:43 and review these reminders.
17:45 This will help us  to remember what we learn.
17:48 But, figuratively speaking,  there is something else
17:52 that we can do  to press the record button.
17:55 That means we don’t have to wait
17:58 for someone else  to give us a reminder.
18:00 We can make our own reminder.
18:03 How can we do so?
18:05 The answer to that question
18:08 is highlighted  in Jehovah’s instructions to Moses
18:11 as found at Exodus 17:14:
18:15 “Jehovah now said to Moses:
18:17 “‘Write this as a memorial
18:20 “‘[or the footnote says: “reminder”]
18:22 in the book and repeat it to Joshua.’”
18:25 What’s the point?
18:27 Write down new things  we want to remember.
18:31 Some brothers use a notebook,  or exercise book,
18:35 to write down a list of interesting points  that they want to remember.
18:39 Then they look through the book  from time to time
18:42 to remind themselves of those points.
18:45 Many of us do this with our notes  from conventions and assemblies.
18:49 Of course, to do that successfully,
18:52 you need to remember  where you put the notebook.
18:55 Additionally,  we have to be careful
18:57 that we don’t write down  every little fact.
19:00 Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed  with all the information.
19:06 We can make  these notes either on paper
19:08 or electronically using computers  or electronic devices.
19:13 Whatever system we use,  let’s make lists of things
19:17 that we want to remember.
19:20 Many brothers have found it good  to have two separate lists.
19:24 One list could be subjects
19:27 —perhaps points that we want to use
19:29 in the ministry or in our own lives.
19:32 Another, scriptures
19:35 —explanations that clarify  the meaning of certain verses.
19:39 With regard to notes on scriptures,
19:42 let’s ask a very important question:
19:45 Do you have a study Bible?
19:49 What is a study Bible?
19:52 Perhaps it’s a separate Bible
19:54 to the one you take in the ministry.
19:56 It’s a Bible for you to write in
19:58 so that you’re reminded  of things that you’ve learned.
20:02 These are some of the things  we can do with a study Bible:
20:07 Highlight or underline some words or verses.
20:10 That will make it easier to find them again.
20:13 But remember not to make  too many highlights or marks;
20:17 otherwise, nothing will stand out.
20:20 Write a summary of points and scriptures  you want to remember
20:23 on the blank pages in the front  or the back of your Bible.
20:28 Write notes in the margin
20:30 —that’s what Gilead students often do.
20:33 Of course, you need  the right type of pen or pencil
20:37 that won’t bleed through  to the other side of the page.
20:40 What type of things  could you write in the margin?
20:44 Perhaps new points  that you learn while reading magazines
20:47 or attending meetings and assemblies.
20:50 If you learn a new point, ask yourself,
20:53 ‘What verse is being explained?’
20:56 And then write a brief comment  in the margin next to that verse.
21:01 Let’s take an example.
21:03 Perhaps you are reading  the Sermon on the Mount
21:06 and you get to Matthew 7:24-27.
21:10 That’s the illustration
21:12 about the two men who built houses
21:15 —one on sand and the other on rock.
21:18 As you research this  in Watchtower Library
21:21 or the Research Guide,
21:23 you come across the article
21:25 “Are You Building on Sand or on Rock?”
21:27 in the November 1, 2008, Watchtower.
21:32 What points could you write in the margin
21:34 to help you remember the explanation?
21:37 Well, perhaps you could write:
21:39 Sand equals build on the surface.
21:43 Rock equals dig down deep.
21:48 Digging equals doing and applying.
21:52 You might even put Luke 6:46-48 there.
21:57 Now, if you still have room  and your writing is small,
22:00 you could add something like this:
22:02 Not hearers only, but doers.
22:06 Both houses in same location,
22:09 same tests, foundations different.
22:14 Now every time  you read those verses,
22:17 you will be reminded  of what they mean.
22:20 Perhaps like me,
22:22 you’ve had several study Bibles  over the years.
22:25 I think back to the first one I used.
22:27 It was like this big green Bible.
22:30 Then, later that was replaced  by another Bible
22:34 —this black covered Bible.
22:36 And then, further still,
22:39 we had another Bible —the Reference Bible.
22:42 And, of course,  now for most of us,
22:45 we have the large-print Bible.
22:48 This does, however,
22:51 highlight a challenge  we might experience.
22:53 It can be frustrating
22:55 when a new edition  of the Bible comes out.
22:57 How do you transfer all your study notes
23:00 over to the new Bible?
23:02 Additionally, our beloved study Bible  may wear out
23:06 or, worse still, be lost, stolen, burned,  ruined, run over, blown away.
23:14 So that’s the advantage  of using an electronic list;
23:18 it doesn’t matter  what type of file you use.
23:21 It can be updated very easily,  and you can even make copies
23:25 —not like the printed copy
23:27 that already has  the old idea written in the margin.
23:31 Even now in English,
23:33 we have the books  of Matthew, Mark, and Luke
23:36 in our electronic study Bible
23:38 on jw.org and WOL.
23:42 Later in the program,  we have some exciting news
23:46 about how JW Library  will help us in this regard.
23:49 But I’ll leave that for later.
23:52 Really, having a study Bible  is not only helpful
23:57 but it also makes our personal study  far more interesting.
24:01 How so?
24:03 Every time we read  or study a publication,
24:07 we’ll find ourselves  searching for new points
24:10 that we can write  in our study Bible.
24:13 This way, we’ll be doing  what the psalmist expressed
24:16 at Psalm 119:111:
24:20 ‘We will take Jehovah’s reminders
24:22 ‘as our permanent possession  (or heritage),
24:25 for his reminders  are the joy of our hearts!’
24:31 But do you agree that sometimes  the reminders we get
24:35 may be less than pleasant?
24:37 Maybe they even hurt!
24:40 In this dramatization,
24:42 pay attention to how  we should respond to counsel.
24:59 Today started out well.
25:09 But after the meeting tonight,
25:11 my feelings were hurt.
25:22 Earlier in the week, we invited  some friends over to watch a movie.
25:25 And apparently,
25:27 this new young elder heard about it,
25:31 so he counseled me about it  after the meeting,
25:33 saying that I should give  my movie choices
25:36 some thought.
25:38 I just didn’t like  the way he gave the counsel.
25:41 He’s only 27.
25:43 That’s too young.
25:50 The next day,  we had plans to go out in the ministry
25:54 with Brother Kang and his wife.
25:57 But the motivation
25:59 just wasn’t there.
26:13 I asked to speak  with Brother Kang alone.
26:16 I told him what happened
26:18 and how we didn’t feel  the counsel applied to us.
26:22 I can understand  how you might feel.
26:24 But, Byong Soo,
26:26 be absolutely honest with me.
26:28 Do you feel there is no valid reason  for that counsel?
26:33 Mm.
26:42 Well, maybe there were some scenes
26:44 that could have been less violent.
26:46 But the way he gave the counsel
26:49 —he didn’t even ask how we felt.
26:51 Byong Soo, what is the only way
26:54 for us to receive perfect counsel?
26:56 From a perfect man.
26:58 That’s right.
27:00 And is Jesus here on the earth today?
27:04 He was right.
27:07 Counsel can only be perfect
27:09 if it’s given from a perfect person.
27:13 Still, this counsel  about our movie choices
27:17 would have been so much easier
27:19 if it came from someone older  and more experienced,
27:23 like Brother Kang.
27:27 Well, he must have sensed  what I was thinking
27:30 because he helped me to remember
27:33 something from the Bible.
27:37 When Job underwent severe trials,
27:40 it was the younger Elihu who helped Job
27:43 adjust his thinking correctly.
27:47 It required humility on Job’s part
27:50 to listen to someone younger  and less experienced.
27:57 He then read Proverbs 19:20:
27:59 “Listen to counsel and accept discipline,
28:04 in order to become wise in your future.”
28:09 The point was clear:
28:11 Keep our focus on the counsel,
28:14 not the counselor.
28:30 I later shared  Brother Kang’s comments with my wife.
28:35 We both realized that we should welcome
28:37 all counsel from Jehovah.
28:40 It’s for our good.
29:02 I’m sure it took courage
29:05 for that young elder  to approach me about the matter.
29:10 But I’m so glad he did because,
29:13 in the end, his counsel
29:15 was just another example
29:18 of God’s love.
29:23 Yes, we all need reminders.
29:25 And did you notice some  of the main teaching points
29:28 in this dramatization?
29:30 First,  we need to be humble
29:32 when we receive counsel.
29:34 Second,  we need to keep our focus on the counsel,
29:38 not the counselor.
29:40 And the young elder likely learned  from the experience too.
29:44 Perhaps next time,  after conferring with a seasoned elder,
29:48 he might handle matters  with a little bit more tact and discretion.
29:54 But we can’t rely solely  on receiving reminders from others
29:58 to keep our spirituality intact.
30:00 We need to do our part.
30:03 One of the tools that can help us
30:05 to actively search out reminders
30:07 is JW Library.
30:09 This amazing app has been installed
30:13 on over 15 million devices.
30:16 But do you know  how much work it takes
30:19 to develop and maintain this app?
30:21 Well, we are now going  to look  behind the scenes
30:25 and meet some of the brothers  who have either worked on this project
30:29 or helped to organize that work.
30:32 This really is an opportunity to visit
30:35 an area in Bethel  that you don’t get to see on tour.
30:39 Of course, there are many brothers  associated with the work.
30:42 But we would like you  to get to know three
30:46 of these very hard-working brothers,
30:48 and let me introduce them to you.
30:50 First of all, Brother Per Christensen,  the overseer of MEPS Programming.
30:55 Now, Per, you’ve been in this country
30:57 working in the U.S. Bethel  for a number of years.
30:59 But where are you from originally?
31:02 I was born in Denmark
31:04 and served there in the branch for years.
31:07 So when did you and your wife, Berit,  come to the United States?
31:11 In 1994.
31:13 And our first year was in Brooklyn.
31:15 And then we had 18 years in Patterson
31:18 and then back to Brooklyn again  for three and a half years.
31:21 And now we’re in Warwick  since November last year.
31:25 Well, I know you worked  in Translation Services for a while
31:28 because, in fact,  the two of us worked together
31:30 in the same department  there for a while.
31:32 But what type of work  have you been involved with
31:35 since you’ve come  to the United States?
31:37 Lots of exciting and challenging jobs.
31:41 Working in Translation Services
31:43 —that was training and support  for our translators worldwide.
31:48 Now in MEPS Programming
31:50 —that is all about  distribution of spiritual food
31:54 to all our brothers and sisters.
31:56 So we have a ton of work  and a lot of challenges.
32:00 But I’m also working with a lot
32:02 of very, very talented  brothers and sisters.
32:06 So it’s a lot of fun,  and it’s great going to work every day.
32:10 That’s great to hear, Per.
32:12 In fact, I’m even tempted  to come back and work with you.
32:15 Oh, we would love that.
32:16 I think I’d love it too.
32:18 Well, let’s turn our attention  to Brother Alfredo Serna.
32:22 Now, you are the assistant overseer  of MEPS Programming.
32:25 In fact, you and I worked together  in Mexico back in 2003.
32:29 Could you tell us a little bit  about what you were doing at that time?
32:33 My last work assignment involved overseeing
32:35 the large Translation Department there.
32:37 It was an amazing privilege to work
32:39 with translators in sign language  and the indigenous languages,
32:43 a true joy to contribute to preparing publications
32:47 for those in the minority groups.
32:49 So when did you and your wife, Gina,  come to the United States to work here?
32:53 We arrived at Patterson in 2007.
32:56 We have fond memories of that time,
32:58 and it’s something we still treasure.
33:01 Very good.
33:01 And now,  Brother Paul Willies,
33:04 where do you originally come from  along with your wife, Su-lin,
33:08 and when did you come to the United States?
33:11 Well, we’re both originally  from South Africa,
33:13 and we served there in Bethel  for a number of years.
33:15 And then in 2010,  we were transferred to work
33:18 along with MEPS Programming  here in the U.S.
33:21 So, what type of work  have you been involved with,
33:24 particularly recently?
33:26 Well, most of my time in Bethel
33:27 I’ve been working  on the Watchtower Translation System,
33:29 or WTS.
33:31 Actually,  I was working along with Per.
33:33 Per was in headquarters,  and I was working
33:35 on the programming team  that we had in South Africa.
33:37 WTS is the program  that the translators use
33:40 to help organize and manage  their translation work.
33:42 And then, of course, most recently  I’ve been working on the mobile apps
33:46 —the JW Library app  and the JW Library Sign Language app.
33:49 Very good.
33:50 Well, now all of you work  in MEPS Programming.
33:53 Per, can you just tell us a little bit?
33:56 We’re familiar with the term MEPS,  but what really is it?
33:59 Well, MEPS stands for
34:01 Multilanguage Electronic Publishing System.
34:05 That didn’t help me at all.
34:06 Sorry.
34:07 Can you make it a little bit  more simple so we can understand?
34:10 We make the tools, or the programs,  that the organization needs
34:14 to make publications
34:17 and have them translated  into hundreds of languages.
34:21 So I can illustrate it this way:
34:24 that we are not making  the spiritual food,
34:26 but we are building  a conveyor belt for the spiritual food
34:30 from the faithful and discreet slave
34:33 down to the printing presses
34:35 or to our website  or to Watchtower Library,
34:38 ONLINE LIBRARY  or, like in this case, JW Library.
34:42 Thanks so much.
34:44 Now, at long last, I do understand  a bit more
34:45 about what MEPS means.
34:47 Now, as I travel around,  the brothers and sisters,
34:51 they tell me how much  they love JW Library.
34:54 But there seems to be no end
34:57 to the suggestions  for improvements and features
35:00 —and long lists of suggestions.
35:02 Can you give us a little bit  of an idea of what’s involved
35:06 with trying to develop  a new feature for JW Library?
35:11 Yes, the brothers and the sisters  really love using the app,
35:14 and because of that,  they’re keen to get many new features.
35:18 Of course, we wish we could just add  all those new features into the app,
35:22 but the truth is we just can’t.
35:25 Yes, adding each new feature  involves a lot of work.
35:28 And we also need to determine  whether a feature
35:32 that’s requested is just a “nice to have”
35:34 or is it something  that’s going to address a real need?
35:37 For example, will it really help an elder  who is out on a shepherding call
35:40 or maybe a pioneer sister  who is at the public witnessing carts
35:44 or at her Bible study or return visit?
35:46 Also, very important  to us is trying to make
35:50 each new feature  very simple to use . . .
35:53 Ah, thanks for doing that.
35:55 . . . especially for a first-time user,  someone who’s never used the app before.
35:59 And then, of course,  before we start working on anything,
36:01 we always get approval  from the Governing Body.
36:03 Ah, that’s a good thing to do too.
36:05 Like one feature  that many have been asking for
36:08 is the ability  to add notes into the app.
36:12 And, of course,  before we start programming it,
36:14 we have to make sure  that it actually does what is wanted.
36:18 We made a video  that shows how we go about that.
36:20 You have?
36:21 Would you like to see it?
36:22 Well, of course.  I’d love to see it!
36:25 Hello.  How are you?
36:26 Good, good, good.
36:27 Welcome!  Thanks for coming.
36:28 How about yourself?
36:29 Fine, thank you.  Have a seat.
36:30 All right, so glad you could be here!
36:32 Thank you so much.
36:33 Oh, so fancy.
36:35 Yeah! So we get to talk about JW Library today.
36:38 So, what are some ways  that you use JW Library?
36:41 I mean, it’s revolutionized  going to meetings.
36:44 Oh, my.
36:45 I go to meetings  and sometimes I just carry my iPad.
36:47 So the fact that you can make  the text larger. . .
36:49 It’s easy to listen  to the readings right in the app now,
36:52 and so I—I find myself doing that.
36:54 So if we were  to make a notes feature,
36:56 what are some things  that you’d like to be able to do?
36:58 I mean, if you could see  all your notes without tapping on
37:00 each one that would be great.
37:03 And even if you make a note in,  maybe, your phone
37:06 and it can also be saved in your tablet,  that would be really nice.
37:09 Yeah.
37:10 Well, what if I told you  that in front of you
37:13 is an early version of JW Library?
37:16 Whoa!  Cool!
37:17 Oh, fantastic!
37:18 This is it?
37:18 With notes—yeah.
37:20 Ooh.
37:22 So a few months ago,  the Governing Body
37:24 gave us approval to start working  on the notes feature.
37:26 We got together as a team,  and we’ll do, like, these rough sketches,
37:30 and programmers write code.
37:31 But before we release an update,
37:33 we have a group of testers.
37:34 And, you know, they’ll find  little glitches or bugs or things,
37:36 but they’ll try to work it out  with the programmers.
37:38 After that, we have  a pretty stable version of JW Library.
37:42 The goal is to show it to you,
37:44 and you can let us know  what you think.
37:47 So now that you’ve seen  the new notes feature
37:49 in JW Library, what do you think?
37:51 I love that I can tag the personal things  that I need to work on
37:55 or a comment or a scripture  that I can encourage someone with.
37:58 This is fantastic!
37:59 Yeah.  It’s great.
38:00 I like that I can find my notes,  especially using the search feature.
38:03 It’s great!
38:04 And it’s really neat  how my comments—
38:07 I can place it right next  to the paragraph for meetings,
38:09 and it doesn’t cover the actual text.
38:11 The ability to back it up  so you can restore it to another device,
38:15 that’s going to be really helpful.
38:17 I love it!
38:18 Amazing!
38:19 OK.  Go ahead.
38:20 Yeah.  Go ahead!
38:22 So you’re telling us we can proceed.
38:25 That’s fantastic!
38:26 But, brothers, you can’t show us  something like that
38:29 and not tell us when  we’re going to get it.
38:32 Well, we said on the website  that it was coming soon.
38:34 I know you said that on the website,  but when?
38:36 Is it OK to be more specific than that?
38:38 I think that’s why they invited us here.
38:40 Paul, let’s hear it.
38:42 Well, we’re happy to tell you  that the notes feature
38:44 in JW Library  will be coming soon,
38:46 and by soon we mean  during May of 2017—this month!
38:51 So we can go and check  the app stores for an update.
38:54 Oh, that’s wonderful to hear.
38:56 So all of us will be happy  to be able to put our own reminders
38:59 right there in the JW Library app.
39:03 Well, I’m looking forward  to being able to do that as well.
39:06 But now,  while I’ve got you here,
39:08 we’re not going to let you go  until we ask this big question:
39:11 What are you working on now?
39:14 In other words, what can we expect  to see soon with JW Library?
39:19 We have another brief video showing  what the team is working on
39:22 to support the Study Bible  on the JW Library app.
39:26 Would you like to see it?
39:26 That’s wonderful.  Let’s have a look.
39:30 Later this year,
39:32 work will begin on adding the Study Edition
39:34 of the New World Translation to JW Library.
39:37 When this edition becomes available
39:39 in your language,
39:40 you will be able to discover
39:42 spiritual gems in the study notes.
39:44 And the new media gallery
39:46 will help you to visualize the people, places,
39:49 and things you read about.
39:50 You will also see the new overviews of each book,
39:53 play the introductory videos,
39:55 and study additional appendix material.
39:58 All of this and more
39:59 is coming soon to JW Library!
40:03 That sounds so exciting.
40:06 So we’ll all look forward  to getting that feature.
40:08 You said, “coming soon,” didn’t you?
40:11 Anyway,  we’d like to thank you very much
40:13 for the fact that you’ve come along  and you’ve explained so much to us
40:17 about what goes on  with MEPS Programming
40:20 and the JW Library app.
40:22 But before you go,
40:24 we’d like to ask you,  when you go back to your department,
40:27 please, take an expression  of our appreciation
40:30 back to the hard-working  brothers and sisters
40:32 who are working behind the scenes  in providing this tool for us.
40:36 Will do.
40:37 Happy to.
40:37 Thanks.
40:38 Thank you very much.
40:40 And speaking of behind the scenes,
40:43 do you remember the beautiful dramas
40:45 we had at the regional convention  last year?
40:48 One of them was  about King Hezekiah.
40:51 We saw not only  the threat Jehovah’s people faced
40:54 but also the protection  Jehovah provided.
40:58 In producing the drama,
41:00 the Audio/Video Services Department  used a lot of visual effects.
41:04 Let’s go behind the scenes  and find out what the work entailed.
41:16 The goal of our visual effects team
41:19 is to take the work done  during film production and expand it.
41:22 Our work was driven by the Bible account.
41:26 The audience needed to feel
41:28 the intimidating power of the Assyrian army
41:30 while not endangering our actors.
41:33 And the use of visual effects  had the added benefit
41:36 of drastically saving donated funds.
41:40 But this meant creating hundreds   of digital arrows, war machines,
41:45 cities, tents, soldiers,
41:48 and even an Assyrian palace.
41:50 In some cases, the foreground elements
41:52 had to be separated  from the background
41:55 so digital components could be added.
41:58 This was a time-consuming process,
42:01 as many foreground elements  had to be cut out frame by frame,
42:05 24 times for each second of video.
42:10 Our research team ensured  that the world created
42:12 was as accurate as possible.
42:14 For example,
42:15 having period-correct materials  for the temple
42:18 as well as accurate stone reliefs.
42:21 After filming was complete,
42:23 the research team noted  some scenes in the treasury
42:25 were accidentally shot  showing priests wearing sandals.
42:31 As this was inaccurate,
42:33 the issue was corrected  by generating additional digital treasures
42:36 and placing them in the foreground.
42:40 As we didn’t have  the luxury of 185,000 extras,
42:44 actors were dressed in ancient costumes   and their pictures were taken.
42:48 We then used these pictures  to create digital extras,
42:52 using crowd-simulating software
42:54 to place them in the scenes  and drive their movements.
42:59 The angel shot proved to be  one of the most challenging.
43:03 The original version didn’t have  the dramatic feel needed for the scene.
43:09 So the entire sequence was recreated
43:11 to more accurately convey  the immense power
43:14 that those present must have witnessed.
43:19 Finishing this project  on schedule had many challenges.
43:23 After hearing about just a few of them,
43:26 one industry expert said
43:27 what we were attempting was impossible.
43:30 But like Hezekiah  when hearing negative reports,
43:33 we stayed positive  and relied on Jehovah.
43:36 With His help,  the film was completed on time
43:40 and is now a wonderful tool  to bring this Bible account to life.
43:45 A beautiful drama,
43:47 and how encouraging it was
43:49 to see Jehovah rescue his people!
43:52 The 2016 regional convention  was excellent,
43:56 don’t you agree?
43:58 But you’ll be happy to know  that we have prepared a little glimpse
44:02 of what is to come  at this year’s convention
44:05 to whet your appetite.
44:10 Are you OK?
44:11 Brian, I’m worried.
44:13 You need more money.
44:15 Jehovah will take care of us.
44:16 He always has.
44:18 We have enough.
44:20 Maybe enough for today,
44:22 but what if you get sick?
44:24 Gloria’s mother keeps badgering her  and me to move up.
44:28 I can get a job  at my uncle’s real estate firm.
44:30 Maybe this is an answer  to our prayers.
44:34 What about your pioneering?
44:36 What about it?  I can do both.
44:39 Gloria, I must congratulate you
44:41 on your hard work with my company.
44:44 But you must learn  to keep your religion in its place.
44:48 We’re neglecting  family worship, study, service.
44:53 We’ve even become too busy,
44:55 or maybe too ashamed,  to even pray together.
44:59 I’m concerned about you.
45:01 One of the things  that you always talked to me about
45:03 was Matthew 6:24:
45:06 ‘You cannot slave for God and for Riches.’
45:08 You’re not the same person  that I once knew.
45:14 Dad,
45:15 where is Mom?
45:17 She is coming, right?
45:22 Is it really wrong
45:24 to try to improve our life?
45:27 Mom.
45:28 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
45:30 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
45:31 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
45:40 If you have yet to make definite plans
45:42 to attend your regional convention this year,
45:45 don’t delay.
45:46 Our conventions are a loving provision  from Jehovah.
45:50 Whatever it takes
45:52 —talking to your boss to get time off work
45:54 or making travel plans—
45:56 yes, whatever it takes,  our efforts are worth it
46:00 because we truly treasure  Jehovah’s reminders.
46:04 Jesus’ words  at Matthew 11:28
46:07 are very appropriate  considering everything
46:09 we go through  in this system of things:
46:12 “Come to me, all you who  are toiling and loaded down,
46:16 and I will refresh you.”
46:18 Yes, conventions  can be of refreshment to us,
46:22 giving us the boost we need.
46:25 But such refreshment  is also available
46:28 when the world around us  seems to be falling apart.
46:31 How does the organization  help our brothers and sisters
46:35 in times of national crisis?
46:37 We met two Witness couples who personally experienced
46:41 two of the largest terrorist attacks  in recent years.
46:52 Not a day goes by  when we don’t think
46:54 about our son, Paulie.
47:06 There was horror and suffering,
47:08 things we don’t want to witness anymore.
47:22 September 11  was a very scary, terrifying day.
47:29 As for me,
47:31 when I really understood  what was happening, I got scared.
47:34 I didn’t know what to do.
47:36 I didn’t know what to think.
47:38 I felt helpless.
47:41 When the second tower fell,
47:44 Paulie was on the 110th floor
47:47 and everybody was shouting, crying.
47:50 I was praying to Jehovah
47:53 because I was heartbroken.
48:00 We live on Voltaire Boulevard;   it’s a broad avenue.
48:03 There is a concert hall called the Bataclan.
48:06 When the doors of the Bataclan are open,
48:09 we can hear everything that goes on inside.
48:15 That night, three men  entered the Bataclan concert hall,
48:19 and they started shooting into the crowd.
48:22 We immediately grabbed our “go bag.”
48:24 And then we sat in front of the sofa,
48:27 and we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit
48:30 so we could face the situation.
48:42 It was around 10:00 p.m.  when there was a news flash
48:45 that announced that there was an attack.
48:48 I was in shock when I heard the news,
48:52 and then I immediately thought  about our brothers and sisters.
48:58 I quickly got in contact  with the circuit overseer
49:01 in order to get some news  about our brothers and sisters,
49:05 to know how they were doing.
49:07 Then,
49:09 very early the next morning,
49:11 we set up an emergency committee  made up of several brothers
49:14 from the Service Department.
49:16 We decided to write a letter  and make other arrangements
49:20 to assist the friends who,  in one way or another,
49:23 were affected by this event.
49:26 In turn,
49:27 the circuit overseer  would make an effort
49:30 to rapidly get in touch  with the elders
49:33 who oversee  the affected territory.
49:39 One of our challenges, on a personal level,
49:42 was whether we would even be able
49:44 to encourage our brothers and sisters
49:46 because we had never experienced  such a terrible event.
49:50 We organized ourselves;
49:52 we paired up as elders  and headed off to do shepherding.
49:56 We started calling midmorning  on Tuesday.
50:00 We received a report back
50:02 from all the traveling overseers
50:03 by the end of Thursday.
50:05 And unfortunately,
50:07 we learned that 14  of our brothers and sisters
50:10 had lost their lives.
50:13 We knew that we needed  to encourage the families;
50:18 we knew that we needed  to shepherd them as soon as possible.
50:22 The elders immediately came.
50:26 We went over the book of Job,
50:29 and I just listened.
50:31 You know, I was just listening.
50:33 I’ve heard the same words before,  but it was different now.
50:36 The things that were being said  went straight to my heart.
50:42 A few days later, we were visited  by two brothers from Bethel.
50:45 It was very touching  that they came to see us
50:48 and that they  were concerned about us.
50:51 It shows us that Jehovah  was aware of how we felt that night.
50:56 Our brothers were there.
50:58 They were ready  to help one another out.
51:01 Then there was  so much empathy and love shown.
51:05 When we were ultimately granted
51:06 access to ground zero
51:08 and we started encountering
51:11 the first responders,
51:13 we let them know how much  we appreciated their hard work
51:16 and that they had a skill set
51:18 that we didn’t have.
51:20 But yet our skill set
51:21 was trying  to offer comfort to them.
51:24 We shared a scripture with them.
51:27 Immediately, we could tell  that that was something
51:30 that caused emotion  to rise up in them right away.
51:33 And they expressed
51:35 great appreciation for that.
51:37 It’s one of the beautiful things  about the Scriptures
51:40 —that they’re calming,  soothing, comforting.
51:44 And the Scriptures  did not let down the workers
51:47 that were there at ground zero either.
51:51 The visit of the brothers  from Bethel was really
51:54 a gift from Jehovah.
51:56 It showed his genuine interest in us.
51:59 It was really wonderful.
52:03 After the brothers visited us,
52:05 we felt so comforted,
52:07 so encouraged,
52:09 that we said to each other:
52:11 “We have to get back in the ministry
52:14 “and comfort people in the territory.
52:16 We have to console  our brothers and sisters as well.”
52:21 We can only thank and glorify Jehovah,
52:23 who really is a God of love.
52:31 I kind of felt
52:33 Jehovah’s hand just reaching out to me,
52:36 which I needed.
52:39 But I cannot wait till the day  that I’m totally refreshed.
52:43 Where I can see,   I can actually see,
52:46 Paulie.
52:48 I can see him just coming back
52:51 into our lives,
52:53 and I want to embrace him so much.
52:59 After something like this,  we are not the same.
53:03 But
53:06 with the help of the organization
53:09 —the brothers—
53:11 Jehovah is there for us.
53:13 So that—
53:15 That is refreshing.
53:18 And I thank Jehovah a lot
53:20 for what he wants to do for me
53:24 and also for the millions of people
53:28 that feel the same way.
53:35 What these couples went through
53:37 was a horrible reminder of Satan’s rule,
53:40 but we look forward  to the relief from Jehovah
53:43 —the only true hope we have.
53:46 Reminders of Jehovah’s care,  such as these interviews,
53:50 can be ‘the joy of our heart,’  as the psalmist said.
53:54 Yes, “the reminder  of Jehovah is trustworthy,
53:57 making the inexperienced one wise.”
54:01 Before we conclude,
54:03 let’s visit our brothers  and sisters in India.
54:07 India is the second-most-populated country in the world,
54:10 with a population  of some 1.2 billion people.
54:15 The Kingdom preaching work  is conducted
54:18 by some 45,000 brothers and sisters
54:21 in 627 congregations,
54:23 and last year,
54:25 close to 125,000 people attended
54:29 the Memorial of Christ’s death.
54:32 Our visit brings us to Peermedu,
54:35 which is located in the southern tip
54:37 of the Indian Peninsula,  in the state of Kerala.
54:40 This town is located
54:43 some 914 meters,  or almost 3,000 feet, above sea level.
54:49 It is a land of spices and lush greenery,
54:52 with tea and coffee plantations.
54:55 The two congregations  there have a total of 70 publishers.
55:01 Many of them work in tea estates
55:03 and struggle to make a living.
55:06 They are eager users of the JW Library app,
55:09 which they use to share  our videos
55:11 and publications  in the ministry.
55:14 As Peermedu is a hill station,
55:17 their territory consists  of rugged and uneven terrain.
55:23 Since the congregations there are watching
55:25 this program together with all of us,
55:28 we wanted to take this opportunity
55:30 to convey their warm Christian greetings
55:33 to all of Jehovah’s people  around the world.
55:36 We love you very much.
55:39 This is JW Broadcasting
55:41 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

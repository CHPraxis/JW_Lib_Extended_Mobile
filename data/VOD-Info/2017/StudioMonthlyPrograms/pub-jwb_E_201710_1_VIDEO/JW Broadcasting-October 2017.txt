00:01 Welcome to our program.
00:03 Here’s a preview  of what we can look forward to.
00:06 This brother began  his ministry in the Congo
00:10 when his fellow Witnesses  were few in number.
00:13 How did Jehovah bless his hard work
00:16 to preach and shepherd?
00:19 It’s a joy when we come together  at Assembly Halls for spiritual programs.
00:24 But how much work goes into caring  for these places of pure worship?
00:29 We also work to maintain  peaceful relationships
00:31 with our brothers and sisters.
00:33 What lesson does this sister learn
00:35 that lets her see  the beautiful qualities in others?
00:40 And we’ll consider the privilege we have  to be fellow workers with God.
00:45 You’re watching the October 2017 edition  of JW Broadcasting.
01:10 We begin with a report  from the United States branch
01:13 in Wallkill, New York.
01:15 Any Bethel assignment is a joy  and sometimes a challenge.
01:20 Proper training is therefore  an important part of every job.
01:26 How does the Maintenance Department
01:28 train hundreds of volunteers  to work efficiently and safely?
01:33 And how do the students feel  about the practical training they receive?
01:43 There were a few factors
01:45 that created the need at Bethel
01:48 for a more structured training program.
01:50 One of those factors included the regular changeover in personnel.
01:55 The brothers have to be more versatile
01:57 in their assignments.
01:58 They may have to do tasks they
02:00 previously weren’t trained on.
02:01 Printing equipment became more technologically advanced;
02:05 our building systems became more complicated;
02:09 computer systems were now starting
02:11 to be used to control virtually everything.
02:13 Well, I feel like Bethel has definitely always been good about training,
02:17 but especially now.
02:19 I think everyone sees  the need to continue investing
02:22 in the brothers and sisters that are currently at Bethel.
02:26 I don’t think it’s possible for someone
02:28 to know less about the trades
02:30 than I did when I started.
02:31 I remember my first reaction
02:33 when I was invited to help
02:34 in electrical was fear.
02:37 So when I received my assignment,
02:39 I found out that it involved
02:41 running the heavy equipment.
02:43 So I called my parents.
02:45 I was really excited about it.
02:47 I said, “Mom and Dad, guess what I get to do?”
02:49 And Dad said, “OK, Son.
02:51 Well, did you tell them that you don’t know how to drive?”
02:56 It was decided to pull a group
02:58 of highly experienced,  highly skilled brothers
03:01 to concentrate  on developing and teaching
03:05 repeatable, consistent classes
03:07 that could bring people’s skill levels up to what was needed.
03:12 We teach well over 100 different classes
03:14 in 12 major categories.
03:16 Here at Bethel,  I’ve probably been
03:18 a part of over 30 different classes,
03:20 so it’s been a variety,  depending on
03:23 the needs at the time  of the assignment.
03:25 I would estimate  that I’ve taken about 15
03:28 or 20 different courses from safety and training
03:31 over the course of my 13 years  in learning a trade.
03:33 I’ve become certified
03:35 in at least these seven different licensed requirements.
03:39 We teach people technical skills,
03:40 but that’s not the sole purpose
03:42 of the training.
03:43 If you aren’t skilled in safety,
03:44 you can’t be skilled in your trade and vice versa.
03:46 The objective in all of our safety courses
03:49 is to get them to view safety the same way Jehovah views it
03:53 —as a reflection of their spirituality.
03:56 So training in safety is essential.
03:59 So our goal is to take them
04:00 into the classroom
04:01 and give them some time
04:02 to consider the theoretical.
04:04 And then we take them out
04:05 where there is a lab set up,  and we have them do some tests on it.
04:08 Typically, they will tell us
04:10 that they’ve been able to learn  more in a week
04:13 than what they have learned in a year of trade school.
04:16 We’ve done over 60,000 instances of training.
04:20 And so now receiving this training,
04:22 it provides an area or an aspect
04:25 in which I can give  my 100 percent to Jehovah.
04:28 You see it in their eyes.
04:30 They’re just so happy
04:31 that they now have maybe a new skill
04:34 or a new understanding that they can use to benefit Jehovah.
04:38 I love the fact that I came into Bethel with virtually no experience.
04:42 And not only did I  receive a trade that I could use
04:46 to carry out a work  that glorifies Jehovah
04:50 but I was trained well enough that I can share that with others,
04:53 and they can be trained too.
04:54 Helping someone else  to go from that feeling
04:58 of not knowing anything  to feeling productive
05:01 and feeling like they’re  contributing is a real joy for me.
05:04 And they can take what they learn
05:06 wherever they go.
05:07 The confidence that people leave with once they’ve received
05:11 that investment —it’s confidence that they can carry out
05:14 whatever assignment Jehovah has given them,
05:16 and the confidence that Jehovah is going to train them
05:18 for whatever is being asked of them.
05:21 I think if younger brothers and sisters
05:23 are trying to learn a skill so that they can come to Bethel,
05:26 that’s commendable,  but more important is spirituality.
05:30 Let Jehovah “finish your training.”
05:32 In regard to training, we’re really only getting started.
05:34 The training that we are getting  in this system of things by Jehovah,
05:38 and especially related to safety,
05:41 is absolutely going to be vital in the new world.
05:44 I can imagine the idea
05:46 of being able to use some of the things I’ve learned
05:48 to figure out how
05:50 we can use the natural resources in a way without using them up.
05:53 We know that we serve a God  who is known as the “Grand Instructor.”
05:56 So the things that we’re teaching and training right now,
05:59 it can only expand in the future.
06:02 And as long as you let him train you, you’re going to be all right.
06:09 Good training gives us confidence  to do our best for Jehovah.
06:14 That’s true at Bethel  but also true in the field.
06:19 Have you, though,  ever felt alone in your assignment,
06:22 even if for just a few hours in the ministry?
06:26 Brother Pontien Mukanga may have felt that way early in his assignment.
06:31 He was the first circuit overseer for all of what is now
06:35 the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo.
06:40 He traveled great distances to visit the few brothers throughout the territory.
06:46 Listen to what encouraged him the most to keep going.
06:52 In 1960,
06:54 I was made a circuit overseer for the whole of Congo.
06:59 I was so happy to receive this privilege.
07:03 But I was shocked and scared.
07:06 The assignment was huge.
07:09 Congo is a vast country.
07:12 I was afraid to go to places I didn’t know.
07:17 I felt overwhelmed,  so I turned to Jehovah.
07:22 Sometimes I had to go through savannahs and across the jungle.
07:27 There were wild animals.
07:29 One day, I climbed up a tree to find a place to sleep.
07:34 I tied myself to a branch with my belt.
07:37 I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.
07:42 I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.
07:46 Visiting the brothers was very difficult.
07:49 Sometimes the journey took many days.
07:53 I remember one day,  I left my house
07:55 to visit the brothers to encourage them.
08:01 I left at 5:30 in the morning,
08:04 and I arrived at 7:30 that night.
08:08 I had to push my bicycle through sand
08:10 for up to 13 miles (21 km) or even more.
08:14 Other times, we traveled by truck.
08:16 That was not easy.
08:18 You had to climb on top of the truck.
08:23 I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.
08:27 Congregations, isolated groups were far away from one another.
08:33 There were no phones at that time either.
08:36 Even though they did not know I was coming,
08:39 they made me feel so welcome.
08:44 The brothers were really very hospitable.
08:48 When I arrived,
08:50 I was exhausted but so happy to see the brothers.
08:58 The Kitawala was a religion.
09:02 They sent many letters to the Belgium branch
09:04 asking to be recognized as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
09:09 These people used
09:10 our publications and used the name Watch Tower.
09:17 It created a lot of confusion.
09:21 To clarify the matter,
09:23 the organization prepared a booklet.
09:28 My mission was to check whether
09:30 there were any genuine Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kisangani.
09:36 We found out that these people were
09:39 not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
09:43 In all the confusion,  people even tried to kill me
09:47 during the trip.
09:49 Fortunately, I managed to escape.
09:54 Since it was Jehovah who assigned me this privilege,
09:59 I was confident that he would always help me.
10:07 And today, I am very happy
10:09 to have at my side my children,  my grandchildren,
10:13 and my great-grandchildren —all Jehovah’s Witnesses.
10:19 Jehovah has given me many blessings.
10:22 I am truly grateful.
10:25 What a joy to be used by Almighty God.
10:30 Through all these years, I have never lacked anything.
10:36 Jehovah has given me the strength
10:38 to serve him up until now—to the age of 86.
10:43 In everything and for everything,
10:47 my trust really is in Jehovah.
10:51 There were 46 publishers
10:53 in the whole of Congo.
10:55 Today, I hear there are more than
10:58 223,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
11:00 in the Congo.
11:05 Today, when I see
11:08 the increase of Jehovah’s people,
11:14 to me it is like a miracle.
11:19 I thank Jehovah  for allowing me to see
11:23 ‘the little one become a thousand’
11:25 here in the Congo.
11:36 Brother Mukanga continues to serve as an elder at nearly 88 years old.
11:43 Can you imagine yourself experiencing both the joys
11:46 and difficulties he had as a circuit overseer?
11:50 He courageously visited the Kitawala religious groups
11:54 who claimed to serve Jehovah,
11:56 only to find some were violent and practiced immorality.
12:01 But it was his reliance on Jehovah
12:04 and watching Him turn the small group of brothers
12:07 into more than 200,000 that has kept him going.
12:13 He personally experienced  our theme for this program:
12:16 “The Privilege and Blessing  of Being God’s Fellow Worker.”
12:22 As Jehovah’s people,
12:24 we enjoy many undeserved
12:26 and precious privileges.
12:28 Among them, we bear Jehovah’s name
12:32 and render him sacred service.
12:34 As we carry out his will,
12:37 he dignifies us in a very special way.
12:41 At 1 Corinthians 3:9, the apostle Paul under inspiration
12:46 stated that “we are God’s fellow workers.”
12:51 What an honor to be a fellow worker with the Universal Sovereign,
12:55 our loving heavenly Father!
12:58 To build appreciation for the privilege of working with Jehovah,
13:02 we’re going to review events in the life of Jonathan, a son of King Saul.
13:08 First Samuel 14:45  describes Jonathan when it says:
13:12 “For it was with God that he acted this day.”
13:17 What was the background that led to this statement?
13:20 How did Jonathan act, or work, with Jehovah on that day?
13:25 What lessons can we learn from their working relationship?
13:30 And what blessings result from being a fellow worker with God?
13:35 Let us begin with some background.
13:39 First Samuel 12:20
13:43 records the encouraging words
13:45 spoken by the prophet Samuel  to the nation of Israel:
13:48 “Do not be afraid.  . . .
13:50 “Only do not turn away from following Jehovah,
13:54 and serve Jehovah  with all your heart.”
13:56 Verse 22 adds:
13:59 “For the sake of his great name,
14:01 Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
14:05 As long as they remained faithful,
14:07 Jehovah would always be there to guide, protect, and rescue them.
14:13 These words no doubt strengthened Jonathan to carry out Jehovah’s directive
14:17 to subdue the enemy nations
14:19 and take possession of the Promised Land.
14:23 At  1 Samuel chapter 13,
14:26 we read that Jonathan  was assigned 1,000 men
14:29 to attack a Philistine garrison at Geba.
14:33 Although poorly equipped, Jonathan and his men succeeded.
14:38 This victory strengthened  Jonathan’s confidence in Jehovah
14:42 and provides a valuable lesson for us:
14:46 While we gain strength and courage
14:48 from Jehovah’s reassuring words of the Scriptures,
14:51 our confidence in Jehovah’s support becomes even stronger
14:55 when we successfully carry out our assignments
14:58 that may seem overwhelming.
15:02 The account then relates how the Philistines
15:04 were infuriated over their defeat and mounted a massive counterattack.
15:10 They sent out raiding parties
15:12 from their camp  at Michmash near Jerusalem.
15:15 Many Israelite men hid out of fear,
15:17 and some even fled to the other side of the Jordan River.
15:22 In contrast, Jonathan remained courageous.
15:27 Determined to put a stop to the raids,
15:29 he confronted the Philistine outpost
15:32 at the ravine pass of Michmash.
15:35 The approach was by way of a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs.
15:41 This would have seemed next to impossible to someone unfamiliar with the area,
15:46 but Jonathan grew up in this territory and apparently knew it well.
15:52 His knowledge of the surroundings provides another practical lesson:
15:57 Whatever theocratic assignment we may be given,
16:00 putting forth time and effort  to get to know the terrain,
16:04 so to speak, will contribute to our effectiveness.
16:08 When we show interest in our assigned work,
16:10 we become even more effective fellow workers of Jehovah.
16:15 Let’s read as Jonathan prepares to take action against the Philistines.
16:21 First Samuel 14:6 states:
16:24 “So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:
16:26 “‘Come and let us cross over  to the outpost of these uncircumcised men.
16:31 “‘Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf,
16:34 for nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few.’”
16:40 What contributed to his confidence in Jehovah?
16:44 Recall that he put faith in Jehovah’s reassuring words
16:47 through the prophet Samuel:  “Do not be afraid. . . .
16:51 For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
16:57 He experienced Jehovah’s support
16:59 when he struck down the Philistine garrison at Geba.
17:04 Jonathan could also think back on Israel’s history.
17:08 He could reflect on how Gideon and his 300 men
17:11 were victorious over 135,000 Midianites.
17:16 He could meditate on Samson killing 1,000 Philistines
17:20 with the jawbone of a donkey.
17:24 Such examples  would bolster his confidence
17:27 that he was working  with the Almighty God, Jehovah.
17:33 We too can meditate on fellow workers of God recorded in the Scriptures
17:37 as well as published life stories of modern-day faithful servants.
17:42 Such examples reinforce our faith in Jehovah
17:45 as we rely on him for success.
17:50 Another lesson comes from the response of Jonathan’s armor-bearer
17:54 at 1 Samuel 14:7:
17:56 “At this his armor-bearer said to him:
17:59 “‘Do whatever your heart impels you to do.
18:02 “‘Turn wherever you wish,
18:05 and I will follow you  wherever your heart impels you.’”
18:09 It is unlikely that the attendant
18:11 would have initiated this challenging mission on his own.
18:15 Jonathan’s confident lead was a positive,  motivating influence on the man.
18:22 What happens today when elders and overseers
18:25 take the lead and display zeal in Jehovah’s work like Jonathan?
18:30 Others in the congregation are also motivated to action by their fine example.
18:37 Let us now read verses 8-10:
18:40 “Then Jonathan said:
18:42 “‘We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them.
18:47 “‘If they say to us, “Stand still until we come to you!”
18:51 “‘we will stand where we are and not go up to them.
18:55 “‘But if they say, “Come up against us!”
18:58 “‘we will go up, because Jehovah  will give them into our hand.
19:03 This will be our sign.’”
19:06 Jonathan once again demonstrated humble reliance on Jehovah.
19:11 Later in Second Samuel,
19:13 Jonathan is described as “swifter than the eagles”
19:16 and “mightier than the lions.”
19:19 However, these qualities and abilities did not cause him
19:23 to be self-reliant or overconfident.
19:27 He sought Jehovah’s direction by means of a sign.
19:32 What a powerful reminder for us!
19:35 Regardless of any natural abilities,
19:38 acquired skills, or experience we may have,
19:41 the key to success is seeking Jehovah’s guidance and support.
19:46 We seek his direction through specific prayers,
19:50 Bible reading and meditation,
19:52 and applying direction from “the faithful and discreet slave.”
19:58 We also consult  with longtime faithful brothers and sisters
20:01 who can share their rich experience as God’s fellow workers.
20:07 One such example was Sister Joey Orrom,
20:11 who served in the Britain branch.
20:14 She shared her experiences  in an archived interview
20:18 some time before finishing  her earthly course in 2011.
20:24 Listen also to the comments  of her fellow workers in Britain
20:28 who benefited from their time together.
20:35 I had the privilege for two years
20:37 of sitting at the same table as Sister Orrom for morning worship.
20:40 She expected nothing and appreciated
20:42 everything that you did for her.
20:44 Sister Orrom was affectionately known as Joey.
20:48 And if you take the “e” out of Joey,
20:50 you’re left with the English word “joy,”
20:53 and that summed her up.
20:55 My impression of Joey when I first met her
20:57 was here is this frail old lady.
21:00 But then when you started to speak to Joey,
21:03 you were tapping into a tremendous depth.
21:06 About the age of 20,
21:08 round about that time,
21:09 I had the heavenly calling.
21:11 That was a big battle.
21:12 I couldn’t understand why Jehovah would use a person like me.
21:16 And when I was 21,
21:19 I got into pioneering, in 1939.
21:21 But the police were after me
21:23 because I wouldn’t join the armed forces, and I was tried under a new act.
21:27 And they kept taking me into a side room and saying,
21:30 “If you will say you are not connected with Jehovah’s Witnesses,
21:32 not connected with the Watch Tower, you’ll have a walk away.”
21:36 I said: “I am connected with the Watch Tower.
21:38 I’m proud to be connected with the Watch Tower.”
21:40 And they said, “Then they are directing you.”
21:44 I said, “No, my stand of not doing as you wish is my own personal stand.”
21:49 So this went on.
21:50 In the end, they sent me to prison just for two months
21:52 and then let me out.
21:54 I partnered with another sister,
21:56 and she and I went to Northern Ireland
21:59 and pioneered there for 18 months.
22:01 And it was in Northern Ireland that we had our call to Gilead.
22:03 In 1948, Joey was invited to Gilead,
22:06 and that was the 11th class.
22:08 It left an impression on me,  which I will never ever, ever forget.
22:12 You pick up that spirit  of good behavior, of love.
22:16 It’s something that leaves its mark, or it should.
22:18 It has left its mark on me —very, very much so.
22:22 One thing Brother Knorr impressed on us:
22:24 “You’ll be three years on your assignment before you really love it.”
22:28 And it was true  because it was a hard assignment.
22:31 After Gilead,  she was assigned to be a missionary
22:35 in Dublin, in the Irish Republic.
22:37 That was the time when Catholic priests
22:39 used to organize mobs against the pioneers.
22:42 She was full of joy,  but that didn’t mean to say
22:44 that she’d had an easy life.
22:46 We never went out from door to door without being mobbed
22:49 and attacked and beaten up and thrown around.
22:52 And you could only do a few houses in a row,
22:54 and you’d have to get away very quickly.
22:57 But we made a very good name.
22:58 People got to know we were completely neutral.
23:01 They chose four of us to work the business property,
23:04 and I got some studies going in their offices.
23:06 But one place I went into, I walked the length of this draper shop,
23:10 and I asked if I could go into the manager’s office.
23:14 As I went in, I didn’t say a word.
23:16 I didn’t open my mouth and even say good morning,
23:19 but this man stood up, and he said, “Russellite!”
23:22 And he took hold of me by the scruff of my neck
23:25 and the seat of my pants, and he lifted me up
23:27 and he carried me the length of the store.
23:30 Well, like a silly one, I should’ve gone heavy on him, you see.
23:35 But instead of that,  I let my legs paddle
23:37 and I was hanging onto my book bag, not wanting to lose it.
23:40 And when he got  to the front door, the staff,
23:42 their eyes were absolutely aghast at what was happening.
23:45 He opened his front door and threw me out, literally.
23:48 And I went zoom! just managed to go zoom!
23:51 And one of the brothers was passing,
23:54 and he caught me —caught me steady—
23:56 and said,  “Whatever is going on?”
23:58 And I couldn’t stop laughing.
24:00 To me it was very, very funny.
24:02 The rest were so cross about it, but I wasn’t at all cross.
24:05 I thought it was quite hilarious.
24:07 I could see myself being carried through this shop sky-high.
24:10 Things like that happened.
24:12 These experiences  did not dampen her zeal.
24:15 She always retained that missionary spirit.
24:18 I first met Joey
24:20 when I was commuting to Bethel
24:21 in the infirmary.
24:23 She was sitting on that old-fashioned chair with this huge Bible,
24:27 and she stayed there hours reading the Bible,
24:31 praying to Jehovah.
24:32 Often, when you came in,  she’d be in the middle of Bible reading.
24:35 And she’d be saying something like,
24:37 “Daniel has just been thrown into the lion’s den!”
24:39 or “Oh, Jehovah is really angry.
24:41 He’s thundering from the heavens!”
24:43 And it made me think, ‘Wow!
24:44 ‘She must have read the Bible so many times,
24:46 but every time it was as if it was happening right in front of her.’
24:49 Right up until she became incapacitated,
24:53 she was conducting Bible studies
24:55 and helping people to come to know Jehovah.
24:57 She was looking forward to her heavenly reward.
25:01 And for her that was the culmination
25:04 of a life of joy in Jehovah’s service
25:06 and that she was just transferring to her next assignment.
25:10 I’m very, very grateful for work.
25:12 In fact, often in my prayers,
25:14 I’ll pray to Jehovah that I’ll have some good work to do today.
25:16 I’m very grateful to have work to do.
25:26 Similar to what we  learned about Jonathan,
25:29 Sister Orrom demonstrated  humble reliance on Jehovah.
25:33 So sure was her trust in God
25:36 that she could face even fearful situations
25:39 with a sense of humor.
25:41 We may not be able to laugh  when enduring persecution,
25:44 but we can imitate Joey’s faith  and firm resolve.
25:50 What else can we learn from Jonathan’s account?
25:54 Picking up at 1 Samuel 14:12,
25:58 Jonathan and his armor-bearer advance toward the Philistines.
26:04 From their elevated location, the Philistines shout to them:
26:08 “‘Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson!’
26:12 “At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:
26:15 “‘Follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.’”
26:21 Jonathan had requested a specific sign, and he got it.
26:25 But it meant advancing  up a steep and treacherous incline
26:30 right into enemy hands.
26:33 Someone lacking complete trust  in Jehovah might have said,
26:36 “Before proceeding, perhaps we should ask for another sign,”
26:41 but not Jonathan.
26:44 Without hesitation, he told his attendant to follow him
26:47 because Jehovah would give the enemy into their hand.
26:51 When we receive Jehovah’s direction,
26:54 we should without hesitation put our hearts into the work,
26:57 confident of Jehovah’s backing.
27:01 What happened next?
27:03 First Samuel 14:13, 14 reports:
27:08 “And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet,
27:12 “and his armor-bearer was behind him;
27:15 “and the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan,
27:19 “and his armor-bearer was putting  them to death behind him.
27:22 “In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made,
27:26 they struck down about 20 men.”
27:29 Even after receiving a clear sign from Jehovah,
27:32 it took great effort.
27:34 They had to ‘climb up on their hands and feet,’
27:38 exerting themselves vigorously over rugged terrain.
27:42 The lesson?
27:44 Even when we receive clear direction and are ready to obey,
27:49 carrying out our assignments will not always be easy.
27:54 We have to exert ourselves vigorously,
27:56 being willing to work hard  with all of our mind, heart, and strength.
28:03 How did the Philistines react to seeing Jehovah’s support for his people?
28:08 First Samuel 14:15 reads:
28:10 “Then terror spread in the field camp
28:13 “and among all the people of the outpost,
28:16 “and even the raiding parties were terrified.
28:19 The earth began quaking,  and a terror from God ensued.”
28:25 The earthquake Jehovah caused melted the Philistines’ hearts.
28:29 Soon, the Israelites, even those  who had previously fled in fear,
28:33 joined the victory battle over the Philistines.
28:38 Likewise, when we put our hearts  into theocratic assignments,
28:42 Jehovah, our best Fellow Worker,
28:46 will always come through with whatever we need to accomplish his will.
28:52 But there is another lesson to be learned from this exciting Bible account.
28:56 During the height of the battle,
28:58 King Saul gave an unwise order saying:
29:03 “Cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening
29:06 and until I have taken  vengeance on my enemies!”
29:11 Jonathan, however, was not aware of his father’s order
29:15 and ate some wild honey  that he had found.
29:19 How did Saul react when he discovered that his own son had disobeyed him?
29:25 First Samuel 14:43, 44 tells us:
29:30 “Then Saul said to Jonathan:
29:33 “‘Tell me, what have you done?’
29:36 “So Jonathan told him:
29:38 “‘I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand.
29:44 “Here I am!  I am ready to die!’
29:47 “At this Saul said:
29:49 “‘Thus may God do and may he add to it
29:52 if you do not die, Jonathan.’”
29:56 Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done
29:59 in risking his life in behalf of his people
30:02 and seeing Jehovah grant so much success,
30:05 he is now being condemned to death by his own father.
30:11 How his heart must have sank in disbelief,
30:14 disappointment, and sadness!
30:19 Would Jehovah now abandon  his loyal fellow worker?
30:23 First Samuel 14:45 reads:
30:26 “But the people said to Saul:
30:29 “‘Should Jonathan die
30:32 “‘—the one who brought this great victory to Israel?
30:34 “‘It is unthinkable!
30:36 “‘As surely as Jehovah is alive,
30:39 “‘not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground,
30:42 “for it was with God that he acted this day.’
30:47 With that the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.”
30:53 Jonathan’s success provided undeniable evidence
30:56 that he was truly Jehovah’s fellow worker.
31:00 Jehovah, who had been at Jonathan’s side the whole time,
31:04 saw everything that had happened
31:06 and would not allow his loyal worker to die at Saul’s hands.
31:12 How comforting to know that when we faithfully carry out our assignments,
31:16 he will never forget our zealous efforts!
31:20 If someone as close as a father
31:23 fails to see and appreciate  the work we do in Jehovah’s service
31:27 or even turns against us, Jehovah will never forget our work.
31:32 He will always be there to guide,
31:35 support, protect, and bless us.
31:40 What a faith-building account
31:42 we’ve considered  in 1 Samuel chapters 13 and 14!
31:46 Why not take the time to read these chapters for yourself?
31:50 You’ll be moved to imitate Jonathan’s excellent example of loyalty,
31:54 courage, and obedience.
31:58 We want to be described  just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14:45:
32:03 “For it was with God that he acted this day.”
32:08 By continuing  as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah,
32:11 we are assured that ‘through faith and patience
32:14 we will inherit the promised reward.’
32:20 Let’s look at another example  of modern-day fellow workers with God.
32:25 Assembly Hall servants  care for the cleaning
32:28 and maintenance  of these places of worship,
32:31 but they don’t do this work alone.
32:34 In this report from the United States,
32:37 we’ll see how the work is organized,
32:40 and we’ll hear how  our brothers and sisters
32:42 feel about being able  to help with the work.
32:47 The Assembly Hall is an educational center.
32:50 This is a center of pure worship  for all the congregations that come.
32:57 Taking care of Jehovah’s house
32:59 is part of sacred service.
33:01 Even going back to the temple,
33:03 everyone had an assignment.
33:05 They had someone to open the doors.
33:07 So, of course, they also had  somebody maintaining things.
33:13 As of December 2016,
33:16 there are 773 Assembly Halls worldwide.
33:19 There are so many details  at an Assembly Hall;
33:21 you can’t do it all yourself.
33:23 To be overseer of an Assembly Hall—
33:26 We were excited to do it,  but it seemed real heavy at the time.
33:35 It does take,
33:36 in our particular case, a couple of hundred.
33:38 There are about 200 or so volunteers
33:41 each and every week
33:44 that really are necessary
33:46 to care for the Assembly Hall —the grounds,
33:49 the accounting, the purchasing,
33:51 the maintenance,
33:53 and the cleaning.
33:55 Each and every one of these chairs —the seating—
33:58 all have moving parts  and have to be maintained.
34:01 And with 4,050 seats in here,
34:05 we can say that every single one  of them has been maintained.
34:12 John 2:17 says:  “The zeal for your house will consume me.”
34:16 And I think we have  an opportunity to show Jehovah that
34:19 —that we have zeal,  we have an eagerness, a fire for his house,
34:24 and for caring for it.
34:26 So we appreciate all those  who want to work at the Assembly Hall.
34:30 So many of the dear friends,  after they just spent a whole day
34:33 doing some terribly dirty job,  they thank you for the privilege.
34:38 Well, that’s zeal for Jehovah’s house.
34:40 Nowhere else does that happen.
34:42 And if we tried to do it ourselves  or if we hired somebody,
34:45 it wouldn’t be as good as the work  that the friends do when they come in.
34:50 When the friends come on the weekend,
34:52 this is an educational facility.
34:54 So they come here
34:55 to be educated about Jehovah.
34:57 And new ones come,
34:59 and it needs to be dignified
35:01 and reflect Jehovah’s qualities.
35:05 So the cleaning that goes on  and the maintenance that goes on
35:09 —that’s what the purpose is.
35:14 At lunchtime, we do a spiritual program.
35:17 It could be a talk;  it could be a discussion.
35:21 And we, really,  generally try to cover a topic
35:25 that helps the volunteers  see the connection
35:27 between their work  at the Assembly Hall
35:30 and the Kingdom preaching work.
35:33 We are preachers.
35:34 That’s number one —to spread the good news.
35:37 And we see the results of that here.
35:40 We’re filling this place up.
35:51 It’s a real privilege.
35:53 You learn so much  from the sacrifices that the friends make
35:57 in order to serve Jehovah
36:00 that it makes us feel very small,  and we realize
36:03 what a blessing it is for us to be  in that environment all the time.
36:08 The goal of any work in Jehovah’s service
36:10 is to help as many people as you can
36:12 to come to know him
36:13 and to take care of his interests
36:15 here on the earth.
36:16 And we all have the same goal
36:18 —trying to please him  and doing what we can.
36:25 Our goal, really, as Assembly Hall servants
36:29 is to take care of the place in such a way
36:34 —take care of the Assembly Hall  in such a way—
36:37 that not only saves and makes wise use
36:40 of dedicated funds and resources
36:43 but also makes things ready  in such a way
36:46 that on Saturday morning  when the brothers and sisters walk in
36:48 and the attendants and the sound
36:51 and the stage brothers are getting ready,
36:53 all they really have to do  is come on in and flip the switches
36:56 —lights come on, air conditioning, heat.
36:59 Everything is functioning.
37:00 All they have to do  is just focus on the program
37:03 and listen and take in instruction.
37:06 That’s what we’re asked to do —listen and take in instruction.
37:09 And we can do that when we’re  not distracted by anything else.
37:12 So if everything
37:14 works well on an assembly day,
37:16 we know we’ve done our job.
37:23 We can remember  these hard-working brothers and sisters
37:26 in our prayers,
37:28 and we can do our part to help them.
37:31 If possible, volunteer to assist
37:33 with your congregation’s  cleaning assignment
37:35 at your next assembly.
37:37 Or ask about the arrangement  for maintaining Assembly Halls in your area.
37:42 A few are needed to take the lead,
37:45 but they need our help  to get the work done.
37:50 The same is true with the great amount  of work in the congregation.
37:54 In our discussion about Jonathan,
37:56 we mentioned  the zealous example of our elders.
38:01 Are the elders “leaders”
38:03 or do they “take the lead”?
38:05 What’s the difference?
38:07 Brother Geoffrey Jackson explains  in this Bethel morning worship.
38:12 While meditating on the text this morning,
38:15 I was reminded of an experience
38:17 I had many years ago as a missionary.
38:20 At the time,
38:20 I was studying with a young man
38:23 who was training to be a pastor
38:25 in his church.
38:26 This man had got to the point where he started to attend all our meetings
38:31 while at the same time still attending his church gatherings.
38:36 The church, obviously, was very disturbed
38:38 about the fact that he was coming to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
38:42 and their headquarters sent in a missionary from overseas
38:45 to try and rectify the situation.
38:47 The young man told me what happened.
38:50 He said the missionary asked him,
38:52 “What is it that impresses you about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”
38:55 He said, “Well, one of the things is that they do the preaching work.”
39:00 The missionary replied,  “Well, our church can do that too.”
39:04 So the next time they had a service,
39:08 the missionary conducted the service  and with great zeal and enthusiasm
39:12 demanded that everyone in the church take part in the preaching work.
39:17 He announced the time that they would have the group to go preaching.
39:21 The young man told me  quite a number of people came along.
39:24 But there was just one thing missing, you guessed it, the missionary.
39:28 He felt that it was enough
39:30 just to encourage everybody else to do it without engaging in it himself.
39:36 How different was the example of Jesus and of our hard-working elders
39:41 who do take the lead with regard to the preaching work.
39:45 Now let’s take our Bibles and turn to a very interesting scripture
39:49 in Hebrews 13:7, 17.
39:54 Now, I’d like to highlight the beauty of the New World Translation
39:58 in these two verses.
40:00 You see at the beginning of verse 7:
40:02 “Remember those who are taking the lead among you.”
40:05 And then verse 17:
40:07 “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you.”
40:12 If you look at other Bibles, whether new or old,
40:16 most of them say “your leaders.”
40:19 Now, obviously, the New World Translation Committee
40:23 had in mind Jesus’ comments with regard
40:26 to no one being a leader among us,
40:29 and although it’s a different word in the Greek text,
40:32 still in English we can’t help but be sensitive to that matter.
40:36 And so this accurate translation of saying “taking the lead”
40:40 really summarizes, doesn’t it, what the role is of an elder.
40:45 We’re not leaders,  but we set the right example.
40:49 Now, this accurate translation is also portrayed
40:53 in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ  as recorded in Luke chapter 22,
40:58 and you’ll be interested to note
41:01 that this is part of the revision of the New World Translation text.
41:05 Luke 22:26,  it now portrays accurately
41:10 the fact that both expressions in Hebrew
41:13 and this one here are the same word.
41:17 So, Luke 22:26,
41:21 it says:  “You, though, are not to be that way.
41:25 But let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest.”
41:29 And then notice:  “and the one taking the lead,”
41:33 now this is the same expression as in the Hebrews,
41:36 “as the one ministering.”
41:39 So, obviously, to take the lead means to do the work,
41:44 to be a minister, to be a servant, to serve others.
41:48 This also reminds me,  many years ago,
41:50 when I worked with the translation team in the Pacific nation of Samoa.
41:55 At that point, we were trying to select an accurate expression
41:59 to convey this thought of “taking the lead.”
42:02 And there were two words eventually that the brothers
42:05 were trying to select between,  or choose between.
42:08 One was the word ta’ita’i and the other ta’imua.
42:11 Now, you don’t have to remember those words,
42:14 but as a foreigner, I didn’t really understand
42:18 the subtleties between the difference of the two words.
42:20 So I asked the brothers,  “How can you explain to me
42:23 what these two words mean?”
42:25 So one of the brothers was very eloquent.
42:28 He said: “Well, just imagine a procession, a parade.
42:32 “So a ta’ita’i is the old man who sits
42:36 “on the side of the road barking out the orders:
42:39 “‘You should do it this way; you should do it that way.’
42:41 “The ta’imua, on the other hand,  is the one right in the front of the parade
42:46 taking the lead and everyone’s following him.”
42:49 Which word do you think we selected?
42:52 Doesn’t that summarize nicely just exactly what’s involved with being an elder?
42:57 It’s not a matter of sitting on the sidelines barking out orders
43:01 but getting involved,
43:03 setting the right example, and then others following.
43:06 And this is in harmony with one Greek lexicon
43:09 that describes this expression this way, it says,
43:12 “The concept of leading can be expressed
43:15 “by showing how to do something,
43:18 “demonstrating how we ought to do it,
43:20 and going ahead showing the way.”
43:23 Of course, on the other hand, some religions even view
43:27 the expression “elder” as a title.
43:30 You’ve probably heard of them introducing themselves,
43:33 “Good morning, I’m Elder Jackson.”
43:36 Well, of course, none of us would want to view
43:38 being an elder as a title in the sense of a position
43:43 that lords it over others.
43:45 And with that in mind, another subtlety to the revision
43:48 is seen in 1 Timothy chapter 3,
43:51 so please turn there with me,
43:54 1 Timothy 3:1.
43:58 These are well-known words
44:01 —particularly when brothers are considering the qualifications for elders—
44:06 but you may or may not have seen
44:09 the subtleties of the change here in this revision.
44:12 It says now: “This statement is trustworthy:
44:17 “If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,
44:20 he is desirous of a fine work.”
44:24 Do you remember before  the original New World Translation said:
44:29 ‘If someone is reaching out  for the office of being an overseer?’
44:34 And that reflected and no doubt was influenced
44:37 by the King James  and many of the older translations
44:41 that translated it that way.
44:44 But when we look at the rest of the verse,
44:46 we see that it’s not the office, or the position,
44:50 of being an overseer that someone reaches out for;
44:54 rather, it’s the work.
44:56 Yes, the hard work that needs  to be done by an overseer.
45:00 An overseer recognizes
45:04 that he needs to work hard at setting the right example,
45:08 and then others will follow
45:10 —rather than just telling everyone what they should do.
45:14 So when we look at these subtleties in the New World Translation,
45:18 it only helps us to appreciate it even more, doesn’t it?
45:21 So with this in mind,
45:22 what does our text this morning help us to keep in mind?
45:26 Well, as elders, what do we need to do?
45:30 Not sit on the sidelines barking out orders but, rather,
45:35 to take the lead, be in the forefront, do the work,
45:39 and then others will follow our example,
45:41 just as we follow the example of Jesus.
45:45 The Bible gives us a clear understanding
45:48 of what Jehovah wants us  to do in the congregation.
45:51 Elders take the lead by doing the work,
45:54 and we follow their good example.
45:58 Applying God’s Word  contributes to our being fellow workers
46:01 under peaceful conditions.
46:04 But we could be distracted
46:06 even when our brothers  and sisters are right there with us.
46:10 What are these distractions?
46:12 Let’s see in this music video.
46:24 Think—think outside the box. Be someone who talks.
46:30 Don’t waste away behind that tiny screen
46:33 ’Cause you know  that there’s much more to life
46:37 Than friend requests and likes. Think of all the things we haven’t seen.
46:43 Well, you—
46:44 You’ll never see them if you’re focused on the superficial.
46:48 You need real friends,  if you know what I mean.
46:52 Look at me. Can you see
46:56 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
47:01 Look at me. Do you know
47:05 What I know? That you belong.
47:10 Put down the phone, and look at me.
47:17 Take—take the time to see. See what others see.
47:22 Don’t trade that plastic box for all your friends.
47:25 You can make friends you know are true, Who love Jehovah too,
47:32 Who’ll stand right  by your side until the end.
47:35 But, you—
47:36 You’ll never meet them if you’re focused on the superficial.
47:40 You need real friends, if you know what I mean.
47:44 Look at me. Can you see
47:48 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
47:54 Look at me. Do you know
47:58 What I know? That you belong.
48:02 Put down the phone, and look at me.
48:23 Don’t let it play you for a fool.
48:29 What you’re getting  could be fact or could be fiction.
48:33 Life in the cloud can be so cruel.
48:38 Why don’t you come back down to earth, converse, and reverse the addiction?
49:04 Put—put down your device ’Cause if you don’t think twice,
49:10 The best in life will surely pass you by.
49:13 Look, listen, taste, and touch— The things we love so much
49:19 Have been here all along.  All you need to do is
49:24 Realize what’s in your hand is only superficial.
49:28 You’ve got real friends,  if you know what I mean.
49:32 Look at me. Can you see
49:36 What I see? Around the world, this happy family.
49:42 Look at me. Do you know
49:46 What I know? That you belong.
49:50 Put down the phone, and look at me.
49:53 Can you see What I see?
49:58 Around the world, this happy family.
50:01 Look at me. Do you know
50:05 What I know? That you belong.
50:09 Put down the phone, and look at me.
50:14 Time spent with our brothers  and sisters is precious.
50:18 Make the most of it  by setting aside anything
50:22 that could distract  from the interchange of encouragement.
50:26 Sometimes, though,  our viewpoint of ones in the congregation
50:30 hides their true beauty that Jehovah sees.
50:34 How does the sister  in this dramatization learn that lesson and,
50:39 in turn,  become more beautiful herself?
51:04 My name is Miki.
51:06 I moved here one year ago.
51:09 Everyone was so nice and friendly.
51:20 Well, that’s how I felt in the beginning.
51:38 I am not your babysitter!
51:48 Didn’t you see we were talking?
52:02 Come on!  This is not a park!
52:07 And the elders are always busy.
52:10 I’m not sure if they really want me here.
52:24 Yoko, a pioneer sister from my former congregation, visited me.
52:30 She asked me how I was doing.
52:34 I told her how I felt about my congregation.
52:39 Then she told me that she had a similar experience.
52:43 And she shared with me a Watchtower article that helped her.
52:49 I made this my next personal study project.
52:55 “What do you see when you look at others?
52:59 “Do you have the tendency to view what they say or do
53:02 “as either black or white,
53:04 as if no other colors or shades existed?”
53:10 “Having that viewpoint
53:11 “would be like a photographer who ignores the large variety
53:15 “of brilliant hues and shades in an autumn landscape,
53:19 as if only black and white images existed.”
53:29 Maybe I’ve been viewing the congregation as “black and white.”
53:35 The article then turned my attention to Jesus’ example.
53:41 “The spirit, of course, is eager,
53:45 but the flesh is weak.”
53:51 Why was Jesus able to say such kind words
53:54 to his disciples?
54:06 Insight is the ability to put yourself
54:08 in the other’s place.
54:10 Jesus did that with his disciples.
54:13 OK, I need to do the same.
54:17 She always looks after the children at home.
54:19 She also needs time to be refreshed
54:22 by association with friends at the Kingdom Hall.
54:25 She probably didn’t mean to be rude.
54:29 Since we looked like we were having an enjoyable conversation,
54:32 she may have just wanted to join us.
54:36 The elders are so busy caring for the needs
54:39 of the congregation.
54:41 I know they’re doing the best they can.
54:43 I want to do what I can to make their job easier.
55:13 Miki,
55:14 you are such a beautiful Christian.
55:17 We’re so glad to have you  in our congregation.
55:27 “The insight of a man certainly
55:29 “slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part
55:34 to overlook an offense.”
55:46 If you’d like to make this lesson a topic
55:48 for your personal study or family worship,
55:51 you can review  the March 15, 2008, Watchtower article
55:56 beginning on page 25.
55:58 The title asks the question:
56:01 “Do You View Others as Jehovah Does?”
56:04 When we share Jehovah’s view of others,
56:07 we’re better equipped  to be fellow workers with God
56:10 and with our brothers and sisters.
56:14 Finally, this month’s report  from fellow workers
56:16 comes to us  from the country of Georgia.
56:20 Forests, streams, and lush valleys
56:24 adorn this mountainous region  on the border of Europe and Asia.
56:28 Georgia’s capital,
56:29 Tbilisi, is a bustling city
56:32 where modern buildings  mix with historic architecture.
56:36 The Georgian people are known
56:39 for their strong family ties  and warm hospitality.
56:44 Folk music and dances  are a rich part of their culture.
56:48 Visitors are offered to try  a variety of delicious local foods,
56:52 such as this candy  made from walnuts and grape juice.
56:56 Old town Sighnaghi is a unique place
56:59 to enjoy the beautiful landscape and culture.
57:04 The congregation here has 50 publishers
57:06 who keep busy in the preaching work.
57:08 Despite being a small congregation,
57:11 they represent almost 3 percent  of the town’s population.
57:17 Remote towns and villages  create opportunities to preach
57:20 in unassigned territories  throughout the year.
57:24 We thank the congregation in Sighnaghi
57:26 and the more than 18,000 brothers  and sisters in Georgia
57:30 for this encouraging visit with them.
57:32 And we send them and all of you
57:35 our warm Christian love and greetings.
57:39 From the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
57:42 this is JW Broadcasting.

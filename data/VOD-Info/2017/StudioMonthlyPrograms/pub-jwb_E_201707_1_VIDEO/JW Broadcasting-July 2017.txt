00:01 Welcome to the program!
00:04 Our theme this month is  “Organized to Do God’s Will.”
00:08 Among other things,
00:10 we will look at how our young brothers
00:12 can be encouraged to reach out
00:14 so as to take the lead in the congregation.
00:18 You will also enjoy this report  on the blessings around the world
00:22 from using carts in our ministry,
00:24 and we’ll find out how  the organization makes sure
00:27 our meeting places are properly utilized.
00:32 This is the July program  of JW Broadcasting!
00:54 There are people who believe
00:56 there is no need  for a religious organization.
00:59 They feel they have  their own personal relationship with God
01:03 and that is good enough.
01:05 They see no need to be associated  with a specific organization.
01:10 However, what does  God’s own inspired Word suggest?
01:14 That he would use an organization,  or channel,
01:18 through which spiritual food  would be dispensed
01:20 from his Word, the Bible.
01:23 For example,
1 Peter 2:17 says
01:27 to “have love  for the whole association of brothers.”
01:31 One dictionary definition for “association”
01:34 is “an organization of persons  having a common interest.”
01:40 We have a very interesting, insightful look
01:43 at the organization in the first century.
01:46 If we glance down through chapter 15  of the book of Acts,
01:51 we can gain some insight.
01:53 Verse 1 indicates there was  an issue that caused a disagreement
01:58 between some of the members  of the congregation.
02:00 Then verse 2 says:
02:03 “But after quite a bit  of dissension and disputing
02:07 “by Paul and Barnabas with them,
02:09 “it was arranged for Paul,  Barnabas, and some of the others
02:12 “to go up to the apostles  and elders in Jerusalem
02:16 regarding this issue.”
02:19 It sounds like an organization to me.
02:22 And after considerable discussion
02:24 and with the help of God’s holy spirit,
02:27 what transpired?
02:29 Verses 22 and 23 say:
02:34 “Then the apostles and the elders,  together with the whole congregation,
02:38 “decided to send chosen men  from among them to Antioch,
02:41 “along with Paul and Barnabas;
02:43 “they sent Judas  who was called Barsabbas and Silas,
02:47 “who were leading men  among the brothers.
02:49 They wrote this  and sent it through them.”
02:52 Then in verses 23-29
02:56 is the letter of direction  that was delivered to Antioch
02:59 and other congregations as well.
03:01 In fact, in verse 41,  it says Paul and Silas
03:05 “went through Syria and Cilicia,  strengthening the congregations.”
03:09 Chapter 16, verse 5 says:
03:12 “Then, indeed, the congregations  continued to be made firm in the faith
03:16 and to increase in number day by day.”
03:20 So it was not a matter  of isolated Christians sitting at home
03:25 claiming to have  a personal relationship with God.
03:28 No, the work was organized,
03:31 and congregations  kept being added “day by day.”
03:36 That is very similar to what we see  in Jehovah’s organization today.
03:40 In fact, the organization  of Jehovah’s Witnesses is patterned
03:44 after the first-century  Christian congregation
03:47 as set forth in the Scriptures.
03:50 I would like to remind  all of Jehovah’s Witnesses
03:53 —whether already baptized  or working toward baptism—
03:56 of this book,  Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will.
04:01 It provides an overall view
04:04 of how the Christian congregation  is organized
04:06 for getting God’s work done.
04:09 The book also offers counsel and direction
04:12 to help us maintain unity  with our brothers worldwide.
04:17 New ones need to become familiar
04:19 with the operation  of Jehovah’s organization
04:21 and learn how they can have a share
04:23 in the modern-day preaching work.
04:25 In fact,  when a Bible student progresses
04:29 and desires to join us in the ministry
04:31 as an unbaptized publisher,
04:33 the elders direct him  to make a study of this book,
04:37 including the “Questions for Those  Desiring to Get Baptized”
04:41 in the appendix.
04:43 Even for those of us  who have been baptized many years,
04:47 it may be good to schedule the reading
04:49 of one chapter of the book each week
04:51 during our personal study  or family worship.
04:55 It contains general information
04:58 concerning the duties  of elders and ministerial servants,
05:01 judicial procedures,
05:03 and various other features  of congregation organization.
05:07 I would like to take a few minutes  and review some of the information
05:12 in chapter 1 of the publication.
05:15 Though there are thousands of national
05:18 and international organizations  around the world,
05:20 they are organized
05:22 according to human viewpoints  and philosophies.
05:25 But our organization is different;
05:28 it is theocratic.
05:31 That means it is ruled by Jehovah  as Head over all.
05:36 Isaiah 33:22 says that he is our Judge,
05:41 Lawgiver, and King.
05:44 Many large organizations appoint
05:46 a chief executive officer, or CEO.
05:50 He is the executive  with the chief decision-making authority
05:54 in a business or corporation.
05:57 In a similar way,  Jehovah has appointed his Son, Jesus,
06:01 to be the one  with chief decision-making authority
06:04 over the congregation of God.
06:07 Ephesians 1:22
06:11 is speaking of Jehovah’s actions  in connection with Jesus.
06:15 It says:
06:17 “He also subjected all things under his feet
06:21 “and made him head over all things
06:24 with regard to the congregation.”
06:27 We see the structure  of the organization taking shape.
06:31 Jehovah is the Universal Sovereign,  the King,
06:35 directing the millions of angels
06:37 making up his heavenly organization.
06:40 But when it comes to directing
06:42 the visible earthly part  of God’s organization,
06:45 he has delegated  that responsibility to Jesus,
06:48 the head of the congregation of God.
06:51 Chapter 2 of the Organized book
06:54 explains this Scriptural position of Jesus.
06:58 And how does Jesus direct  the organization here on earth?
07:02 Matthew 24:45 says  that Jesus has appointed
07:06 a “faithful and discreet slave”
07:09 to serve  spiritual “food at the proper time.”
07:13 Today,
07:14 seven anointed men  make up the faithful slave,
07:16 and collectively,  they are known as the Governing Body.
07:20 And Jesus uses the holy spirit  to direct these men
07:24 in harmony with the Scriptures.
07:27 The Scriptural basis  for this layer of organization
07:29 is set forth in chapter 3 of the book.
07:33 Chapter 4 is entitled
07:35 “How the Congregation  Is Organized and Governed.”
07:39 The organizational structure  incorporates Branch Committees,
07:43 circuit overseers, elders,  and ministerial servants.
07:48 The subject index in the back of the book
07:50 can be useful  to quickly gain access to information
07:54 on various aspects of the organization.
07:58 Suppose you’re a young person,
08:00 maybe even  a relatively young married couple.
08:03 The circuit overseer is visiting,
08:05 and he asks you  what spiritual goals you have.
08:08 How would you answer?
08:10 Would your mind start racing,
08:12 trying to think  of various avenues of service available?
08:17 How about now,  before you are asked such a question,
08:22 you look in the subject index  under “Goals”?
08:26 There are 11 references  to paragraphs in the book on that subject.
08:31 After reading about all
08:34 of the possibilities  and different categories,
08:36 you would be  in a better position to plan your life
08:39 for a great future
08:41 in the earthly part  of Jehovah’s organization.
08:46 At this time,
08:48 I would like to draw your attention  to a very important factor
08:51 in a new one’s making progress
08:54 and attaining spiritual stability.
08:57 On page 213 of the Organized book,
09:02 it discusses a person  interested in being baptized.
09:06 After the elders go over the questions  in part 3 of the book,
09:09 it says this:
09:11 “If he has not completed his study  of the Bible Teach and ‘God’s Love’ books,
09:16 the elders should make arrangements  for someone to help him do so.”
09:22 The two books  complement each other so well.
09:27 When someone becomes a dedicated  and baptized servant of Jehovah,
09:31 we want them to stay  closely attached to the organization.
09:36 Yet every year,
09:38 there are a number  who stop attending meetings
09:40 and become inactive.
09:42 At times,  it has been found
09:44 that they did not finish  studying the two books.
09:48 You see,
09:49 the Bible Teach book helps new ones
09:51 to have an accurate knowledge of the Bible,
09:54 and they often learn to love Jehovah.
09:57 The “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love” book
09:59 helps us to learn to apply the Bible
10:02 and live in harmony  with Jehovah’s standards.
10:05 Notice what Jesus told his faithful apostles
10:09 at John 15:10:
10:15 “If you observe my commandments,  you will remain in my love,
10:19 “just as I have observed  the commandments of the Father
10:22 and remain in his love.”
10:26 Did you notice  that Jesus remained in God’s love
10:29 by observing his Father’s commandments?
10:32 The same is true of us today.
10:35 To remain in God’s love,
10:37 we need to apply the truth  in our everyday life.
10:41 And what is the result  if we keep ourselves in God’s love?
10:45 It is so clearly stated
10:48 in Jude 21:
10:51 “In order to keep yourselves in God’s love,
10:55 “while you await the mercy  of our Lord Jesus Christ
10:58 with everlasting life in view.”
11:02 Staying in God’s love  results in everlasting life.
11:07 It is so important  to make sure our Bible students
11:10 complete a study of both books,
11:13 and that applies to our children too.
11:16 Sometimes as parents,
11:18 we can assume  that our children are developing
11:20 a trusting relationship with Jehovah
11:23 because they have been going  to meetings since they were very small.
11:27 A relationship with Jehovah  does not happen by means of osmosis.
11:32 A child does not simply absorb  and assimilate truth
11:36 and a love for God
11:38 just by being in the presence of others
11:40 who have a close relationship with Jehovah.
11:44 We very much appreciate  all of the videos we have,
11:48 including Become Jehovah’s Friend  and JW Broadcasting.
11:52 But new ones and young ones
11:55 need to be able to go  through the process of deep study
12:00 to get to the Bible’s truth
12:02 and get it etched into their minds
12:04 and lodged deep in their hearts.
12:06 Therefore,
12:08 if you parents realize  that you have not studied
12:11 both books with your young ones,
12:14 it would be good to see  that a schedule is established to do so.
12:19 The Governing Body gives all credit
12:22 for the success  of this organization to Jehovah
12:25 and the appointed head  of the congregation, Jesus Christ.
12:29 We are just imperfect men trying to follow
12:32 the lead of Christ and the holy spirit.
12:34 At 1 Corinthians 1:26,
12:39 Paul says:
12:41 “For you see his calling of you, brothers,
12:44 that there are not many wise  in a fleshly way.”
12:47 Verse 27 says:
12:49 “But God chose  the foolish things of the world
12:52 to put the wise men to shame.”
12:54 Then verse 30 says that Christ Jesus
12:58 “has become to us wisdom from God.”
13:02 That is where the direction and wisdom
13:05 of the organization come from,
13:07 not from mere man.
13:10 The words of Jehovah  to the prophet Zechariah fit today
13:14 when we see  the amazing advances in the organization.
13:18 Zechariah 4:6 says:
13:20 “‘Not by a military force, nor by power,
13:23 but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”
13:29 While there are  some well-educated and prominent men
13:32 who have accepted the truth  and are now our fellow brothers,
13:36 the majority in the organization  come from a more humble background.
13:40 For example,
13:42 among the first  of Jehovah’s modern-day servants
13:45 to introduce the Kingdom message  to people in Denmark
13:48 was a shoemaker.
13:50 In Switzerland and France,  it was a gardener.
13:53 In many parts of Africa,
13:55 the message was carried  by itinerant workers.
13:58 In Brazil, sailors had a share.
14:01 Quite a few of the Polish Witnesses  in northern France
14:05 were coal miners.
14:07 Jehovah and Jesus use all of us
14:10 to get a remarkable work accomplished.
14:13 We are proud to be a part  of this spirit-directed organization.
14:17 As one older circuit overseer  was heard to say,
14:20 “This is the best imperfect organization  on earth!”
14:25 There are no perfect organizations on earth.
14:29 However, this is the best of them all.
14:33 And we appreciate  the contribution all of you make
14:36 to the success  of the preaching work worldwide.
14:42 With that contribution in mind,
14:44 consider for a moment  the huge load elders carry
14:48 in caring for our congregations.
14:50 Some of them are now advanced in age.
14:52 So how can young brothers be trained
14:55 to qualify for increased responsibilities?
14:58 In this dramatization,
15:00 a congregation faces a change  on its elder body
15:03 that brought that question to the fore.
15:16 We’re very happy for Daniel.
15:20 He’s going to be a blessing  in his new assignment.
15:28 But we are going to miss him
15:31 and everything he was doing  for the congregation.
15:34 This will change things for us.
15:46 We really want to be there
15:48 for our brothers and sisters.
16:20 And it’s true:
16:22 Having plenty to do  in the Lord’s work is good.
16:26 But where will we get more help?
16:36 We do have good ministerial servants
16:39 like Richie.
16:46 But after Daniel left,  our elder body is one fewer now.
16:51 That prompted a good question:
16:54 Are we doing all we can  to train our brothers?
17:05 Richie, do you have some time for me?
17:07 I have some calls you can help me with.
17:09 Sure, I’d like that.
17:17 I realized it had been  a while since we talked
17:20 about him qualifying to do more.
17:22 He explained that he wanted to help
17:24 but didn’t want to appear presumptuous.
17:27 He’d been praying about it,
17:29 and he wanted to know what else  he could do to keep reaching out.
17:32 Talking to Richie  made me think of Jesus’ example.
17:38 His disciples offered themselves willingly,  and he trained them.
17:42 They were eager but needed his direction.
17:45 Jesus’ training gave them confidence  to do the assignments he gave them.
17:52 They were happy,
17:54 not just to follow Jesus,
17:56 but to work alongside him.
17:59 And Jesus was happy to share his work.
18:03 Up to his final evening with them,
18:05 he prepared them for the work ahead.
18:07 “Most truly I say to you,
18:10 “whoever exercises faith in me  will also do the works that I do;
18:15 “and he will do works greater than these,
18:17 because I am going my way to the Father.”
18:23 I now remember how much training  I had received from the brothers.
18:35 It was easy to forget  that I didn’t always get
18:38 things right at first.
18:48 Soon,  Richie was taking on more responsibility.
18:53 And he told me something  that I too once felt.
18:58 He just didn’t realize how much work
19:01 went into caring for Jehovah’s sheep.
19:05 But once he knew,  he was glad he offered himself willingly.
19:20 We commend all our hard-working elders  for their fine work
19:25 and also those of you who support them,
19:27 whether you are a ministerial servant  or perhaps the wife of an elder.
19:32 Without your help and support,
19:34 it would be very difficult  for our dear elders
19:37 to carry out their weighty responsibilities.
19:40 While there is a lot of work  to be done on a local level,
19:44 there is an unprecedented global effort
19:47 to provide spiritual food  to all of God’s people.
19:50 Under the direction  of the Teaching Committee
19:52 of the Governing Body,
19:54 the Audio/Video Services Department,  or AVS,
19:57 takes the lead in producing  audio and video publications.
20:02 It’s been said that if a picture
20:05 is worth a thousand words,
20:07 then a video is worth a million!
20:10 Videos stir our emotions, don’t they?
20:13 And they can be  very powerful teaching tools.
20:16 Brother Russell recognized this fact.
20:19 Back in 1914,  the small group of Bible Students
20:22 presented the “Photo-Drama of Creation”
20:25 to over nine million people worldwide,
20:29 and the response was overwhelming.
20:32 It was clear that Jehovah  blessed their efforts
20:35 at spreading the Bible’s message  in a visual way.
20:40 Well, over a hundred years later,
20:43 “the faithful and discreet slave”  is producing videos.
20:46 And for many years, basically,
20:49 one large public-release video
20:52 was being released,  or produced, each year.
20:56 For example, back in 2011,
20:59 the video Faith in Action, Part 2  was released.
21:03 And it required a tremendous effort  to produce the video master,
21:07 the audio tracks, the graphics,
21:10 the music, the on-screen text  for one video.
21:15 However, just five years later,
21:19 the work has grown from producing
21:21 an average of one video per year
21:24 to one video per day.
21:27 This is because videos are now  a regular part of our website,
21:32 the broadcasts,  our ministry, the conventions,
21:36 meetings, and other special events.
21:39 In 2016,
21:41 more than 350 videos were produced.
21:45 Under the direction  of the Teaching Committee,
21:48 Audio/Video Services (AVS)  has been entrusted with this work.
21:51 But with this rapid increase  in the amount of videos produced,
21:56 how is all this accomplished?
21:59 Perhaps you’ve heard the expression
22:01 “it takes a village.”
22:03 In this case,  it takes an entire globe.
22:07 Please enjoy the following video  for a close-up look
22:10 at how audio and video work  is accomplished worldwide.
22:24 To assist with the growing workload  in Audio/Video Services,
22:27 the Governing Body has approved
22:29 11 full-time Regional Video Teams (RVT)
22:32 in branches around the world.
22:34 But it doesn’t stop there.
22:36 Bethelites, commuters,  and remote workers in many other branches
22:40 also provide valuable assistance.
22:43 How do we work with all these teams?
22:46 After receiving direction  from the Governing Body committees
22:49 for upcoming videos,
22:51 AVS then assigns  each video to a capable team.
22:57 Once the team accepts the assignment,
23:00 we provide them  with the necessary direction
23:03 as well as answer  any questions they may have.
23:07 Then the team goes to work.
23:25 Because of being a small group,
23:28 each team member may have to wear  multiple hats to get the job done.
23:32 From start to finish,  they all work very hard
23:36 to deliver a completed, edited video
23:38 to us by the designated time.
23:41 Later, you may see these videos  on JW Broadcasting,
23:45 jw.org, or other places.
23:54 Would you like to meet  some of our RVT family?
24:02 It’s a privilege.
24:05 We meet friends who have suffered  some hardships and trials,
24:10 but because of their trust in Jehovah,
24:13 they were able to overcome them,
24:15 and we see the results of their loyalty.
24:18 I think it strengthens our determination
24:21 to also stay loyal.
24:26 We are a joyful team
24:28 with a lot of humor,
24:31 and we work together very harmoniously.
24:32 You could say that we  are like a little family.
24:35 We look forward to the next day  when we go to work again.
24:38 It’s unbelievable how many dear brothers
24:41 and sisters we’ve gotten to know  through these projects.
24:44 Close ties can develop,
24:46 and it is not uncommon  that tears flow when the project is over
24:49 and it is time to say good-bye.
24:56 Sometimes we would film  on private or state property,
24:59 and I would have to approach the manager
25:01 and let them know  what we were planning to shoot
25:03 at the location.
25:05 This wasn’t easy for me  because I’m not very good with words.
25:10 And many people in Korea tend to have  a biased view of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
25:14 so this made it even harder for me.
25:19 So I prayed to Jehovah,
25:21 asking for his guidance and wisdom.
25:25 I was surprised to find that many  were more than willing to help us.
25:32 These experiences help me to realize
25:35 that Jehovah always answers  our prayers for strength and courage.
25:43 You have to balance your time around work,
25:46 around being the head of a family,
25:49 being an elder,
25:51 or other responsibilities  that you have in the congregation.
25:55 That’s when you really see Jehovah’s hand
25:58 —when you see the mountain of challenge,
26:02 but you overcome it.
26:03 And you know it wasn’t you.
26:05 It was impossible for you to do it yourself.
26:09 When I put even half  the amount of energy and effort
26:12 that I do into working for Jehovah  into something secular,
26:16 I’m wiped out; I need a vacation.
26:19 But the more  I put into working for Jehovah,
26:22 the more I want to work.
26:25 To know that you  are offering your skills to Jehovah
26:28 —that is a blessing.
26:31 But, really, the blessing is seeing  your relationship with Jehovah
26:34 thrive and become stronger,
26:36 and you can see  that he does keep his promises
26:40 and that he supports you  more than you’re supporting him.
26:45 Many of us aren’t able  to be full-time Bethelites,
26:49 but commuting really helps us
26:51 get that small snippet of what it’s like
26:53 to be a Bethelite  and realize what a privilege it is.
26:57 And if you’ve got a specific talent, use it.
27:00 One day in Paradise,  someone is going to come to you
27:03 and say,  “How did you use your talent?”
27:05 Maybe you’re a brilliant artist,
27:07 and you’re going  to proudly turn around and say:
27:09 “You know what?  I used it for Jehovah.”
27:11 Even if you’re young,  you can learn skills
27:15 and you can really assist  Jehovah’s organization
27:19 now and in the future.
27:22 And there is no better boss  to work for than Jehovah.
27:26 My advice to young ones: Go for it!
27:29 And during this past year,
27:32 we were excited to add  a new team to our AVS family
27:36 —located in Mira Loma, California.
27:41 All in this group  have made themselves available
27:44 for video needs out there.
27:47 You’re able to take a person—
27:50 You’re able to take an individual  that has dedicated their life to Jehovah,
27:52 and maybe they  didn’t know at the time
27:54 that they were going  to inspire somebody else
27:55 and have somebody
27:56 somewhere across the planet say:
27:58 “Wow! That’s exactly my life too.
28:00 “I’m so glad that this person
28:03 “was selected to be on here  because that’s my life.
28:05 And that has triggered me  to want to do more for Jehovah.”
28:12 You know it’s Jehovah’s holy spirit;  he’s putting together a team;
28:14 he’s the Great Producer.
28:16 And what he really wants  is he wants people who have the talent,
28:18 but he wants people  who have the holy spirit more
28:20 and are willing to work for it.
28:22 But he gives you the ability,  like Oholiab and Bezalel,
28:27 to be able to put your talents  that you’ve learned to work for him.
28:30 As you can see,
28:32 we’re part of a beautiful,  hardworking global team.
28:36 With so many hands helping the load  in so many time zones,
28:41 we’re literally working on videos 24/7.
28:48 It’s a great privilege  to work alongside our extended family.
28:51 We learn from each other.
28:53 Their willing spirit, humble attitude,
28:55 and contagious joy
28:58 inspire all of us here in AVS.
29:03 Additionally, we receive  incredible support right at home too.
29:08 Virtually every department at Bethel
29:10 supports the audio/video work in some way,
29:13 and we are very, very thankful.
29:18 With everyone’s help,  the Bible’s message is being spread visually
29:22 throughout the earth  at unprecedented levels.
29:30 But how is any of this possible?
29:33 Brother Russell said it best:
29:35 ‘This is not man’s work. It’s God’s.’
29:40 Jehovah is certainly at the helm.
29:43 As he foretold at Haggai 2:7:
29:47 “I will shake all the nations,
29:50 “and the precious things  of all the nations will come in;
29:53 and I will fill this house with glory.”
29:57 There is certainly
29:59 a great shaking taking place
30:01 worldwide.
30:03 And many of these precious ones  are offering themselves willingly
30:07 to help Audio/Video Services  accomplish this great work,
30:11 thanks to Jehovah God,
30:13 our Grand and Visual Instructor.
30:19 Our videos are a fantastic provision  from Jehovah,
30:23 and what a teaching tool they have become.
30:26 We get many letters of appreciation
30:28 about the use of our videos  in our midweek meetings.
30:32 And I agree;
30:34 the videos make the meetings  so much more dynamic.
30:37 For example, the week of July 17,
30:40 we will be considering the part  “Do You Forgive Yourself?”
30:44 which includes a video that we first saw
30:47 at the 2016 Regional Convention.
30:50 Make it a habit to prepare  for these video considerations
30:54 just as thoroughly  as you would any other part.
30:57 Your well-prepared comments  will benefit the whole congregation.
31:03 And when we arrive  at the Kingdom Hall for a meeting,
31:05 don’t you agree  that we all feel refreshed
31:08 the moment we see the smiling faces  of our brothers and sisters?
31:12 That’s how I feel.
31:15 Sometimes we can even take  our beautiful meeting location for granted.
31:19 But did you know  that a lot of work goes into making sure
31:23 that our Kingdom Halls are well utilized?
31:26 The Worldwide Design/Construction  Department, or WDC,
31:30 is tasked with analyzing  our worldwide needs
31:33 and providing direction  to Local Design/Construction Departments
31:37 on how best to use  our dedicated funds.
31:45 As we approach the end  of the present system of things,
31:48 Jehovah continues to speed up the work.
31:51 We now have  more than 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide,
31:55 and the demand is still growing.
31:57 Jehovah’s blessing  on the Kingdom work is undeniable,
32:00 as this could not  have been accomplished otherwise.
32:04 Many have been working for years  in support of Kingdom Hall
32:07 and Assembly Hall construction projects,
32:10 most recently as part  of the Local Design/Construction,
32:13 or LDC, program.
32:16 This program was implemented  during the 2014 service year
32:20 and unifies the approach  for construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide.
32:25 What has been accomplished  since the program started?
32:28 At the end of the 2000 service year,
32:30 half of the publishers worldwide  met in suitable meeting places.
32:34 However, the other half
32:37 —approximately three million publishers—
32:39 met in places that were overcrowded
32:41 or otherwise unsuitable as Kingdom Halls.
32:44 At that time,
32:46 27,000 Kingdom Halls were needed.
32:49 By 2014,  the number of publishers meeting
32:52 in unsuitable facilities had been reduced.
32:55 But because of growth in the organization,
32:58 this still meant that 1.6 million publishers
33:01 did not have a suitable meeting place.
33:04 Since 2014,
33:06 that figure has been reduced
33:08 by 25 percent.
33:10 What accounts for this significant reduction  in the backlog,
33:13 allowing us to catch up faster  than in the past?
33:17 Part of the answer
33:19 lies in making efficient use  of the facilities we already have.
33:23 When providing food for thousands,
33:25 Jesus made it clear  that nothing should be wasted.
33:28 The LDC program applies that principle
33:31 to the seats in our Kingdom Halls.
33:33 As noted earlier,
33:35 we have 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide.
33:39 On average,  only 60 percent of the seats
33:41 are filled for congregation meetings.
33:43 That means that approximately three  to four million seats are empty
33:48 during congregation meetings each week.
33:51 There are a number of options  to help make better use of these seats,
33:55 which will make the use  of each Kingdom Hall more efficient.
33:58 Consider, for example,
34:00 a Kingdom Hall in an urban area.
34:02 It has 200 seats
34:04 and is used  by four congregations sharing the facility.
34:08 That means the Kingdom Hall will be in use
34:10 for four weeknight meetings
34:13 and four weekend meetings.
34:15 It would definitely appear  to be fully utilized
34:17 and suggests the need
34:19 for new construction for further growth.
34:22 However,  how many seats were in the Kingdom Hall?
34:25 Two hundred.
34:27 Multiplied by meetings  for the four congregations,
34:30 this facility has a total seating capacity
34:33 of 800 people.
34:35 Global records indicate that congregations
34:38 using this size Kingdom Hall
34:39 have an average attendance
34:41 of 120 at their meeting.
34:43 This could mean  that only 480 seats are used
34:47 by the four congregations  in this Kingdom Hall
34:50 and 320 seats remain empty
34:53 —not very efficient.
34:55 If the four congregations were redistributed
34:58 into three congregations,
35:00 average meeting attendance  for each congregation
35:03 would increase  to about 160 per meeting,
35:06 while still fitting comfortably  in that Kingdom Hall.
35:09 And this would now allow  for an open slot in the schedule,
35:12 which could be used  to meet needs in the area
35:15 without requiring new construction.
35:18 In the first three years of the LDC program,
35:22 fully utilizing our existing facilities
35:24 played a part in reducing  the backlog of Kingdom Hall projects
35:28 from 14,000 to approximately 10,000.
35:32 This saved millions of dollars.
35:34 Of course, this does not meet every need,
35:37 and there is still a significant need
35:39 to construct new Kingdom Halls
35:41 to provide suitable places of worship.
35:44 How does the branch office  make these decisions,
35:46 and how are priorities set?
35:50 All options are examined  as the Branch Committees
35:52 work with their Local Design/Construction
35:54 and Service departments.
35:56 Transportation needs —such as distance,
35:58 opportunities for carpooling,
36:01 and availability  of public transportation—
36:03 are taken into account.
36:06 In many cases,  congregations can be sized
36:09 to make better use of available seats
36:11 in Kingdom Halls  that have already been built.
36:14 However,  when they are needed,
36:16 new Kingdom Halls can be constructed  using simple, standard designs
36:20 that make wise use of donated funds.
36:24 Of course, all of this must be done  with the big picture in mind.
36:28 It is the spiritual needs  of the congregations
36:30 that are of the utmost priority.
36:34 The structures themselves are not  the focus of these centers of pure worship,
36:37 but rather it is the people  who use the facilities.
36:43 On one occasion,  as they passed the temple,
36:45 Mark 13:1 quotes one of Jesus’ disciples
36:48 admiring the structure when he said:
36:50 “Teacher, see!  what wonderful stones and buildings!”
36:55 However,
36:56 Jesus’ reply simply indicated
36:58 that the building itself would not last.
37:02 It was people Jesus was concerned with.
37:06 Likewise,  the Kingdom Halls that we build today
37:09 will not last forever.
37:12 But these centers of pure worship  bring people together
37:14 so that we can serve Jehovah  as a united group
37:18 —and that will last forever.
37:22 Whether we assist in the construction
37:24 of the many Kingdom Halls  that are still needed
37:27 or help to renovate and maintain  existing Kingdom Halls,
37:30 it is our shared privilege  to help provide
37:32 suitable meeting places  for our brothers and sisters.
37:36 In this way,
37:38 we each support  “the faithful and discreet slave”
37:40 as they provide what is needed  so that each congregation
37:44 can praise Jehovah  in a suitable place of worship.
37:52 Brother Thomas Kalimeris,
37:54 who serves at the United States branch,
37:56 together with his wife,
37:58 has spent close to four decades  supporting various aspects
38:02 of the organization’s construction projects.
38:05 What has that experience taught him?
38:08 That the work is not run by us.
38:16 Throughout history, men have built
38:18 many beautiful and impressive buildings.
38:21 These structures  have usually brought glory to men,
38:24 not to God.
38:26 But those men are long gone,
38:28 and even many of the structures  no longer exist.
38:32 How true is the scripture at Psalm 127:1:
38:36 “Unless Jehovah builds the house,
38:39 it is in vain  that its builders work hard on it.”
38:45 In our time too,  Jehovah is using his people to build.
38:49 We’re working hard  to build spirituality in interested ones,
38:52 and also we build structures
38:54 in order to help individuals to learn
38:58 about Jehovah and serve him.
39:00 In this type of construction
39:03 —both spiritual and physical construction—
39:05 I’ve been involved for most of my life.
39:07 I was born in Greece.
39:10 Our family came into contact  with the truth in the early sixties.
39:14 I was baptized when I was in high school.
39:17 I left school to get  some practical training in architecture,
39:22 but I made pioneering my career.
39:25 In 1973,  I married my dear wife, Margaret,
39:28 and together  we enjoyed many assignments.
39:31 We pioneered —special pioneering.
39:33 We went to Gilead.
39:36 We were invited to Bethel
39:38 in 1979 to work  in the Engineering Department.
39:42 We worked on designing new branches,
39:46 Assembly Halls, Kingdom Halls,
39:49 renovation of existing branches
39:52 and remote translation offices.
39:56 Before we came to Bethel, we had seen how  Jehovah provided for us individually.
40:01 But now we had the opportunity
40:03 to see how Jehovah provided  for the needs of his organization globally.
40:10 By the year 2000,  it became apparent that the present facility
40:14 of the Britain branch  was not meeting their needs.
40:19 So a site was located
50 miles (80 km) north of London
40:21 to relocate the branch there.
40:24 However,
40:26 the Governing Body  decided to cancel the project.
40:29 So in 2008,
40:31 the Governing Body wrote  that now is the time
40:34 —Jehovah’s time— to find property
40:37 closer to London.
40:39 So a project team was formed,
40:42 and a few years went by, and a number of properties were searched,
40:44 and one was located closer to London.
40:48 If something we plan falls through,
40:50 it could mean  that Jehovah has something else
40:53 —or better— in mind to meet  the needs of his organization.
40:58 While working in the Haiti branch,  we learned a lesson:
41:02 not to compromise on safety.
41:06 The Brooklyn Engineering Department  did the drawings for the branch,
41:10 and a local contractor was hired
41:13 to build the structural work.
41:15 Now, the contractor,  when he reviewed the drawings,
41:17 told the Branch Committee:  “Really, this is overdesigned.
41:21 You’re wasting a lot of money  by putting all the steel in the building.”
41:25 So we wrote back and said:  “No, the drawings are OK.
41:30 “The branch is designed  according to the seismic zone that it’s in.
41:33 And the contractor is to go ahead  with the plans as drawn.”
41:38 In 2010,  when the earthquake came to Haiti,
41:42 hundreds of thousands of people died
41:46 because of inferior materials  and methods of construction.
41:50 However,
41:52 the branch did not suffer any damage,
41:54 and many people went there to find refuge.
41:59 We’re so glad that Jehovah did not allow us
42:02 to be swayed in this case.
42:05 Jehovah continues to direct  a great physical building work
42:09 and a spiritual work.
42:11 Jehovah trains his people  how to work together
42:14 for the work just ahead of us
42:16 —the beautification of this earth  to a paradise.
42:22 It is so important that we  ‘trust in Jehovah
42:24 and not to lean  upon our own understanding.’
42:28 A life of building with Jehovah
42:30 has shown me the wisdom of Psalm 127:1.
42:34 If we keep building our lives with Jehovah,
42:37 our building work will never be in vain.
42:45 The more responsibility a brother  is given in the organization,
42:48 the less he feels he is in control.
42:50 Instead, he will clearly see how Jehovah  takes the lead in the organization.
42:55 And Brother Kalimeris’ experience  confirms that.
42:59 The account about how the branch in Haiti
43:01 was protected from earthquake damage
43:04 sent chills down my spine.
43:06 While some buildings looked like this,
43:10 our branch looked like this.
43:12 And it wasn’t the ingenuity of the brothers   that protected the branch,
43:16 but wisdom that only Jehovah can provide.
43:19 But how can we apply  that same wisdom in our lives?
43:23 Let’s consider three ways we can do so.
43:34 Jehovah has warned us that we’re living
43:36 in “critical times hard to deal with.”
43:42 And Jesus foretold that in the last days
43:45 there would be great “earthquakes  in one place after another”
43:49 and other “fearful sights.”
43:54 Many of us either have or will be affected
43:57 by some form of natural disaster.
44:04 If this happens, how can we be prepared?
44:08 First,
44:10 we can prepare spiritually by maintaining
44:13 a close relationship with Jehovah.
44:15 He is “the God of all comfort,”
44:18 and he can comfort us  in times of tribulation.
44:22 How does he do this?
44:24 We do not expect divine intervention.
44:27 But if we pray during times of distress,
44:30 his powerful holy spirit  can bring Bible passages
44:34 back to mind to comfort us.
44:38 Second,
44:40 we can take practical steps,
44:43 perhaps preparing an emergency kit.
44:46 Our kit could contain  the following items if possible:
44:51 first-aid supplies,
44:53 bottled water,
44:55 and nonperishable food.
45:01 Also, we shouldn’t forget  to update the elders
45:04 with our latest contact information.
45:08 If we don’t do so,
45:10 valuable time could be lost in a disaster.
45:17 Additionally,  during a Family Worship evening,
45:20 our family could review  the types of disasters that might happen
45:24 and what could be done in each situation
45:28 —such as where we meet,
45:31 how we contact the elders, and so forth.
45:35 And third,
45:37 we can help others  when they’re experiencing a disaster,
45:40 knowing they’d do the same for us.
45:44 How can we do this?
45:48 By offering prayers in their behalf,
45:52 by volunteering to assist  with disaster relief efforts,
45:57 and by contributing donations  to the worldwide work.
46:02 No, we can’t avoid all natural disasters.
46:09 But if we prepare spiritually,
46:11 practically,
46:13 and help others currently affected,
46:15 we can take comfort in knowing
46:17 that in Jehovah’s eyes
46:19 we are prepared.
46:22 That was great, practical advice  for all of us to take to heart.
46:26 But there are some things  we can do to help our local congregation.
46:30 Let’s turn briefly  to interview Brother Bram Siegel,
46:34 who’s with  the Coordinators’ Committee Office.
46:37 Bram, how can all of us cooperate
46:39 with the congregation arrangement
46:42 when a disaster hits?
46:44 Immediately after a disaster occurs,
46:47 each field service group overseer
46:49 will contact everyone in his group
46:51 to make sure that all are accounted for
46:53 and to see if anyone needs assistance.
46:56 So each of us  should make sure to give the elders
46:58 our up-to-date contact information.
47:01 That way they can reach us  when something happens.
47:04 That’s a very important reminder —good point!
47:08 But what if my area  was not hit by the disaster
47:11 but an adjacent town or city was?
47:14 Can I just travel there on my own to help,
47:16 or what should I do?
47:18 We really appreciate  the beautiful spirit the brotherhood shows
47:22 when it comes to providing disaster relief.
47:25 Really, the best time  to make yourself available to help
47:28 is right now,
47:30 before a disaster occurs.
47:32 Just ask your local elders  for an application.
47:35 Later, when there’s a need  to provide disaster relief,
47:38 the branch office will know  that you’re willing and ready to assist.
47:42 Thank you very much, Bram,  for those important reminders.
47:45 Thank you.
47:50 When large disasters occur,
47:52 our brothers and sisters  may have to relocate
47:55 —perhaps even to another country.
47:56 As refugees, they face unique challenges.
48:00 You will notice that the Watchtower study  for the week of July 3
48:04 provides practical suggestions
48:06 on how we can support  such brothers and sisters.
48:10 And I’m sure you agree
48:12 that the guidance  Jehovah’s organization provides,
48:15 the love and care that we experience  every day as a people for his name,
48:19 the spiritual paradise that we dwell in
48:22 —all of that makes us want  to praise our heavenly Father.
48:26 This brings us to this month’s  music video which is entitled
48:31 We Marvel at Your Work.
48:41 The work of the Kingdom, in my lifetime and before,
48:50 Provides me with your written Word,  the truth, and so much more.
48:58 Your faithful slave, discreet and wise,  provides increasing light
49:06 And sends out men who shepherd me  with loving oversight.
49:17 I know expectations  at conventions will be met.
49:25 And afterward, I always say, “Now that’s the best one yet!”
49:33 At weekly meetings,  I can feel your thoughtful, loving care
49:41 And learn how best to preach and teach  and have a fuller share.
49:52 We marvel at your work And what the Kingdom’s done so far.
50:08 We cherish Kingdom rule.
50:17 We grow in faith to realize  the kind of God you are.
50:25 We look ahead to blessings  that your Kingdom soon will bring.
50:42 You give us the honor  to be workers on your side,
50:50 Our ministry that lets us show  the love we feel inside.
50:58 The depth of understanding  and the peace of mind you give,
51:06 They teach us what is pure and true;  they show the way to live.
51:16 The songs that express  what’s in my heart so very well
51:25 And Fam’ly Worship ev’nings  give your spirit room to dwell.
51:33 Our unity, despite whatever language  we might speak,
51:42 Proves that our loving brotherhood  in this world is unique.
51:52 We marvel at your work And what the Kingdom’s done so far.
52:08 We cherish Kingdom rule.
52:17 We grow in faith  to realize the kind of God you are.
52:25 We look ahead to blessings  that your Kingdom soon will bring.
52:46 That’s beautiful.
52:48 And how can we show our appreciation
52:50 for Jehovah’s provisions in a practical way?
52:54 By taking seriously  our God-given assignment to preach.
52:58 And we have seen developments
53:00 in our preaching methods  in the past few years.
53:02 For example, in 2001,  with the Governing Body’s approval,
53:07 our brothers in France  started using a variety of methods
53:10 to carry out our public witnessing,  including the use of carts.
53:15 The trial resulted  in many good experiences.
53:18 As a result, in 2011,
53:21 a pilot project with cart witnessing
53:24 in New York City, U.S.A., was approved.
53:28 Since Manhattan, in New York City,
53:31 had a ratio of 1 Jehovah’s Witness to 657 inhabitants,
53:35 this was a perfect choice.
53:37 That was the beginning  of a pilot program in Manhattan.
53:42 The program lasted one year,  using many graduates
53:46 from what was then  the Bible School for Christian Couples.
53:49 Although different tables  were used at the time,
53:51 it was evident that a mobile cart
53:53 had many advantages.
53:55 As a result, today,  Jehovah’s Witnesses are well-known
53:58 for their public witnessing using carts
54:01 designed to display their literature.
54:03 By means of this method,
54:04 good news from the Bible  can be taken to many places
54:08 and easily becomes available  to countless people.
54:13 These carts include different posters that:
54:16 call attention  to our well-known publications,
54:19 invite people to accept  free home Bible studies,
54:23 and direct passersby to our official website.
54:27 Here are just a few examples of how  this method has had many good results.
54:33 My name is Mi Jung You.
54:35 The first time I met Jehovah’s Witnesses
54:38 was more than 20 years ago.
54:39 I started studying  in the You Can Live Forever book,
54:42 but about a month later,
54:44 I had to stop studying.
54:46 After that,  I would accept the magazines,
54:50 but I never ended up  studying the Bible again.
54:52 In June of 2014, though,
54:55 I saw the public witnessing stand.
54:57 I realized that it belonged  to Jehovah’s Witnesses.
55:01 So many of the different publications  they had caught my eye.
55:04 So I asked if it would be OK  if I took a copy of each one.
55:09 We ended up exchanging numbers,
55:11 and a few weeks later  the brother contacted me.
55:14 I began studying  the Bible again with the couple
55:18 and one month later  started attending meetings regularly.
55:23 I was baptized in October of 2015
55:26 and started auxiliary pioneering  right away for ten months.
55:30 Now I’m serving as a regular pioneer.
55:32 Public witnessing helped me find the truth,
55:36 and it’s a way for me to meet people  that are interested like I was.
55:40 I have really come to cherish  the public witnessing work.
55:46 My name is Jacob Salomé.
55:49 I work as a driver and spent most of my life
55:51 traveling all over Peru.
55:53 Because of this, I had problems  with the woman I was living with.
55:57 I never spent time at home  and practically lived in the truck.
56:05 I would see Jehovah’s Witnesses preaching
56:08 on the streets near the buses.
56:10 But since I was always driving,
56:12 I couldn’t park or even talk to them.
56:16 But once, I saw some Witnesses  preaching in a public square.
56:20 So I went up to them to ask them
56:22 what the Bible says about family matters.
56:27 This marked a change in my life.
56:32 My girlfriend and I  began attending meetings,
56:36 and then we got married and got baptized.
56:40 Now we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
56:45 As Annies and I were standing by our cart,  we met young Sudharshan.
56:50 Annies showed him our tract  Can the Dead Really Live Again?
56:54 He was surprised and said,  “How is it possible?”
56:57 When she explained to him Acts 24:15,
56:59 he exclaimed: “I am a Christian.  I never knew this!”
57:04 I asked him,  “Would you like to learn more
57:06 about such wonderful things  from the Bible?”
57:09 He asked,  “Can you tell me right now?”
57:12 There and then, I discussed the first chapter  of the Bible Teach book.
57:15 That’s how it started.
57:18 Sudharshan brought his friend, Sagar.
57:20 Sagar, in turn,  brought Shiva and Srikanth along.
57:24 Three of them are attending  our meetings regularly.
57:27 Sagar even turned down a job offer
57:29 that conflicted with Bible principles.
57:32 One tract resulted in many Bible studies.
57:35 We can really see Jehovah’s blessing
57:38 on this form of public witnessing.
57:55 Without a doubt,  cart witnessing is being used
57:58 to help preach  the good news of God’s Kingdom
58:00 “in all the inhabited earth  for a witness to all the nations.”
58:19 The examples we’ve seen in this program
58:22 truly highlight how Jehovah and Jesus
58:25 use all of us to get  an unprecedented work accomplished.
58:29 We’ve seen how young brothers are trained
58:32 to take the lead in the congregations,
58:34 how videos are produced  around the world
58:37 for our spiritual benefit,
58:39 the work that goes into better  utilizing our Kingdom Halls,
58:43 how wisdom from Jehovah  benefits our construction work,
58:46 and how appropriate it is to praise  our heavenly Father for all his works.
58:51 And last,
58:53 we were encouraged to continue  in our public witnessing efforts
58:56 as we clearly see Jehovah’s blessing.
59:00 Yes, we are proud  to be Jehovah’s Witnesses.
59:04 This is the best organization on earth.
59:08 To conclude,
59:10 we’d like to share  this postcard from Iceland.
59:14 Almost 335,000 people live
59:17 on this North Atlantic island nation,
59:19 of which about 380 are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
59:24 Iceland is known  for being the land of ice and fire,
59:27 as it has both a lot of volcanic activity
59:30 and Europe’s largest glacier.
59:33 In their free time,
59:35 the Witnesses in Iceland  enjoy hiking in the beautiful nature
59:38 or riding on horseback  on Icelandic horses.
59:42 The preaching work   in Iceland began in 1929.
59:46 Brother Lindal was the only publisher  on the island for nearly 18 years.
59:51 Today, the 380 publishers conduct
59:54 approximately 270 Bible studies,
59:58 and almost 700 people
59:59 attended the Memorial of Christ’s death  last year.
1:00:04 In the winter,  the sun is up for only a few hours.
1:00:07 While the Witnesses  use the limited sunlight wisely
1:00:11 —going from door to door  or business witnessing—
1:00:13 they are not scared by the darkness.
1:00:18 Some congregations use tiny lights  on their public witnessing carts
1:00:21 so that the passersby will see the carts.
1:00:25 Also, the weather in Iceland  can change quickly.
1:00:28 To prevent literature from being damaged  by rain or other weather elements,
1:00:33 some congregations use plastic covers  on the literature.
1:00:37 In 2011, a Polish group was established
1:00:40 in the capital city of Reykjavik,
1:00:42 and in 2016, a congregation  with over 40 publishers was formed.
1:00:48 Today, they conduct over 20 Bible studies.
1:00:53 All the brothers and sisters in Iceland  send their warm Christian love.
1:00:56 We pray that Jehovah will continue
1:01:00 to bless their efforts in praising his name.

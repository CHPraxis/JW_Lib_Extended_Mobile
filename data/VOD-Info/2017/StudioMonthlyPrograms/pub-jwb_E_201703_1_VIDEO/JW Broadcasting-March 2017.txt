00:01 Welcome to another edition
00:05 of JW Broadcasting!
00:08 This month we will see examples
00:11 of what young ones
00:14 around the world have done to seek
00:17 the Kingdom first.
00:19 Also,
00:21 you will meet a brother  who got into a lot of trouble
00:25 early in his life.
00:27 But how did the truth help him
00:30 to straighten out his life?
00:33 We look forward to his story.
00:36 We will also visit  a language course in Ecuador.
00:40 What is it like  to learn a new language
00:43 to expand our ministry?
00:45 We will find out.
00:48 This is the March program
00:51 of JW Broadcasting!
01:12 My theme for this month’s broadcast is
01:16 “Young Ones —Build Your Future With Jehovah!”
01:23 If you do,
1 Timothy 6:19 assures
01:27 that you will  ‘safely treasure up for yourself
01:31 a fine foundation for the future,’
01:34 and you will  “get a firm hold on the real life.”
01:40 Obviously, we will be directing  many of our comments
01:44 directly to you dear young ones
01:47 in Jehovah’s organization.
01:50 Yet, if we think about it,
01:52 all of us figuratively
01:55 are very young ones
01:57 compared to eternity
02:00 —how long we hope to live.
02:02 So, in a sense,  our comments during this broadcast
02:07 have application to all of us.
02:11 Personally, I am so thankful to Jehovah
02:15 that positive peer pressure  was put on me
02:19 to enter the pioneer ministry  right out of high school.
02:23 What a blessing and a protection
02:27 it was to enter  the regular pioneer work
02:31 at age 17
02:33 and to be able to go to Bethel at 18.
02:36 Even though there was considerable  worldly pressure put on me
02:41 to pursue university education,
02:44 I am so happy that with Jehovah’s help,
02:49 I decided to build my future
02:52 with Jehovah.
02:54 Truly, I have no regrets.
02:59 And this is always true of young ones
03:03 who serve Jehovah from their hearts
03:06 —they have no regrets.
03:09 In fact, you will enjoy  these expressions from young ones
03:13 who are building  their future with Jehovah.
03:22 Before I started pioneering,
03:24 I was really nervous that I wouldn’t be able  to get my time in every month.
03:27 It was a bit hard when I started pioneering  because I didn’t have a car.
03:31 My boss,  he didn’t give me part-time work.
03:35 I found it really hard  to balance schoolwork
03:37 and pioneering  at the same time.
03:39 My biggest struggle was fear of man,  so that really hindered me
03:43 because I wasn’t very good  at talking to people.
03:45 Having a good routine was a struggle.
03:48 My brother and I are  the only ones in the truth.
03:51 My family didn’t understand
03:54 why we wanted to go preaching.
03:57 I didn’t think  that I’d make a good pioneer.
03:59 I’ve had Type 1 diabetes  since I was five.
04:02 So I was always worried  about whether or not
04:05 I could balance that health condition  with pioneering.
04:07 The challenges  don’t seem that big now,
04:11 but back at that time  they were a really big deal.
04:13 But the coolest thing  was how Jehovah helped me.
04:16 Prayer to Jehovah  helped me overcome my fears.
04:19 My family was  a massive help from Jehovah.
04:22 Because my dad was the one  who first encouraged me to pioneer,
04:25 when I did start pioneering,  he promised that I would have
04:28 the full support of my family.
04:30 When I spoke to brothers and sisters  who spent their youth
04:34 in the full-time service  that really helped me
04:37 because it was really encouraging,  and it really motivated me
04:40 to want to make my own memories  and my own experiences
04:43 in the full-time service.
04:45 So there were  practical things I could do.
04:47 I didn’t have a car;  I just walked or I caught the bus.
04:50 I had to work out  what my priorities were first.
04:53 So I had to find out how many hours  would I have to go witnessing every week.
04:57 So then I just sat down  and I looked at every day
04:59 and planned out which days  I could go witnessing,
05:01 which days I had to go to school,
05:03 and also allocated time  so that I could do my homework and study.
05:06 Having a schedule  was really good
05:08 because I could see it  all out in front of me,
05:10 and I could see  that the hour requirement
05:12 was actually attainable,  so that made it a lot less daunting.
05:15 I first set short-term goals of pioneering  in the special months of activity.
05:19 Then I was able  to begin continuous auxiliary,
05:23 and then eventually  I started regular pioneering.
05:26 One of the best things I did  to prepare myself for pioneering
05:29 was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand.
05:31 It really set me up  to be able to overcome
05:34 any challenges  that I faced while I was pioneering.
05:37 I thought about Malachi 3:10.
05:39 I knew I trusted in Jehovah,
05:41 but this was my chance  to test him out.
05:44 I prayed,  put my trust in Jehovah,
05:46 and put my application in.
05:48 After my form  was in for pioneering,
05:51 a brother, with time,  a brother called me and offered me work.
05:54 I had unemployment  for three months,
05:58 which wasn’t a good time.
06:01 But during that time,  I had Jehovah as my main focus.
06:04 And so he supported me,  and he didn’t let me down.
06:07 Asking brothers and sisters to come
06:09 and work with me,  maybe on days that I knew
06:11 that I wouldn’t get as much support,  really helped.
06:14 That helped me to organize  my hours a little bit more,
06:17 and also I’d get to know  my brothers and sisters more as well.
06:20 One of the greatest joys of pioneering  has been to pioneer with Mum.
06:24 And we had the privilege of going
06:26 to the pioneer school together,  which was really special.
06:29 Psalm 16:8 reminds me
06:32 that Jehovah is right beside me.
06:35 When I’m preaching,  it’s like Jehovah is holding my hand.
06:39 So with full-time service,  I love making Jehovah happy.
06:44 With everything that he has given me,  I’m finally able to give something back.
06:47 Looking back —pioneering—
06:49 it was the best decision  I’ve ever made.
06:51 It’s opened up  so many different avenues
06:53 of service to Jehovah,
06:55 and it helped me also  to have that real desire
06:57 to want to stay  in full-time service.
06:59 Helping someone  on the road to everlasting life,
07:03 it’s the best feeling ever;  and it’s really irreplaceable.
07:09 The only thing I can say,
07:11 “As a young person, start pioneering!”
07:18 What a fine attitude  those young ones have!
07:23 They are clearly following  in Jesus’ footsteps.
07:28 Jesus was the wisest man
07:32 who ever walked the earth.
07:34 He could’ve pursued any career
07:37 and truly excelled at it.
07:40 He could’ve been  the greatest carpenter who ever lived.
07:44 Think about it,
07:46 he helped his Father  build the physical universe.
07:50 Can you imagine  what kind of houses he could’ve built?
07:54 Or what if he had pursued  being an inventor?
07:59 With his perfect brain,
08:01 he probably could’ve invented  the telephone,
08:05 automobile, or computer
08:08 in the first century.
08:10 Or what about becoming  a businessman?
08:13 With perfect intelligence,
08:16 he likely could’ve come out on top
08:19 of every business transaction  that he entered,
08:22 becoming the richest businessman  who ever lived.
08:28 Or have you ever thought about
08:31 if he had pursued becoming  an athlete?
08:35 And excelling in athletic contests
08:38 was a huge endeavor in Jesus’ day.
08:41 With a little training,
08:43 it is likely that his perfect body
08:46 would have outperformed all people
08:50 with imperfect bodies,
08:52 enabling him to become
08:55 the most famous athlete who ever lived.
08:58 Or one more example,
09:01 what if he had decided to become a doctor?
09:04 He could cure sick people
09:07 —even raise the dead.
09:10 Can you imagine how much  he could’ve charged rich people
09:14 to raise their dead loved ones?
09:18 But Jesus pursued none of these careers.
09:21 Why?
09:23 Because he knew  that any of such endeavors
09:28 would have only very limited
09:31 and temporary benefits.
09:33 Instead, he pursued something
09:37 he knew would bring far-reaching  and everlasting benefits:
09:42 the full-time ministry.
09:46 If this is how the wisest man  who ever walked the earth—
09:50 If this is how he reasoned,
09:52 we are wise if we strive to think  the same way.
09:58 That makes me think of the comments
10:01 of a well-adjusted teenage brother
10:04 whom we served  while in the circuit work many years ago.
10:08 This young brother went straight into  the regular pioneer work
10:12 out of high school,
10:14 and I asked him why he did so.
10:18 He explained that he knew
10:21 he could’ve gotten a full-time secular job
10:24 and bought a new car for himself,
10:27 but he reasoned that in a few years
10:32 that car would rust out and break down,
10:36 and he would have nothing.
10:39 But he knew that he could go  into the pioneer work
10:43 and build a close relationship  with Jehovah
10:46 and perhaps even find  an honest-hearted person
10:50 and be able to teach that one the truth.
10:53 And he knew that would last forever.
10:58 Now, that is some wise thinking
11:00 on the part of that young brother.
11:03 And today, that brother  has a beautiful Christian wife
11:07 and several spiritual children,
11:10 and he is serving as a fine elder.
11:15 But if you young ones  are going to think this way
11:18 and continue to pursue spiritual goals,
11:22 it is vital that you wisely choose
11:26 your associates.
11:29 In a sense, our associates
11:32 can be likened to an elevator.
11:36 What do we mean?
11:38 Well, they can take you up
11:40 or they can take you down.
11:43 If you choose wisely,
11:45 they will take you up
11:48 —elevate your good qualities
11:50 and make you a better person.
11:52 But if you choose poorly,
11:55 they will take you down.
11:58 Depending on how badly you choose,
12:01 they can take you way down
12:03 —to the basement,
12:06 even the subbasement.
12:10 At Proverbs 13:20,
12:12 our loving heavenly Father,
12:15 who made us,  explains how it works.
12:19 Jehovah tells us there:
12:21 “The one walking with the wise
12:25 “will become wise,
12:28 “but the one  who has dealings with the stupid
12:32 will fare badly.”
12:35 “Walking with”
12:37 and “having dealings with”
12:40 mean “associating with.”
12:42 And who are the “stupid” ones?
12:45 Well, this scripture contrasts  such a person
12:49 with those who are wise.
12:51 It is not talking about someone  who lacks mental intellect.
12:55 It is talking about someone
12:58 who does not make  wise decisions spiritually
13:01 from Jehovah’s standpoint.
13:04 And if we think about it,
13:06 anyone who is not really serving Jehovah
13:10 —at least right now—
13:12 that one is unwise indeed.
13:17 And if we associate closely with such ones,
13:21 Jehovah says that we “will fare badly.”
13:26 We could use another illustration.
13:28 Think about someone who is physically sick
13:32 and is running a high fever.
13:35 If we spend a lot of time with that person,
13:38 we will probably catch the same sickness.
13:42 Or worse,
13:44 if we spend a lot of time  near a dead body—a corpse—
13:49 we will probably pick up a disease.
13:53 Well, it is similar
13:55 with spending time with a person
13:58 who is spiritually sick,
14:00 or worse, spiritually dead.
14:04 On the other hand,
14:06 if we choose as our associates
14:10 those who love Jehovah
14:12 and who are building  their everlasting future with Jehovah,
14:17 we will benefit greatly.
14:21 Please observe carefully  this variety of young ones
14:26 who are busy storing up  treasures in heaven
14:30 with Jehovah.
16:27 How heartwarming it is to us
16:31 —and we know it is to Jehovah—
16:33 to see these beautiful young people
16:37 doing what Jesus encourages
16:40 at Matthew 6:20, 21.
16:45 There, Jesus encourages:
16:48 “Store up for yourselves  treasures in heaven,
16:53 “where neither moth nor rust consumes,
16:57 “and where thieves do not break in and steal.
17:01 “For where your treasure is,
17:04 there your heart will be also.”
17:08 And if we think about it,
17:10 in the final analysis,
17:13 after all is said and done,
17:16 whether we are younger or older,
17:18 our net worth will be
17:21 what we have stored up  in heaven with Jehovah.
17:25 We will not be able to take  material treasures with us
17:29 through the great tribulation.
17:31 And if we die,
17:33 we certainly will not be able to take  material treasures with us,
17:38 but we can take spiritual treasures
17:41 with us through the great tribulation
17:44 and even through death and resurrection.
17:48 It is true with all of Jehovah’s people,
17:51 as it is with the anointed,
17:54 what is stated at Revelation 14:13.
17:58 It says there:
18:00 “The things they did go right with them.”
18:06 And how encouraging it is
18:08 to see young ones getting baptized
18:13 —publicly demonstrating
18:15 that they are giving their lives to Jehovah.
18:19 And we sincerely hope
18:21 that you young ones  who are not yet baptized
18:24 will not hold back from getting baptized
18:27 as soon as you qualify.
18:30 The sooner you can get baptized,
18:33 the sooner you will receive  greater protection
18:38 and blessings from Jehovah.
18:41 Not long ago,  it made me very happy
18:45 to observe a little ten-year-old brother
18:48 get baptized!
18:51 And young ones,
18:53 never be afraid to identify yourselves
18:58 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
19:01 Never allow the fear  of what others may think
19:05 to cause you to hesitate to do so.
19:08 Jehovah tells us
19:10 at Proverbs 29:25:
19:14 “Trembling at men is a snare,
19:19 “but the one trusting in Jehovah
19:22 will be protected.”
19:26 Many years ago when I was in school,
19:29 I can remember being  at times somewhat worried
19:34 about how my fellow classmates  would view me.
19:39 But then a little while later,
19:42 I got out of school
19:44 and never ever again even saw
19:47 most of those former classmates.
19:50 Then it dawned on me
19:53 that it doesn’t really matter  what people think about us.
19:57 It is Jehovah’s rating of us
20:00 that truly counts.
20:02 Humans cannot add
20:06 even five seconds to our lifespan,
20:09 but Jehovah can add
20:12 or subtract eternity.
20:16 And he alone  can also give us true happiness.
20:20 And as Proverbs 29:25 indicates,
20:24 what a protection
20:27 it is to courageously identify ourselves
20:31 as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
20:34 fully trusting Jehovah
20:37 and taking our stand solidly with him.
20:42 Never be ashamed of who you are.
20:47 You are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
20:53 And please, dear young ones,
20:56 we warmly encourage you
20:59 to listen to those who love you.
21:02 Jehovah loves you very much;
21:05 the Governing Body loves you very much;
21:08 the elders love you very much;
21:11 your Christian parents love you very much.
21:15 And these ones will tell you the truth,
21:19 even though at times
21:21 it may not be what you want to hear.
21:23 They will not ‘tickle your ears,’
21:27 perhaps like ones at school
21:29 or in the neighborhood
21:31 who don’t really love you
21:34 or have your best interests at heart.
21:37 But please believe those
21:40 who will tell you the truth
21:43 because they love you.
21:45 And never view  Jehovah’s laws and principles
21:50 as depriving you of something good.
21:54 View them as protecting you
21:58 from what will hurt you.
22:00 If you recall,
22:02 Satan convinced Eve
22:05 that she was being deprived by Jehovah
22:08 and was missing out on something good.
22:12 Now, it is true that Eve  was missing out on something.
22:16 But what was she really missing out on?
22:20 A tormented conscience,
22:23 her beautiful hair turning gray,
22:26 her teeth falling out,
22:28 her perfect skin wrinkling up like a prune,
22:33 being bent over from old age,
22:37 hobbling around on a cane,
22:40 and finally dying!
22:44 But Satan convinced her
22:47 that Jehovah was depriving her,
22:50 so foolishly she reached out to get
22:55 what she thought she was missing out on.
22:58 Well, Satan will try to use
23:01 the same kind of strategy on you,
23:05 but please don’t let him do it!
23:11 This also makes me think  of an experience a brother once related.
23:16 He said that he was visiting  an animal observatory,
23:21 and a large lion lunged toward him
23:25 but was prevented from reaching him
23:27 by a thick glass pane
23:30 separating the animals from the observers.
23:35 As the lion stood on his hind legs,
23:38 clawing the glass
23:40 and baring his massive teeth,
23:45 the brother came to realize in a special way
23:48 the protective value of that barrier.
23:53 Previously, he said  that he somewhat viewed the glass pane
23:58 as a restriction
24:00 because the smudges on it
24:03 partially blurred his view,
24:06 but now he viewed it
24:09 as a real protection.
24:12 Well, in a similar way,
24:14 Jehovah doesn’t want Satan,
24:18 who is described  as ‘a roaring, devouring lion’
24:22 at 1 Peter 5:8—
24:24 He doesn’t want him  to gobble down you young ones.
24:30 And His laws and principles
24:33 are designed to keep that  from happening to you.
24:37 So please listen to Jehovah.
24:41 He loves you!
24:45 You would probably agree  that having good friends
24:50 is of great encouragement  in your service to Jehovah.
24:56 You may also recognize
24:58 that there is more  to being a friend
25:01 than simply clicking links  on a computer screen
25:05 or a smartphone.
25:07 But where can you find  good friends
25:11 when there seems to be  no one to choose from?
25:14 In this dramatization,
25:17 consider the example  of this young brother
25:20 who struggled  with this very question.
25:29 My name is Akil.
25:31 When I was 18,  my family moved to a new city.
25:37 It was bad enough  leaving my friends behind.
25:40 But now,
25:42 I wasn’t sure  if I could make new ones.
25:50 My parents seemed really happy.
25:54 I didn’t want  to make them feel bad
25:57 by telling them how I really felt.
26:02 The new school  wasn’t much better
26:11 until I met Cameron.
26:15 He seemed  like a pretty cool guy.
26:22 Soon, his friends  became my friends.
26:29 . . . something that David  believed was true,
26:31 he actually proved it  by the association that he kept.
26:35 We think about one  of the closest friendships
26:37 recorded in the Scriptures,
26:38 and it was  that of David and Jonathan.
26:42 What was it that David and Jonathan  shared in common?
26:44 It wasn’t their age.
26:47 Akil,  you were texting in the meeting.
26:49 I shouldn’t have sent the text.
26:51 I’m sorry.
26:53 But Cameron is a good person.
26:56 He might even study one day.
26:59 I understand that, Akil.
27:00 But we all have to be careful  with how much time
27:03 we spend with people  that don’t love Jehovah.
27:06 See,  their values are just different.
27:08 You know  what Proverbs 13:20 says:
27:11 ‘Walk with those who are wise.’
27:13 So why don’t you seek out  friends who love Jehovah?
27:16 And you will make friends  that last a lifetime.
27:19 How am I supposed to do that?
27:21 There’s no one my age  in the congregation.
27:24 Akil, good friends  can come from unexpected places.
27:27 Mom,  I had good friends
27:31 —back home.
27:38 We all felt bad that night.
27:49 The next day,
27:51 Cameron posted pictures  of a party he had.
27:55 My parents were right.
28:00 I broke off my association  with Cameron
28:04 and his friends,
28:05 but I still felt
28:07 lost.
28:10 Hi, Akil?
28:12 Do you have  field service plans for Saturday?
28:15 Ah, no.
28:17 Good.  Now you do.
28:18 I’ll see you  at the 9:30 a.m. meeting, OK?
28:40 After service,
28:42 Max had the group  over for refreshments.
28:47 Did you take these?
28:50 Do you like them?
28:51 Yeah.
28:52 My wife,  she was always the photographer.
28:55 She loved photography.
28:57 And then one anniversary  she went out and bought me a camera,
28:59 and from that moment on,  I was hooked too.
29:04 Time flies so quickly.
29:06 It’s hard to believe  she passed away 12 years ago now.
29:11 I’m sorry.
29:12 It’s OK.
29:13 But you still take pictures?
29:15 I do.  I really enjoy photography.
29:18 There’s something about being close
29:20 to Jehovah’s creation.
29:22 It reminds me
29:24 that we’re never really alone,  you know?
29:33 Good friends can come  from unexpected places
29:37 and unexpected ages.
29:39 As I spent more time with Max,
29:42 I realized it was  just like David and Jonathan.
29:48 Their friendship was based,
29:50 not on age,  but on their love for Jehovah.
29:55 And they helped each other.
30:03 And with Max’s help,
30:05 I was able to keep  a good spiritual routine
30:07 without interruption.
30:09 Although we weren’t the same age,
30:12 Max became my good friend.
30:15 I just needed to see  what was right
30:18 in front of me.
30:23 Yes, friends can come in various ages.
30:28 And the best kind of friend
30:31 is one who encourages us in our service to Jehovah.
30:37 We all need to work hard  on making spiritual progress
30:40 —learning new things  about Jehovah and his qualities.
30:45 So we want friends  who will help us do that.
30:50 There is a saying
30:52 that experience  is the best teacher,
30:55 but that is not  really accurate.
30:58 Experience is often  the hard way to learn.
31:04 Brother Fernando Casillas  was born in Mexico,
31:08 but when he was a baby,
31:11 his family moved  to the United States.
31:15 The neighborhood he grew up in
31:18 had a lot of gang influence.
31:21 This had  a very negative impact on him.
31:25 But despite these circumstances,
31:28 notice how the truth attracted him.
31:36 I used to love violence;  I dreamed of violence.
31:39 My gang was my religion.
31:42 I got into the prison system  at a young age.
31:45 At first, they sent me  to a juvenile facility,
31:48 but I got kicked out of there  for a riot.
31:50 Basically, they deemed me a threat  to the safety and security
31:55 of the institution,  the guards, and other inmates.
31:58 And I was sent  to solitary confinement
32:00 to finish off my prison term.
32:02 Me thinking  I was violent back then
32:04 was nothing compared to  what I came out with.
32:08 Basically, what you try to come out to be
32:10 is the best killer out of all.
32:14 After my incarceration,
32:17 I was deported to Mexico.
32:21 I used to carry a weapon  with me everywhere I went.
32:23 After a while, we started getting involved  with bad people.
32:27 Eventually,  my girlfriend got in trouble.
32:30 Once that was over,
32:32 she saw a Kingdom Hall.
32:34 My girlfriend had been  to meetings as a child,
32:36 so she basically dragged me  to the Kingdom Hall.
32:39 They treated me nice.
32:41 And that’s when I started  to get to know Omar.
32:44 So I started hanging around  with him and his wife
32:46 —me and my girlfriend at the time— and going to meetings.
32:50 But it wasn’t till I found out  this guy
32:52 used to be one of my rivals
32:54 —I was very, very upset.
32:56 I felt betrayed because he never told me.
32:58 Everything that was going  through my head was,
33:01 ‘I’ve got to find a way to get him over here,
33:03 so I can hurt him.’
33:05 After thinking about all the things  that I wanted to do to him that night
33:08 —I’d been running it through my head  over and over again—
33:12 I decided to just stay friends with him.
33:16 And eventually,  we decided to start studying together.
33:20 Being the way I was,  I thought that there’s
33:23 no way a God can forgive me.
33:25 The scripture at Isaiah 55:7  really helped me,
33:29 where it says:
33:30 “Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his thoughts;
33:34 let him return to Jehovah,  who will have mercy on him.”
33:38 As time went by,  I started understanding clearly
33:41 that Jehovah does forgive.
33:43 By that time, I had already  kind of made a decision
33:47 that I was done with doing time in prison.
33:49 I just decided to cut all ties with everybody
33:51 that had anything to do  with anything illegal.
33:54 I felt like a free person.
33:56 And after progressing
33:58 and quitting the habits that I had  of smoking and drinking a lot,
34:02 I became  an unbaptized publisher.
34:04 But my father passed away;
34:07 I started hanging around  with bad association again,
34:10 and eventually  I had my privileges removed.
34:12 And as that was happening,  Satan attacked me again.
34:16 So one day, my wife was crossing the border
34:19 to go take care of some paperwork for the kids
34:22 and was surprised by the border patrol
34:24 telling her that there  were drugs in the vehicle.
34:27 We did not know  that the previous owner
34:29 had stashed drugs in the truck.
34:31 Even though later they proved
34:34 that the drugs were not my wife’s and she was released,
34:36 they still decided to keep my kids.
34:41 What I was thinking of doing  was going back to my old ways
34:44 —organizing a plot with my old friends
34:47 to bring my kids back to Mexico to me.
34:51 But I decided to rely
34:53 on Jehovah instead  and on the brothers
34:55 coming to visit me  on a regular basis
34:58 and giving me encouraging thoughts
34:59 of how Jehovah  will take care of everything.
35:02 Eventually, our kids were returned to us,
35:04 with Jehovah’s help.
35:06 After a little struggle,  of course, I had my privileges back.
35:10 A few months later, I was baptized.
35:13 I’m a lot happier now  than what I was back then.
35:18 One day as I was preaching in the rehab centers,
35:21 I ran into a person  I once knew before, growing up.
35:25 Once he found out who I was, he said:
35:28 “You’re the reason why I left town.
35:30 Every time you would see me,  you would shoot at me.”
35:33 So after a while,  I was able to convince him
35:36 that actually my purpose there
35:39 was not to hurt him anymore
35:41 but to teach him the truth
35:44 and how to gain everlasting life.
35:46 I’m no longer a violent person.
35:49 I enjoy the privileges  that Jehovah now gives me.
35:52 I have now been serving  as a ministerial servant
35:55 for the past two years.
35:56 I’m in charge of the accounting
35:58 for the Kingdom Hall,
36:00 instead of stealing money  as I used to do before.
36:04 What I do for a living  is I do gardening work.
36:06 Now I don’t carry around knives,
36:09 but I carry around my tools.
36:11 You could say that I did beat
36:13 my pistols into plowshares now
36:16 —or weed whacker or lawn mower.
36:20 I’m glad that I’m  now serving a great God
36:23 who is loving,  caring, and forgiving.
36:31 Fernando and his family are serving
36:35 in an English congregation in Mexico.
36:38 With everything  Brother Casillas went through,
36:42 he could see
36:44 that Jehovah is the best teacher.
36:47 If you listen to Jehovah,
36:50 you won’t have to learn  the hard way.
36:53 Jehovah is
36:55 “the One teaching you  to benefit yourself.”
37:01 Jeremiah 17:13  conveys the thought
37:06 that those  who do not serve Jehovah
37:10 will have their names  “written in the dust.”
37:14 But by building  your future with Jehovah,
37:18 you young ones are ensuring
37:20 that Jehovah will keep your individual names
37:25 written in his “book of life”
37:28 that is mentioned  at Philippians 4:3
37:32 and Revelation 3:5.
37:35 Earlier in the program,
37:38 we saw some examples  of how young ones
37:41 are building a future  with Jehovah.
37:45 But what impact are such efforts  having on the organization?
37:51 Let’s look at one example:
37:53 the construction  of the new world headquarters
37:57 at Warwick, New York.
38:02 Jehovah’s Witnesses built
1.6 million square feet (149,000 sq m)
38:06 in less than four years.
38:10 Of the 27,035 volunteers,
38:13 3,247 were between the ages of 19 and 25.
38:19 I thought this was a project
38:21 that was going to strictly need
38:23 very experienced brothers and sisters.
38:27 Early on, I realized I was wrong.
38:29 It was also going to take youthful energy
38:32 because of the volume of work.
38:35 The mix of older and younger ones
38:37 was really a helpful thing  on the Warwick project.
38:39 The older ones  brought skill and experience.
38:42 The younger ones  brought the energy, the muscle,
38:46 and the diligence to stay  with hard physical tasks
38:48 all the way through the project.
38:49 Whether it was in the kitchen or night watch
38:54 or the early 5:00 a.m. start  with the concrete crew
38:56 at 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12°C),
38:57 their joy and their humility was outstanding
39:00 to accept any work that needed to be done.
39:03 And a lot of young ones,  brothers and sisters,
39:05 moved into the area  so they could commute.
39:08 And they would work  day after day tirelessly,
39:10 into the evenings even,  to have the project ready for the next day.
39:14 Their energy was just astonishing.
39:18 Jehovah loves young ones,  and he’s willing to invest in them
39:21 and train them and make them  a part of his organization.
39:26 And I saw that so much.
39:29 We had a lot of young people  who offered themselves
39:31 with technical skills.
39:32 But if the humility of these  very technically-skilled young people
39:37 didn’t match  or exceed their abilities,
39:40 then, really,  Jehovah couldn’t use them.
39:42 And they were willing to adjust,  and we really saw the benefit.
39:46 We knew and they knew
39:49 that they were building
39:51 not just a project at Warwick
39:54 —they were building  a spiritual project for Jehovah.
39:57 You could see Jehovah’s spirit  operating on them.
40:00 You could see them  mature so quickly.
40:04 These young brothers  are the next generation
40:06 of elders  and traveling overseers.
40:08 They’re to be commended  and highly respected
40:11 for the contribution  they made as young men.
40:13 They all talk about the effect
40:15 that their Bethel service has had on their outlook
40:18 and how they don’t want  to get caught up
40:21 in this world  and its daily pursuits.
40:24 Use the skills you’ve learned
40:27 here on this project and in Bethel.
40:30 You are needed.
40:33 Continue to keep your spirituality up
40:36 and to keep your association  at a high level.
40:40 The highest quality of life is when,
40:43 as clay, we put ourselves  in the hands of the Great Potter, Jehovah,
40:48 and we say:  “Here I am! Send me!”.
40:51 And I’m fully confident  they will have no regrets
40:55 building their future  with Jehovah.
41:02 Yes, young ones  truly had a beautiful impact
41:07 on the construction project  of world headquarters!
41:13 By the way,  you may find it interesting to know
41:17 that the Warwick  and Wallkill construction projects
41:21 were not funded by the donations
41:24 that you have made  to the worldwide work.
41:27 Your donations are being used  to support the work
41:31 in the worldwide field.
41:34 The massive construction projects  at Warwick and Wallkill
41:39 were funded by the sale  of properties in Brooklyn.
41:44 In effect,  we just traded locations.
41:48 We traded the value  of the properties in Brooklyn
41:51 for the beautiful facilities  at Warwick and Wallkill.
41:57 And I must say,
41:59 the Governing Body is truly enjoying
42:02 the new facility at Warwick,
42:05 thanks to the hard work,
42:08 both of the young and the older ones
42:12 who labored in our behalf,
42:15 and we truly appreciate it.
42:20 The apostle Paul said of Timothy
42:23 as recorded  at Philippians 2:20-23:
42:29 “For I have no one else  of a disposition like his
42:34 “who will genuinely care  for your concerns.
42:38 “For all the others  are seeking their own interests,
42:41 “not those of Jesus Christ.
42:44 “But you know the proof  he gave of himself,
42:48 “that like a child with a father
42:51 “he slaved with me  to advance the good news.
42:55 Therefore, he is the one I am hoping to send.”
43:00 It is obvious that Paul
43:02 loved the young man Timothy very much
43:06 because of his unselfish hard work
43:09 in behalf of Kingdom interests.
43:12 Well, the Governing Body  feels exactly the same way
43:17 about you dear young ones  who are working hard
43:22 in your various theocratic assignments.
43:27 In addition to the many avenues  of full-time service
43:31 we mentioned earlier  in the program,
43:34 making yourself available  when a need arises locally
43:39 is a fine way  to seek the Kingdom first.
43:44 For example, in San Antonio,  in the state of Texas,
43:49 in the United States,
43:51 a large convention
43:54 with over 20,000  in attendance was planned.
43:59 However,  the venue could only provide
44:02 about one third of the chairs needed  for the convention.
44:07 Where would our brothers  find the needed chairs?
44:11 Well, Jehovah provided,
44:14 and many young ones  were eager to help.
44:22 When I heard  that this needed to happen,
44:25 I was thinking,  ‘How are we going to do this?’
44:27 I thought, ‘It’s a big job!’
44:30 It was amazing!
44:32 The first thing I was asked to do
44:35 was try to find a storage place  that we could use
44:37 for six to eight thousand chairs.
44:40 A sister manages a storage place,
44:42 and we saw Jehovah’s blessing
44:44 because the owner said,  “You can have this stall
44:47 “at no charge for a year  as long as you sign a contract
44:50 that it’s  for Jehovah’s Witnesses’ organization.”
44:52 Truckload after truckload  after truckload came in.
44:55 We had to unload the trucks.
44:57 The brothers had  to unstack the chairs,
44:59 repair the chairs, clean the chairs,  put them back on pallets,
45:02 restack them,
45:04 load them onto trucks,  and that was half of it.
45:06 Those were the ones  in the warehouse.
45:08 On the other side,  we got permission to ask
45:11 the San Antonio congregations  if we could use their chairs
45:14 for the convention.
45:15 We were hoping  to get three thousand chairs.
45:17 And then the numbers  grew for the audience,
45:20 so we had to increase  our numbers.
45:22 So we were able to gather  six thousand chairs
45:24 from the willing volunteers  of congregations around San Antonio.
45:29 So we prayed about it and the brothers  started asking for volunteers,
45:32 and it was a great cooperation  right at the beginning.
45:35 As soon as  we let the friends know
45:37 that this was going  to be the case,
45:40 all of them— all of them said,
45:41 “We’re going to get off  of work early.”
45:43 We immediately wanted  to clear our schedules
45:45 so that we could be available  to help in any way that we could.
45:49 It was a privilege to know
45:52 that our congregation  was going to be part of it.
45:54 We are so grateful to Jehovah  that he has given us
45:58 this privilege to do.
46:00 We had thousands of chairs
46:01 of every color —green, red, brown, blue.
46:05 We even had some bright orange ones  left out of the ‘70’s,
46:08 and we’re putting those in the back.
46:10 But it was not just the colors  but the sizes.
46:13 They were all different sizes.
46:15 And so how do you make  sections with straight rows
46:17 when the chairs  are all different sizes?
46:19 But I knew somehow,  as Jehovah’s people, we’d get it done.
46:22 And we definitely—  As you see, a lot of volunteers,
46:26 and we’re here getting it done.
46:27 And it’s made  for a beautiful experience
46:30 because the friends have gotten to know  each other as never before.
46:32 And they’re willingly  working together,
46:34 and the excitement is there.
46:36 It doesn’t matter whose venue it is,  it’s all for Jehovah,
46:40 and that’s been  the attitude everybody has had.
46:42 It just tells you  that Jehovah is a God of order.
46:45 It’s good to feel  that you’re doing your best for Jehovah.
46:48 Well, it reminds me of Psalm 127:1, where it mentions
46:53 that ‘unless Jehovah builds the house,
46:56 it’s in vain that his workers  even work hard.’
46:58 So it’s because of Jehovah’s hand  and his blessing
47:01 —that is why everything  runs so smoothly.
47:03 What other organization!
47:04 No one else can do that  except Jehovah’s people.
47:12 It truly is a fine witness  when our young ones
47:16 wholeheartedly give  of their time.
47:21 Proverbs 20:29 says:
47:24 “The glory of young men  is their strength.”
47:29 And commendably,  you young men and women
47:33 are using your strength
47:36 to make a name  with Jehovah.
47:40 Have you ever considered  helping out in a foreign-language field?
47:45 Perhaps there is a need  in your local circuit.
47:49 All over the earth,
47:51 the organization  provides language courses
47:55 with the goal of reaching  every nation, tribe, tongue, and people
48:00 with the good news of God’s Word.
48:03 Brother Juan Carlos Chacón
48:07 serves as a special pioneer
48:10 in the rapidly growing Shuar language field
48:14 in Ecuador.
48:16 He was recently asked to attend
48:19 a course at the local branch
48:21 to become a language teacher
48:24 so that he could help  willing publishers
48:27 learn the language.
48:32 [Speaking Shuar]
48:42 It has been said before,
48:46 “This is a language of the Devil”
48:49 —that it should be forgotten.
48:52 It serves no purpose.
48:58 But to Jehovah,
49:02 no nation is insignificant.
49:09 I grew up in an area  of the Ecuadorian jungle
49:11 where there is  a large community
49:13 of Shuar people.
49:19 Like many native languages,
49:21 Shuar is very complex.
49:29 We need many, many workers in the field.
49:31 But if we don’t give them a foundation,
49:34 if we don’t help them  or give them a little push,
49:37 it’s difficult for them to enter this field.
49:42 I received an invitation to attend
49:45 a seminar for language instructors.
49:53 There were 58 students in the class,
49:56 representing 16 different languages  or language groups.
50:11 We are learning  fantastic teaching techniques,
50:13 real techniques that work.
50:21 The instructor told us how humor helps  our minds to create a world of connections,
50:24 which stimulates our brain.
50:36 Yeah, I’m like a small child
50:39 when it comes to drawing.
50:41 I never learned to draw well.
50:44 We draw a scene,
50:46 and starting with our native language
50:48 along with large gestures,
50:51 we act out a dialogue.
50:54 Little by little,
50:56 we convert the scene into the new language.
51:18 What scares me?
51:20 That I’ve never done this before.
51:23 This will be my first time.
51:28 I don’t have any experience  teaching languages.
51:44 Although I felt intimidated by this,
51:47 I knew that with Jehovah  all things are possible.
51:56 Welcome to the first day  of the Shuar language course.
52:17 The techniques they offered us  in the course were like a box of tools
52:21 that we need to study more carefully  and see how to apply them
52:25 in each circumstance.
52:31 When we are in the territory,
52:33 we see how people’s eyes  light up when they learn
52:37 the name of God.
52:39 Just seeing that there is so much need  for them to learn the truth,
52:44 that has motivated us to come here
52:46 and continue serving here.
52:55 Since God has created us,
52:57 we know that he will never abandon us.
52:59 He thinks about us all the time,
53:01 and he loves us very much.
53:04 I didn’t know that before.
53:06 I feel so happy now
53:08 because I can really understand  the Word of God.
53:14 Being in an isolated group far from other congregations,
53:18 my wife and I  have felt every day
53:20 how real Jehovah is.
53:23 Jehovah is now looking
53:25 and giving his attention  to these small places,
53:28 no matter how small they are.
53:31 If people have a good heart  and want to serve Jehovah,
53:35 he will send workers to give the help that is needed.
53:40 And in reality, this moves us  to say to him with all of our heart,
53:44 “Thank you, Jehovah.”
53:55 There is a lot to do  in Jehovah’s organization
53:59 regardless of our age.
54:02 Even if our circumstances  may restrict us,
54:06 Jehovah sees and values
54:11 all of our efforts  to expand our ministry
54:15 and to build  an everlasting future with him.
54:21 Our music video for this month
54:24 is appropriately entitled
54:27 Building My Future With Jehovah.
54:41 At times, I wish I could see  exactly what my future will be
54:48 And how my life will turn out  and which road is the right one for me.
54:58 But one thing’s for sure,  no matter what comes along,
55:06 I live for Jehovah,  to him I belong.
55:14 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
55:20 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
55:24 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
55:32 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
55:37 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
55:42 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
55:50 At times, the chance comes along  to take a path I know to be wrong,
55:58 A path that leads me away  from the place that I know I belong.
56:08 But keeping in mind  the dedication I made
56:17 Can give me the firmness and faith  that won’t fade.
56:25 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
56:29 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
56:34 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
56:42 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
56:47 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
56:51 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
57:00 I’m building a future  that never will end
57:04 If I build it with help  from Jehovah, my Friend.
57:09 The happiest moments,  the best life can give,
57:13 Come from pleasing Jehovah  each day that I live.
57:38 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
57:43 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
57:47 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
57:55 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
58:00 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
58:05 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
58:18 I’m building my future  with him ev’ry step that I take.
58:29 An encouraging song indeed!
58:34 We encourage all young ones
58:37 to take the message of this program
58:40 —to build a future with Jehovah—
58:43 to heart.
58:45 Prayerfully consider what you can do
58:49 to expand your ministry.
58:52 Always safeguard  your most valuable possession
58:57 —your precious relationship  with Jehovah.
59:02 Never forget  that there are more with you
59:06 than there are against you.
59:09 It is true that Satan, the demons,
59:13 and this world are against you.
59:16 But your brothers and sisters,
59:18 including the Governing Body,  are with you;
59:23 the angels are with you;
59:27 the resurrected immortal anointed ones  are with you;
59:33 Jesus is with you;
59:35 and most important,  Jehovah is with you.
59:41 You are never alone!
59:46 To conclude,
59:48 we have greetings  to share with you
59:51 from the special convention  that was held
59:53 in July of last year
59:56 in Paris, France.
59:58 I had the privilege  of attending this convention
1:00:01 with Brother Kenneth Flodin,
1:00:03 a helper to the Teaching Committee.
1:00:05 While most of the convention program  was in French,
1:00:09 it was simultaneously interpreted
1:00:11 into Croatian, English,
1:00:15 and Polish  for the benefit
1:00:17 of the international delegates.
1:00:20 You will be happy to know
1:00:22 that 71 new sisters
1:00:24 and 41 new brothers
1:00:26 symbolized their dedication  through water baptism.
1:00:32 The oldest baptismal candidate  was an 80-year-old sister
1:00:35 and the youngest  was a 10-year-old.
1:00:39 The young candidates  had to overcome
1:00:41 various challenges in order  to reach their goal
1:00:44 of baptism.
1:00:46 Four of them took this step
1:00:48 even though their parents
1:00:50 are not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
1:00:52 Many of these dear young ones  had to overcome
1:00:54 peer pressure at school
1:00:56 —pressure to do things
1:00:59 Jehovah does not like.
1:01:01 Two of the young brothers,  also fleshly brothers,
1:01:04 used to play  violent video games.
1:01:07 Through their personal Bible study
1:01:09 and the personal interest  shown in them,
1:01:12 they came to understand  Jehovah’s viewpoint on violence
1:01:16 and made the necessary changes  to progress spiritually.
1:01:20 By taking this first step
1:01:22 of getting baptized,  these brothers and sisters have shown
1:01:26 that they want to build a future
1:01:29 with Jehovah.
1:01:31 Let us all do everything
1:01:33 we can to continue making  spiritual progress,
1:01:37 which will bring  Jehovah’s smile of approval.
1:01:42 Brothers and sisters,  we love you very much.

00:01.083 --> 00:05.421
Welcome to another edition 


00:05.422 --> 00:08.759
of JW Broadcasting! 


00:08.758 --> 00:11.626
This month we will see examples 


00:11.627 --> 00:14.064
of what young ones 


00:14.063 --> 00:17.500
around the world
have done to seek


00:17.500 --> 00:19.468
the Kingdom first. 


00:19.468 --> 00:21.470
Also,


00:21.470 --> 00:25.342
you will meet a brother 
who got into a lot of trouble 


00:25.342 --> 00:27.510
early in his life. 


00:27.510 --> 00:30.213
But how did the truth help him 


00:30.213 --> 00:33.215
to straighten out his life? 


00:33.215 --> 00:36.218
We look forward to his story. 


00:36.218 --> 00:40.623
We will also visit 
a language course in Ecuador. 


00:40.623 --> 00:43.426
What is it like 
to learn a new language 


00:43.427 --> 00:45.995
to expand our ministry? 


00:45.995 --> 00:48.263
We will find out. 


00:48.263 --> 00:51.935
This is the March program 


00:51.935 --> 00:54.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:12.422 --> 01:16.994
My theme for this month’s broadcast is 


01:16.993 --> 01:22.000
“Young Ones
—Build Your Future With Jehovah!”


01:23.132 --> 01:27.970
If you do, 
1 Timothy 6:19 assures 


01:27.970 --> 01:31.307
that you will 
‘safely treasure up for yourself 


01:31.307 --> 01:34.144
a fine foundation for the future,’ 


01:34.143 --> 01:39.000
and you will 
“get a firm hold on the real life.”


01:40.583 --> 01:44.853
Obviously, we will be directing 
many of our comments 


01:44.853 --> 01:47.990
directly to you dear young ones 


01:47.990 --> 01:50.793
in Jehovah’s organization.


01:50.793 --> 01:52.961
Yet, if we think about it, 


01:52.962 --> 01:55.132
all of us figuratively 


01:55.132 --> 01:57.300
are very young ones 


01:57.300 --> 02:00.035
compared to eternity


02:00.035 --> 02:02.772
—how long we hope to live. 


02:02.772 --> 02:07.377
So, in a sense, 
our comments during this broadcast 


02:07.377 --> 02:11.014
have application to all of us.


02:11.013 --> 02:15.885
Personally, I am so thankful to Jehovah 


02:15.885 --> 02:19.655
that positive peer pressure 
was put on me 


02:19.655 --> 02:23.960
to enter the pioneer ministry 
right out of high school. 


02:23.960 --> 02:27.397
What a blessing and a protection 


02:27.397 --> 02:31.300
it was to enter 
the regular pioneer work 


02:31.300 --> 02:33.537
at age 17 


02:33.537 --> 02:36.974
and to be able to go to Bethel at 18. 


02:36.973 --> 02:41.776
Even though there was considerable 
worldly pressure put on me 


02:41.777 --> 02:44.847
to pursue university education, 


02:44.847 --> 02:49.219
I am so happy that with Jehovah’s help, 


02:49.218 --> 02:52.888
I decided to build my future 


02:52.888 --> 02:54.890
with Jehovah. 


02:54.890 --> 02:59.028
Truly, I have no regrets. 


02:59.028 --> 03:03.031
And this is always true of young ones 


03:03.032 --> 03:06.569
who serve Jehovah from their hearts


03:06.568 --> 03:09.038
—they have no regrets. 


03:09.038 --> 03:13.776
In fact, you will enjoy 
these expressions from young ones 


03:13.777 --> 03:17.000
who are building 
their future with Jehovah.


03:22.218 --> 03:24.220
Before I started pioneering, 


03:24.220 --> 03:27.923
I was really nervous that I wouldn’t be able 
to get my time in every month.


03:27.923 --> 03:31.895
It was a bit hard when I started pioneering 
because I didn’t have a car.


03:31.895 --> 03:35.298
My boss, 
he didn’t give me part-time work.


03:35.298 --> 03:37.600
I found it really hard 
to balance schoolwork 


03:37.600 --> 03:39.668
and pioneering 
at the same time.


03:39.668 --> 03:43.005
My biggest struggle was fear of man, 
so that really hindered me 


03:43.005 --> 03:45.308
because I wasn’t very good 
at talking to people.


03:45.308 --> 03:48.210
Having a good routine was a struggle.


03:48.210 --> 03:51.847
My brother and I are 
the only ones in the truth. 


03:51.847 --> 03:54.184
My family didn’t understand 


03:54.183 --> 03:57.020
why we wanted to go preaching.


03:57.020 --> 03:59.255
I didn’t think 
that I’d make a good pioneer.


03:59.255 --> 04:02.158
I’ve had Type 1 diabetes 
since I was five. 


04:02.158 --> 04:05.295
So I was always worried 
about whether or not 


04:05.295 --> 04:07.763
I could balance that health condition 
with pioneering.


04:07.763 --> 04:11.233
The challenges 
don’t seem that big now, 


04:11.233 --> 04:13.970
but back at that time 
they were a really big deal. 


04:13.970 --> 04:16.638
But the coolest thing 
was how Jehovah helped me.


04:16.638 --> 04:19.608
Prayer to Jehovah 
helped me overcome my fears.


04:19.608 --> 04:22.711
My family was 
a massive help from Jehovah. 


04:22.712 --> 04:25.582
Because my dad was the one 
who first encouraged me to pioneer, 


04:25.582 --> 04:28.985
when I did start pioneering, 
he promised that I would have 


04:28.985 --> 04:30.887
the full support of my family.


04:30.887 --> 04:34.857
When I spoke to brothers and sisters 
who spent their youth 


04:34.857 --> 04:37.527
in the full-time service 
that really helped me


04:37.527 --> 04:40.797
because it was really encouraging, 
and it really motivated me 


04:40.797 --> 04:43.399
to want to make my own memories 
and my own experiences 


04:43.398 --> 04:45.301
in the full-time service.


04:45.302 --> 04:47.537
So there were 
practical things I could do. 


04:47.537 --> 04:50.907
I didn’t have a car; 
I just walked or I caught the bus.


04:50.907 --> 04:53.542
I had to work out 
what my priorities were first. 


04:53.542 --> 04:57.680
So I had to find out how many hours 
would I have to go witnessing every week. 


04:57.680 --> 04:59.815
So then I just sat down 
and I looked at every day 


04:59.815 --> 05:01.817
and planned out which days 
I could go witnessing, 


05:01.817 --> 05:03.820
which days I had to go to school, 


05:03.820 --> 05:06.922
and also allocated time 
so that I could do my homework and study.


05:06.922 --> 05:08.692
Having a schedule 
was really good 


05:08.692 --> 05:10.694
because I could see it 
all out in front of me,


05:10.693 --> 05:12.695
and I could see 
that the hour requirement 


05:12.695 --> 05:15.565
was actually attainable, 
so that made it a lot less daunting.


05:15.565 --> 05:19.768
I first set short-term goals of pioneering 
in the special months of activity. 


05:19.768 --> 05:23.371
Then I was able 
to begin continuous auxiliary, 


05:23.372 --> 05:26.142
and then eventually 
I started regular pioneering.


05:26.142 --> 05:29.379
One of the best things I did 
to prepare myself for pioneering 


05:29.378 --> 05:31.480
was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand. 


05:31.480 --> 05:34.117
It really set me up 
to be able to overcome 


05:34.117 --> 05:37.154
any challenges 
that I faced while I was pioneering.


05:37.153 --> 05:39.788
I thought about Malachi 3:10. 


05:39.788 --> 05:41.790
I knew I trusted in Jehovah, 


05:41.790 --> 05:44.327
but this was my chance 
to test him out.


05:44.327 --> 05:46.962
I prayed, 
put my trust in Jehovah, 


05:46.962 --> 05:48.999
and put my application in.


05:48.998 --> 05:51.566
After my form 
was in for pioneering, 


05:51.567 --> 05:54.837
a brother, with time, 
a brother called me and offered me work.


05:54.837 --> 05:58.007
I had unemployment 
for three months, 


05:58.007 --> 06:01.277
which wasn’t a good time. 


06:01.277 --> 06:04.580
But during that time, 
I had Jehovah as my main focus. 


06:04.580 --> 06:07.917
And so he supported me, 
and he didn’t let me down.


06:07.917 --> 06:09.919
Asking brothers and sisters to come 


06:09.918 --> 06:11.986
and work with me, 
maybe on days that I knew 


06:11.987 --> 06:14.257
that I wouldn’t get as much support, 
really helped. 


06:14.257 --> 06:17.294
That helped me to organize 
my hours a little bit more, 


06:17.293 --> 06:20.563
and also I’d get to know 
my brothers and sisters more as well.


06:20.563 --> 06:24.366
One of the greatest joys of pioneering 
has been to pioneer with Mum. 


06:24.367 --> 06:26.935
And we had the privilege of going 


06:26.935 --> 06:29.638
to the pioneer school together, 
which was really special.


06:29.638 --> 06:32.675
Psalm 16:8 reminds me 


06:32.675 --> 06:35.745
that Jehovah is right beside me. 


06:35.745 --> 06:39.948
When I’m preaching, 
it’s like Jehovah is holding my hand.


06:39.948 --> 06:44.053
So with full-time service, 
I love making Jehovah happy. 


06:44.053 --> 06:47.790
With everything that he has given me, 
I’m finally able to give something back.


06:47.790 --> 06:49.658
Looking back
—pioneering—


06:49.658 --> 06:51.493
it was the best decision 
I’ve ever made. 


06:51.493 --> 06:53.528
It’s opened up 
so many different avenues 


06:53.528 --> 06:55.363
of service to Jehovah, 


06:55.363 --> 06:57.366
and it helped me also 
to have that real desire 


06:57.367 --> 06:59.869
to want to stay 
in full-time service.


06:59.868 --> 07:03.438
Helping someone 
on the road to everlasting life, 


07:03.438 --> 07:07.000
it’s the best feeling ever; 
and it’s really irreplaceable.


07:09.445 --> 07:11.847
The only thing I can say, 


07:11.847 --> 07:15.000
“As a young person, start pioneering!”


07:18.387 --> 07:22.000
What a fine attitude 
those young ones have! 


07:23.058 --> 07:28.396
They are clearly following 
in Jesus’ footsteps. 


07:28.397 --> 07:32.034
Jesus was the wisest man 


07:32.033 --> 07:34.036
who ever walked the earth. 


07:34.037 --> 07:37.072
He could’ve pursued any career 


07:37.072 --> 07:40.075
and truly excelled at it. 


07:40.075 --> 07:44.713
He could’ve been 
the greatest carpenter who ever lived. 


07:44.713 --> 07:46.715
Think about it, 


07:46.715 --> 07:50.620
he helped his Father 
build the physical universe. 


07:50.620 --> 07:54.890
Can you imagine 
what kind of houses he could’ve built? 


07:54.890 --> 07:59.528
Or what if he had pursued 
being an inventor? 


07:59.528 --> 08:01.996
With his perfect brain, 


08:01.997 --> 08:05.935
he probably could’ve invented 
the telephone, 


08:05.935 --> 08:08.303
automobile, or computer 


08:08.303 --> 08:10.405
in the first century. 


08:10.405 --> 08:13.542
Or what about becoming 
a businessman? 


08:13.542 --> 08:16.445
With perfect intelligence, 


08:16.445 --> 08:19.382
he likely could’ve come out on top 


08:19.382 --> 08:22.885
of every business transaction 
that he entered, 


08:22.885 --> 08:27.000
becoming the richest businessman 
who ever lived. 


08:28.723 --> 08:31.526
Or have you ever thought about 


08:31.527 --> 08:35.064
if he had pursued becoming 
an athlete? 


08:35.063 --> 08:38.133
And excelling in athletic contests 


08:38.133 --> 08:41.803
was a huge endeavor in Jesus’ day. 


08:41.803 --> 08:43.771
With a little training, 


08:43.772 --> 08:46.742
it is likely that his perfect body 


08:46.742 --> 08:50.412
would have outperformed all people 


08:50.412 --> 08:52.682
with imperfect bodies, 


08:52.682 --> 08:55.150
enabling him to become 


08:55.150 --> 08:58.955
the most famous athlete who ever lived. 


08:58.955 --> 09:01.223
Or one more example, 


09:01.223 --> 09:04.460
what if he had decided to become a doctor? 


09:04.460 --> 09:07.430
He could cure sick people


09:07.430 --> 09:10.733
—even raise the dead. 


09:10.733 --> 09:14.736
Can you imagine how much 
he could’ve charged rich people 


09:14.737 --> 09:17.000
to raise their dead loved ones? 


09:18.373 --> 09:21.810
But Jesus pursued none of these careers. 


09:21.810 --> 09:23.812
Why? 


09:23.812 --> 09:28.184
Because he knew 
that any of such endeavors 


09:28.183 --> 09:31.053
would have only very limited 


09:31.053 --> 09:33.956
and temporary benefits. 


09:33.957 --> 09:37.192
Instead, he pursued something 


09:37.192 --> 09:42.164
he knew would bring far-reaching 
and everlasting benefits: 


09:42.163 --> 09:45.000
the full-time ministry. 


09:46.035 --> 09:50.138
If this is how the wisest man 
who ever walked the earth—


09:50.138 --> 09:52.408
If this is how he reasoned, 


09:52.408 --> 09:57.000
we are wise if we strive to think 
the same way.


09:58.347 --> 10:01.150
That makes me think of the comments 


10:01.150 --> 10:04.253
of a well-adjusted teenage brother 


10:04.253 --> 10:08.190
whom we served 
while in the circuit work many years ago. 


10:08.190 --> 10:12.862
This young brother went straight into 
the regular pioneer work 


10:12.862 --> 10:14.864
out of high school, 


10:14.863 --> 10:17.000
and I asked him why he did so. 


10:18.533 --> 10:21.203
He explained that he knew 


10:21.203 --> 10:24.640
he could’ve gotten a full-time secular job 


10:24.640 --> 10:27.377
and bought a new car for himself, 


10:27.377 --> 10:32.247
but he reasoned that in a few years 


10:32.247 --> 10:36.785
that car would rust out and break down, 


10:36.785 --> 10:39.022
and he would have nothing. 


10:39.022 --> 10:43.092
But he knew that he could go 
into the pioneer work 


10:43.092 --> 10:46.429
and build a close relationship 
with Jehovah 


10:46.428 --> 10:50.031
and perhaps even find 
an honest-hearted person


10:50.032 --> 10:53.002
and be able to teach that one the truth. 


10:53.002 --> 10:58.274
And he knew that would last forever. 


10:58.273 --> 11:00.508
Now, that is some wise thinking 


11:00.508 --> 11:03.278
on the part of that young brother. 


11:03.278 --> 11:07.750
And today, that brother 
has a beautiful Christian wife 


11:07.750 --> 11:10.218
and several spiritual children, 


11:10.218 --> 11:14.000
and he is serving as a fine elder.


11:15.157 --> 11:18.760
But if you young ones 
are going to think this way 


11:18.760 --> 11:22.197
and continue to pursue spiritual goals, 


11:22.197 --> 11:26.802
it is vital that you wisely choose 


11:26.802 --> 11:29.105
your associates. 


11:29.105 --> 11:32.675
In a sense, our associates 


11:32.675 --> 11:36.145
can be likened to an elevator. 


11:36.145 --> 11:38.113
What do we mean? 


11:38.113 --> 11:40.816
Well, they can take you up 


11:40.817 --> 11:43.552
or they can take you down. 


11:43.552 --> 11:45.822
If you choose wisely, 


11:45.822 --> 11:48.124
they will take you up


11:48.123 --> 11:50.826
—elevate your good qualities 


11:50.827 --> 11:52.995
and make you a better person. 


11:52.995 --> 11:55.330
But if you choose poorly, 


11:55.330 --> 11:58.100
they will take you down. 


11:58.100 --> 12:01.570
Depending on how badly you choose, 


12:01.570 --> 12:03.872
they can take you way down


12:03.872 --> 12:06.042
—to the basement, 


12:06.042 --> 12:10.345
even the subbasement. 


12:10.345 --> 12:12.882
At Proverbs 13:20, 


12:12.882 --> 12:15.717
our loving heavenly Father, 


12:15.717 --> 12:19.289
who made us, 
explains how it works. 


12:19.288 --> 12:21.723
Jehovah tells us there: 


12:21.723 --> 12:25.493
“The one walking with the wise 


12:25.493 --> 12:28.263
“will become wise, 


12:28.263 --> 12:32.501
“but the one 
who has dealings with the stupid 


12:32.502 --> 12:35.805
will fare badly.”


12:35.805 --> 12:37.807
“Walking with” 


12:37.807 --> 12:40.175
and “having dealings with” 


12:40.175 --> 12:42.612
mean “associating with.” 


12:42.612 --> 12:45.815
And who are the “stupid” ones? 


12:45.815 --> 12:49.452
Well, this scripture contrasts 
such a person 


12:49.452 --> 12:51.687
with those who are wise. 


12:51.687 --> 12:55.624
It is not talking about someone 
who lacks mental intellect. 


12:55.623 --> 12:58.060
It is talking about someone 


12:58.060 --> 13:01.930
who does not make 
wise decisions spiritually 


13:01.930 --> 13:04.500
from Jehovah’s standpoint. 


13:04.500 --> 13:06.535
And if we think about it, 


13:06.535 --> 13:10.505
anyone who is not really serving Jehovah


13:10.505 --> 13:12.508
—at least right now—


13:12.508 --> 13:17.411
that one is unwise indeed. 


13:17.412 --> 13:21.450
And if we associate closely with such ones, 


13:21.450 --> 13:26.655
Jehovah says that we “will fare badly.” 


13:26.655 --> 13:28.990
We could use another illustration. 


13:28.990 --> 13:32.460
Think about someone who is physically sick 


13:32.460 --> 13:35.263
and is running a high fever. 


13:35.263 --> 13:38.933
If we spend a lot of time with that person, 


13:38.933 --> 13:42.838
we will probably catch the same sickness. 


13:42.838 --> 13:44.873
Or worse, 


13:44.873 --> 13:49.311
if we spend a lot of time 
near a dead body—a corpse—


13:49.312 --> 13:53.149
we will probably pick up a disease. 


13:53.148 --> 13:55.616
Well, it is similar 


13:55.617 --> 13:58.120
with spending time with a person 


13:58.120 --> 14:00.255
who is spiritually sick, 


14:00.255 --> 14:04.693
or worse, spiritually dead. 


14:04.693 --> 14:06.895
On the other hand, 


14:06.895 --> 14:10.365
if we choose as our associates 


14:10.365 --> 14:12.602
those who love Jehovah 


14:12.602 --> 14:17.674
and who are building 
their everlasting future with Jehovah, 


14:17.673 --> 14:20.000
we will benefit greatly. 


14:21.677 --> 14:26.649
Please observe carefully 
this variety of young ones 


14:26.648 --> 14:30.986
who are busy storing up 
treasures in heaven 


14:30.987 --> 14:33.000
with Jehovah.


16:27.468 --> 16:31.073
How heartwarming it is to us


16:31.073 --> 16:33.775
—and we know it is to Jehovah—


16:33.775 --> 16:37.045
to see these beautiful young people 


16:37.045 --> 16:40.415
doing what Jesus encourages  


16:40.415 --> 16:45.120
at Matthew 6:20, 21. 


16:45.120 --> 16:48.057
There, Jesus encourages: 


16:48.057 --> 16:53.679
“Store up for yourselves 
treasures in heaven,


16:53.678 --> 16:57.365
“where neither moth nor rust consumes, 


16:57.365 --> 17:01.703
“and where thieves do not break in and steal.


17:01.703 --> 17:04.473
“For where your treasure is, 


17:04.473 --> 17:08.810
there your heart will be also.”


17:08.810 --> 17:10.978
And if we think about it, 


17:10.978 --> 17:13.748
in the final analysis, 


17:13.748 --> 17:16.051
after all is said and done, 


17:16.052 --> 17:18.654
whether we are younger or older,


17:18.653 --> 17:21.890
our net worth will be 


17:21.890 --> 17:25.593
what we have stored up 
in heaven with Jehovah. 


17:25.593 --> 17:29.631
We will not be able to take 
material treasures with us 


17:29.632 --> 17:31.867
through the great tribulation. 


17:31.867 --> 17:33.935
And if we die, 


17:33.935 --> 17:38.173
we certainly will not be able to take 
material treasures with us, 


17:38.173 --> 17:41.310
but we can take spiritual treasures 


17:41.310 --> 17:44.480
with us through the great tribulation 


17:44.480 --> 17:48.417
and even through death and resurrection. 


17:48.417 --> 17:51.820
It is true with all of Jehovah’s people, 


17:51.820 --> 17:54.188
as it is with the anointed, 


17:54.188 --> 17:58.426
what is stated at Revelation 14:13. 


17:58.427 --> 18:00.462
It says there: 


18:00.462 --> 18:05.000
“The things they did go right with them.”


18:06.268 --> 18:08.736
And how encouraging it is 


18:08.737 --> 18:13.042
to see young ones getting baptized


18:13.042 --> 18:15.710
—publicly demonstrating 


18:15.710 --> 18:19.047
that they are giving their lives to Jehovah. 


18:19.047 --> 18:21.250
And we sincerely hope 


18:21.250 --> 18:24.520
that you young ones 
who are not yet baptized 


18:24.520 --> 18:27.823
will not hold back from getting baptized 


18:27.823 --> 18:30.858
as soon as you qualify. 


18:30.858 --> 18:33.428
The sooner you can get baptized, 


18:33.428 --> 18:38.100
the sooner you will receive 
greater protection 


18:38.100 --> 18:41.203
and blessings from Jehovah. 


18:41.203 --> 18:45.240
Not long ago, 
it made me very happy 


18:45.240 --> 18:48.143
to observe a little ten-year-old brother 


18:48.143 --> 18:51.146
get baptized!


18:51.147 --> 18:53.182
And young ones, 


18:53.182 --> 18:58.020
never be afraid to identify yourselves 


18:58.020 --> 19:01.190
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


19:01.190 --> 19:05.660
Never allow the fear 
of what others may think 


19:05.660 --> 19:08.730
to cause you to hesitate to do so. 


19:08.730 --> 19:10.732
Jehovah tells us 


19:10.732 --> 19:14.537
at Proverbs 29:25: 


19:14.537 --> 19:19.445
“Trembling at men is a snare, 


19:19.445 --> 19:22.845
“but the one trusting in Jehovah 


19:22.845 --> 19:25.000
will be protected.”


19:26.682 --> 19:29.785
Many years ago when I was in school, 


19:29.785 --> 19:34.690
I can remember being 
at times somewhat worried 


19:34.690 --> 19:39.360
about how my fellow classmates 
would view me. 


19:39.360 --> 19:42.130
But then a little while later, 


19:42.130 --> 19:44.165
I got out of school 


19:44.165 --> 19:47.335
and never ever again even saw 


19:47.335 --> 19:50.272
most of those former classmates. 


19:50.272 --> 19:53.175
Then it dawned on me 


19:53.175 --> 19:57.678
that it doesn’t really matter 
what people think about us. 


19:57.678 --> 20:00.515
It is Jehovah’s rating of us 


20:00.515 --> 20:02.918
that truly counts. 


20:02.918 --> 20:06.020
Humans cannot add 


20:06.020 --> 20:09.357
even five seconds to our lifespan, 


20:09.357 --> 20:12.527
but Jehovah can add 


20:12.527 --> 20:16.164
or subtract eternity. 


20:16.163 --> 20:20.701
And he alone 
can also give us true happiness. 


20:20.702 --> 20:24.907
And as Proverbs 29:25 indicates, 


20:24.907 --> 20:27.042
what a protection 


20:27.042 --> 20:31.880
it is to courageously identify ourselves 


20:31.880 --> 20:34.683
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


20:34.683 --> 20:37.185
fully trusting Jehovah 


20:37.185 --> 20:42.423
and taking our stand solidly with him. 


20:42.423 --> 20:47.261
Never be ashamed of who you are. 


20:47.262 --> 20:52.000
You are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


20:53.835 --> 20:56.372
And please, dear young ones, 


20:56.372 --> 20:59.107
we warmly encourage you 


20:59.107 --> 21:02.877
to listen to those who love you. 


21:02.877 --> 21:05.614
Jehovah loves you very much; 


21:05.613 --> 21:08.816
the Governing Body loves you very much; 


21:08.817 --> 21:11.954
the elders love you very much; 


21:11.953 --> 21:15.590
your Christian parents love you very much. 


21:15.590 --> 21:19.127
And these ones will tell you the truth, 


21:19.127 --> 21:21.129
even though at times 


21:21.128 --> 21:23.798
it may not be what you want to hear. 


21:23.798 --> 21:27.135
They will not ‘tickle your ears,’ 


21:27.135 --> 21:29.938
perhaps like ones at school 


21:29.938 --> 21:31.973
or in the neighborhood 


21:31.973 --> 21:34.375
who don’t really love you 


21:34.375 --> 21:37.712
or have your best interests at heart. 


21:37.712 --> 21:40.682
But please believe those 


21:40.682 --> 21:43.219
who will tell you the truth 


21:43.218 --> 21:45.586
because they love you. 


21:45.587 --> 21:50.292
And never view 
Jehovah’s laws and principles 


21:50.292 --> 21:54.562
as depriving you of something good. 


21:54.562 --> 21:58.134
View them as protecting you 


21:58.133 --> 22:00.601
from what will hurt you. 


22:00.602 --> 22:02.704
If you recall, 


22:02.703 --> 22:05.273
Satan convinced Eve 


22:05.273 --> 22:08.576
that she was being deprived by Jehovah 


22:08.577 --> 22:11.000
and was missing out on something good. 


22:12.280 --> 22:16.150
Now, it is true that Eve 
was missing out on something. 


22:16.150 --> 22:20.288
But what was she really missing out on? 


22:20.288 --> 22:23.258
A tormented conscience, 


22:23.258 --> 22:26.093
her beautiful hair turning gray, 


22:26.093 --> 22:28.596
her teeth falling out, 


22:28.597 --> 22:33.402
her perfect skin wrinkling up like a prune, 


22:33.402 --> 22:37.305
being bent over from old age, 


22:37.305 --> 22:40.308
hobbling around on a cane, 


22:40.308 --> 22:43.000
and finally dying! 


22:44.345 --> 22:47.182
But Satan convinced her 


22:47.182 --> 22:50.552
that Jehovah was depriving her, 


22:50.552 --> 22:55.424
so foolishly she reached out to get 


22:55.423 --> 22:58.960
what she thought she was missing out on. 


22:58.960 --> 23:01.897
Well, Satan will try to use 


23:01.897 --> 23:04.000
the same kind of strategy on you, 


23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
but please don’t let him do it!


23:11.440 --> 23:16.978
This also makes me think 
of an experience a brother once related. 


23:16.978 --> 23:21.115
He said that he was visiting 
an animal observatory, 


23:21.115 --> 23:25.053
and a large lion lunged toward him 


23:25.053 --> 23:27.755
but was prevented from reaching him 


23:27.755 --> 23:30.492
by a thick glass pane 


23:30.492 --> 23:34.000
separating the animals from the observers. 


23:35.263 --> 23:38.400
As the lion stood on his hind legs, 


23:38.400 --> 23:40.935
clawing the glass 


23:40.935 --> 23:43.000
and baring his massive teeth, 


23:45.073 --> 23:48.676
the brother came to realize in a special way 


23:48.677 --> 23:53.915
the protective value of that barrier. 


23:53.915 --> 23:58.320
Previously, he said 
that he somewhat viewed the glass pane 


23:58.320 --> 24:00.555
as a restriction 


24:00.555 --> 24:03.292
because the smudges on it 


24:03.292 --> 24:06.394
partially blurred his view, 


24:06.393 --> 24:09.396
but now he viewed it 


24:09.397 --> 24:12.600
as a real protection. 


24:12.600 --> 24:14.602
Well, in a similar way, 


24:14.602 --> 24:18.105
Jehovah doesn’t want Satan, 


24:18.105 --> 24:22.877
who is described 
as ‘a roaring, devouring lion’ 


24:22.877 --> 24:24.880
at 1 Peter 5:8— 


24:24.880 --> 24:29.000
He doesn’t want him 
to gobble down you young ones. 


24:30.518 --> 24:33.221
And His laws and principles 


24:33.222 --> 24:36.000
are designed to keep that 
from happening to you. 


24:37.125 --> 24:41.028
So please listen to Jehovah. 


24:41.028 --> 24:44.000
He loves you!


24:45.567 --> 24:50.272
You would probably agree 
that having good friends 


24:50.272 --> 24:56.244
is of great encouragement 
in your service to Jehovah. 


24:56.243 --> 24:58.580
You may also recognize 


24:58.580 --> 25:01.115
that there is more 
to being a friend 


25:01.115 --> 25:05.020
than simply clicking links 
on a computer screen 


25:05.020 --> 25:07.722
or a smartphone. 


25:07.722 --> 25:11.059
But where can you find 
good friends 


25:11.058 --> 25:14.595
when there seems to be 
no one to choose from? 


25:14.595 --> 25:17.598
In this dramatization, 


25:17.598 --> 25:20.768
consider the example 
of this young brother 


25:20.768 --> 25:25.000
who struggled 
with this very question.


25:29.110 --> 25:31.847
My name is Akil. 


25:31.847 --> 25:35.000
When I was 18, 
my family moved to a new city. 


25:37.518 --> 25:40.955
It was bad enough 
leaving my friends behind. 


25:40.955 --> 25:42.523
But now, 


25:42.523 --> 25:46.000
I wasn’t sure 
if I could make new ones.


25:50.332 --> 25:53.000
My parents seemed really happy. 


25:54.735 --> 25:57.472
I didn’t want 
to make them feel bad 


25:57.472 --> 26:01.000
by telling them how I really felt.


26:02.310 --> 26:06.000
The new school 
wasn’t much better 


26:11.853 --> 26:14.000
until I met Cameron. 


26:15.923 --> 26:18.000
He seemed 
like a pretty cool guy. 


26:22.097 --> 26:27.000
Soon, his friends 
became my friends.


26:29.637 --> 26:31.674
. . . something that David 
believed was true, 


26:31.673 --> 26:34.000
he actually proved it 
by the association that he kept.


26:35.410 --> 26:37.445
We think about one 
of the closest friendships 


26:37.445 --> 26:38.980
recorded in the Scriptures, 


26:38.980 --> 26:41.000
and it was 
that of David and Jonathan. 


26:42.517 --> 26:44.719
What was it that David and Jonathan 
shared in common? 


26:44.718 --> 26:47.188
It wasn’t their age.


26:47.188 --> 26:49.390
Akil, 
you were texting in the meeting.


26:49.390 --> 26:51.627
I shouldn’t have sent the text. 


26:51.627 --> 26:53.295
I’m sorry. 


26:53.295 --> 26:56.698
But Cameron is a good person. 


26:56.698 --> 26:59.266
He might even study one day.


26:59.267 --> 27:00.835
I understand that, Akil. 


27:00.835 --> 27:03.805
But we all have to be careful 
with how much time 


27:03.805 --> 27:06.307
we spend with people 
that don’t love Jehovah. 


27:06.307 --> 27:08.777
See, 
their values are just different. 


27:08.777 --> 27:11.647
You know 
what Proverbs 13:20 says: 


27:11.647 --> 27:13.682
‘Walk with those who are wise.’ 


27:13.682 --> 27:16.719
So why don’t you seek out 
friends who love Jehovah? 


27:16.718 --> 27:19.620
And you will make friends 
that last a lifetime.


27:19.620 --> 27:21.122
How am I supposed to do that? 


27:21.122 --> 27:24.659
There’s no one my age 
in the congregation.


27:24.658 --> 27:27.428
Akil, good friends 
can come from unexpected places.


27:27.428 --> 27:30.000
Mom, 
I had good friends


27:31.098 --> 27:34.000
—back home.


27:38.238 --> 27:41.000
We all felt bad that night.


27:49.250 --> 27:51.318
The next day, 


27:51.318 --> 27:54.000
Cameron posted pictures 
of a party he had. 


27:55.523 --> 27:59.000
My parents were right. 


28:00.862 --> 28:04.032
I broke off my association 
with Cameron 


28:04.032 --> 28:05.934
and his friends, 


28:05.933 --> 28:07.901
but I still felt 


28:07.902 --> 28:10.939
lost.


28:10.938 --> 28:12.973
Hi, Akil? 


28:12.973 --> 28:15.376
Do you have 
field service plans for Saturday?


28:15.377 --> 28:17.145
Ah, no.


28:17.145 --> 28:18.380
Good. 
Now you do. 


28:18.380 --> 28:21.000
I’ll see you 
at the 9:30 a.m. meeting, OK?


28:40.502 --> 28:42.970
After service, 


28:42.970 --> 28:45.000
Max had the group 
over for refreshments.


28:47.708 --> 28:50.445
Did you take these?


28:50.445 --> 28:51.545
Do you like them?


28:51.545 --> 28:52.680
Yeah.


28:52.680 --> 28:55.217
My wife, 
she was always the photographer. 


28:55.217 --> 28:57.319
She loved photography. 


28:57.318 --> 28:59.886
And then one anniversary 
she went out and bought me a camera, 


28:59.887 --> 29:03.000
and from that moment on, 
I was hooked too.


29:04.325 --> 29:06.427
Time flies so quickly. 


29:06.427 --> 29:11.032
It’s hard to believe 
she passed away 12 years ago now.


29:11.032 --> 29:12.067
I’m sorry.


29:12.067 --> 29:13.535
It’s OK.


29:13.535 --> 29:15.403
But you still take pictures?


29:15.403 --> 29:18.171
I do. 
I really enjoy photography. 


29:18.172 --> 29:20.209
There’s something about being close 


29:20.208 --> 29:22.710
to Jehovah’s creation. 


29:22.710 --> 29:24.878
It reminds me 


29:24.878 --> 29:28.000
that we’re never really alone, 
you know?


29:33.020 --> 29:37.358
Good friends can come 
from unexpected places 


29:37.358 --> 29:39.860
and unexpected ages. 


29:39.860 --> 29:42.463
As I spent more time with Max, 


29:42.463 --> 29:47.000
I realized it was 
just like David and Jonathan. 


29:48.135 --> 29:50.205
Their friendship was based, 


29:50.205 --> 29:54.000
not on age, 
but on their love for Jehovah. 


29:55.243 --> 29:58.000
And they helped each other.


30:03.552 --> 30:05.187
And with Max’s help, 


30:05.187 --> 30:07.789
I was able to keep 
a good spiritual routine 


30:07.788 --> 30:09.790
without interruption. 


30:09.790 --> 30:12.293
Although we weren’t the same age, 


30:12.293 --> 30:15.296
Max became my good friend. 


30:15.297 --> 30:18.500
I just needed to see 
what was right 


30:18.500 --> 30:21.000
in front of me.


30:23.605 --> 30:28.610
Yes, friends can come in various ages. 


30:28.610 --> 30:31.478
And the best kind of friend 


30:31.478 --> 30:36.000
is one who encourages us
in our service to Jehovah.


30:37.218 --> 30:40.821
We all need to work hard 
on making spiritual progress


30:40.822 --> 30:45.360
—learning new things 
about Jehovah and his qualities. 


30:45.360 --> 30:50.298
So we want friends 
who will help us do that.


30:50.298 --> 30:52.500
There is a saying  


30:52.500 --> 30:55.803
that experience 
is the best teacher, 


30:55.803 --> 30:58.305
but that is not 
really accurate. 


30:58.305 --> 31:03.000
Experience is often 
the hard way to learn. 


31:04.178 --> 31:08.950
Brother Fernando Casillas 
was born in Mexico, 


31:08.950 --> 31:11.152
but when he was a baby, 


31:11.152 --> 31:15.122
his family moved 
to the United States. 


31:15.122 --> 31:18.225
The neighborhood he grew up in 


31:18.225 --> 31:21.328
had a lot of gang influence. 


31:21.328 --> 31:25.165
This had 
a very negative impact on him. 


31:25.165 --> 31:28.468
But despite these circumstances, 


31:28.468 --> 31:33.000
notice how the truth attracted him.


31:36.177 --> 31:39.814
I used to love violence; 
I dreamed of violence. 


31:39.813 --> 31:42.783
My gang was my religion. 


31:42.783 --> 31:45.653
I got into the prison system 
at a young age. 


31:45.653 --> 31:48.421
At first, they sent me 
to a juvenile facility, 


31:48.422 --> 31:50.725
but I got kicked out of there 
for a riot. 


31:50.725 --> 31:55.228
Basically, they deemed me a threat 
to the safety and security 


31:55.228 --> 31:58.398
of the institution, 
the guards, and other inmates. 


31:58.398 --> 32:00.601
And I was sent 
to solitary confinement 


32:00.602 --> 32:02.637
to finish off my prison term.


32:02.637 --> 32:04.939
Me thinking 
I was violent back then 


32:04.938 --> 32:07.000
was nothing compared to 
what I came out with. 


32:08.442 --> 32:10.545
Basically,
what you try to come out to be 


32:10.545 --> 32:13.000
is the best killer out of all.


32:14.248 --> 32:17.018
After my incarceration, 


32:17.018 --> 32:20.000
I was deported to Mexico. 


32:21.555 --> 32:23.825
I used to carry a weapon 
with me everywhere I went.


32:23.825 --> 32:27.562
After a while, we started getting involved 
with bad people.


32:27.562 --> 32:30.699
Eventually, 
my girlfriend got in trouble. 


32:30.698 --> 32:32.933
Once that was over, 


32:32.933 --> 32:34.935
she saw a Kingdom Hall. 


32:34.935 --> 32:36.937
My girlfriend had been 
to meetings as a child, 


32:36.937 --> 32:39.707
so she basically dragged me 
to the Kingdom Hall.


32:39.707 --> 32:41.709
They treated me nice. 


32:41.708 --> 32:44.445
And that’s when I started 
to get to know Omar. 


32:44.445 --> 32:46.947
So I started hanging around 
with him and his wife


32:46.947 --> 32:50.619
—me and my girlfriend at the time—
and going to meetings. 


32:50.618 --> 32:52.620
But it wasn’t till I found out 
this guy 


32:52.620 --> 32:54.755
used to be one of my rivals


32:54.755 --> 32:56.890
—I was very, very upset. 


32:56.890 --> 32:58.760
I felt betrayed because he never told me. 


32:58.760 --> 33:01.595
Everything that was going 
through my head was, 


33:01.595 --> 33:03.597
‘I’ve got to find a way to get him over here, 


33:03.597 --> 33:05.600
so I can hurt him.’ 


33:05.600 --> 33:08.803
After thinking about all the things 
that I wanted to do to him that night


33:08.803 --> 33:11.000
—I’d been running it through my head 
over and over again—


33:12.740 --> 33:16.210
I decided to just stay friends with him. 


33:16.210 --> 33:20.213
And eventually, 
we decided to start studying together.


33:20.213 --> 33:23.283
Being the way I was, 
I thought that there’s 


33:23.283 --> 33:25.686
no way a God can forgive me. 


33:25.687 --> 33:29.090
The scripture at Isaiah 55:7 
really helped me, 


33:29.090 --> 33:30.358
where it says: 


33:30.358 --> 33:34.595
“Let the wicked man leave his way
and the evil man his thoughts; 


33:34.595 --> 33:38.198
let him return to Jehovah, 
who will have mercy on him.” 


33:38.198 --> 33:41.001
As time went by, 
I started understanding clearly 


33:41.002 --> 33:43.637
that Jehovah does forgive.


33:43.637 --> 33:47.375
By that time, I had already 
kind of made a decision


33:47.375 --> 33:49.410
that I was done
with doing time in prison. 


33:49.410 --> 33:51.945
I just decided to cut all ties with everybody 


33:51.945 --> 33:54.782
that had anything to do 
with anything illegal. 


33:54.782 --> 33:56.784
I felt like a free person. 


33:56.783 --> 33:58.618
And after progressing 


33:58.618 --> 34:02.056
and quitting the habits that I had 
of smoking and drinking a lot, 


34:02.057 --> 34:04.959
I became 
an unbaptized publisher. 


34:04.958 --> 34:07.195
But my father passed away; 


34:07.195 --> 34:10.097
I started hanging around 
with bad association again, 


34:10.097 --> 34:12.934
and eventually 
I had my privileges removed.


34:12.933 --> 34:16.336
And as that was happening, 
Satan attacked me again. 


34:16.337 --> 34:19.574
So one day,
my wife was crossing the border 


34:19.573 --> 34:22.210
to go take care of
some paperwork for the kids 


34:22.210 --> 34:24.778
and was surprised
by the border patrol 


34:24.778 --> 34:27.381
telling her that there 
were drugs in the vehicle. 


34:27.382 --> 34:29.450
We did not know 
that the previous owner 


34:29.450 --> 34:31.918
had stashed drugs in the truck. 


34:31.918 --> 34:34.188
Even though later they proved 


34:34.188 --> 34:36.890
that the drugs were not my wife’s
and she was released,  


34:36.890 --> 34:39.000
they still decided to keep my kids.


34:41.062 --> 34:44.632
What I was thinking of doing 
was going back to my old ways


34:44.632 --> 34:47.235
—organizing a plot with my old friends 


34:47.235 --> 34:50.000
to bring my kids
back to Mexico to me. 


34:51.038 --> 34:53.073
But I decided to rely 


34:53.073 --> 34:55.075
on Jehovah instead 
and on the brothers 


34:55.075 --> 34:58.012
coming to visit me 
on a regular basis 


34:58.012 --> 34:59.714
and giving me encouraging thoughts 


34:59.713 --> 35:02.350
of how Jehovah 
will take care of everything. 


35:02.350 --> 35:04.552
Eventually, our kids were returned to us, 


35:04.552 --> 35:06.587
with Jehovah’s help.


35:06.587 --> 35:10.759
After a little struggle, 
of course, I had my privileges back. 


35:10.758 --> 35:13.895
A few months later, I was baptized. 


35:13.895 --> 35:18.598
I’m a lot happier now 
than what I was back then. 


35:18.598 --> 35:21.468
One day as I was preaching
in the rehab centers, 


35:21.468 --> 35:25.171
I ran into a person 
I once knew before, growing up. 


35:25.172 --> 35:28.242
Once he found out who I was, he said: 


35:28.242 --> 35:30.945
“You’re the reason why I left town. 


35:30.945 --> 35:33.982
Every time you would see me, 
you would shoot at me.” 


35:33.982 --> 35:36.184
So after a while, 
I was able to convince him


35:36.183 --> 35:39.220
that actually my purpose there 


35:39.220 --> 35:41.222
was not to hurt him anymore 


35:41.222 --> 35:44.059
but to teach him the truth 


35:44.058 --> 35:46.093
and how to gain everlasting life.


35:46.093 --> 35:49.263
I’m no longer a violent person. 


35:49.263 --> 35:52.300
I enjoy the privileges 
that Jehovah now gives me. 


35:52.300 --> 35:55.102
I have now been serving 
as a ministerial servant 


35:55.102 --> 35:56.704
for the past two years. 


35:56.703 --> 35:58.973
I’m in charge of the accounting 


35:58.973 --> 36:00.975
for the Kingdom Hall, 


36:00.975 --> 36:04.045
instead of stealing money 
as I used to do before. 


36:04.045 --> 36:06.813
What I do for a living 
is I do gardening work. 


36:06.813 --> 36:09.050
Now I don’t carry around knives, 


36:09.050 --> 36:11.318
but I carry around my tools. 


36:11.318 --> 36:13.386
You could say that I did beat 


36:13.387 --> 36:16.724
my pistols into plowshares now


36:16.723 --> 36:19.000
—or weed whacker or lawn mower. 


36:20.327 --> 36:23.230
I’m glad that I’m 
now serving a great God 


36:23.230 --> 36:27.000
who is loving, 
caring, and forgiving.


36:31.538 --> 36:35.141
Fernando and his family
are serving  


36:35.142 --> 36:38.779
in an English congregation in Mexico. 


36:38.778 --> 36:42.316
With everything 
Brother Casillas went through, 


36:42.317 --> 36:44.352
he could see 


36:44.352 --> 36:47.489
that Jehovah is the best teacher. 


36:47.488 --> 36:50.523
If you listen to Jehovah, 


36:50.523 --> 36:53.895
you won’t have to learn 
the hard way. 


36:53.895 --> 36:55.897
Jehovah is 


36:55.897 --> 37:00.000
“the One teaching you 
to benefit yourself.”


37:01.968 --> 37:06.973
Jeremiah 17:13 
conveys the thought 


37:06.973 --> 37:10.376
that those 
who do not serve Jehovah 


37:10.377 --> 37:14.715
will have their names 
“written in the dust.” 


37:14.715 --> 37:18.285
But by building 
your future with Jehovah, 


37:18.285 --> 37:20.922
you young ones are ensuring 


37:20.922 --> 37:25.159
that Jehovah will keep
your individual names


37:25.158 --> 37:28.361
written in his “book of life” 


37:28.362 --> 37:32.132
that is mentioned 
at Philippians 4:3 


37:32.132 --> 37:35.202
and Revelation 3:5.


37:35.202 --> 37:38.239
Earlier in the program, 


37:38.238 --> 37:41.708
we saw some examples 
of how young ones 


37:41.708 --> 37:45.646
are building a future 
with Jehovah. 


37:45.647 --> 37:50.000
But what impact are such efforts 
having on the organization? 


37:51.552 --> 37:53.720
Let’s look at one example: 


37:53.720 --> 37:57.090
the construction 
of the new world headquarters 


37:57.090 --> 38:01.000
at Warwick, New York.


38:02.162 --> 38:06.567
Jehovah’s Witnesses built 
1.6 million square feet (149,000 sq m) 


38:06.567 --> 38:10.672
in less than four years.


38:10.672 --> 38:13.607
Of the 27,035 volunteers, 


38:13.607 --> 38:18.000
3,247 were between the ages of 19 and 25.


38:19.013 --> 38:21.148
I thought this was a project 


38:21.148 --> 38:23.383
that was going to strictly need 


38:23.383 --> 38:27.086
very experienced brothers and sisters. 


38:27.087 --> 38:29.524
Early on, I realized I was wrong. 


38:29.523 --> 38:32.693
It was also going to take youthful energy 


38:32.693 --> 38:35.195
because of the volume of work.


38:35.195 --> 38:37.197
The mix of older and younger ones 


38:37.197 --> 38:39.700
was really a helpful thing 
on the Warwick project. 


38:39.700 --> 38:42.370
The older ones 
brought skill and experience. 


38:42.370 --> 38:46.040
The younger ones 
brought the energy, the muscle, 


38:46.040 --> 38:48.508
and the diligence to stay 
with hard physical tasks 


38:48.508 --> 38:49.676
all the way through the project.


38:49.677 --> 38:54.615
Whether it was in the kitchen
or night watch


38:54.615 --> 38:56.850
or the early 5:00 a.m. start 
with the concrete crew 


38:56.850 --> 38:57.985
at 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12°C), 


38:57.985 --> 39:00.653
their joy and their humility was outstanding 


39:00.653 --> 39:03.023
to accept any work that needed to be done.


39:03.023 --> 39:05.860
And a lot of young ones, 
brothers and sisters, 


39:05.860 --> 39:08.162
moved into the area 
so they could commute.


39:08.162 --> 39:10.630
And they would work 
day after day tirelessly, 


39:10.630 --> 39:14.168
into the evenings even, 
to have the project ready for the next day. 


39:14.168 --> 39:18.271
Their energy was just astonishing.


39:18.272 --> 39:21.809
Jehovah loves young ones, 
and he’s willing to invest in them 


39:21.808 --> 39:26.613
and train them and make them 
a part of his organization. 


39:26.613 --> 39:29.083
And I saw that so much.


39:29.083 --> 39:31.085
We had a lot of young people 
who offered themselves 


39:31.085 --> 39:32.820
with technical skills. 


39:32.820 --> 39:37.525
But if the humility of these 
very technically-skilled young people 


39:37.525 --> 39:40.027
didn’t match 
or exceed their abilities, 


39:40.027 --> 39:42.029
then, really, 
Jehovah couldn’t use them. 


39:42.028 --> 39:46.700
And they were willing to adjust, 
and we really saw the benefit.


39:46.700 --> 39:49.203
We knew and they knew 


39:49.203 --> 39:51.338
that they were building 


39:51.338 --> 39:54.108
not just a project at Warwick


39:54.108 --> 39:57.110
—they were building 
a spiritual project for Jehovah.


39:57.110 --> 40:00.013
You could see Jehovah’s spirit 
operating on them. 


40:00.013 --> 40:04.451
You could see them 
mature so quickly.


40:04.452 --> 40:06.454
These young brothers 
are the next generation 


40:06.453 --> 40:08.555
of elders 
and traveling overseers. 


40:08.555 --> 40:11.558
They’re to be commended 
and highly respected 


40:11.558 --> 40:13.926
for the contribution 
they made as young men.


40:13.927 --> 40:15.930
They all talk about the effect 


40:15.930 --> 40:18.932
that their Bethel service
has had on their outlook


40:18.932 --> 40:21.269
and how they don’t want 
to get caught up 


40:21.268 --> 40:24.905
in this world 
and its daily pursuits.


40:24.905 --> 40:27.642
Use the skills you’ve learned 


40:27.642 --> 40:30.677
here on this project and in Bethel. 


40:30.677 --> 40:33.080
You are needed. 


40:33.080 --> 40:36.183
Continue to keep your spirituality up 


40:36.183 --> 40:40.420
and to keep your association 
at a high level.


40:40.420 --> 40:43.990
The highest quality of life is when, 


40:43.990 --> 40:48.328
as clay, we put ourselves 
in the hands of the Great Potter, Jehovah, 


40:48.328 --> 40:51.331
and we say: 
“Here I am! Send me!”. 


40:51.332 --> 40:55.069
And I’m fully confident 
they will have no regrets 


40:55.068 --> 41:00.000
building their future 
with Jehovah.


41:02.075 --> 41:07.815
Yes, young ones 
truly had a beautiful impact 


41:07.815 --> 41:12.000
on the construction project 
of world headquarters! 


41:13.553 --> 41:17.725
By the way, 
you may find it interesting to know 


41:17.725 --> 41:21.728
that the Warwick 
and Wallkill construction projects 


41:21.728 --> 41:24.331
were not funded
by the donations


41:24.332 --> 41:27.569
that you have made 
to the worldwide work. 


41:27.568 --> 41:31.705
Your donations are being used 
to support the work 


41:31.705 --> 41:34.375
in the worldwide field. 


41:34.375 --> 41:39.347
The massive construction projects 
at Warwick and Wallkill 


41:39.347 --> 41:44.017
were funded by the sale 
of properties in Brooklyn. 


41:44.017 --> 41:48.155
In effect, 
we just traded locations. 


41:48.155 --> 41:51.992
We traded the value 
of the properties in Brooklyn 


41:51.992 --> 41:56.000
for the beautiful facilities 
at Warwick and Wallkill. 


41:57.230 --> 41:59.233
And I must say, 


41:59.233 --> 42:02.301
the Governing Body is truly enjoying 


42:02.302 --> 42:05.605
the new facility at Warwick, 


42:05.605 --> 42:08.308
thanks to the hard work, 


42:08.308 --> 42:12.813
both of the young and the older ones 


42:12.813 --> 42:15.983
who labored in our behalf, 


42:15.983 --> 42:18.000
and we truly appreciate it.


42:20.353 --> 42:23.723
The apostle Paul said of Timothy 


42:23.723 --> 42:29.796
as recorded 
at Philippians 2:20-23: 


42:29.797 --> 42:34.735
“For I have no one else 
of a disposition like his 


42:34.735 --> 42:38.772
“who will genuinely care 
for your concerns. 


42:38.772 --> 42:41.975
“For all the others 
are seeking their own interests, 


42:41.975 --> 42:44.778
“not those of Jesus Christ. 


42:44.778 --> 42:48.015
“But you know the proof 
he gave of himself, 


42:48.015 --> 42:51.018
“that like a child with a father 


42:51.018 --> 42:55.455
“he slaved with me 
to advance the good news. 


42:55.455 --> 43:00.860
Therefore,
he is the one I am hoping to send.”


43:00.860 --> 43:02.863
It is obvious that Paul 


43:02.863 --> 43:06.066
loved the young man Timothy very much 


43:06.067 --> 43:09.270
because of his unselfish hard work 


43:09.270 --> 43:12.338
in behalf of Kingdom interests. 


43:12.338 --> 43:17.310
Well, the Governing Body 
feels exactly the same way 


43:17.310 --> 43:22.315
about you dear young ones 
who are working hard 


43:22.315 --> 43:26.000
in your various theocratic assignments.


43:27.788 --> 43:31.325
In addition to the many avenues 
of full-time service 


43:31.325 --> 43:34.628
we mentioned earlier 
in the program, 


43:34.628 --> 43:39.466
making yourself available 
when a need arises locally 


43:39.467 --> 43:44.339
is a fine way 
to seek the Kingdom first. 


43:44.338 --> 43:49.175
For example, in San Antonio, 
in the state of Texas, 


43:49.175 --> 43:51.878
in the United States, 


43:51.878 --> 43:54.381
a large convention 


43:54.382 --> 43:59.219
with over 20,000 
in attendance was planned. 


43:59.218 --> 44:02.488
However, 
the venue could only provide 


44:02.488 --> 44:06.000
about one third of the chairs needed 
for the convention. 


44:07.260 --> 44:11.198
Where would our brothers 
find the needed chairs? 


44:11.198 --> 44:14.066
Well, Jehovah provided, 


44:14.067 --> 44:19.000
and many young ones 
were eager to help.


44:22.843 --> 44:25.145
When I heard 
that this needed to happen, 


44:25.145 --> 44:27.748
I was thinking, 
‘How are we going to do this?’


44:27.748 --> 44:30.250
I thought, ‘It’s a big job!’


44:30.250 --> 44:32.787
It was amazing!


44:32.787 --> 44:35.055
The first thing I was asked to do 


44:35.055 --> 44:37.623
was try to find a storage place 
that we could use 


44:37.623 --> 44:40.326
for six to eight thousand chairs. 


44:40.327 --> 44:42.964
A sister manages a storage place, 


44:42.963 --> 44:44.731
and we saw Jehovah’s blessing 


44:44.732 --> 44:47.567
because the owner said, 
“You can have this stall 


44:47.567 --> 44:50.770
“at no charge for a year 
as long as you sign a contract 


44:50.770 --> 44:52.773
that it’s 
for Jehovah’s Witnesses’ organization.”


44:52.773 --> 44:55.941
Truckload after truckload 
after truckload came in. 


44:55.942 --> 44:57.644
We had to unload the trucks. 


44:57.643 --> 44:59.580
The brothers had 
to unstack the chairs, 


44:59.580 --> 45:02.282
repair the chairs, clean the chairs, 
put them back on pallets, 


45:02.282 --> 45:04.217
restack them, 


45:04.217 --> 45:06.754
load them onto trucks, 
and that was half of it. 


45:06.753 --> 45:08.755
Those were the ones 
in the warehouse. 


45:08.755 --> 45:11.725
On the other side, 
we got permission to ask 


45:11.725 --> 45:14.027
the San Antonio congregations 
if we could use their chairs 


45:14.027 --> 45:15.762
for the convention. 


45:15.762 --> 45:17.999
We were hoping 
to get three thousand chairs.


45:17.998 --> 45:20.066
And then the numbers 
grew for the audience,


45:20.067 --> 45:22.102
so we had to increase 
our numbers. 


45:22.102 --> 45:24.639
So we were able to gather 
six thousand chairs 


45:24.638 --> 45:29.910
from the willing volunteers 
of congregations around San Antonio.


45:29.910 --> 45:32.780
So we prayed about it and the brothers 
started asking for volunteers, 


45:32.780 --> 45:35.515
and it was a great cooperation 
right at the beginning.


45:35.515 --> 45:37.885
As soon as 
we let the friends know 


45:37.885 --> 45:40.353
that this was going 
to be the case, 


45:40.353 --> 45:41.955
all of them—
all of them said, 


45:41.955 --> 45:43.490
“We’re going to get off 
of work early.”


45:43.490 --> 45:45.925
We immediately wanted 
to clear our schedules 


45:45.925 --> 45:49.930
so that we could be available 
to help in any way that we could.


45:49.930 --> 45:52.098
It was a privilege to know 


45:52.098 --> 45:54.768
that our congregation 
was going to be part of it.


45:54.768 --> 45:58.071
We are so grateful to Jehovah 
that he has given us 


45:58.072 --> 46:00.074
this privilege to do.


46:00.073 --> 46:01.808
We had thousands of chairs 


46:01.808 --> 46:05.478
of every color
—green, red, brown, blue. 


46:05.478 --> 46:08.848
We even had some bright orange ones 
left out of the ‘70’s, 


46:08.848 --> 46:10.650
and we’re putting those in the back. 


46:10.650 --> 46:13.353
But it was not just the colors 
but the sizes. 


46:13.353 --> 46:15.388
They were all different sizes. 


46:15.388 --> 46:17.590
And so how do you make 
sections with straight rows 


46:17.590 --> 46:19.760
when the chairs 
are all different sizes?


46:19.760 --> 46:22.930
But I knew somehow, 
as Jehovah’s people, we’d get it done. 


46:22.930 --> 46:26.300
And we definitely— 
As you see, a lot of volunteers, 


46:26.300 --> 46:27.935
and we’re here getting it done.


46:27.935 --> 46:30.503
And it’s made 
for a beautiful experience 


46:30.503 --> 46:32.906
because the friends have gotten to know 
each other as never before. 


46:32.907 --> 46:34.842
And they’re willingly 
working together, 


46:34.842 --> 46:36.644
and the excitement is there. 


46:36.643 --> 46:40.546
It doesn’t matter whose venue it is, 
it’s all for Jehovah, 


46:40.547 --> 46:42.715
and that’s been 
the attitude everybody has had.


46:42.715 --> 46:45.818
It just tells you 
that Jehovah is a God of order.


46:45.818 --> 46:48.921
It’s good to feel 
that you’re doing your best for Jehovah.


46:48.922 --> 46:53.394
Well, it reminds me of Psalm 127:1,
where it mentions 


46:53.393 --> 46:56.230
that ‘unless Jehovah builds the house, 


46:56.230 --> 46:58.865
it’s in vain that his workers 
even work hard.’ 


46:58.865 --> 47:01.368
So it’s because of Jehovah’s hand 
and his blessing


47:01.368 --> 47:03.370
—that is why everything 
runs so smoothly.


47:03.370 --> 47:04.838
What other organization! 


47:04.838 --> 47:08.000
No one else can do that 
except Jehovah’s people.


47:12.012 --> 47:16.884
It truly is a fine witness 
when our young ones 


47:16.883 --> 47:21.053
wholeheartedly give 
of their time. 


47:21.053 --> 47:24.290
Proverbs 20:29 says: 


47:24.290 --> 47:29.062
“The glory of young men 
is their strength.” 


47:29.062 --> 47:33.634
And commendably, 
you young men and women 


47:33.633 --> 47:36.236
are using your strength 


47:36.237 --> 47:40.674
to make a name 
with Jehovah.


47:40.673 --> 47:45.145
Have you ever considered 
helping out in a foreign-language field? 


47:45.145 --> 47:49.148
Perhaps there is a need 
in your local circuit. 


47:49.148 --> 47:51.351
All over the earth, 


47:51.352 --> 47:55.289
the organization 
provides language courses 


47:55.288 --> 48:00.193
with the goal of reaching 
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people 


48:00.193 --> 48:03.963
with the good news of God’s Word. 


48:03.963 --> 48:07.633
Brother Juan Carlos Chacón 


48:07.633 --> 48:10.803
serves as a special pioneer 


48:10.803 --> 48:14.073
in the rapidly growing Shuar language field


48:14.073 --> 48:16.576
in Ecuador.


48:16.577 --> 48:19.079
He was recently asked to attend


48:19.078 --> 48:21.815
a course at the local branch 


48:21.815 --> 48:24.818
to become a language teacher 


48:24.818 --> 48:27.520
so that he could help 
willing publishers 


48:27.520 --> 48:30.000
learn the language.


48:32.927 --> 48:42.135
[Speaking Shuar]


48:42.135 --> 48:46.038
It has been said before, 


48:46.038 --> 48:49.141
“This is a language of the Devil”


48:49.142 --> 48:52.545
—that it should be forgotten. 


48:52.545 --> 48:55.000
It serves no purpose. 


48:58.352 --> 49:02.522
But to Jehovah, 


49:02.522 --> 49:05.000
no nation is insignificant.


49:09.328 --> 49:11.865
I grew up in an area 
of the Ecuadorian jungle 


49:11.865 --> 49:13.867
where there is 
a large community 


49:13.867 --> 49:16.000
of Shuar people.


49:19.673 --> 49:21.708
Like many native languages, 


49:21.708 --> 49:25.000
Shuar is very complex. 


49:29.415 --> 49:31.918
We need many, many workers in the field. 


49:31.918 --> 49:34.186
But if we don’t give them a foundation, 


49:34.187 --> 49:37.724
if we don’t help them 
or give them a little push, 


49:37.723 --> 49:40.000
it’s difficult for them to enter this field.


49:42.728 --> 49:45.698
I received an invitation to attend 


49:45.698 --> 49:48.000
a seminar for language instructors. 


49:53.040 --> 49:56.543
There were 58 students in the class, 


49:56.543 --> 50:01.000
representing 16 different languages 
or language groups.


50:11.492 --> 50:13.927
We are learning 
fantastic teaching techniques, 


50:13.927 --> 50:16.000
real techniques that work.


50:21.768 --> 50:24.905
The instructor told us how humor helps 
our minds to create a world of connections, 


50:24.905 --> 50:27.000
which stimulates our brain.


50:36.383 --> 50:39.051
Yeah, I’m like a small child 


50:39.052 --> 50:41.087
when it comes to drawing. 


50:41.087 --> 50:43.000
I never learned to draw well. 


50:44.690 --> 50:46.727
We draw a scene, 


50:46.727 --> 50:48.895
and starting with our native language 


50:48.895 --> 50:51.832
along with large gestures, 


50:51.832 --> 50:54.267
we act out a dialogue.


50:54.267 --> 50:56.269
Little by little,


50:56.268 --> 50:59.000
we convert the scene
into the new language.


51:18.925 --> 51:20.927
What scares me? 


51:20.927 --> 51:22.000
That I’ve never done this before. 


51:23.997 --> 51:27.000
This will be my first time. 


51:28.435 --> 51:33.000
I don’t have any experience 
teaching languages.


51:44.217 --> 51:47.154
Although I felt intimidated by this, 


51:47.153 --> 51:52.000
I knew that with Jehovah 
all things are possible.


51:56.530 --> 52:01.000
Welcome to the first day 
of the Shuar language course.


52:17.583 --> 52:21.488
The techniques they offered us 
in the course were like a box of tools 


52:21.488 --> 52:25.091
that we need to study more carefully 
and see how to apply them 


52:25.092 --> 52:28.000
in each circumstance.


52:31.732 --> 52:33.734
When we are in the territory, 


52:33.733 --> 52:37.170
we see how people’s eyes 
light up when they learn 


52:37.170 --> 52:39.172
the name of God. 


52:39.172 --> 52:43.000
Just seeing that there is so much need 
for them to learn the truth, 


52:44.110 --> 52:46.478
that has motivated us to come here 


52:46.478 --> 52:49.000
and continue serving here.


52:55.255 --> 52:57.257
Since God has created us,


52:57.257 --> 52:59.725
we know that he will
never abandon us.


52:59.725 --> 53:01.728
He thinks about us all the time,


53:01.728 --> 53:04.898
and he loves us very much.


53:04.898 --> 53:06.933
I didn’t know that before.


53:06.933 --> 53:08.701
I feel so happy now 


53:08.702 --> 53:12.000
because I can really understand 
the Word of God.


53:14.573 --> 53:18.745
Being in an isolated group
far from other congregations,


53:18.745 --> 53:20.980
my wife and I 
have felt every day 


53:20.980 --> 53:23.717
how real Jehovah is.


53:23.717 --> 53:25.719
Jehovah is now looking 


53:25.718 --> 53:28.988
and giving his attention 
to these small places, 


53:28.988 --> 53:31.523
no matter how small they are. 


53:31.523 --> 53:35.995
If people have a good heart 
and want to serve Jehovah, 


53:35.995 --> 53:39.000
he will send workers
to give the help that is needed.


53:40.567 --> 53:44.972
And in reality, this moves us 
to say to him with all of our heart, 


53:44.972 --> 53:48.000
“Thank you, Jehovah.”


53:55.115 --> 53:59.485
There is a lot to do 
in Jehovah’s organization 


53:59.485 --> 54:02.488
regardless of our age. 


54:02.488 --> 54:06.726
Even if our circumstances 
may restrict us, 


54:06.727 --> 54:11.264
Jehovah sees and values 


54:11.263 --> 54:15.935
all of our efforts 
to expand our ministry 


54:15.935 --> 54:20.000
and to build 
an everlasting future with him. 


54:21.440 --> 54:24.443
Our music video for this month 


54:24.443 --> 54:27.680
is appropriately entitled 


54:27.680 --> 54:32.000
Building My Future With Jehovah.


54:41.460 --> 54:48.835
At times, I wish I could see 
exactly what my future will be


54:48.835 --> 54:56.000
And how my life will turn out 
and which road is the right one for me.


54:58.645 --> 55:05.000
But one thing’s for sure, 
no matter what comes along,


55:06.853 --> 55:14.693
I live for Jehovah, 
to him I belong.


55:14.693 --> 55:20.066
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


55:20.067 --> 55:24.737
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


55:24.737 --> 55:32.512
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


55:32.512 --> 55:37.717
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


55:37.717 --> 55:42.089
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


55:42.088 --> 55:48.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


55:50.963 --> 55:58.871
At times, the chance comes along 
to take a path I know to be wrong,


55:58.872 --> 56:06.000
A path that leads me away 
from the place that I know I belong.


56:08.313 --> 56:15.000
But keeping in mind 
the dedication I made


56:17.157 --> 56:25.132
Can give me the firmness and faith 
that won’t fade.


56:25.132 --> 56:29.902
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


56:29.902 --> 56:34.107
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


56:34.107 --> 56:42.449
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


56:42.448 --> 56:47.586
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


56:47.587 --> 56:51.925
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


56:51.925 --> 56:59.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


57:00.867 --> 57:04.704
I’m building a future 
that never will end


57:04.703 --> 57:09.275
If I build it with help 
from Jehovah, my Friend.


57:09.275 --> 57:13.378
The happiest moments, 
the best life can give,


57:13.378 --> 57:20.000
Come from pleasing Jehovah 
each day that I live.


57:38.337 --> 57:43.009
Of all the people and things 
my life could be filled with,


57:43.008 --> 57:47.646
The best one of all, 
the best one to build with,


57:47.647 --> 57:55.722
Is pleasing Jehovah each day 
with the choices I make.


57:55.722 --> 58:00.594
He gave me all that I have; 
I’ll never forget it.


58:00.593 --> 58:05.331
I’m safe in his hands; 
I’ll never regret it.


58:05.332 --> 58:11.000
I’m building my future with him 
ev’ry step that I take.


58:18.010 --> 58:26.000
I’m building my future 
with him ev’ry step that I take.


58:29.188 --> 58:34.526
An encouraging song indeed! 


58:34.527 --> 58:37.530
We encourage all young ones 


58:37.530 --> 58:40.867
to take the message of this program


58:40.867 --> 58:43.570
—to build a future with Jehovah—


58:43.570 --> 58:45.572
to heart. 


58:45.572 --> 58:49.509
Prayerfully consider what you can do 


58:49.508 --> 58:52.678
to expand your ministry. 


58:52.678 --> 58:57.716
Always safeguard 
your most valuable possession


58:57.717 --> 59:02.422
—your precious relationship 
with Jehovah. 


59:02.422 --> 59:06.859
Never forget 
that there are more with you 


59:06.858 --> 59:09.628
than there are against you. 


59:09.628 --> 59:13.065
It is true that Satan, the demons, 


59:13.065 --> 59:16.068
and this world are against you. 


59:16.068 --> 59:18.838
But your brothers and sisters, 


59:18.838 --> 59:23.408
including the Governing Body, 
are with you; 


59:23.408 --> 59:27.280
the angels are with you; 


59:27.280 --> 59:33.085
the resurrected immortal anointed ones 
are with you; 


59:33.085 --> 59:35.588
Jesus is with you; 


59:35.588 --> 59:40.000
and most important, 
Jehovah is with you. 


59:41.193 --> 59:46.831
You are never alone!


59:46.832 --> 59:48.835
To conclude, 


59:48.835 --> 59:51.170
we have greetings 
to share with you 


59:51.170 --> 59:53.840
from the special convention 
that was held 


59:53.840 --> 59:56.608
in July of last year


59:56.608 --> 59:58.745
in Paris, France.


59:58.745 --> 1:00:01.547
I had the privilege 
of attending this convention 


1:00:01.547 --> 1:00:03.582
with Brother Kenneth Flodin,


1:00:03.582 --> 1:00:05.585
a helper to the Teaching Committee.


1:00:05.585 --> 1:00:09.588
While most of the convention program 
was in French, 


1:00:09.588 --> 1:00:11.890
it was simultaneously interpreted 


1:00:11.890 --> 1:00:15.127
into Croatian, English, 


1:00:15.127 --> 1:00:17.664
and Polish 
for the benefit 


1:00:17.663 --> 1:00:20.065
of the international delegates.


1:00:20.065 --> 1:00:22.068
You will be happy to know 


1:00:22.068 --> 1:00:24.436
that 71 new sisters 


1:00:24.437 --> 1:00:26.905
and 41 new brothers 


1:00:26.905 --> 1:00:31.000
symbolized their dedication 
through water baptism. 


1:00:32.645 --> 1:00:35.982
The oldest baptismal candidate 
was an 80-year-old sister 


1:00:35.982 --> 1:00:38.000
and the youngest 
was a 10-year-old.


1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.387
The young candidates 
had to overcome 


1:00:41.387 --> 1:00:44.390
various challenges in order 
to reach their goal 


1:00:44.390 --> 1:00:46.392
of baptism. 


1:00:46.392 --> 1:00:48.394
Four of them took this step 


1:00:48.393 --> 1:00:50.430
even though their parents 


1:00:50.430 --> 1:00:52.432
are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


1:00:52.432 --> 1:00:54.867
Many of these dear young ones 
had to overcome 


1:00:54.867 --> 1:00:56.869
peer pressure at school


1:00:56.868 --> 1:00:59.438
—pressure to do things 


1:00:59.438 --> 1:01:01.440
Jehovah does not like. 


1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:04.510
Two of the young brothers, 
also fleshly brothers, 


1:01:04.510 --> 1:01:07.613
used to play 
violent video games. 


1:01:07.613 --> 1:01:09.781
Through their personal Bible study 


1:01:09.782 --> 1:01:12.152
and the personal interest 
shown in them, 


1:01:12.152 --> 1:01:16.155
they came to understand 
Jehovah’s viewpoint on violence 


1:01:16.155 --> 1:01:20.860
and made the necessary changes 
to progress spiritually. 


1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:22.862
By taking this first step 


1:01:22.862 --> 1:01:26.199
of getting baptized, 
these brothers and sisters have shown


1:01:26.198 --> 1:01:29.568
that they want to build a future 


1:01:29.568 --> 1:01:31.603
with Jehovah. 


1:01:31.603 --> 1:01:33.171
Let us all do everything 


1:01:33.172 --> 1:01:37.410
we can to continue making 
spiritual progress, 


1:01:37.410 --> 1:01:42.782
which will bring 
Jehovah’s smile of approval. 


1:01:42.782 --> 1:01:48.487
Brothers and sisters, 
we love you very much. 


1:01:48.487 --> 1:01:51.690
This is JW Broadcasting 


1:01:51.690 --> 1:02:03.500
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01 Welcome to JW Broadcasting!
00:04 This month we’ll consider  ways we can get
00:06 the most benefit  from Bible principles.
00:09 Here are some highlights:
00:11 How can Bible study and meditation
00:14 prepare us for trials?
00:17 We’ll learn about the example  of Sister Gertrud Pötzinger
00:20 through an archived interview.
00:22 What principles and Bible accounts  enabled her and her husband, Martin,
00:26 to keep their integrity  in Nazi Germany?
00:30 Jehovah urges us  to seek first the Kingdom.
00:34 What can happen when a person  seeks things in the world
00:36 instead of the Kingdom?
00:39 We’ll listen to how this young sister  learned to trust Jehovah
00:43 and lead a life that brings  true happiness.
00:47 Have you ever thought  that a familiar piece of Bible counsel
00:49 didn’t apply to your situation?
00:52 Well, how can analyzing such counsel  lead to related principles
00:56 that fit your specific challenge?
00:59 We’ll see  in this encouraging dramatization.
01:04 You’re watching  JW Broadcasting for February 2017.
01:29 You and I make a lot of decisions every day.
01:31 Now, some have a little impact on our lives;
01:34 others have a very big impact.
01:37 And we can appreciate that we can make
01:39 choices and decisions for ourselves.
01:42 Think of how life would be  if you made no decisions for yourself
01:46 —someone tells you when to go to bed,
01:48 they pick out your clothes,
01:50 and they tell you what to do for work.
01:52 Well, none of us would like that!
01:54 Jehovah gave each of us free will,
01:58 and that’s the precious gift
02:00 of making choices for ourselves.
02:03 Now, have you ever thought  about why Jehovah gave us this gift?
02:06 I mean,  why trust us with free will
02:09 when he knew that we could make  bad choices or decisions?
02:12 Well, one powerful reason is love.
02:16 The only way to give us the gift of love
02:19 is also to give us the gift of free will.
02:22 The two are tied together.
02:24 You really can’t have  one without the other.
02:27 For example,  if I programmed my computer
02:30 to give me a message  every day at 2:00 p.m.:
02:33 “John, I love you.  I think you’re a wonderful guy,”
02:36 I think there’d be a little something  wrong with me if I thought:
02:39 ‘Aw, isn’t that nice?  My computer, it loves me.’
02:43 Yeah, love only exists
02:46 if it comes truly  from a free-will expression.
02:50 Now, did Jehovah place  any boundaries on free will?
02:54 Yes.
02:56 They were stated in the Law  to the nation of Israel.
02:59 And Jesus later repeated them
03:01 at Matthew 22:37-40:
03:07 “He said to him:
03:09 “‘“You must love Jehovah your God  with your whole heart
03:13 “‘“and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.”
03:16 “‘This is the greatest and first commandment.
03:20 “‘The second, like it, is this:
03:22 “‘“You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
03:25 “‘On these two commandments
03:28 the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.’”
03:31 So our use of free will
03:34 has love of God and love of neighbor
03:37 as its boundaries.
03:39 Notice, for example,
03:41 what people are doing  in this picture,
03:43 both inside the circle boundary  and outside.
03:48 See, free will allows us to do
03:50 any of the things  we see in the picture.
03:52 But love of God  and love of neighbor
03:55 move us to reject  what’s outside the circle
03:58 and choose  to do the kinds of things
04:00 that we see inside the circle.
04:03 Now, to stay  within those boundaries,
04:06 Jehovah gave us  a marvelous brain
04:08 and a built-in conscience,
04:10 but he also knows  we need more help.
04:12 And that’s why  he also gave us Bible principles
04:16 —basic truths from the Bible
04:19 that can help us  to make good decisions.
04:21 And it can safely be said  that any decision we face
04:25 can be guided  by Bible principles.
04:28 Now, our Creator, Jehovah,  knows what’s best for us.
04:32 And he also trusts us  to make decisions
04:35 based on Bible principles
04:38 because he knows  that when we do that,
04:40 then we’re really,  truly going to be happy, content,
04:44 and at peace with him  and with others.
04:47 So in review so far:
04:49 Jehovah gave us free will
04:52 —that’s the privilege  to make choices for ourselves—
04:55 and he also gave us  Bible principles
04:58 as the boundaries  to our choices.
05:02 But making difficult decisions  requires that we train ourselves
05:07 to recognize Bible principles  and apply them.
05:11 Now let’s read Romans 12:1,
05:15 and let’s see how this verse
05:18 describes the decision-making process.
05:22 “Therefore, I appeal to you
05:25 “by the compassions of God, brothers,
05:27 “to present your bodies  as a living sacrifice,
05:31 “holy and acceptable to God,
05:33 a sacred service  with your power of reason.”
05:38 So are we using  our “power of reason”
05:43 to understand Bible principles?
05:46 For example, young children
05:48 ask lots of questions.
05:51 But has a child ever asked you:
05:53 “What happens when I drop a ball?
05:55 a pencil? a book?”
05:57 No, they don’t ask that.
05:59 They know what happens  to anything they drop.
06:02 It falls down!
06:04 See, the child doesn’t need  rules for every object
06:07 but has quickly grasped the principle.
06:10 Anything he drops falls down.
06:14 Now,  what if an 18-year-old asked you,
06:17 “What’s going to happen when I drop this pen?”
06:20 Well, it’s obvious  he’s not been paying attention
06:23 to basic principles of life.
06:26 So by us paying attention  to Bible principles,
06:30 we can very quickly see  the pattern
06:33 of love of God  and love of neighbor
06:37 and know  the right thing to do
06:39 without a long list of rules  for every situation.
06:44 Well, how can we train our “power of reason”?
06:48 We train it by paying attention
06:51 as we read and study the Bible.
06:54 Now, we don’t need rules
06:56 for which movies to watch,  which songs to listen to,
07:00 or what clothes we can wear.
07:02 If we’re paying attention  when we’re reading the Bible,
07:06 we train our conscience  with Bible principles
07:10 so we can make  such decisions
07:12 without needing  a long list of rules.
07:15 You know,  we could compare our training
07:18 of our “power of reason”  to a blind person
07:21 using a guide dog.
07:23 Now, an untrained dog
07:25 would be very helpful  to a blind person.
07:28 It would bark when others  were around, for example.
07:31 However,  a dog trained
07:34 in specific skills  is amazingly helpful.
07:37 The dog knows  when to stop at curbs
07:40 and walk around obstacles
07:42 that the person  might run their head into.
07:44 A guide dog  is also taught a skill called
07:48 “intelligent disobedience.”
07:50 And even if the blind person  encourages the dog forward,
07:54 it won’t obey,
07:56 but it’ll pull  the person back from danger.
07:59 Now, it can take a year or more  of training for the dog to learn
08:02 the amazing skills  that are so helpful to a blind person.
08:07 Likewise, our raw,  untrained “power of reason”
08:11 can help us to a degree.
08:13 However, it can be amazing
08:16 if we take the time to train it.
08:19 Now, here are  three skills that we can use
08:22 to train our “power of reason.”
08:24 They are illustrating,
08:26 analyzing,
08:28 and balancing.
08:31 Now, to consider our first skill,  illustrating,
08:35 let’s use the general topic  of forgiveness.
08:40 What Bible principles  could help with forgiveness?
08:46 Please think of as many principles  and scriptures as you can.
08:50 Now, if it helps,  you can pause the program now
08:53 and write down  the principles that come to mind.
08:58 Now, your list  may include principles like these:
09:02 Matthew 18:22 says
09:04 to forgive “up to 77 times”;
09:08 Proverbs 12:18 says:
09:11 “The tongue of the wise is a healing”;
09:14 and Colossians 3:13 tells us
09:17 to ‘forgive one another freely.’
09:20 Now, the skill  we want to learn is illustrating
09:24 —creating a mental picture  of an idea or principle
09:28 to see its real meaning  and impact.
09:30 Now, even if we  are not skilled artists,
09:33 all of us can and do create  pictures in our minds.
09:37 When illustrating,  pay attention to things that are similar
09:41 or like the thing  you are trying to visualize.
09:45 For example,  if sin is like debt,
09:49 then forgiveness  is like someone canceling the debt.
09:53 If a hurtful remark  is like a cut,
09:57 then forgiveness  is like seeing it heal.
10:01 If sin is like a mark  on a blackboard,
10:05 forgiveness is like erasing it.
10:08 Proverbs 12:18
10:11 is a great example  of using the “like” technique.
10:16 “Thoughtless speech  is like the stabs of a sword,
10:21 but the tongue of the wise  is a healing.”
10:25 Imagine what your skin  would look like
10:27 if you still had  every open cut, bruise,
10:31 or bleeding scratch  since childhood.
10:33 See, Jehovah  wonderfully designed our body
10:36 to heal such minor cuts  and bruises.
10:39 And we can now visualize  how the forgiveness of others
10:43 helps us to heal emotionally.
10:45 Now, learning to illustrate,  or visualize,
10:48 takes time and practice.
10:50 However, it can be one  of the most powerful skills we use
10:53 to train  our “power of reason,”
10:55 and it can also be  quite enjoyable.
10:58 You know,  try at your family worship
11:00 to take  the principles for a topic
11:02 and see  how many similarities,
11:04 or “likes,”  you can come up with.
11:07 Now, granted,  they all won’t be amazing,
11:10 but you may be surprised  by the insights
11:13 that come from seeing  something from a new perspective.
11:17 Well, let’s consider now  our second skill:
11:19 analyzing.
11:21 Now, analyzing something means
11:24 “examining it carefully in detail.”
11:26 And let’s use  the topic of wrong desires.
11:31 Now, in this case,  let’s say that we’ve already found
11:34 the principle  at Colossians 3:5:
11:39 “Deaden, therefore, your body members  that are on the earth
11:43 “as respects sexual immorality,  uncleanness,
11:47 “uncontrolled sexual passion,
11:49 “hurtful desire, and greediness,
11:52 which is idolatry.”
11:54 Now, what can we learn from analyzing Colossians 3:5
11:59 to help when we struggle  with wrong desires?
12:03 Again, feel free  to pause the program
12:05 if you want some time  to think about it.
12:09 Look carefully  at each step outlined.
12:13 Did you notice, for example,  what appears to be
12:16 a reverse order  of the steps leading to sin?
12:20 This verse works its way  from sexual immorality
12:24 back to the very roots  of the problem.
12:27 Now, let’s take each phrase  starting with the last,
12:31 “greediness, which is idolatry.”
12:35 So, sexual immorality  starts with selfishness,
12:38 greedily putting our needs  ahead of anything else.
12:42 Next is “hurtful desire.”
12:45 Greediness leads to “hurtful desire.”
12:48 It’s like a person  hanging around a bakery,
12:52 smelling the bread and cakes  when he can’t pay for it.
12:56 Likewise,  hanging around immoral entertainment
12:59 or bad associates
13:01 can feed “hurtful desire”  for what is not ours.
13:06 Next is listed  “uncontrolled sexual passion.”
13:10 So “hurtful desire”  has now turned from an idea
13:15 into a strong emotion  of passion,
13:18 causing one  to look for an opportunity
13:20 to fulfill the desire.
13:23 Next, “uncleanness.”
13:26 The previous steps have now led  to inappropriate physical conduct
13:30 with another person.
13:33 Finally, “sexual immorality” —serious sin.
13:37 Sexual immorality  has occurred between persons
13:40 that are not married  to one another.
13:43 So analyzing Colossians 3:5
13:47 can really help us to eliminate,  not stimulate, wrong desires.
13:52 And we can see  how important it is
13:54 to get rid  of wrong desires immediately.
13:57 It’s easier  to walk away from sin
13:59 when we’re still in the early stages,  rather than later.
14:03 So we need  to practice the skill
14:05 of not simply  just reading scriptures
14:08 but analyzing them
14:10 until we’ve learned  all that we can.
14:12 And we can use  the many research tools we have
14:15 to find valuable comments  and application.
14:18 Now, let’s consider our third
14:20 and final skill: balancing.
14:24 And to do that,
14:26 let’s use a question  on the topic of alcohol.
14:29 What Bible principles  could help a couple to decide
14:33 whether to serve alcohol  at their wedding?
14:37 What principles and scriptures  do you think would help them
14:41 make a balanced decision?
14:44 Again, you’re welcome  to pause the program
14:46 if you’d like to write down  what comes to mind
14:48 or to research something.
14:51 Now, your list probably has  some of these principles.
14:55 At John 2:9,  Jesus made wine for a wedding.
15:00 However,
1 Corinthians 6:10 says
15:04 that ‘drunkards  will not inherit the Kingdom.’
15:07 And 1 Corinthians 10:31, 32 says:
15:11 “Whether you are eating or drinking . . . ,
15:14 do all things for God’s glory”
15:16 and to “keep from becoming  causes for stumbling.”
15:20 Now,  it doesn’t seem
15:22 that any one principle  provides the answer.
15:26 The couple could simply say:
15:28 “Well, Jesus served wine at a wedding,  so we can too.”
15:32 However, there’s really more  to it than that, isn’t there?
15:35 It’s clear that a balance
15:37 of all these Bible principles  is needed.
15:40 Will relatives  or others be there
15:43 who might be prone  to overdrinking?
15:45 Would serving alcohol bother  the conscience of many present
15:49 because of local customs  and feelings about alcohol?
15:53 It’s often the case  when making decisions
15:56 that we need to balance  several Bible principles,
16:00 not taking any one principle solely  on its own merit.
16:05 Jehovah expects us  to use our “power of reason”
16:09 to balance Bible principles  and make good decisions.
16:13 Ecclesiastes 7:16-18
16:18 gives us good advice  about being balanced.
16:21 “Do not be overly righteous,
16:24 “nor show yourself excessively wise.
16:27 “Why should you bring ruin to yourself?
16:30 “Do not be excessively wicked,  nor be foolish.
16:33 “Why should you die before your time?
16:35 “It is best to grasp one warning
16:38 “without letting go of the other;
16:40 for the one who fears God  will heed them both.”
16:44 How true.
16:46 Such balance between extremes  is often necessary
16:49 when we apply  Bible principles.
16:51 We need to heed them both,  so to speak.
16:54 We need to balance  all the Bible principles
16:58 so we can come  to the decision
17:00 that would show love of God  and love of neighbor.
17:03 We could illustrate the balance  between different Bible principles
17:08 and applying them with this model bike.
17:11 It was a gift from a brother in Malawi.
17:13 Now, a bicycle has  three basic principles of operation:
17:17 the brakes, the pedals, and the steering.
17:20 Now, the brakes are really like principles
17:24 that slow us down
17:26 or stop us from doing the wrong thing.
17:28 And the pedals are really like the principles
17:30 that move us forward
17:32 in showing love for Jehovah  and our brothers and sisters.
17:35 And the steering is like our free will
17:38 to choose a direction in life
17:41 that pleases Jehovah.
17:43 So making decisions  is like riding a bicycle.
17:46 We have to balance  several Bible principles.
17:51 So in review,
17:53 Jehovah gave us free will
17:55 to use within the boundaries  of love of God and love of neighbor
17:59 and many other fine Bible principles.
18:02 Making difficult decisions requires  that we train our “power of reason”
18:06 to recognize Bible principles  and apply them.
18:09 And we discussed  how to train
18:11 our power of reason  with the three skills:
18:13 illustrating,
18:14 analyzing,
18:16 and balancing.
18:18 So no matter what decisions  you are faced with,
18:20 we encourage you:
18:22 “Let Bible principles guide you.”
18:27 Let’s use  the following dramatization
18:29 to practice the skills  we’ve just discussed.
18:32 In this video,
18:34 three Witnesses all hear  the same familiar Bible counsel
18:37 at a Christian meeting.
18:39 And at first,  it doesn’t seem to apply
18:41 to anything  they’re currently experiencing,
18:43 but it does.
18:45 Maybe that’s happened to you.
18:47 As you listen to their reasoning,
18:50 what do you think they  could do to let Bible principles
18:54 guide them  to making a good decision?
19:00 We must know Jehovah well.
19:03 That means knowing  his thinking on matters.
19:05 We should welcome  such an examination
19:09 and make any necessary changes.
19:12 For example,
19:14 let’s read
1 Corinthians 15:33 together.
19:20 Here we read:
19:22 “Do not be misled.
19:24 Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
19:28 As familiar as that principle is,
19:31 can you think of an area in your life
19:33 where it’s difficult to apply?
19:38 Hey, John.
19:39 Hey.
19:40 I know it’s not your usual,
19:41 but there’s no one to entertain  those clients tonight.
19:43 So can you do it?  Thanks.
19:44 But I have. . .
19:44 Great.
19:49 Until then,  it wasn’t my usual thing.
20:03 But I need to support my family.
20:13 And these aren’t really my friends.
20:17 I can handle it.
20:19 I think.
20:21 . . .we’re faced with bad associations
20:23 in subtle ways.
20:25 This may require us  to ask additional questions
20:28 of ourselves.
20:30 Are we letting in bad association
20:33 through social media?
20:35 Perhaps we can think  of another way bad association. . .
20:38 I don’t think so
20:43 —except for some friends  from my old congregation.
20:47 Wow!
20:49 They’re not doing so well spiritually.
20:52 But if I stay connected  and see what they’re doing,
20:56 maybe I can help them.
20:59 . . .can affect us.
21:00 Maybe it’s something very specific.
21:03 Or maybe
21:05 bad association  is coming from a place
21:08 we never expected.
21:15 I only join games  with Witness friends I know.
21:19 But sometimes
21:21 they connect  with people I don’t know
21:26 who pick games  I’m not sure we should play.
21:33 But maybe my friends know them,
21:38 so they’re probably OK.
21:41 It is vital that we avoid  bad associations.
21:44 Now,  as we resume in Psalm 26. . .
21:49 The basic principle in this story is one we all know:
21:52 “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”
21:55 But do our three friends  find themselves in the same situation,
21:59 where they can simply apply
1 Corinthians 15:33
22:04 in exactly the same way?
22:06 No.
22:08 The family head is concerned  about supporting his family.
22:11 Our sister wants  to stay in touch with her friends
22:13 in hopes of helping them spiritually.
22:16 And our young brother  didn’t know exactly who
22:19 his associates were.
22:21 Are you already thinking of  additional principles
22:24 that would apply  to each person’s problem?
22:27 How would you illustrate, analyze,  or balance those principles
22:31 if you were in their position?
22:34 If you want to,  pause the program here.
22:36 Take the time to write down  what you’re thinking.
22:40 Then watch how they each  search for Bible principles
22:43 and train their “power of reason.”
22:48 I thought that talk  didn’t apply to me.
22:51 But can I really handle  bad association?
22:55 If I take a stand,  I may lose my job.
23:01 But that’s being anxious  about tomorrow.
23:09 Jesus said:
23:10 “So never be anxious and say,
23:13 “‘What are we to eat?’ or,
23:14 “‘What are we to drink?’ or,
23:16 ‘What are we to wear?’”
23:18 Jehovah knows I need a job.
23:22 And I need  to set a good example
23:25 for when my children  face bad association.
23:34 1 Corinthians 15:33.
23:38 My friends’ posts  are getting worse
23:41 —their pictures and comments.
23:44 Hmm, 2 Timothy 2:16.
23:50 “But reject empty speeches
23:53 “that violate what is holy,
23:55 for they will lead  to more and more ungodliness.”
24:00 I’m letting them share  “empty speeches” with me online.
24:06 I will try to help  them while I still can,
24:09 but following their posts  is not the way to do it.
24:15 I told Mom what’s been happening  when I game
24:18 with my friends.
24:20 She gave me good ideas  on what to look for
24:23 in the Research Guide.
24:26 “Christian Life.”
24:28 “Association.”
24:32 “Is Your Recreation Beneficial?”
24:37 “Who Are My Companions?”
24:39 It says,
24:40 “Who are the ones I want  to share my leisure time with?”
24:45 “Does he have the same Bible-based  values and morals that I have?”
24:50 Good question.
24:52 I don’t even know  who they are sometimes.
24:56 Psalm 119:63 says:
24:59 “I am a friend of all who fear you
25:02 and of those who keep your orders.”
25:06 But if I only know them online,
25:09 I can’t know if they fear Jehovah.
25:15 Let’s turn in our Bibles  to the book
25:17 of 1 Timothy 1:5
25:21 and notice how it reads:
25:25 “Really, the objective of this instruction
25:28 “is love out of a clean heart
25:30 “and out of a good conscience
25:33 and out of faith without hypocrisy.”
25:37 We train our conscience
25:40 with Bible principles  that reveal Jehovah’s thinking.
25:45 There may be several principles needed
25:47 for our unique problem.
25:49 But when we find
25:51 and apply them,
25:53 we’ll enjoy a clean heart  and a good conscience.
26:03 How did their Bible principles  and meditation
26:06 compare to what  you were thinking?
26:08 Now, you may not have come up  with the same scriptures and thoughts,
26:12 but that’s OK.
26:14 The important thing is that by training  our “power of reason,”
26:18 we’re aligning our thoughts  with Jehovah’s thoughts.
26:22 Did you see the three skills in use?
26:25 The young brother was able
26:27 to visualize his potential friends.
26:29 He couldn’t see them literally,
26:31 but knowing they didn’t fear Jehovah  or keep His orders
26:35 painted a picture of the kind of associates  they might prove to be.
26:39 When our sister  analyzed 2 Timothy 2:16,
26:44 she saw the social media comments
26:47 were similar to “empty speeches”
26:49 that could weaken her faith.
26:51 And the family head balanced
26:54 his family responsibilities
26:57 by applying the principle  at Matthew 6:31,
27:01 where Jesus said  not to be anxious over material things.
27:05 And we can imagine him trying  to work the matter out with his boss
27:09 while trusting Jehovah  to care for him and his family,
27:12 no matter what  might happen to his job.
27:15 Think now about another principle  in Matthew chapter 6.
27:19 Jesus tells us in verse 33  to ‘seek first the Kingdom.’
27:24 Young ones especially  face temptations
27:28 —both large and small—
27:30 to seek things  in the world instead.
27:32 And sadly, some have ignored  Bible principles they have learned.
27:37 They’ve looked  for happiness in what appears
27:39 to be the exciting possibilities  of this system of things.
27:43 In this “Truth Transforms Lives” segment,
27:46 Sister Anneliese Zelina explains  what led her to a similar choice
27:50 and what drew her back to Jehovah.
27:58 Growing up in the truth,
28:00 I felt like I fit in
28:02 more with my friends at school
28:04 or people who weren’t Witnesses.
28:06 I was living a double life  and I knew it.
28:09 I was not baptized.
28:12 I had always tried to make  the truth fit in with the world.
28:15 And this time I decided  that I just want to give
28:18 the world a shot  and see what that’s like.
28:20 I came right to my parents,  and I said,
28:22 “I want to move to LA  and pursue modeling.”
28:25 I had my first job within the week.
28:28 It looked so glamorous.
28:40 There were a lot of parties
28:42 —going to the coolest houses,  getting to hang out with celebrities.
28:48 There are no rules.
28:50 You have the money  to do whatever you want.
28:55 That lifestyle was so far  from what I was raised knowing as right
28:59 that I basically had  no relationship with Jehovah.
29:03 Once all the smoke  and mirrors are gone,
29:06 you see these things  for what they are.
29:08 I remember I called my mom,
29:10 and I told her:  “It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah.
29:12 I’m literally in the middle of it all.”
29:14 And I thought, like, this is it;
29:16 this is what everyone says is the best,  and I’m not happy.
29:18 And I just felt so dull —empty.
29:21 And I actually thought to myself:
29:23 ‘I wish— I wish I was never raised a Witness.
29:26 I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.’
29:29 There were certain nights  where I needed him.
29:32 I was thinking,  ‘Just pray; just go to him.’
29:35 And I couldn’t.
29:37 I thought I would never be able to come back to Jehovah.
29:45 One of the jobs  I got hired to do
29:47 was to work  for this young fashion company.
29:49 In between different outfits and shoots,  you would, you know,
29:53 talk with the photographer.
29:57 So, what are you guys  going to be for Halloween?
29:59 Matt doesn’t celebrate Halloween.
30:01 He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
30:03 So am I.
30:04 It’s not a joke.
30:06 No, I’m not kidding.
30:08 I was raised as a Witness.
30:10 Yeah, I was raised as one as well.
30:11 Do you, um— do you go to meetings?
30:13 No, I haven’t been in forever.
30:15 What about you?
30:16 No, no, I haven’t.
30:19 I got a last-minute job to New York.
30:21 I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge.
30:23 I knew Bethel was there,  and I’d never been to Bethel.
30:27 This sister stopped me on my tour,  and she invited me up to her office.
30:32 There were different paintings  of the resurrection.
30:35 She asked me, “Do you know why  the people are waiting on the balcony?”
30:38 And I was like,  “I—I don’t know. Why?”
30:41 And she said, “Because they’re waiting  for their loved ones to be resurrected.”
30:48 It was as if something  just went straight to my heart.
30:51 I’ve never felt something like that.
30:54 I had for the first time actually seen  the resurrection and believed it.
30:58 It wasn’t just this thing that might happen —it was for sure.
31:01 I knew exactly  what it was going to look like.
31:03 I would be standing there  on that balcony
31:05 looking for my loved ones  to come back,
31:10 and I wanted to be there.
31:12 The resurrection was so real to me.
31:17 And the second I got out of Bethel,
31:19 I—I called my mom,  and I told her, and I said:
31:23 “Mom, Mom, I’m coming back.
31:27 “I know exactly what I need to do.
31:30 I’m coming back to Jehovah.”
31:34 I had made up my mind, you know,  I’m going to give Jehovah a chance.
31:38 But, you know,  I’m coming back to the truth.
31:40 I’m going to do it right.
31:42 There was an elder  who was doing the Watchtower,
31:45 and he just came off so kind
31:47 that I thought, you know,  when this meeting ends,
31:50 I want to talk with him, and I’m going  to explain to him why I’m here.
31:53 I knew I had so many changes to make.
31:55 Matthew 6:33 is so important to me,
31:58 ‘Seek first the Kingdom.’
32:01 My entire life I sought  everything else before Jehovah.
32:05 I never put him first,  and I for the first time was saying,
32:09 “OK, Jehovah, I’m going to put you first.”
32:12 The job I have right now  isn’t necessarily my dream job,
32:16 but it allows me to do exactly  what I want to do for Jehovah
32:19 —and that’s pioneer.
32:21 I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard
32:24 going from casting to casting  with my portfolio in hand,
32:26 and now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard  with the cart in my hand.
32:30 Out in the ministry,  I see models that I used to work with,
32:33 and I love getting to show  them that this is my new life,
32:35 and this has changed my life.
32:37 I am so happy.
32:39 I know what it’s like  to superficially feel good.
32:41 But to literally have the joy,  the happiness
32:46 —I want to share that with everybody.
32:52 Jehovah completely changed my life.
33:09 We’re so happy  that Sister Zelina returned
33:12 and dedicated  her life to Jehovah.
33:14 Even though she wanted to forget  what she knew about God,
33:19 the things she had learned about him  kept coming back to her mind.
33:22 Finally, when she saw  the picture of the resurrection,
33:25 while touring Bethel,
33:27 it was a powerful reminder  of Jehovah’s love.
33:30 Really,  Sister Zelina’s Bible-trained conscience
33:34 was at work the entire time.
33:36 Young ones, please know  that Jehovah does not want
33:41 to hold you back  from having fun,
33:43 and he doesn’t want  you to feel guilty
33:45 for the desire to use  your talents and to enjoy life.
33:49 But he does want to protect you  from spiritual dangers,
33:54 and he asks you to seek first  the Kingdom in these last days.
33:58 Proverbs 10:22 puts it well:
34:03 “It is the blessing of Jehovah  that makes one rich,
34:07 and He adds no pain with it.”
34:11 It is Satan’s system that adds  any pain we may experience.
34:15 Sister Zelina and so many others  have found that scripture to be true.
34:20 So often, young ones who choose  to give Jehovah their best
34:24 are blessed with ways to use  their talents and interests
34:28 in sacred service.
34:30 Jehovah wants you to be part
34:32 of the exciting fulfillment  of Micah 4:2,
34:35 where nations are saying:
34:37 “Come, let us go up  to the mountain of Jehovah.”
34:41 Well, that verse was the daily text
34:44 and part of a morning worship discussion
34:46 by Brother Geoffrey Jackson.
34:49 Micah’s prophecy is being fulfilled now,
34:52 and it results  in our worldwide brotherhood
34:55 and highlights the need  for Christian unity and neutrality.
35:00 So Brother Jackson asked  an interesting question,
35:03 “How important is our neutrality?”
35:07 It’s true, isn’t it?
35:09 When we look at this prophecy  in the book of Micah,
35:12 it’s very exciting  because it portrays to us
35:15 what’s actually happening  among God’s people today.
35:19 We know that although  in the new world
35:23 there will be a tremendous unity  displayed by God’s people,
35:26 chapter 4 of Micah
35:28 is actually portraying  what’s happening now,
35:31 and we’re involved with this.
35:33 We know that because  in verse 5 it says
35:35 that at the same time  that this unity would be evident:
35:38 “All the peoples will walk,  each in the name of its god.”
35:42 Well, that’s not talking  about the new world, is it?
35:45 It’s talking about the time  we are living in now.
35:48 Well, what is it that helps all  of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide
35:53 to be so united and not to be involved  with the wars of this world?
35:58 Well, one of the things that helps us  is our Christian neutrality.
36:02 What do we mean by neutrality?
36:05 We mean not taking sides  in political issues.
36:10 Of course, we take sides  with Jehovah and the Kingdom,
36:13 but with regard to worldly political debates  and issues that arise,
36:18 we don’t take sides.
36:20 Why is this so important?
36:23 Well, let’s turn our Bibles  to Revelation chapter 13.
36:28 Revelation 13:16, 17,
36:32 and here it tells us:
36:35 “It puts under compulsion all people —the small and the great,
36:39 “the rich and the poor,  the free and the slaves
36:42 “—that these should be marked  on their right hand or on their forehead,
36:46 “and that nobody can buy or sell  except a person having the mark,
36:51 the name of the wild beast  or the number of its name.”
36:57 What’s the point of this verse?
37:00 Well, of course,  we will look forward to seeing
37:03 how this may  turn out in the future
37:06 and what pressure is put  on God’s people at that time.
37:09 But even now,  we see the principle here
37:11 that the political system is wanting  to put its mark on us,
37:16 mentally as well as physically.
37:19 So we see the forehead  as well as the hand being involved.
37:23 So we need to be absolutely certain  that we remain neutral
37:28 with regard to political issues  in the world,
37:31 not only by  not being involved actively
37:36 in the political issues
37:38 but also mentally not allowing  ourselves to take sides.
37:42 What are some of the things  that perhaps could erode our neutrality?
37:46 Well, maybe we could mention  three things this morning.
37:50 One is the propaganda  that the world puts forward.
37:55 Now, we have seen what the media says  about Jehovah’s Witnesses, haven’t we?
37:59 How distorted some of their reports are
38:03 and how they can paint  a negative picture with regard to us.
38:07 Well, should we expect  that they are neutral
38:10 with regard to other events  that they report on,
38:13 particularly when there are conflicts  between two nations?
38:17 The media  in one particular nation may promote
38:20 certain ideas about the other nation.
38:23 We may be affected by that.
38:25 We may be surprised perhaps
38:27 to visit some other countries  that have a different political ideology
38:32 and be surprised to see  how things perhaps are a little different
38:35 in that country to how it’s portrayed  by the media in our country.
38:40 So we need to be careful  not to be influenced
38:42 by the propaganda of this world,
38:45 particularly media reports and so on.
38:48 What’s another thing perhaps  that could cause us
38:51 to lose a measure of neutrality?
38:53 Sporting events.
38:55 Sometimes sporting events  are able to achieve
38:59 certain goals  with regard to nationalism.
39:02 We see the national anthem  being played at many of these events.
39:06 It reminds me many years ago  when I was in a different country,
39:10 a friend of mine asked me  to record a certain sporting event.
39:14 I wasn’t particularly  interested in the event,
39:16 but because he made this request,  I recorded it.
39:19 And, of course, I wanted to make sure  that I got the last ten minutes of it.
39:23 I thought our friendship  may be strained
39:25 if I didn’t get  the actual last part of the game.
39:29 When I watched it,  it was absolutely exciting
39:33 —nail-biting finish.
39:35 Well, after the brother  gave me back the videotape,
39:38 I thought maybe  some of the other brothers
39:41 who would be interested  in this sporting event
39:43 may want to have it  rather than just wipe the tape.
39:46 So I offered it to several,  and each one of them said to me:
39:50 “No thanks.
39:51 If we had won,  perhaps it would be different.”
39:54 Now, what was the problem?
39:56 As I said to them,
39:57 “Were you watching the game  or were you taking sides?”
40:01 An interesting concept,
40:03 because here  two different nations were involved.
40:06 So we have to be careful  that even sporting events
40:10 don’t stir up within us  certain nationalistic feelings,
40:14 and perhaps we could take sides  with regard to certain events.
40:20 The third area that perhaps  could erode our neutrality:
40:24 the political promises being made,  particularly at election time.
40:29 Perhaps one of the candidates  is from our ethnic background
40:34 or perhaps  is the same gender as we are.
40:39 When we look at the political situation  these days with many elections,
40:43 it seems to be more in the form  of entertainment than anything else,
40:46 with music  and very colorful characters.
40:50 But if we were  to say in our heart,
40:53 ‘I hope that idiot  doesn’t get into power,’
40:57 are we neutral?
40:59 Or worse still, if we say,
41:01 ‘I hope the other person  gets into power,’
41:04 well, we need  to be careful, don’t we?
41:06 I remember many years ago  as a young pioneer in Australia,
41:10 I was facing  the conscription issue
41:13 —the national call-up  for the military.
41:16 At that time,  the Vietnam War was being fought.
41:19 And then there was  an election in Australia.
41:22 And at that time, the party  that was trying to get into power
41:25 said that if they got into power,  they would abolish conscription.
41:30 So now that affected me personally.
41:32 I remember how hard it was sitting there  watching the election results,
41:37 not to say in my heart,  ‘I hope they get in.’
41:40 And then, when they got in,  not to say, ‘Yes!’
41:46 You see, if we personally are affected  by some of these political promises,
41:50 we may violate our neutrality.
41:53 So brothers and sisters,  let’s work hard at remembering
41:57 that we’re no part of this world.
41:59 We support the best government  that could ever rule this earth.
42:04 And by doing so,  we will keep our neutrality,
42:07 and we will keep our unity.
42:10 When neutrality is mentioned,
42:12 isn’t it true we often think of taking  a stand during times of war?
42:16 But Brother Jackson  reminded us that neutrality
42:19 is something we do every day  in our thoughts and in our speech.
42:24 What a good example  of analyzing a Bible principle
42:28 to understand its full meaning  and application for us.
42:32 Of course,  there are times when governments
42:35 do pressure God’s people  to renounce their faith or take up arms.
42:39 This happened  to Sister Gertrud Pötzinger
42:42 and her husband, Martin,
42:44 in Nazi Germany  during World War II.
42:46 Now, later in life, Brother Pötzinger  was a member of the Governing Body,
42:50 and he finished  his earthly course in 1988;
42:53 but Sister Pötzinger continued  faithful until her death in 2003.
42:58 In an archived interview,
43:00 Sister Pötzinger described  her wartime experiences.
43:04 How did Gertrud and Martin,
43:06 like thousands  of our spiritual brothers and sisters,
43:09 keep their integrity  through brutal persecution?
43:16 I worked underground  and traveled in Silesia,
43:20 and at that time,
43:23 I visited the families  with copies of The Watchtower.
43:27 They caught me and arrested me
43:30 in Dresden.
43:32 And there, there was the same strong interrogation,
43:36 and Jehovah helped me  in a wonderful way.
43:39 I was surprised by myself
43:44 —what kind of thoughts  came in my mind
43:46 when they asked me,
43:48 “Did you know
43:50 “that the organization  of the Watchtower
43:53 is forbidden  by the government?”
43:56 I was saying,  “Sure, I know that.”
43:58 “Why were you  working underground
44:01 against our command?”
44:05 Then I was saying:
44:07 “The German judgment,
44:10 “they acknowledge the command:
44:14 “‘You have not to steal,  not to lie, not to murder.’
44:17 “And this came from the Mosaic Law;  it’s from the Bible.
44:21 “If you acknowledge  this command,
44:24 “then you have to acknowledge  the other command too.
44:28 “The Bible is saying:  ‘You have to watch
44:30 “to come together   and to encourage one another.’
44:33 “How can I do it  if I would be ashamed to meet them?
44:39 “I want to do the will of God.
44:41 This is a commandment.”
44:44 The judge was saying nothing.
44:46 He spoke with the side judge,  but he gave no answer.
44:50 I was sentenced  at first for five years.
44:55 And later on,
44:57 they made it go down  to three and a half years
44:59 because I was so young;
45:01 I was 25 years of age.
45:04 So I started  my solitary confinement.
45:09 But Jehovah’s spirit
45:12 made me real joyful.
45:16 Every day  I was thinking:
45:19 ‘Now I have  to make every day
45:22 ‘a special object  to think about.
45:26 ‘In fact,  I want to think
45:28 about the qualities  of Jehovah.
45:31 I’ll start with wisdom.’
45:34 And so I put  my fingers in my ears
45:37 and was running  to and fro and to and fro.
45:40 I wanted  to hear nothing outside.
45:43 So, wonderful thoughts  and I was happy.
45:49 Then when that was over,
45:51 then I thought:  ‘What is hope?
45:54 What is faith?’
45:56 I started to think  about the fruits of the spirit.
46:00 You have a lot.
46:02 Then I have  so much to think,
46:06 and the time runs.
46:08 After three and a half years,
46:12 the Gestapo  called me again
46:14 and gave me  a declaration.
46:16 I have to sign
46:18 that I never want  to be in connection
46:20 with the Jehovah’s Witnesses
46:22 and that I refuse
46:24 to learn more  from the Bible.
46:27 And I said:  “No! Never!”
46:29 Then he said,  “You can think for overnight.”
46:34 “No!  I want not to think overnight.”
46:36 And immediately I said:  “Never will I do it!
46:40 Never will I sign it!”
46:42 And then he was saying:
46:45 “Then you have  to take the consequences.
46:47 “You will transfer  to the concentration camp
46:50 —to Ravensbruck.”
46:53 And when I came,
46:55 they ordered that I have  to put all my dress out
46:58 and to get them away.
47:00 And then I have to stay  with other prisoners
47:04 several hours  in a big bedroom.
47:09 And we have to wait  till the doctor will see us.
47:15 And it was  so humiliating.
47:19 They wanted to humiliate,
47:21 and they wanted  to make us down.
47:24 And the old women  between the young girls,
47:28 they were  so strongly ashamed.
47:30 You saw it —how they suffered.
47:43 I never will forget this.
47:45 And after,
47:47 we got the new dress  from the camp
47:51 and we were assigned to go  to the punishment barrack.
47:56 And then  that was a terrible night.
47:59 So many prisoners,
48:01 they were crying the night
48:04 and others were vomiting
48:08 —had to vomit.
48:11 It was a terrible night.
48:14 The next day,  we had to go for working.
48:18 We had so strong to work
48:20 from morning —in summertime,
48:22 from 5 o’clock  we were on the roll call place
48:25 till evening, 7 o’clock.
48:29 Then the quarantine came.
48:31 We have to not go out.
48:33 They closed the door.
48:34 They gave us our meals  through the window,
48:39 and we had  a fine time to have rest.
48:43 We encouraged one another  with spiritual interests.
48:47 And the doctor came  and knocked on the window.
48:50 “Who died in your barrack?”
48:52 “Nobody.”
48:54 No one.
48:56 Our old, weak sisters  they overcame all.
48:59 Never some became sick.
49:03 So it was really a good witness
49:06 for the others in the camp.
49:11 My husband was  in the concentration camp,
49:13 at first in Dachau  and later on in Mauthausen.
49:17 They worked  in the stone quarry.
49:20 And in that group,
49:22 a brother  had the bad shoes;
49:25 they were too tight for him,  and he took them off.
49:29 And he had forgotten
49:31 to take them from the stone quarry  to the camp.
49:35 And my husband  wanted to help him,
49:38 and he was running  to pick up the shoes.
49:41 And the watchman  observed that he
49:45 ran away from the lawn,  from the group.
49:48 His punishment was to hang  for one hour on the pole.
49:54 When I asked my husband,
49:57 “How did you overcome  such a torture?”
50:00 Then he said:  “I was thinking:
50:04 “‘How was the situation
50:07 “‘when Abraham  had to kill his son?
50:10 “And this was a long way.’
50:12 “I was always thinking:
50:14 “‘What were his thoughts?
50:16 “‘How had he  overcome his feeling
50:20 and what Jehovah  wants for him?’”
50:23 And in this way,  he didn’t feel anymore.
50:28 After one hour,  when he came down,
50:31 the other brothers  were saying,
50:33 “You don’t look as you have been  on the torture stake.”
50:38 So Jehovah can help us
50:42 in all such situations.
50:44 Every situation we had some
50:47 of what was not so easy.
50:50 But in every situation,
50:53 we have a touch of wonderful help —Jehovah’s spirit.
50:57 And we could pray.
50:59 Jehovah’s name  is the most important part in our life.
51:04 Nothing is so important  like Jehovah’s name.
51:11 Did you see the ways Jehovah blessed  Sister Pötzinger’s determination
51:15 to stay loyal under pressure?
51:18 At Matthew 10:19,  Jesus told his apostles:
51:22 “When they hand you over,  do not become anxious
51:25 “about how or what  you are to speak,
51:28 for what you are to speak  will be given you in that hour.”
51:32 She may have felt that same assurance
51:34 when arrested and interrogated.
51:36 Then, when tested in the camps,
51:38 she and Martin meditated  on Christian qualities
51:41 and the faith of Bible characters.
51:43 And finally they,
51:45 like so many Witnesses,
51:47 were helped to survive  because of the love and care
51:50 of their spiritual brothers and sisters.
51:53 Sister Pötzinger used her experience
51:55 to encourage others  in her later assignments.
51:57 For example, in the interview
51:59 with William and Sandra Malenfant,
52:01 Sister Malenfant remembered working  with Sister Pötzinger
52:04 in the Bethel Sewing Department,
52:06 and Sister Pötzinger had given her  a memorable sewing illustration.
52:10 She likened each prayer  to adding another thread
52:15 to a strong cord  that unites us with Jehovah.
52:18 You might enjoy  watching that interview again
52:21 in the “Interviews and Experiences” section,
52:24 under “Blessings of Sacred Service.”
52:27 Later this month,  you’ll also want to watch
52:30 a new original song  under the “Music” section.
52:34 In the April 2016 program,
52:37 a group of young ones explained
52:38 why they visited Bethel  and what they enjoyed seeing.
52:41 While there, they also sang  a song about their experience,
52:45 with the help of Bethelites,  at the branches they visited.
52:51 And we have a music video  to enjoy in this month’s program.
52:55 It’s called  Stop, Think, and Pray.
52:59 No matter what the problem is,
53:02 we should always take time  to think about Bible principles
53:05 and pray for Jehovah’s holy spirit.
53:19 Life’s not easy when trouble’s around And the whole situation is getting you down.
53:29 So-called friends, they just want a reaction. Turn to Jehovah and pray—
53:41 Silently pray.
53:47 Don’t give up; don’t give in. Put your trust in Jehovah.
53:57 Keep it calm; we can win If we stop, think, and pray.
54:07 When there seems no way out, He’ll be there, always by our side.
54:17 He will be our guide, never doubt; No, just stop, think, and pray.
54:27 Make Jehovah smile. Let him show the way.
54:46 Ev’ry day will have troubles to share.
54:51 There are bills to be paid  with no money to spare.
54:56 Even so, we’ll be happy in giving If we can make someone smile—
55:07 Make someone smile.
55:14 Never doubt; never fear. Put your trust in Jehovah.
55:23 And our road will be clear If we stop, think, and pray.
55:34 When we’re weak, we are strong. And we’ll see he was by our side.
55:44 He has been our guide all along. Always stop, think, and pray.
55:54 Make Jehovah smile. Let him show the way.
56:05 Put your trust in Jehovah. And our road will be clear
56:15 If we stop, think, and pray. When we’re weak, we are strong.
56:25 And we’ll see he was by our side. He has been our guide all along.
56:35 Always stop, think, and pray. Make Jehovah smile.
56:45 Thank him ev’ry day.
56:52 Jehovah will always bless us
56:54 when we go to him  in prayer with our concerns.
56:56 Whatever the situation,
56:58 he can give us  “the power beyond what is normal.”
57:01 And as we learned  and practiced in this program,
57:04 we do our part by training  our “power of reason”
57:08 with the principles  from his written Word.
57:11 Finally,  we have greetings
57:13 from the Vesterålen islands,  in Norway.
57:16 These islands are home to 30,000 people
57:19 who enjoy the beautiful fjords, mountains,
57:22 and calm beaches.
57:24 The 53 publishers  in the Sortland Norwegian Congregation
57:28 preach in a territory that covers
1,800 square kilometers,
57:33 or 695 square miles.
57:38 Their thorough witnessing takes them  into the beautiful countryside,
57:42 as well as to the city of Sortland
57:44 for metropolitan public witnessing.
57:47 Each year, they organize trips  to unassigned territory,
57:50 where they often meet people
57:52 who show deep respect for the Bible.
57:56 One Saturday each month,  after the ministry,
57:57 they gather to watch  the JW Broadcasting program
58:01 and enjoy spending time together.
58:03 Progressive Bible studies  and a Russian group
58:06 join them each week  at their meetings.
58:08 We send our love  and greetings
58:11 and thank them  for their Christian love
58:13 and example of faith.
58:17 Thank you for watching.
58:19 From the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
58:22 this is JW Broadcasting!

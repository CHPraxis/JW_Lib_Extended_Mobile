00:01 As Jehovah’s Witnesses,  we truly love the Bible.
00:06 Why?
00:08 Because we know it is God’s Word.
00:11 That’s why we love reading it,  we love studying it,
00:15 and we love learning about its history.
00:18 When we pause  for a moment and reflect on
00:21 the many efforts that have been made  through the centuries
00:24 to hinder and even stop  the distribution of the Bible,
00:29 it becomes obvious  that its Author, Jehovah,
00:33 has been personally involved  in preserving
00:37 and making known  his precious Word.
00:40 This is very much  in harmony with the thought
00:43 in Isaiah 40:8:
00:46 “The green grass dries up,
00:49 “the blossom withers,
00:52 but the word of our God endures forever.”
00:57 With that in mind,
00:59 I’m happy to speak  with you this month
01:01 on a theme  that’s very close to my heart:
01:05 “The Word of Our God Endures Forever.”
01:09 The more we come to appreciate  the value of God’s Word,
01:13 the more we’ll be moved to read it
01:16 and, even more important,  to apply it in our lives.
01:21 Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift  when he inspired
01:26 faithful men  to record his precious Word.
01:30 It’s through the pages of God’s Word
01:33 that we learn  just how much God loves us.
01:37 Thus, his Word contains  guidance on how to live.
01:41 It outlines his purpose  in creating us.
01:45 It gives us his precious promises  for life everlasting
01:49 in peace and happiness.
01:51 No wonder the apostle Paul  was inspired to write
01:55 at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17:
02:01 “All Scripture is inspired of God
02:05 “and beneficial for teaching,  for reproving,
02:08 “for setting things straight,  for disciplining in righteousness,
02:13 “so that the man of God  may be fully competent,
02:17 completely equipped for every good work.”
02:23 Of course, Satan the Devil  does not want people to have access
02:27 to these precious truths  from our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
02:31 It’s no surprise  that there have been many obstacles
02:35 to making the Bible available.
02:37 While Satan may not have been  directly behind all of these,
02:41 he certainly  has made use of them.
02:45 What are some  of these obstacles,
02:47 and how have they been overcome?
02:50 Let’s consider the first obstacle:
02:53 language barriers.
02:55 The first 39 books of the Bible,
02:58 which are often called the Old Testament,
03:01 were written primarily  in the Hebrew language.
03:05 These books were known
03:07 by Hebrew-speaking servants of Jehovah.
03:10 However, as time went on,
03:13 particularly after  the destruction of Babylon,
03:16 many Jews established communities  in other nations of the earth.
03:21 Many of these Jews spoke Greek.
03:23 They no longer used Hebrew.
03:26 That meant that many Jews  no longer had access
03:30 to the Scriptures in a language  they could understand.
03:34 Consider what had happened.
03:36 As Alexander the Great conquered
03:38 more and more  of the then-known world,
03:41 Greek gradually became
03:43 the common language  of commerce and government
03:46 throughout his empire.
03:48 If the Bible  was to be understood
03:51 by the Jews and by Jewish proselytes
03:54 who were scattered throughout  this vast Greek-speaking territory,
03:58 it needed to be translated into Greek.
04:02 Beginning in about the year 250 B.C.E.,
04:06 the Hebrew Scriptures began  to be translated into Greek.
04:11 In time, that Greek translation  came to be known
04:15 as the Septuagint.
04:17 It was widely and frequently used  by the Christians
04:21 in the first century who spoke Greek.
04:23 In fact, the writers  of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
04:28 which is often called  the New Testament,
04:30 frequently quoted directly  from that translation.
04:35 So that obstacle had been overcome.
04:38 But there were many more  language obstacles ahead.
04:42 As the Roman Empire  began to flourish,
04:46 Latin replaced Greek  as a common language.
04:49 Now it was necessary  to translate the Bible into Latin.
04:54 Some Latin translations  of the Bible books began to appear.
04:59 But it was in the year 405 C.E.  that Jerome completed
05:04 the definitive Latin translation  of the Bible.
05:08 It came to be known
05:10 as the Latin Vulgate.
05:12 Jerome’s translation  would become
05:15 the standard Bible  used by Christendom
05:18 for the next nearly 1,000 years.
05:23 However, Latin soon became  the language of the learned and the elite,
05:28 so the common people  could no longer understand
05:32 the Bible’s message.
05:34 During that long period,  there were sincere men
05:39 that translated portions of the Bible  into some additional languages,
05:43 but these translations were,  of course, all made by hand.
05:49 Such handwritten copies of the Bible  were rare and expensive.
05:54 Therefore,  access to the Bible in vernacular,
05:57 or common languages,   was very limited.
06:01 But language was not  the only obstacle
06:04 that threatened to prevent  the distribution of God’s Word.
06:07 Consider a second factor:
06:10 direct opposition  to Bible translation and distribution
06:15 from religious leaders.
06:17 That opposition  started to increase in 1229
06:22 when the local church  Council of Toulouse decreed:
06:27 “We prohibit also  that the laity should be permitted
06:31 to have the books  of the Old or the New Testament.”
06:36 In 1234,  the Council of Tarragona decreed:
06:41 “No one should possess the books  of the Old or the New Testament
06:46 “in the vernacular [language],
06:48 “and if anyone possesses them,
06:50 “let him deliver them, within eight days
06:54 “from the promulgation of this decree,
06:56 to the local bishop,  so that they may be burned.”
07:01 Thus, during  a very long period in history,
07:06 there was limited access to the Bible
07:08 in the languages  spoken by common people.
07:12 But did that mean  that the Word of God
07:15 would not continue to endure?
07:17 Neither language barriers
07:20 nor opposition from religious leaders
07:22 could stop God’s Word  from being made known.
07:26 Even in those dark times,
07:29 there were individuals  who loved God’s Word
07:32 and who worked hard  to translate it
07:35 and to make it available to others.
07:38 Consider John Wycliffe
07:40 and his followers  who were called the Lollards.
07:43 John Wycliffe and his associates
07:46 completed the translation  of the Bible
07:48 into English  about the year 1382.
07:52 They eagerly  hand copied the translation
07:55 and then traveled  from village to village
07:58 reading the Bible  to the common people.
08:01 Despite tremendous opposition  from the church,
08:05 Wycliffe and his followers  made the Bible available
08:09 to many honesthearted people  in the English language.
08:13 After Wycliffe died in 1384,
08:18 great opposition  came to his followers.
08:21 Many had land  and property confiscated.
08:24 Others were burned  at the stake.
08:29 In response to the work  of Wycliffe and the Lollards,
08:32 in 1408,
08:34 Thomas Arundel,  Archbishop of Canterbury, declared:
08:41 “We therefore decree and ordain
08:44 “that no man shall, hereafter,  by his own authority,
08:49 “translate any text of the Scripture
08:52 “into English,  or any other tongue,
08:55 . . . upon pain  of greater excommunication.”
09:00 Did such opposition  wipe out efforts
09:03 to translate and make  the Bible available?
09:06 Absolutely not!
09:09 The work of Wycliffe  and his associates
09:12 stimulated interest in the Bible  throughout England
09:15 and even as far as central Europe.
09:19 Religious leaders were not able  to silence the Word of God.
09:24 In fact, within just a few decades  after Wycliffe’s death,
09:28 two factors  led to a tremendous increase
09:32 in the availability  of the Bible.
09:35 The first,  about the year 1454,
09:39 was the development  of printing with movable type.
09:43 This invention would  in time allow for the printing
09:47 of large quantities  of Bibles in many languages.
09:52 The second factor was  the compiling and printing
09:57 of the Hebrew and Greek  original language text
10:01 of the Holy Scriptures.
10:03 This allowed many translators
10:05 to have access  to the original language texts
10:09 so that they then could produce
10:11 high-quality translations  in their own languages.
10:15 What was the result?
10:17 In the 1500’s across Europe,
10:21 fresh translations  were made and printed
10:24 in vernacular,  or common languages,
10:27 including German, English, Italian, French,
10:31 Dutch, Czech, Danish, Swedish,
10:35 Spanish, Slovenian, and many others.
10:39 However, opposition continued.
10:43 Bible translators were frequently hounded  by the Inquisition,
10:47 and some translators like  William Tyndale and John Rogers
10:52 were even put to death  for their work.
10:55 Nonetheless, the Word of God  continued to endure
11:00 and be made available  to more and more language groups.
11:04 By the early 1800’s,
11:07 Bible translation  began to speed up.
11:10 Bible societies  and intrepid translators
11:14 began to work  in many parts of the earth
11:17 so that the Bible began  to appear in languages
11:20 of Asia, Africa,  the Pacific islands,
11:24 as well as in indigenous languages  of the Americas.
11:28 From 1800 to 1899,
11:32 some portions of the Bible  were translated
11:35 into some 400 languages,
11:38 and from 1900 to 1950,
11:40 more than 500 languages  were added.
11:45 Consider what has been accomplished  with the New World Translation.
11:50 As of this month,  the New World Translation
11:53 has been produced  in whole or in part
11:56 in 149 languages,
12:00 with an additional
37 languages approved.
12:04 It’s obvious  that neither language barriers
12:08 nor opposition  from religious leaders
12:11 was able to stop  the distribution of God’s Word.
12:14 Jehovah has protected it  through the ages.
12:19 It’s just as Psalm 12:6, 7 says:
12:24 “The sayings of Jehovah are pure;
12:28 “they are like silver refined  in an earthen furnace,
12:32 “purified seven times.
12:35 “You will guard them, O Jehovah;
12:38 “you will protect each one of them
12:40 from this generation forever.”
12:45 Yes, Jehovah  has protected each one
12:49 of his precious sayings  down through the ages.
12:52 But consider a third obstacle.
12:56 Although the Bible is now available  in whole or in part
13:00 in almost 3,000 languages,
13:03 many people are no longer interested  in reading it.
13:07 In our modern age,  people have become
13:10 increasingly skeptical and irreligious.
13:13 Scientists have extolled  the theory of evolution
13:16 and have made it appear intelligent
13:19 to doubt the existence of God.
13:21 At the same time,
13:23 secular philosophy has encouraged people
13:26 to make life decisions  according to what feels right to them.
13:30 What is the result?
13:32 A world where people  are often guided
13:35 by their own selfish, fleshly desires.
13:39 Instead of leading to happiness,
13:42 many people are left  feeling empty and dissatisfied.
13:46 How is this third obstacle overcome?
13:50 Around the world,
13:52 people are opening  God’s Word, the Bible,
13:56 and reading it  for themselves.
13:58 They’re recognizing  that its thoughts
14:01 are not simply human wisdom.
14:03 As they apply  its principles in their lives,
14:07 they find  contentment and joy.
14:10 They develop  self-respect and dignity
14:14 from living according to  the upright moral standards
14:17 outlined by our Creator.
14:19 As Psalm 119:97-100 states:
14:26 “How I do love your law!
14:28 “I ponder over it all day long.
14:32 “Your commandment  makes me wiser than my enemies,
14:36 “because it is with me forever.
14:39 “I have more insight  than all my teachers,
14:42 “because I ponder over your reminders.
14:45 “I act with more understanding  than older men,
14:49 because I observe your orders.”
14:54 What a powerful proof
14:56 that the Word of God endures forever.
15:00 While the advice of human philosophers  is frequently flawed,
15:04 the Bible’s counsel works.
15:07 If we apply it,
15:09 it can help us either  to overcome or to cope
15:13 with any problem  or situation that we may face.
15:17 What is more,
15:19 by explaining  God’s purpose for the future,
15:23 it gives us a solid hope
15:25 this earth will be restored  to the Paradise
15:29 that it was  when it was first created.
15:31 It will be filled  with peace and righteousness.
15:36 What a wonderful gift
15:38 Jehovah gave us through the Bible!
15:41 Yes, languages barriers,  opposition from religious leaders,
15:46 and even  an increasingly irreligious world
15:49 cannot stop God’s Word.
15:52 How can you be part  of the evidence
15:55 that the Word of God  endures forever?
15:58 Read it every day,  study it,
16:02 meditate on the deep thoughts  that it contains,
16:06 and then apply  those priceless teachings in your life.
16:11 In this way,  not just on the printed page,
16:16 not just on the library shelf,
16:19 but in our minds,  in our own hearts,
16:22 in our own lives
16:25 the Word of God  will truly endure forever.

00:01 The theme for our program is
00:03 “The Women Proclaiming the Good News.”
00:06 Sadly, throughout human history
00:09 women have been subjected  to injustice, violence, and abuse.
00:14 Why is that?
00:16 The Bible explains.
00:19 In the latter part of Genesis 3:16,
00:24 notice what God says:
00:28 “Your longing will be for your husband,
00:30 and he will dominate you.”
00:35 When God said  that Adam would “dominate” his wife,
00:39 God was not indicating His approval  of the subjugation of woman by man.
00:44 He was simply foretelling  the sad consequences
00:47 of sin on the first couple.
00:50 So abuse of women  is a direct outcome
00:54 of the sinful nature of humans,  not of God’s will.
00:59 Right down to our day,
01:01 rarely have women been accorded
01:03 the dignity that God  wants them to receive.
01:07 However, Jehovah makes clear  in his Word, the Bible,
01:12 that women and men  have equal standing before him.
01:15 In fact, he indicated  that women would play a vital role
01:20 in the outworking of his purpose.
01:23 Our theme is based on Psalm 68:11.
01:29 Let’s read it:
01:31 “Jehovah gives the command;
01:34 the women proclaiming  the good news are a large army.”
01:39 Those words were inspired by God.
01:41 But what did the psalmist  have in mind when he penned them?
01:46 The context of Psalm 68
01:48 shows that David was praising  Jehovah as a God of saving acts.
01:54 From the time of their Exodus from Egypt,
01:57 the men of Israel often had to fight  against enemy nations.
02:01 With Jehovah’s help,  they defeated them.
02:05 And the entire nation would then rejoice
02:07 over the victory Jehovah had given them.
02:10 The first of the victory celebrations  recorded in the Bible
02:15 was at the time  that Jehovah gave his people
02:17 the victory over Pharaoh  and the Egyptians who were pursuing them.
02:22 Exodus 15:20, 21
02:27 tells what happened  after this miraculous victory:
02:32 “Then Miriam the prophetess,  Aaron’s sister,
02:36 “took a tambourine in her hand,
02:38 “and all the women followed her  with tambourines and with dances.
02:43 “Miriam sang in response to the men:
02:46 “‘Sing to Jehovah,
02:48 “‘for he has become highly exalted.
02:52 The horse and its rider  he has hurled into the sea.’”
02:56 Picture that scene.
02:59 There were  an estimated three million people
03:02 in the nation of Israel.
03:04 Imagine —out of that large number,
03:07 “all the women” were dancing  and singing praises to Jehovah.
03:11 That was undoubtedly a large army!
03:15 What a great shout of praise  to Jehovah that was!
03:21 Another example was  when King Saul and his general David
03:24 returned from victory over the Philistines.
03:27 Let’s read the account
03:29 at 1 Samuel 18:6.
03:36 “When David and the others would return
03:38 “from striking down the Philistines,
03:40 “the women would come out
03:42 “from all the cities of Israel
03:43 “with song and dances to meet King Saul
03:46 “with tambourines,
03:48 with rejoicing, and with lutes.”
03:51 Notice that the account says
03:54 that the women came out of “all the cities”
03:57 to greet them with music, song, and dance.
04:01 Occasions such as these
04:03 were not simply expressions of rejoicing
04:07 that originated with human emotion.
04:10 Recall that under inspiration, David said:
04:13 “Jehovah gives the command;
04:16 the women proclaiming  the good news are a large army.”
04:19 Yes, and Jehovah valued  their expressions of praise,
04:22 just as he valued the contributions  of the men who had engaged in battle.
04:27 What about today?
04:30 The report for the 2017 service year
04:35 shows that there were  over 8.3 million publishers
04:38 proclaiming the good news  throughout the earth.
04:42 Keep in mind that in most lands,
04:45 it is not unusual for our dear sisters
04:47 to make up over half  of our special pioneers
04:51 and nearly three quarters of those  who serve in the regular pioneer work.
04:56 In addition, many other sisters
04:59 are wholeheartedly spreading  the good news of the Kingdom
05:02 to the best of their ability  within their circumstances.
05:06 There are many single-parent families  where our sisters
05:10 are providing materially  and spiritually for their children.
05:15 Many of our faithful single sisters
05:17 are expending themselves  in Jehovah’s service
05:20 in theocratic construction  and maintenance work,
05:23 Bethel service,  and serving where the need is greater
05:27 —which includes  serving in foreign-language fields.
05:31 Faithful wives  loyally support their husbands
05:35 as well as fulfill their own roles  as preachers and teachers.
05:39 Yes, how Jehovah must be pleased
05:42 to see all of you  who serve in various ways!
05:46 And we’re grateful
05:48 for the warm spirit and positive influence
05:51 our dear sisters have on our congregations.
05:55 Clearly,
05:57 Jehovah values  this “large army” of sisters.
06:02 But does he take note  of the individual circumstances
06:05 and sacrifices of each sister?
06:09 We do not have to wonder.
06:11 By means of his Word,
06:13 Jehovah makes it evident that he sees
06:16 and appreciates each of his servants.
06:19 For example,
06:21 did you notice when we read  the scripture in Exodus chapter 15
06:26 that Miriam was described  as a “prophetess”?
06:31 Evidently,  she was privileged to be used
06:33 as an instrument  of divine communication.
06:36 In some instances,
06:38 this no doubt included singing songs  that were inspired by Jehovah.
06:43 Miriam was not the only one  in the Scriptures with this designation.
06:48 Other women in the Bible record,
06:50 such as Anna and Isaiah’s wife,
06:53 were also spoken of as prophetesses.
06:57 In the book of Judges,
07:00 another faithful servant,  Deborah, is identified.
07:05 Let’s read Judges 4:4, 5:
07:12 “Now Deborah, a prophetess,
07:14 “the wife of Lappidoth,
07:16 “was judging Israel at that time.
07:19 “She used to sit under Deborah’s palm tree
07:21 “between Ramah and Bethel
07:23 “in the mountainous region of Ephraim;
07:26 the Israelites  would go up to her for judgment.”
07:28 Evidently,
07:31 Deborah was assigned to settle  disputes that arose among Israelites
07:34 by giving Jehovah’s answer  to problems that came up.
07:39 Much later in Israel’s history,
07:42 during the reign of faithful King Josiah,
07:45 Huldah served as a prophetess.
07:48 At 2 Kings 22:8,
07:53 we read that while the temple  was being repaired,
07:57 the original book of the Law was found.
08:00 When it was read to Josiah,
08:02 he was distraught at seeing how far off
08:05 the nation had strayed from Jehovah’s Law.
08:09 In verse 13,
08:11 he directed the priest, the secretary,
08:14 and other influential men:
08:17 “Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf,
08:22 “in behalf of the people,
08:24 “and in behalf of all Judah  concerning the words of this book
08:28 that has been found.”
08:31 How did they accomplish this?
08:33 Verse 14 continues:
08:36 “So Hilkiah the priest,
08:38 “Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah
08:43 went to Huldah the prophetess.”
08:47 It’s interesting that Jehovah  used this faithful woman
08:50 to convey his direction
08:52 and that prominent men and priests
08:54 sought her divinely inspired advice.
08:58 The Christian Greek Scriptures, however,
09:01 do not permit sisters  to serve in such a capacity
09:04 as did Deborah  and other prophetesses
09:06 in the nation of Israel.
09:08 However,
09:10 Titus 2:3, 4
09:15 encourages “older women”  to display spiritual qualities,
09:20 “so that they may advise  the younger women”
09:22 in spiritual matters.
09:24 Let’s read those verses:
09:28 “Likewise, let the older women  be reverent in behavior,
09:32 “not slanderous,  not enslaved to a lot of wine,
09:36 “teachers of what is good,
09:38 “so that they may advise  the younger women
09:41 to love their husbands, to love their children.”
09:45 How we appreciate  the spiritually mature sisters among us
09:49 who provide  such fine assistance to younger sisters
09:53 or those who are newer in the truth!
09:56 However, today Jehovah  has delegated authority to men.
10:01 They Scripturally qualify  to serve as elders and ministerial servants
10:06 in order to serve, guide,  and protect his people.
10:10 It is obvious that this is not due  to a lack of respect
10:14 for the gifts of our sisters  in the congregation.
10:17 In fact,  many responsible brothers will acknowledge
10:20 that they have benefited  from the experience
10:23 and practical wisdom  of our humble, spiritually mature sisters.
10:29 Finally,
10:31 think of the outstanding faith
10:33 of another woman  mentioned in the Bible, Mary.
10:38 What an awesome responsibility  Jehovah entrusted her with
10:43 —bearing and raising  his own Son as a human!
10:48 We can only imagine the thoughts  that were going through her mind
10:52 when she was told of this assignment.
10:55 But the account in Luke chapter 1
11:00 tells us much about her spirituality.
11:04 In verse 38,
11:07 after the angel Gabriel  finished speaking with her,
11:12 Mary’s response was simply:
11:16 “Look! Jehovah’s slave girl!
11:19 May it happen to me  according to your declaration.”
11:23 She must have wondered  how Jehovah would accomplish these things,
11:28 but she was humble and obedient.
11:31 Faithful men such as Moses  and Jeremiah hesitated
11:35 when given  a challenging assignment from God.
11:37 Not Mary!
11:39 What a beautiful example  she set for all of us
11:41 —men and women!
11:44 Clearly,  Jehovah has always highly valued women.
11:49 And we are privileged to serve today
11:52 with millions of hardworking sisters.
11:55 How pleased Jehovah must be
11:58 to see dear sisters  serving him humbly and faithfully!
12:03 We urge you sisters,
12:05 please keep up your good work
12:08 and continue to be  a positive influence in the congregation.
12:12 God has indeed granted  you faithful women
12:15 the privilege of participating  in the fulfillment of the psalmist’s words:
12:19 “Jehovah gives the command;
12:22 the women proclaiming  the good news are a large army.”

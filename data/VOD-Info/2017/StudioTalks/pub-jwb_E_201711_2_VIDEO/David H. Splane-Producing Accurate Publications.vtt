00:01.383 --> 00:04.320
This month I’d like to talk about the efforts 


00:04.320 --> 00:06.322
Jehovah’s organization is making 


00:06.322 --> 00:09.725
to produce literature, publications, 


00:09.725 --> 00:13.897
articles that are as accurate as possible. 


00:13.897 --> 00:18.902
We’re going to talk about accuracy
—accuracy of statement. 


00:18.902 --> 00:24.540
Now, first, what’s the responsibility 
of the writer of the article? 


00:24.540 --> 00:27.577
When a writer submits 
an article for publication, 


00:27.577 --> 00:32.249
he is expected to supply references 
from reputable sources 


00:32.248 --> 00:35.016
to back up the facts 
that he’s included in his article. 


00:35.017 --> 00:37.787
And our Research Department 
will use those references 


00:37.787 --> 00:40.724
to check the accuracy of everything.


00:40.723 --> 00:44.126
Reliable, respected sources. 


00:44.127 --> 00:47.564
What do we mean by a reliable source? 


00:47.563 --> 00:50.866
Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias, 


00:50.867 --> 00:55.872
books, magazines, and then newspapers


00:55.872 --> 00:58.007
—basically in that order. 


00:58.007 --> 01:01.277
We prefer encyclopedias over books, 


01:01.277 --> 01:03.880
books over magazines, 


01:03.880 --> 01:05.915
and magazines over newspapers


01:05.915 --> 01:09.485
—generally because newspaper editors 
have a hard time checking their facts. 


01:09.485 --> 01:13.423
They have a very limited time 
in which to check their facts. 


01:13.423 --> 01:17.226
Even encyclopedias and books get updated, 


01:17.227 --> 01:20.630
so we have to go 
with the latest edition of those. 


01:20.630 --> 01:24.633
We have to make sure 
that our sources are reliable.


01:24.633 --> 01:27.703
Now, when a writer quotes an expert, 


01:27.703 --> 01:31.306
our researchers will ask: 
“Who’s this expert? 


01:31.307 --> 01:33.309
“What’s his reputation? 


01:33.308 --> 01:36.511
“Is he working for a particular organization? 


01:36.512 --> 01:39.749
“Does this organization have an agenda? 


01:39.748 --> 01:41.951
Is it a special-interest group?” 


01:41.952 --> 01:46.022
If we find that the goals 
of the organization are questionable, 


01:46.022 --> 01:51.594
we won’t use the quote
—even if it’s a really good quote.


01:51.593 --> 01:55.698
Now, suppose that a writer 
wants to quote something from a book. 


01:55.698 --> 01:57.733
In the reference material, 


01:57.733 --> 02:00.936
he’ll supply a photocopy 
of the quote in the book, 


02:00.937 --> 02:04.940
but very often he’ll give us 
two or three pages before the quote 


02:04.940 --> 02:07.843
and two or three pages after as well. 


02:07.843 --> 02:11.046
And that way, 
our researchers can examine the quote 


02:11.047 --> 02:15.152
in context to make sure 
that what we’re saying in print 


02:15.152 --> 02:18.855
is really what the author 
of the quote had in mind.


02:18.855 --> 02:22.158
For example, 
an evolutionist might make a statement 


02:22.158 --> 02:24.160
which on the surface 


02:24.160 --> 02:27.830
appears to confirm his support of creation. 


02:27.830 --> 02:30.098
Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement 


02:30.098 --> 02:33.603
that seems to indicate 
that he believes in God. 


02:33.603 --> 02:36.005
But when you examine 
the quote in context, 


02:36.005 --> 02:39.975
you realize that that isn’t what 
the author had in mind at all. 


02:39.975 --> 02:44.247
We would never 
deliberately distort a quotation. 


02:44.247 --> 02:49.000
We try very hard to use all 
of our quotations in context.


02:50.052 --> 02:53.724
Now, it’s important to keep up 
with the very latest research. 


02:53.723 --> 02:58.360
Something that was stated years ago 
as a fact may have been disproved. 


02:58.360 --> 03:00.397
And the reason why is obvious. 


03:00.397 --> 03:02.565
Someone may spend his entire life 


03:02.565 --> 03:06.402
researching a very limited point in history


03:06.402 --> 03:08.404
—a very small point in history—


03:08.403 --> 03:10.606
and, of course, 
if he spends so much time researching, 


03:10.607 --> 03:12.609
he’s going to uncover things. 


03:12.608 --> 03:15.110
And so it’s not surprising 
that from time to time 


03:15.110 --> 03:19.248
we have to adjust our view 
of some historical points. 


03:19.248 --> 03:21.750
We have to check, check, check. 


03:21.750 --> 03:26.022
And later on in this discussion, 
we’re going to consider some examples of it. 


03:26.022 --> 03:28.725
It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!


03:28.725 --> 03:32.995
Now, someone might ask, 
‘Why is it necessary to be so picky, 


03:32.995 --> 03:36.732
to be so fussy, about accuracy?’ 


03:36.732 --> 03:39.969
And in answer, 
I’d like to give an experience 


03:39.968 --> 03:42.138
that I heard about a few years ago. 


03:42.138 --> 03:44.306
In Northern Europe, 
there was a man 


03:44.307 --> 03:47.377
who accepted a Bible study 
from Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:47.377 --> 03:49.379
And when he was asked 


03:49.378 --> 03:52.181
what motivated him 
to want to study, he said: 


03:52.182 --> 03:55.852
“I read an article 
in your Awake! magazine on trees. 


03:55.852 --> 03:59.089
“Now, I happen to be 
a bit of an expert on trees. 


03:59.088 --> 04:02.358
“And after I read the article, 
I said to myself: 


04:02.358 --> 04:05.628
“‘That article was so well-documented. 


04:05.628 --> 04:07.730
“‘It was so precise. 


04:07.730 --> 04:11.935
“‘Any organization that is that careful 
when writing about trees 


04:11.935 --> 04:15.438
is going to be just as careful 
when teaching me the Bible.’” 


04:15.438 --> 04:19.000
And on that basis, 
he accepted a Bible study.


04:20.543 --> 04:23.813
Now, an area where great care 
needs to be taken 


04:23.813 --> 04:26.181
is when we’re quoting statistics. 


04:26.182 --> 04:29.519
A newspaper may report on a disaster 
in a certain country 


04:29.518 --> 04:34.290
and say that 10,000 people 
were killed in the disaster. 


04:34.290 --> 04:37.227
Immediately, 
our researchers are going to ask, 


04:37.227 --> 04:39.662
“Where did they get that statistic?” 


04:39.662 --> 04:42.699
They might phone the newspaper 
and ask for the source. 


04:42.698 --> 04:45.701
And if the reporter 
can’t confirm the statistic, 


04:45.702 --> 04:48.705
our researchers will go to another source


04:48.705 --> 04:52.000
—a more official source—
to get the correct statistic.


04:53.508 --> 04:57.413
Care is also taken 
when quoting personalities of the past. 


04:57.413 --> 05:02.318
Now, suppose we want to quote 
something that Napoleon Bonaparte said


05:02.318 --> 05:04.320
—the French general. 


05:04.320 --> 05:07.990
Well, being French, 
Napoleon spoke French. 


05:07.990 --> 05:09.992
So if we’re quoting it in English, 


05:09.992 --> 05:14.664
that means that somebody translated 
the quote from French into English. 


05:14.663 --> 05:18.466
But did they translate the quote correctly? 


05:18.467 --> 05:22.672
Our researchers will probably go 
to the target language 


05:22.672 --> 05:27.210
and research the quote 
in French or in another language. 


05:27.210 --> 05:32.182
And more often than not, 
they find that what is presented in English 


05:32.182 --> 05:37.720
doesn’t accurately represent 
what the individual said at all.


05:37.720 --> 05:41.357
Now, as we age, 
our memory can play tricks on us. 


05:41.357 --> 05:44.827
And our researchers are aware of that. 


05:44.827 --> 05:47.664
Suppose that an elderly brother 
writes in his life story 


05:47.663 --> 05:52.435
that he was baptized 
at a circuit assembly on a certain date. 


05:52.435 --> 05:55.303
Our researchers may look at the date. 


05:55.303 --> 05:57.306
They may check the date, 


05:57.307 --> 06:01.544
and suppose they find that the date 
the brother gave fell on a Tuesday. 


06:01.543 --> 06:06.081
Now, what are the chances that there was 
a circuit assembly on a Tuesday? 


06:06.082 --> 06:08.819
There may have been, 
but they’re going to check. 


06:08.818 --> 06:11.820
Is the brother’s memory failing him? 


06:11.820 --> 06:13.857
If they can’t confirm the date, 


06:13.857 --> 06:16.092
they may ask someone to help the brother 


06:16.092 --> 06:19.262
to remember the date 
more correctly, more accurately. 


06:19.262 --> 06:23.199
Perhaps someone was baptized 
at the same circuit assembly as he was, 


06:23.198 --> 06:27.000
and perhaps that person 
has an accurate note of the date.


06:28.137 --> 06:31.040
Our translators also go to great lengths 


06:31.040 --> 06:35.478
to present accurate information 
to the brothers and sisters. 


06:35.478 --> 06:38.280
Some time ago, 
the Awake! magazine published an article 


06:38.280 --> 06:41.683
on a very rare species of butterfly. 


06:41.683 --> 06:44.453
Now, with all animals and insects, 


06:44.453 --> 06:46.721
we provide our translators 


06:46.722 --> 06:49.825
with the Latin name 
of the animal or the insect. 


06:49.825 --> 06:52.195
And so our translators had the Latin name. 


06:52.195 --> 06:54.197
But in one large country, 


06:54.197 --> 06:57.134
they were unable to find 
the name in the vernacular. 


06:57.133 --> 06:59.135
So, what did they do? 


06:59.135 --> 07:02.372
They phoned the country’s leading university, 


07:02.372 --> 07:05.374
and they were transferred 
to the Biology Department, 


07:05.373 --> 07:07.443
and there an expert gave them 


07:07.443 --> 07:11.313
the name in the vernacular 
of that particular butterfly. 


07:11.313 --> 07:14.616
But then he said: 
“Why is it that you’re worrying so much 


07:14.617 --> 07:16.852
“about the correct name of this butterfly? 


07:16.852 --> 07:19.322
“If you got it wrong, 
there are only two of us 


07:19.322 --> 07:22.225
in the whole country 
who would’ve known the difference.” 


07:22.225 --> 07:27.663
Well, that opened the way 
to give a witness to this expert.


07:27.663 --> 07:29.665
Well, now, how well would you do 


07:29.665 --> 07:32.335
in spotting a statement that is slightly off 


07:32.335 --> 07:34.603
and making it more accurate? 


07:34.603 --> 07:36.605
Would you like to find out? 


07:36.605 --> 07:39.108
Of course you would! 
It’ll be fun. 


07:39.108 --> 07:41.310
So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call 


07:41.310 --> 07:43.412
You Be the Editor. 


07:43.412 --> 07:46.349
We’re going to put 
a number of statements on the screen, 


07:46.348 --> 07:48.985
and there’s a problem 
with each one of them. 


07:48.985 --> 07:51.987
Now your job 
is to figure out what’s wrong, 


07:51.987 --> 07:55.992
why it is wrong, 
and then suggest how to fix it. 


07:55.992 --> 07:57.994
It’s going to be fun.


07:57.993 --> 07:59.995
Here’s the first statement: 


07:59.995 --> 08:04.067
“According 
to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia, 


08:04.067 --> 08:06.102
“the Egyptian Sphinx 


08:06.102 --> 08:10.472
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 


08:10.472 --> 08:13.109
“The Egyptian Sphinx 


08:13.108 --> 08:17.446
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 


08:17.447 --> 08:19.482
Well, the problem 


08:19.482 --> 08:21.950
is with the date 2550 B.C.E. 


08:21.950 --> 08:23.953
The global Flood occurred 


08:23.953 --> 08:26.855
about 200 years after that date. 


08:26.855 --> 08:30.000
So, what are the chances 
that the Sphinx survived the Flood? 


08:31.293 --> 08:35.296
Unless, of course, you think 
that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose. 


08:35.297 --> 08:38.400
Now, these dates 
are good for you school children 


08:38.400 --> 08:40.502
to keep in mind 
when you’re writing reports. 


08:40.502 --> 08:43.072
Sometimes you copy something 
from an encyclopedia, 


08:43.072 --> 08:45.074
and it gives a certain date. 


08:45.073 --> 08:48.410
But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,


08:48.410 --> 08:53.000
so that what you put in your report 
is as accurate as possible.


08:54.850 --> 08:57.487
Now let’s go on to the next one: 


08:57.487 --> 08:59.489
“In 29 C.E., 


08:59.488 --> 09:03.058
“Jesus was baptized by a close relative, 


09:03.058 --> 09:06.661
John the Baptizer.” 


09:06.662 --> 09:09.199
Well, 29 C.E., that looks right. 


09:09.198 --> 09:11.200
And we know that Jesus 


09:11.200 --> 09:13.368
was baptized by John; that’s right. 


09:13.368 --> 09:15.403
So the problem must be 


09:15.403 --> 09:18.506
“close relative,” and it is. 


09:18.507 --> 09:20.877
Now, both of Jesus’ parents 


09:20.877 --> 09:25.582
were of the tribe of Judah, 
and their parents were of the tribe of Judah. 


09:25.582 --> 09:29.252
But, what about John’s parents, 
Zechariah and Elizabeth? 


09:29.252 --> 09:31.454
They were both of the tribe of Levi. 


09:31.453 --> 09:34.123
So Elizabeth and Mary 
couldn’t have been sisters. 


09:34.123 --> 09:36.158
Could they have been cousins? 


09:36.158 --> 09:37.260
Maybe. 


09:37.260 --> 09:39.262
We can’t even confirm that. 


09:39.262 --> 09:43.432
And if they were, that would make 
Jesus and John second cousins. 


09:43.432 --> 09:46.702
Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”? 


09:46.702 --> 09:49.272
Some would say yes; 
some would say no. 


09:49.272 --> 09:51.840
So it’s safer just to say, 


09:51.840 --> 09:56.145
“In 29 C.E., 
Jesus was baptized by a relative, 


09:56.145 --> 09:58.847
John the Baptizer.”


09:58.847 --> 09:59.949
Here’s one. 


09:59.948 --> 10:02.718
Let’s see if you can spot 
the error in this one: 


10:02.718 --> 10:04.720
“While most of the early Christians 


10:04.720 --> 10:07.490
“were held in little esteem in the community, 


10:07.490 --> 10:10.893
“a few enjoyed an elevated social status. 


10:10.893 --> 10:15.000
For example, Luke was a respected physician.” 


10:16.432 --> 10:18.100
Well, the word we need 


10:18.100 --> 10:20.803
to look at is “respected.” 


10:20.803 --> 10:23.538
We respect our doctors today, 


10:23.538 --> 10:26.941
and our doctors have 
a very, very fine education. 


10:26.942 --> 10:29.779
But was that the case in the first century? 


10:29.778 --> 10:34.250
A reference work says this 
about first-century physicians: 


10:34.250 --> 10:37.753
“Many doctors were freed Greek slaves, 


10:37.753 --> 10:42.256
“hence the social standing 
of doctors was quite low. 


10:42.257 --> 10:45.160
“Because recovery rates were so low, 


10:45.160 --> 10:48.930
many people were skeptical 
or even scornful of doctors.” 


10:48.930 --> 10:51.800
Note this statement from the first century: 


10:51.800 --> 10:55.403
“Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor; 


10:55.403 --> 10:58.240
“now he is an undertaker. 


10:58.240 --> 11:00.508
“He is still doing as an undertaker, 


11:00.508 --> 11:03.511
what he used to do as a doctor.” 


11:03.512 --> 11:05.514
Not very flattering, is it? 


11:05.513 --> 11:09.751
Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use 
a different example.


11:09.752 --> 11:11.287
Here’s one: 


11:11.287 --> 11:14.357
“In 325 C.E., 


11:14.357 --> 11:16.359
“the Roman Emperor Constantine 


11:16.358 --> 11:18.393
“established Christianity 


11:18.393 --> 11:20.395
“as the official religion 


11:20.395 --> 11:23.365
of the Roman Empire.” 


11:23.365 --> 11:26.702
Well, 325 C.E., that looks right. 


11:26.702 --> 11:29.705
And Constantine, that looks right. 


11:29.705 --> 11:32.073
But look at the word “official”


11:32.073 --> 11:35.276
—“official religion.” 


11:35.277 --> 11:38.314
Constantine never established Christianity 


11:38.313 --> 11:41.583
as the official religion 
of the Roman Empire. 


11:41.583 --> 11:45.353
In 313 B.C.E., 
he did make it legal to be a Christian, 


11:45.353 --> 11:48.256
but paganism was still 
one of the official religions. 


11:48.257 --> 11:52.227
Apostate Christianity 
didn’t become the official religion 


11:52.227 --> 11:55.530
until 391 C.E.


11:55.530 --> 11:57.533
This one is tricky. 


11:57.533 --> 11:59.901
See how you do with this one: 


11:59.902 --> 12:01.904
“Imagine the apostle Paul 


12:01.903 --> 12:04.706
“during his first imprisonment in Rome, 


12:04.707 --> 12:06.975
“writing his letter to the Colossians 


12:06.975 --> 12:09.000
from a dark prison cell.” 


12:10.645 --> 12:12.948
Well, if you look in the back 
of the New World Translation, 


12:12.948 --> 12:16.618
you’ll find that Paul did write his letter 
to the Colossians while in Rome, 


12:16.618 --> 12:20.221
and he was imprisoned at the time. 


12:20.222 --> 12:22.592
So, what’s the problem? 


12:22.592 --> 12:24.894
“Dark prison cell.” 


12:24.893 --> 12:27.730
Where was Paul 
during his first imprisonment? 


12:27.730 --> 12:30.365
In his own rented house. 


12:30.365 --> 12:32.635
So the statement “dark prison cell,” 


12:32.635 --> 12:36.738
it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.


12:36.738 --> 12:39.308
Here’s an old one: 


12:39.308 --> 12:41.310
“While Paul generally preached 


12:41.310 --> 12:43.312
“to people of the nations, 


12:43.312 --> 12:45.380
“Peter was sent to the Jews. 


12:45.380 --> 12:47.950
“Contrary to popular belief, 


12:47.950 --> 12:50.853
Peter was never in Rome.” 


12:50.853 --> 12:53.521
Some scholars used to make that statement, 


12:53.522 --> 12:55.690
and they made it 60 years ago: 


12:55.690 --> 12:58.593
“Peter was never in Rome.” 


12:58.593 --> 13:00.595
But can we really say that? 


13:00.595 --> 13:02.798
Can we be that dogmatic? 


13:02.798 --> 13:05.366
Can we say that he didn’t even spend 


13:05.367 --> 13:07.670
vacation time or have a short visit in Rome? 


13:07.670 --> 13:09.705
No, we cannot. 


13:09.705 --> 13:11.773
So it would be more accurate to state: 


13:11.773 --> 13:16.000
“There is no record 
that Peter ever lived in Rome.”


13:17.112 --> 13:18.914
Here’s one: 


13:18.913 --> 13:21.616
“We can have confidence in the Bible


13:21.617 --> 13:25.120
—it is mankind’s oldest book.” 


13:25.120 --> 13:28.957
“Mankind’s oldest book.” 


13:28.957 --> 13:31.727
Years ago, some scholars believed 


13:31.727 --> 13:35.364
that texts written 
by Adam, Noah, and others 


13:35.363 --> 13:37.833
survived the Flood 
and became part of the Bible. 


13:37.833 --> 13:39.835
And if that were true, 


13:39.835 --> 13:43.000
then we could say that the Bible 
is mankind’s oldest book. 


13:44.473 --> 13:46.708
Now, here’s a quote 
from Insight on the Scriptures, 


13:46.708 --> 13:48.743
our Bible encyclopedia. 


13:48.743 --> 13:53.048
It says: 
“There is no way to establish definitely 


13:53.048 --> 13:55.851
“that some of the histories 
mentioned in the book of Genesis 


13:55.852 --> 13:59.120
were committed to writing 
before the Flood.” 


13:59.120 --> 14:03.392
So, today we might call the Bible 
one of mankind’s oldest books 


14:03.392 --> 14:06.895
or the world’s oldest modern book, 


14:06.895 --> 14:09.432
as we do in one of our videos.


14:09.432 --> 14:11.534
Here’s the last one: 


14:11.533 --> 14:13.735
“In 1517, 


14:13.735 --> 14:17.172
“Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses 


14:17.172 --> 14:21.000
on the door of a church 
in Wittenberg, Germany.” 


14:22.210 --> 14:24.380
Well, we’ve highlighted “95,” 


14:24.380 --> 14:27.315
but there are questions 
about the entire statement. 


14:27.315 --> 14:29.952
Some modern scholars have done 


14:29.952 --> 14:32.955
a tremendous, exhaustive study 
of the life of Martin Luther, 


14:32.955 --> 14:35.657
and they claim 
that he couldn’t have compiled 


14:35.657 --> 14:40.329
all 95 of his theses by 1517. 


14:40.328 --> 14:44.098
Others go so far as to claim 
that it never happened


14:44.098 --> 14:48.003
—that he never did nail his theses 
on the door of the church. 


14:48.003 --> 14:51.406
Still others are just as adamant 
that it’s all true


14:51.407 --> 14:53.442
—that it all happened. 


14:53.442 --> 14:55.710
So there’s no consensus. 


14:55.710 --> 14:58.180
We would have to modify the statement


14:58.180 --> 15:01.050
—“some believe” or “it is believed”—


15:01.050 --> 15:03.052
in order to make it more accurate 


15:03.052 --> 15:07.000
and to acknowledge the fact 
that there are differences of opinion.


15:08.357 --> 15:11.260
Well, how did you do on the quiz? 


15:11.260 --> 15:15.998
If you’re like me, you’ve probably made 
some of those statements yourself at times. 


15:15.998 --> 15:19.835
The statements were based 
on the best research we had at the time. 


15:19.835 --> 15:23.272
But this is to illustrate 
the fact that times change; 


15:23.272 --> 15:26.275
research facilities improve. 


15:26.275 --> 15:30.947
A scholar does exhaustive research 
on one point of history, 


15:30.947 --> 15:34.249
and he uncovers things 
that were previously unknown. 


15:34.248 --> 15:36.251
So we have to keep up. 


15:36.252 --> 15:38.720
We have to check, check, check. 


15:38.720 --> 15:42.858
And when credible research 
reveals that we have to adjust 


15:42.858 --> 15:45.493
or tweak a statement 
that we made in the past, 


15:45.493 --> 15:48.030
we do so without hesitation. 


15:48.030 --> 15:53.035
Our goal is to provide information 
that is as accurate as possible 


15:53.035 --> 15:56.372
because we know that you 
brothers and sisters use this information. 


15:56.372 --> 15:58.374
You quote it in the field ministry. 


15:58.373 --> 16:00.441
You use it in your public talks. 


16:00.442 --> 16:02.979
So we want to make sure 
that our brothers are fed 


16:02.978 --> 16:07.115
with the most accurate 
spiritual food possible.


16:07.115 --> 16:10.818
We’re imperfect, of course, 
and we are going to make mistakes. 


16:10.818 --> 16:13.588
And when we do, 
we have to correct them. 


16:13.588 --> 16:18.000
Our goal is to do the best we can 
in all our imperfection.


16:19.828 --> 16:22.163
Well, how does it make you feel? 


16:22.163 --> 16:24.666
I know how it makes me feel. 


16:24.667 --> 16:29.672
I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization 
takes accuracy so seriously. 


16:29.672 --> 16:31.874
It gives me confidence. 


16:31.873 --> 16:35.743
And, you know, I’m reminded 
of the description of another researcher, 


16:35.743 --> 16:42.283
as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10. 


16:42.283 --> 16:44.285
You know who this is. 


16:44.285 --> 16:48.723
Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10: 


16:48.723 --> 16:52.360
“Not only had the congregator become wise 


16:52.360 --> 16:56.232
“but he continually taught 
the people what he knew, 


16:56.232 --> 16:58.567
“and he pondered 


16:58.567 --> 17:01.904
“and made a thorough search 


17:01.903 --> 17:04.873
“in order to compile many proverbs. 


17:04.873 --> 17:07.743
“The congregator sought 
to find delightful words 


17:07.743 --> 17:18.771
and to record accurate words of truth.”

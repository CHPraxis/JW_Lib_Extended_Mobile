00:01 This month I’d like to talk about the efforts
00:04 Jehovah’s organization is making
00:06 to produce literature, publications,
00:09 articles that are as accurate as possible.
00:13 We’re going to talk about accuracy —accuracy of statement.
00:18 Now, first, what’s the responsibility  of the writer of the article?
00:24 When a writer submits  an article for publication,
00:27 he is expected to supply references  from reputable sources
00:32 to back up the facts  that he’s included in his article.
00:35 And our Research Department  will use those references
00:37 to check the accuracy of everything.
00:40 Reliable, respected sources.
00:44 What do we mean by a reliable source?
00:47 Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias,
00:50 books, magazines, and then newspapers
00:55 —basically in that order.
00:58 We prefer encyclopedias over books,
01:01 books over magazines,
01:03 and magazines over newspapers
01:05 —generally because newspaper editors  have a hard time checking their facts.
01:09 They have a very limited time  in which to check their facts.
01:13 Even encyclopedias and books get updated,
01:17 so we have to go  with the latest edition of those.
01:20 We have to make sure  that our sources are reliable.
01:24 Now, when a writer quotes an expert,
01:27 our researchers will ask:  “Who’s this expert?
01:31 “What’s his reputation?
01:33 “Is he working for a particular organization?
01:36 “Does this organization have an agenda?
01:39 Is it a special-interest group?”
01:41 If we find that the goals  of the organization are questionable,
01:46 we won’t use the quote —even if it’s a really good quote.
01:51 Now, suppose that a writer  wants to quote something from a book.
01:55 In the reference material,
01:57 he’ll supply a photocopy  of the quote in the book,
02:00 but very often he’ll give us  two or three pages before the quote
02:04 and two or three pages after as well.
02:07 And that way,  our researchers can examine the quote
02:11 in context to make sure  that what we’re saying in print
02:15 is really what the author  of the quote had in mind.
02:18 For example,  an evolutionist might make a statement
02:22 which on the surface
02:24 appears to confirm his support of creation.
02:27 Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement
02:30 that seems to indicate  that he believes in God.
02:33 But when you examine  the quote in context,
02:36 you realize that that isn’t what  the author had in mind at all.
02:39 We would never  deliberately distort a quotation.
02:44 We try very hard to use all  of our quotations in context.
02:50 Now, it’s important to keep up  with the very latest research.
02:53 Something that was stated years ago  as a fact may have been disproved.
02:58 And the reason why is obvious.
03:00 Someone may spend his entire life
03:02 researching a very limited point in history
03:06 —a very small point in history—
03:08 and, of course,  if he spends so much time researching,
03:10 he’s going to uncover things.
03:12 And so it’s not surprising  that from time to time
03:15 we have to adjust our view  of some historical points.
03:19 We have to check, check, check.
03:21 And later on in this discussion,  we’re going to consider some examples of it.
03:26 It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!
03:28 Now, someone might ask,  ‘Why is it necessary to be so picky,
03:32 to be so fussy, about accuracy?’
03:36 And in answer,  I’d like to give an experience
03:39 that I heard about a few years ago.
03:42 In Northern Europe,  there was a man
03:44 who accepted a Bible study  from Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:47 And when he was asked
03:49 what motivated him  to want to study, he said:
03:52 “I read an article  in your Awake! magazine on trees.
03:55 “Now, I happen to be  a bit of an expert on trees.
03:59 “And after I read the article,  I said to myself:
04:02 “‘That article was so well-documented.
04:05 “‘It was so precise.
04:07 “‘Any organization that is that careful  when writing about trees
04:11 is going to be just as careful  when teaching me the Bible.’”
04:15 And on that basis,  he accepted a Bible study.
04:20 Now, an area where great care  needs to be taken
04:23 is when we’re quoting statistics.
04:26 A newspaper may report on a disaster  in a certain country
04:29 and say that 10,000 people  were killed in the disaster.
04:34 Immediately,  our researchers are going to ask,
04:37 “Where did they get that statistic?”
04:39 They might phone the newspaper  and ask for the source.
04:42 And if the reporter  can’t confirm the statistic,
04:45 our researchers will go to another source
04:48 —a more official source— to get the correct statistic.
04:53 Care is also taken  when quoting personalities of the past.
04:57 Now, suppose we want to quote  something that Napoleon Bonaparte said
05:02 —the French general.
05:04 Well, being French,  Napoleon spoke French.
05:07 So if we’re quoting it in English,
05:09 that means that somebody translated  the quote from French into English.
05:14 But did they translate the quote correctly?
05:18 Our researchers will probably go  to the target language
05:22 and research the quote  in French or in another language.
05:27 And more often than not,  they find that what is presented in English
05:32 doesn’t accurately represent  what the individual said at all.
05:37 Now, as we age,  our memory can play tricks on us.
05:41 And our researchers are aware of that.
05:44 Suppose that an elderly brother  writes in his life story
05:47 that he was baptized  at a circuit assembly on a certain date.
05:52 Our researchers may look at the date.
05:55 They may check the date,
05:57 and suppose they find that the date  the brother gave fell on a Tuesday.
06:01 Now, what are the chances that there was  a circuit assembly on a Tuesday?
06:06 There may have been,  but they’re going to check.
06:08 Is the brother’s memory failing him?
06:11 If they can’t confirm the date,
06:13 they may ask someone to help the brother
06:16 to remember the date  more correctly, more accurately.
06:19 Perhaps someone was baptized  at the same circuit assembly as he was,
06:23 and perhaps that person  has an accurate note of the date.
06:28 Our translators also go to great lengths
06:31 to present accurate information  to the brothers and sisters.
06:35 Some time ago,  the Awake! magazine published an article
06:38 on a very rare species of butterfly.
06:41 Now, with all animals and insects,
06:44 we provide our translators
06:46 with the Latin name  of the animal or the insect.
06:49 And so our translators had the Latin name.
06:52 But in one large country,
06:54 they were unable to find  the name in the vernacular.
06:57 So, what did they do?
06:59 They phoned the country’s leading university,
07:02 and they were transferred  to the Biology Department,
07:05 and there an expert gave them
07:07 the name in the vernacular  of that particular butterfly.
07:11 But then he said:  “Why is it that you’re worrying so much
07:14 “about the correct name of this butterfly?
07:16 “If you got it wrong,  there are only two of us
07:19 in the whole country  who would’ve known the difference.”
07:22 Well, that opened the way  to give a witness to this expert.
07:27 Well, now, how well would you do
07:29 in spotting a statement that is slightly off
07:32 and making it more accurate?
07:34 Would you like to find out?
07:36 Of course you would!  It’ll be fun.
07:39 So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call
07:41 You Be the Editor.
07:43 We’re going to put  a number of statements on the screen,
07:46 and there’s a problem  with each one of them.
07:48 Now your job  is to figure out what’s wrong,
07:51 why it is wrong,  and then suggest how to fix it.
07:55 It’s going to be fun.
07:57 Here’s the first statement:
07:59 “According  to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia,
08:04 “the Egyptian Sphinx
08:06 was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”
08:10 “The Egyptian Sphinx
08:13 was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.”
08:17 Well, the problem
08:19 is with the date 2550 B.C.E.
08:21 The global Flood occurred
08:23 about 200 years after that date.
08:26 So, what are the chances  that the Sphinx survived the Flood?
08:31 Unless, of course, you think  that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose.
08:35 Now, these dates  are good for you school children
08:38 to keep in mind  when you’re writing reports.
08:40 Sometimes you copy something  from an encyclopedia,
08:43 and it gives a certain date.
08:45 But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,
08:48 so that what you put in your report  is as accurate as possible.
08:54 Now let’s go on to the next one:
08:57 “In 29 C.E.,
08:59 “Jesus was baptized by a close relative,
09:03 John the Baptizer.”
09:06 Well, 29 C.E., that looks right.
09:09 And we know that Jesus
09:11 was baptized by John; that’s right.
09:13 So the problem must be
09:15 “close relative,” and it is.
09:18 Now, both of Jesus’ parents
09:20 were of the tribe of Judah,  and their parents were of the tribe of Judah.
09:25 But, what about John’s parents,  Zechariah and Elizabeth?
09:29 They were both of the tribe of Levi.
09:31 So Elizabeth and Mary  couldn’t have been sisters.
09:34 Could they have been cousins?
09:36 Maybe.
09:37 We can’t even confirm that.
09:39 And if they were, that would make  Jesus and John second cousins.
09:43 Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”?
09:46 Some would say yes;  some would say no.
09:49 So it’s safer just to say,
09:51 “In 29 C.E.,  Jesus was baptized by a relative,
09:56 John the Baptizer.”
09:58 Here’s one.
09:59 Let’s see if you can spot  the error in this one:
10:02 “While most of the early Christians
10:04 “were held in little esteem in the community,
10:07 “a few enjoyed an elevated social status.
10:10 For example, Luke was a respected physician.”
10:16 Well, the word we need
10:18 to look at is “respected.”
10:20 We respect our doctors today,
10:23 and our doctors have  a very, very fine education.
10:26 But was that the case in the first century?
10:29 A reference work says this  about first-century physicians:
10:34 “Many doctors were freed Greek slaves,
10:37 “hence the social standing  of doctors was quite low.
10:42 “Because recovery rates were so low,
10:45 many people were skeptical  or even scornful of doctors.”
10:48 Note this statement from the first century:
10:51 “Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor;
10:55 “now he is an undertaker.
10:58 “He is still doing as an undertaker,
11:00 what he used to do as a doctor.”
11:03 Not very flattering, is it?
11:05 Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use  a different example.
11:09 Here’s one:
11:11 “In 325 C.E.,
11:14 “the Roman Emperor Constantine
11:16 “established Christianity
11:18 “as the official religion
11:20 of the Roman Empire.”
11:23 Well, 325 C.E., that looks right.
11:26 And Constantine, that looks right.
11:29 But look at the word “official”
11:32 —“official religion.”
11:35 Constantine never established Christianity
11:38 as the official religion  of the Roman Empire.
11:41 In 313 B.C.E.,  he did make it legal to be a Christian,
11:45 but paganism was still  one of the official religions.
11:48 Apostate Christianity  didn’t become the official religion
11:52 until 391 C.E.
11:55 This one is tricky.
11:57 See how you do with this one:
11:59 “Imagine the apostle Paul
12:01 “during his first imprisonment in Rome,
12:04 “writing his letter to the Colossians
12:06 from a dark prison cell.”
12:10 Well, if you look in the back  of the New World Translation,
12:12 you’ll find that Paul did write his letter  to the Colossians while in Rome,
12:16 and he was imprisoned at the time.
12:20 So, what’s the problem?
12:22 “Dark prison cell.”
12:24 Where was Paul  during his first imprisonment?
12:27 In his own rented house.
12:30 So the statement “dark prison cell,”
12:32 it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.
12:36 Here’s an old one:
12:39 “While Paul generally preached
12:41 “to people of the nations,
12:43 “Peter was sent to the Jews.
12:45 “Contrary to popular belief,
12:47 Peter was never in Rome.”
12:50 Some scholars used to make that statement,
12:53 and they made it 60 years ago:
12:55 “Peter was never in Rome.”
12:58 But can we really say that?
13:00 Can we be that dogmatic?
13:02 Can we say that he didn’t even spend
13:05 vacation time or have a short visit in Rome?
13:07 No, we cannot.
13:09 So it would be more accurate to state:
13:11 “There is no record  that Peter ever lived in Rome.”
13:17 Here’s one:
13:18 “We can have confidence in the Bible
13:21 —it is mankind’s oldest book.”
13:25 “Mankind’s oldest book.”
13:28 Years ago, some scholars believed
13:31 that texts written  by Adam, Noah, and others
13:35 survived the Flood  and became part of the Bible.
13:37 And if that were true,
13:39 then we could say that the Bible  is mankind’s oldest book.
13:44 Now, here’s a quote  from Insight on the Scriptures,
13:46 our Bible encyclopedia.
13:48 It says:  “There is no way to establish definitely
13:53 “that some of the histories  mentioned in the book of Genesis
13:55 were committed to writing  before the Flood.”
13:59 So, today we might call the Bible  one of mankind’s oldest books
14:03 or the world’s oldest modern book,
14:06 as we do in one of our videos.
14:09 Here’s the last one:
14:11 “In 1517,
14:13 “Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses
14:17 on the door of a church  in Wittenberg, Germany.”
14:22 Well, we’ve highlighted “95,”
14:24 but there are questions  about the entire statement.
14:27 Some modern scholars have done
14:29 a tremendous, exhaustive study  of the life of Martin Luther,
14:32 and they claim  that he couldn’t have compiled
14:35 all 95 of his theses by 1517.
14:40 Others go so far as to claim  that it never happened
14:44 —that he never did nail his theses  on the door of the church.
14:48 Still others are just as adamant  that it’s all true
14:51 —that it all happened.
14:53 So there’s no consensus.
14:55 We would have to modify the statement
14:58 —“some believe” or “it is believed”—
15:01 in order to make it more accurate
15:03 and to acknowledge the fact  that there are differences of opinion.
15:08 Well, how did you do on the quiz?
15:11 If you’re like me, you’ve probably made  some of those statements yourself at times.
15:15 The statements were based  on the best research we had at the time.
15:19 But this is to illustrate  the fact that times change;
15:23 research facilities improve.
15:26 A scholar does exhaustive research  on one point of history,
15:30 and he uncovers things  that were previously unknown.
15:34 So we have to keep up.
15:36 We have to check, check, check.
15:38 And when credible research  reveals that we have to adjust
15:42 or tweak a statement  that we made in the past,
15:45 we do so without hesitation.
15:48 Our goal is to provide information  that is as accurate as possible
15:53 because we know that you  brothers and sisters use this information.
15:56 You quote it in the field ministry.
15:58 You use it in your public talks.
16:00 So we want to make sure  that our brothers are fed
16:02 with the most accurate  spiritual food possible.
16:07 We’re imperfect, of course,  and we are going to make mistakes.
16:10 And when we do,  we have to correct them.
16:13 Our goal is to do the best we can  in all our imperfection.
16:19 Well, how does it make you feel?
16:22 I know how it makes me feel.
16:24 I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization  takes accuracy so seriously.
16:29 It gives me confidence.
16:31 And, you know, I’m reminded  of the description of another researcher,
16:35 as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10.
16:42 You know who this is.
16:44 Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10:
16:48 “Not only had the congregator become wise
16:52 “but he continually taught  the people what he knew,
16:56 “and he pondered
16:58 “and made a thorough search
17:01 “in order to compile many proverbs.
17:04 “The congregator sought  to find delightful words
17:07 and to record accurate words of truth.”

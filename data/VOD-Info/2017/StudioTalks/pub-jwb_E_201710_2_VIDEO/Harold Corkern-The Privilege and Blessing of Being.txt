00:01 As Jehovah’s people,
00:03 we enjoy many undeserved
00:05 and precious privileges.
00:07 Among them, we bear Jehovah’s name
00:11 and render him sacred service.
00:13 As we carry out his will,
00:16 he dignifies us in a very special way.
00:20 At 1 Corinthians 3:9, the apostle Paul under inspiration
00:25 stated that “we are God’s fellow workers.”
00:31 What an honor to be a fellow worker with the Universal Sovereign,
00:34 our loving heavenly Father!
00:37 To build appreciation for the privilege of working with Jehovah,
00:41 we’re going to review events in the life of Jonathan, a son of King Saul.
00:47 First Samuel 14:45  describes Jonathan when it says:
00:51 “For it was with God that he acted this day.”
00:56 What was the background that led to this statement?
01:00 How did Jonathan act, or work, with Jehovah on that day?
01:05 What lessons can we learn from their working relationship?
01:09 And what blessings result from being a fellow worker with God?
01:14 Let us begin with some background.
01:18 First Samuel 12:20
01:22 records the encouraging words
01:24 spoken by the prophet Samuel  to the nation of Israel:
01:27 “Do not be afraid.  . . .
01:29 “Only do not turn away from following Jehovah,
01:33 and serve Jehovah  with all your heart.”
01:36 Verse 22 adds:
01:38 “For the sake of his great name,
01:40 Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
01:44 As long as they remained faithful,
01:46 Jehovah would always be there to guide, protect, and rescue them.
01:52 These words no doubt strengthened Jonathan to carry out Jehovah’s directive
01:56 to subdue the enemy nations
01:58 and take possession of the Promised Land.
02:02 At  1 Samuel chapter 13,
02:05 we read that Jonathan  was assigned 1,000 men
02:08 to attack a Philistine garrison at Geba.
02:12 Although poorly equipped, Jonathan and his men succeeded.
02:18 This victory strengthened  Jonathan’s confidence in Jehovah
02:21 and provides a valuable lesson for us:
02:25 While we gain strength and courage
02:27 from Jehovah’s reassuring words of the Scriptures,
02:30 our confidence in Jehovah’s support becomes even stronger
02:34 when we successfully carry out our assignments
02:37 that may seem overwhelming.
02:41 The account then relates how the Philistines
02:43 were infuriated over their defeat and mounted a massive counterattack.
02:49 They sent out raiding parties
02:51 from their camp  at Michmash near Jerusalem.
02:54 Many Israelite men hid out of fear,
02:56 and some even fled to the other side of the Jordan River.
03:01 In contrast, Jonathan remained courageous.
03:06 Determined to put a stop to the raids,
03:08 he confronted the Philistine outpost
03:11 at the ravine pass of Michmash.
03:15 The approach was by way of a deep gorge with nearly vertical cliffs.
03:20 This would have seemed next to impossible to someone unfamiliar with the area,
03:25 but Jonathan grew up in this territory and apparently knew it well.
03:31 His knowledge of the surroundings provides another practical lesson:
03:36 Whatever theocratic assignment we may be given,
03:39 putting forth time and effort  to get to know the terrain,
03:43 so to speak, will contribute to our effectiveness.
03:47 When we show interest in our assigned work,
03:49 we become even more effective fellow workers of Jehovah.
03:54 Let’s read as Jonathan prepares to take action against the Philistines.
04:00 First Samuel 14:6 states:
04:03 “So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:
04:05 “‘Come and let us cross over  to the outpost of these uncircumcised men.
04:10 “‘Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf,
04:13 for nothing can hinder Jehovah from saving by many or by few.’”
04:19 What contributed to his confidence in Jehovah?
04:23 Recall that he put faith in Jehovah’s reassuring words
04:26 through the prophet Samuel:  “Do not be afraid. . . .
04:30 For the sake of his great name, Jehovah will not abandon his people.”
04:36 He experienced Jehovah’s support
04:38 when he struck down the Philistine garrison at Geba.
04:43 Jonathan could also think back on Israel’s history.
04:47 He could reflect on how Gideon and his 300 men
04:50 were victorious over 135,000 Midianites.
04:55 He could meditate on Samson killing 1,000 Philistines
04:59 with the jawbone of a donkey.
05:03 Such examples  would bolster his confidence
05:06 that he was working  with the Almighty God, Jehovah.
05:12 We too can meditate on fellow workers of God recorded in the Scriptures
05:16 as well as published life stories of modern-day faithful servants.
05:21 Such examples reinforce our faith in Jehovah
05:25 as we rely on him for success.
05:29 Another lesson comes from the response of Jonathan’s armor-bearer
05:33 at 1 Samuel 14:7:
05:36 “At this his armor-bearer said to him:
05:38 “‘Do whatever your heart impels you to do.
05:42 “‘Turn wherever you wish,
05:44 and I will follow you  wherever your heart impels you.’”
05:48 It is unlikely that the attendant
05:50 would have initiated this challenging mission on his own.
05:54 Jonathan’s confident lead was a positive,  motivating influence on the man.
06:01 What happens today when elders and overseers
06:04 take the lead and display zeal in Jehovah’s work like Jonathan?
06:09 Others in the congregation are also motivated to action by their fine example.
06:16 Let us now read verses 8-10:
06:19 “Then Jonathan said:
06:22 “‘We will cross over to those men and reveal our presence to them.
06:26 “‘If they say to us, “Stand still until we come to you!”
06:31 “‘we will stand where we are and not go up to them.
06:34 “‘But if they say, “Come up against us!”
06:37 “‘we will go up, because Jehovah  will give them into our hand.
06:42 This will be our sign.’”
06:45 Jonathan once again demonstrated humble reliance on Jehovah.
06:50 Later in Second Samuel,
06:52 Jonathan is described as “swifter than the eagles”
06:55 and “mightier than the lions.”
06:58 However, these qualities and abilities did not cause him
07:02 to be self-reliant or overconfident.
07:06 He sought Jehovah’s direction by means of a sign.
07:11 What a powerful reminder for us!
07:14 Regardless of any natural abilities,
07:17 acquired skills, or experience we may have,
07:20 the key to success is seeking Jehovah’s guidance and support.
07:26 We seek his direction through specific prayers,
07:29 Bible reading and meditation,
07:32 and applying direction from “the faithful and discreet slave.”
07:37 We also consult  with longtime faithful brothers and sisters
07:40 who can share their rich experience as God’s fellow workers.
07:49 What else can we learn from Jonathan’s account?
07:53 Picking up at 1 Samuel 14:12,
07:57 Jonathan and his armor-bearer advance toward the Philistines.
08:03 From their elevated location, the Philistines shout to them:
08:07 “‘Come up to us, and we will teach you a lesson!’
08:11 “At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:
08:14 “‘Follow me, for Jehovah will give them into the hand of Israel.’”
08:20 Jonathan had requested a specific sign, and he got it.
08:24 But it meant advancing  up a steep and treacherous incline
08:28 right into enemy hands.
08:32 Someone lacking complete trust  in Jehovah might have said,
08:35 “Before proceeding, perhaps we should ask for another sign,”
08:40 but not Jonathan.
08:42 Without hesitation, he told his attendant to follow him
08:46 because Jehovah would give the enemy into their hand.
08:50 When we receive Jehovah’s direction,
08:53 we should without hesitation put our hearts into the work,
08:56 confident of Jehovah’s backing.
09:00 What happened next?
09:02 First Samuel 14:13, 14 reports:
09:07 “And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet,
09:11 “and his armor-bearer was behind him;
09:14 “and the Philistines began to fall before Jonathan,
09:18 “and his armor-bearer was putting  them to death behind him.
09:21 “In the first attack that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made,
09:25 they struck down about 20 men.”
09:28 Even after receiving a clear sign from Jehovah,
09:31 it took great effort.
09:33 They had to ‘climb up on their hands and feet,’
09:37 exerting themselves vigorously over rugged terrain.
09:41 The lesson?
09:43 Even when we receive clear direction and are ready to obey,
09:48 carrying out our assignments will not always be easy.
09:52 We have to exert ourselves vigorously,
09:55 being willing to work hard  with all of our mind, heart, and strength.
10:02 How did the Philistines react to seeing Jehovah’s support for his people?
10:06 First Samuel 14:15 reads:
10:09 “Then terror spread in the field camp
10:12 “and among all the people of the outpost,
10:15 “and even the raiding parties were terrified.
10:18 The earth began quaking,  and a terror from God ensued.”
10:24 The earthquake Jehovah caused melted the Philistines’ hearts.
10:28 Soon, the Israelites, even those  who had previously fled in fear,
10:32 joined the victory battle over the Philistines.
10:37 Likewise, when we put our hearts  into theocratic assignments,
10:41 Jehovah, our best Fellow Worker,
10:45 will always come through with whatever we need to accomplish his will.
10:51 But there is another lesson to be learned from this exciting Bible account.
10:55 During the height of the battle,
10:57 King Saul gave an unwise order saying:
11:02 “Cursed is the man who eats any food before the evening
11:05 and until I have taken  vengeance on my enemies!”
11:10 Jonathan, however, was not aware of his father’s order
11:14 and ate some wild honey  that he had found.
11:18 How did Saul react when he discovered that his own son had disobeyed him?
11:24 First Samuel 14:43, 44 tells us:
11:29 “Then Saul said to Jonathan:
11:32 “‘Tell me, what have you done?’
11:35 “So Jonathan told him:
11:37 “‘I merely tasted a little honey on the tip of the staff in my hand.
11:42 “Here I am!  I am ready to die!’
11:46 “At this Saul said:
11:48 “‘Thus may God do and may he add to it
11:51 if you do not die, Jonathan.’”
11:54 Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done
11:58 in risking his life in behalf of his people
12:01 and seeing Jehovah grant so much success,
12:04 he is now being condemned to death by his own father.
12:10 How his heart must have sank in disbelief,
12:13 disappointment, and sadness!
12:18 Would Jehovah now abandon  his loyal fellow worker?
12:22 First Samuel 14:45 reads:
12:25 “But the people said to Saul:
12:28 “‘Should Jonathan die
12:30 “‘—the one who brought this great victory to Israel?
12:33 “‘It is unthinkable!
12:35 “‘As surely as Jehovah is alive,
12:38 “‘not even a single hair of his head should fall to the ground,
12:41 “for it was with God that he acted this day.’
12:46 With that the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.”
12:51 Jonathan’s success provided undeniable evidence
12:55 that he was truly Jehovah’s fellow worker.
12:59 Jehovah, who had been at Jonathan’s side the whole time,
13:03 saw everything that had happened
13:05 and would not allow his loyal worker to die at Saul’s hands.
13:11 How comforting to know that when we faithfully carry out our assignments,
13:15 he will never forget our zealous efforts!
13:19 If someone as close as a father
13:22 fails to see and appreciate  the work we do in Jehovah’s service
13:25 or even turns against us, Jehovah will never forget our work.
13:31 He will always be there to guide,
13:34 support, protect, and bless us.
13:38 What a faith-building account
13:40 we’ve considered  in 1 Samuel chapters 13 and 14!
13:45 Why not take the time to read these chapters for yourself?
13:49 You’ll be moved to imitate Jonathan’s excellent example of loyalty,
13:53 courage, and obedience.
13:57 We want to be described  just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14:45:
14:02 “For it was with God that he acted this day.”
14:07 By continuing  as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah,
14:10 we are assured that ‘through faith and patience
14:13 we will inherit the promised reward.’

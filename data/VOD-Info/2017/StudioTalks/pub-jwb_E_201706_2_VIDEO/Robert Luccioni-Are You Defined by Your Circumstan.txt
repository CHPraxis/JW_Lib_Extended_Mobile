00:01 There are many exciting things happening
00:04 in Jehovah’s organization.
00:06 Why, month after month, we read articles,
00:08 watch videos, and hear personal experiences
00:12 about our brothers and sisters  who are doing more for Jehovah.
00:15 They are serving where  the need is greater or reaching out
00:19 for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:21 They are working  on construction, renovation,
00:25 maintenance of Kingdom Halls,  or other theocratic projects.
00:29 No doubt,  many of you watching this program
00:32 are excitedly looking forward
00:34 to expanding your ministry  in one of these areas.
00:37 We encourage you to do so.
00:40 You can be assured  that you will receive much fulfillment
00:44 and many blessings from Jehovah.
00:47 On the other hand,
00:49 there are others  who are watching this program
00:52 who may feel discouraged  because their circumstances
00:55 may seem to limit  their being as involved as they would like.
01:00 What are some of these circumstances?
01:03 These may include our age, our health,
01:06 our economic situation,  or our physical limitations.
01:10 For some of us,  perhaps our upbringing
01:14 or past errors  we have made in our life
01:17 may cause us to feel  that we are limited
01:20 as to what we can do  for Jehovah.
01:23 As we know well,  focusing on our limitations
01:26 can affect our joy,  causing discouragement.
01:29 What can we do?
01:31 There are many examples  in the Scriptures of men and women
01:36 who had circumstances  beyond their control
01:38 that seemed to limit how much  they could do for Jehovah.
01:42 Others had to deal with the effects  of their upbringing and family life
01:47 or with serious errors they made.
01:50 Did they allow themselves to be limited
01:53 by their circumstances or their past?
01:56 How did Jehovah feel about them?
01:59 How does Jehovah feel about us?
02:02 That is what we are going to discuss  in this month’s broadcast,
02:06 which has the theme
02:07 “Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?”
02:11 Let’s start by looking at some
02:13 who could have let  their circumstances limit them.
02:17 Consider first the example  of Joseph in the book of Genesis.
02:22 Now, Joseph faced injustice at its worst.
02:25 His situation was especially hurtful
02:28 since it was initially brought on by those  who should have been closest to him
02:32 —his family!
02:34 As a slave in Egypt  and later as a prisoner,
02:37 Joseph was indeed limited  in what he could do.
02:40 How might Joseph have reacted?
02:44 Well,  Joseph could have become so preoccupied
02:47 with what he could not do
02:49 that he lost sight of what he could do.
02:52 Did Joseph let his circumstances
02:55 paralyze his life?
02:57 No!
02:59 He chose to make  the best of his situation.
03:01 In fact,  note what Joseph did
03:04 while serving as a slave  in Potiphar’s house
03:06 if we turn together  to Genesis 39:4:
03:11 “Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes,
03:14 “and he became his personal attendant.
03:17 “So he appointed him over his house,
03:20 and he put him  in charge of all that was his.”
03:23 Joseph worked diligently
03:26 within the limitations  of his circumstances.
03:29 He took a similar approach while in prison.
03:31 Joseph focused on what he could do
03:34 despite suffering the effects of injustice.
03:38 As a second example,  consider Hezekiah.
03:41 Hezekiah is one  who might easily have felt
03:44 that he was defined by his upbringing.
03:48 Look at the terrible example  that was set by his father, Ahaz,
03:52 as recorded in 2 Kings chapter 16.
03:56 Second Kings chapter 16,
03:59 and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz:
04:03 “Instead, he walked in the way  of the kings of Israel,
04:08 “and he even made his own son  pass through the fire,
04:12 “following the detestable practices  of the nations
04:15 that Jehovah had driven out  from before the Israelites.”
04:19 Hezekiah’s father did detestable things
04:23 in opposition to Jehovah.
04:25 But Hezekiah showed
04:27 that he was not the helpless victim
04:29 of a poor parental example.
04:31 What did he do?
04:33 Well, turn in your Bibles  to 2 Kings chapter 18
04:37 and notice verse 3,
04:39 what it says about Hezekiah:
04:42 “He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes,
04:46 just as David his forefather had done.”
04:50 Verse 5 says of Hezekiah:
04:52 “There was no one like him  among all the kings of Judah.”
04:56 He became fully involved in true worship.
04:59 Verses 6 and 7 say that Hezekiah
05:02 ‘held fast to Jehovah,  and Jehovah proved to be with him.’
05:07 How encouraging  Hezekiah’s example is for us!
05:12 We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah
05:14 and do much in our worship of Jehovah,
05:17 even if we did not grow up in a family
05:19 that served Jehovah fully.
05:21 We are not helpless victims  of our environment.
05:25 Hezekiah’s example  reassures us that our past
05:30 does not have to control our future.
05:33 As a third example,  consider the apostle Paul.
05:37 He did not let his own past mistakes
05:39 involving religious prejudice and violence
05:43 stop him from giving his all to Jehovah.
05:46 How did Paul feel about his past?
05:49 Well, let’s read together  at 1 Corinthians 15:9:
05:55 “For I am the least of the apostles,
05:59 “and I am not worthy  of being called an apostle,
06:02 because I persecuted  the congregation of God.”
06:06 “I am the least of the apostles.”
06:09 Later, when writing to the Ephesians  as recorded at Ephesians 3:8,
06:13 he calls himself  “less than the least of all holy ones.”
06:18 Finally, at 1 Timothy 1:15,
06:21 he now calls himself  the “foremost” of all sinners.
06:25 Yes,  Paul’s prior treatment of the congregation
06:29 weighed heavily upon him.
06:31 Could Paul have reasoned  that he was damaged?
06:35 Could he have reasoned that his past
06:37 limited what he could do for Jehovah?
06:40 He could have,  but Paul did not do that.
06:43 He poured himself out  for the congregation.
06:46 Why, Paul was privileged to write  more books and letters
06:49 in the Christian Greek Scriptures  than anyone else.
06:52 He demonstrated  an outstanding zeal for the ministry.
06:55 Paul did not let his conduct in the past
06:59 dictate what he could do for Jehovah.
07:03 And there are many other examples as well.
07:05 For example,  are we in a difficult economic situation?
07:10 The account in 2 Corinthians chapter 8
07:12 tells us about the Macedonians.
07:14 Paul says that they were in deep poverty.
07:18 Yet they begged to have a financial share
07:21 in the relief work.
07:23 Are we older in years?
07:25 We may think of Anna.
07:27 The account at Luke 2:36-38
07:31 tells us that she was 84 years old
07:33 and that her husband had died
07:35 after just seven years of marriage.
07:38 Yet,  “she was never missing from the temple.”
07:40 She rendered ‘sacred service day and night.’
07:44 What lessons do we learn  from these accounts?
07:49 Our dear brothers and sisters in Bible times were just like us.
07:53 Many were in circumstances that they would not have chosen.
07:57 Yet, they did not let their circumstances
08:00 or their past define them.
08:03 They joyfully did what they could
08:06 within the limits of their situation.
08:09 And these are just a few examples.
08:11 There are many others in the Bible.
08:14 Why not make it a personal study project
08:17 to research faithful ones
08:19 who were in circumstances  similar to yours?
08:22 How did they stay involved  in Jehovah’s work?
08:25 We are sure  that you will be greatly encouraged.
08:33 Now,  we’ve considered examples of those
08:36 who did not let  their circumstances hinder them
08:40 from giving their all to Jehovah.
08:42 But another question is:
08:44 How does Jehovah  view his faithful servants
08:48 despite their limitations?
08:50 Now, I’ve often thought  about the example of John the Baptizer.
08:54 As we know, he was arrested  shortly after Jesus started his ministry.
08:59 John could have felt
09:01 that he was no longer of use  to Jehovah or the work.
09:05 Yet, as recorded at Matthew 11:11,
09:09 Jesus said about John:
09:11 “Among those born of women,
09:13 there has not been raised up  anyone greater than John the Baptist.”
09:18 Jehovah’s and Jesus’ view of John
09:20 was not based  on the man’s circumstances
09:23 of being in prison.
09:25 Their view of John was based on who he was on the inside
09:29 and on his relationship with Jehovah.
09:32 Jehovah did not focus on the limitations.
09:35 In Jehovah’s eyes,  John was great.
09:39 He was still a faithful servant  doing the best that he could,
09:42 and that was all that really mattered.
09:46 Another example  that may come to your mind
09:49 is that of King David.
09:51 As we know,  King David committed serious sins.
09:55 Yet,  David repented for his sins,
09:57 and there is no record that he repeated them.
10:01 How did Jehovah view him?
10:04 Did Jehovah see David as damaged,
10:07 as a man who would always be limited in serving him?
10:11 Notice Jehovah’s words  directed to King Jeroboam
10:16 at 1 Kings 14:8:
10:20 “But you have not become  like my servant David,
10:24 “who kept my commandments
10:26 “and who walked after me  with all his heart,
10:29 doing only what was right in my eyes.”
10:32 Jehovah viewed David  as a special servant.
10:35 He says that he  “kept my commandments.”
10:38 He did  “what was right in my eyes.”
10:41 That’s what Jehovah remembered.
10:44 How encouraging that is for us!
10:47 If we have repented  of our past mistakes
10:49 and set matters straight  to the best of our circumstances,
10:53 we too can be assured  that Jehovah loves us dearly.
10:58 He appreciates whatever we can do  in our worship of him.
11:03 So, what’s the point?
11:05 Well, our past  or our present circumstances
11:09 do not define our value before Jehovah.
11:13 Our Father loves us for who we are,
11:17 and he values our efforts
11:19 as we do the best  that we can to serve him.
11:22 Why do you think it is important
11:25 that we strive to see ourselves  as Jehovah does?
11:29 Because we can weaken,  discourage, or limit ourselves
11:34 if we see ourselves only  in the framework of our circumstances.
11:39 May we work hard not to do that.
11:43 What does Jehovah see
11:45 when he looks  at his faithful servants today?
11:49 Well, turn, please,  to 1 Samuel 16:7.
11:54 And the setting is  that Samuel was about to go
11:57 to anoint the next king of Israel;
11:59 and he goes to the house of Jesse;  and Jesse lines up all of his sons,
12:02 except for David, who is still out in the field;
12:05 and Samuel walks in  and he sees Eliab.
12:08 And based on what he sees,
12:11 Samuel concludes that this surely must be
12:14 the next king of Israel.
12:16 Yet, note what Jehovah saw.
12:18 Please read with me 1 Samuel 16:7:
12:23 “But Jehovah said to Samuel:
12:26 “‘Do not pay attention  to his appearance and how tall he is,
12:31 “‘for I have rejected him.
12:33 “‘For the way man sees is not the way God sees,
12:38 “‘because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,
12:41 but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”
12:45 That’s the way Jehovah sees.
12:48 He does not look  at our outward appearance and our abilities;
12:51 he sees into our hearts.
12:53 He sees what we would be doing
12:54 if all of the limitations  were lifted off of us.
12:57 Why, just the fact  that we keep going,
12:59 that we keep putting  one foot in front of the other,
13:03 endears us to Jehovah.
13:06 We understand the truth  of that statement,
13:09 and we all may agree
13:11 that this is how  Jehovah views his people.
13:14 However, we may have  a hard time convincing ourselves
13:19 if this really applies to me.
13:22 Have you ever wondered:  ‘Does Jehovah really see me?
13:26 ‘Does he see what’s in my heart
13:28 and value my desire to do more for him?’
13:32 The answer is yes.
13:34 In fact, Jehovah has already seen  what is in your heart.
13:39 Think about this:
13:41 Why are you watching this program?
13:44 Why do you care about spiritual things?
13:47 Why are you, perhaps,  the only one in your family
13:50 who is a dedicated,  baptized servant of Jehovah?
13:53 Or why are you, perhaps,  the only one at your place of employment
13:56 or the only one near where you live  who’s serving Jehovah?
14:00 Is it because you are  so much more studious
14:03 or smarter than everyone else?
14:05 No!
14:07 Haggai 2:7 tells us
14:10 that Jehovah  “will shake all the nations,
14:14 and the precious things  of all the nations will come in.”
14:17 John 6:44 says
14:21 that ‘no man can come to Jesus
14:24 unless the Father draws him.’
14:28 Jeremiah 31:3, Jehovah says:
14:32 “I have loved you with an everlasting love.
14:36 That is why I have drawn you.”
14:39 So again, why are you serving Jehovah?
14:43 Because Jehovah loves you.
14:45 Jehovah drew you.
14:47 As he was shaking the nations,
14:49 he looked down into your heart  and he saw something very precious
14:53 and he drew you to him.
14:55 He said,  “I want to draw this person to my Son.
14:57 “I want to draw this person to me.
15:00 I love this person.”
15:03 Jehovah drew you,
15:05 not because you have perfect circumstances,
15:08 but because of your heart and because he loves you.
15:12 He greatly appreciates  that his servants give their best to him.
15:20 Remember,  not the way man sees is the way God sees
15:25 —Jehovah sees what the heart is.
15:27 May we work hard to see ourselves as Jehovah does
15:32 and be determined to never give up.
15:35 May we never forget that it is the privilege of bearing Jehovah’s name,
15:40 having a relationship with him,
15:42 and our love for Jehovah that defines us.
15:45 Jehovah is happy  if we give the best that we can.
15:49 So may we do our part
15:52 by not limiting ourselves  due to our circumstances,
15:55 but always look for ways  to give our best to Jehovah.
15:59 You beautiful older ones,
16:02 even those with severe health problems,
16:04 can do much to help  in the great work that’s taking place today.
16:07 Now, you may wonder  what can you do.
16:09 You can pray for your brothers and sisters.
16:11 We need your prayers.
16:13 Pray for the Governing Body.
16:15 Pray for those who are taking the lead.
16:17 Pray for the elders in your congregations.
16:19 Pray for those who  are going through difficult times.
16:23 Do such prayers help  the work of the organization?
16:26 Absolutely!
16:28 James 5:16 tells us
16:31 that ‘a righteous person’s supplication
16:34 has a powerful effect.’
16:36 No matter who we are  and whatever our situation in life,
16:41 may we find joy  in giving what we can for Jehovah.
16:46 And may each one of us  rejoice at the privilege we have
16:50 of being part of what Jehovah  is accomplishing in these last days.

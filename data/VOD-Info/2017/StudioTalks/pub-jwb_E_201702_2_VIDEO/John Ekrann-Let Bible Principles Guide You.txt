00:02 You and I make a lot of decisions every day.
00:04 Now, some have a little impact on our lives;
00:07 others have a very big impact.
00:10 And we can appreciate that we can make
00:12 choices and decisions for ourselves.
00:15 Think of how life would be  if you made no decisions for yourself
00:18 —someone tells you when to go to bed,
00:21 they pick out your clothes,
00:23 and they tell you what to do for work.
00:25 Well, none of us would like that!
00:27 Jehovah gave each of us free will,
00:31 and that’s the precious gift
00:33 of making choices for ourselves.
00:35 Now, have you ever thought  about why Jehovah gave us this gift?
00:39 I mean,  why trust us with free will
00:41 when he knew that we could make  bad choices or decisions?
00:45 Well, one powerful reason is love.
00:49 The only way to give us the gift of love
00:52 is also to give us the gift of free will.
00:55 The two are tied together.
00:57 You really can’t have  one without the other.
01:00 For example,  if I programmed my computer
01:03 to give me a message  every day at 2:00 p.m.:
01:06 “John, I love you.  I think you’re a wonderful guy,”
01:09 I think there’d be a little something  wrong with me if I thought:
01:12 ‘Aw, isn’t that nice?  My computer, it loves me.’
01:16 Yeah, love only exists
01:18 if it comes truly  from a free-will expression.
01:23 Now, did Jehovah place  any boundaries on free will?
01:27 Yes.
01:29 They were stated in the Law  to the nation of Israel.
01:31 And Jesus later repeated them
01:34 at Matthew 22:37-40:
01:40 “He said to him:
01:42 “‘“You must love Jehovah your God  with your whole heart
01:46 “‘“and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.”
01:49 “‘This is the greatest and first commandment.
01:52 “‘The second, like it, is this:
01:55 “‘“You must love your neighbor as yourself.”
01:58 “‘On these two commandments
02:00 the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.’”
02:04 So our use of free will
02:07 has love of God and love of neighbor
02:10 as its boundaries.
02:12 Notice, for example,
02:14 what people are doing  in this picture,
02:16 both inside the circle boundary  and outside.
02:21 See, free will allows us to do
02:23 any of the things  we see in the picture.
02:25 But love of God  and love of neighbor
02:28 move us to reject  what’s outside the circle
02:31 and choose  to do the kinds of things
02:33 that we see inside the circle.
02:36 Now, to stay  within those boundaries,
02:39 Jehovah gave us  a marvelous brain
02:41 and a built-in conscience,
02:43 but he also knows  we need more help.
02:45 And that’s why  he also gave us Bible principles
02:48 —basic truths from the Bible
02:52 that can help us  to make good decisions.
02:54 And it can safely be said  that any decision we face
02:58 can be guided  by Bible principles.
03:01 Now, our Creator, Jehovah,  knows what’s best for us.
03:05 And he also trusts us  to make decisions
03:08 based on Bible principles
03:11 because he knows  that when we do that,
03:13 then we’re really,  truly going to be happy, content,
03:16 and at peace with him  and with others.
03:20 So in review so far:
03:22 Jehovah gave us free will
03:24 —that’s the privilege  to make choices for ourselves—
03:28 and he also gave us  Bible principles
03:31 as the boundaries  to our choices.
03:35 But making difficult decisions  requires that we train ourselves
03:40 to recognize Bible principles  and apply them.
03:44 Now let’s read Romans 12:1,
03:48 and let’s see how this verse
03:50 describes the decision-making process.
03:55 “Therefore, I appeal to you
03:58 “by the compassions of God, brothers,
04:00 “to present your bodies  as a living sacrifice,
04:03 “holy and acceptable to God,
04:06 a sacred service  with your power of reason.”
04:11 So are we using  our “power of reason”
04:16 to understand Bible principles?
04:19 For example, young children
04:21 ask lots of questions.
04:24 But has a child ever asked you:
04:26 “What happens when I drop a ball?
04:28 a pencil? a book?”
04:30 No, they don’t ask that.
04:32 They know what happens  to anything they drop.
04:35 It falls down!
04:37 See, the child doesn’t need  rules for every object
04:40 but has quickly grasped the principle.
04:43 Anything he drops falls down.
04:47 Now,  what if an 18-year-old asked you,
04:49 “What’s going to happen when I drop this pen?”
04:53 Well, it’s obvious  he’s not been paying attention
04:56 to basic principles of life.
04:59 So by us paying attention  to Bible principles,
05:10 `
05:54 06:04 06:14 
06:27 it won’t obey,
06:29 but it’ll pull  the person back from danger.
06:31 Now, it can take a year or more  of training for the dog to learn
06:35 the amazing skills  that are so helpful to a blind person.
06:39 Likewise, our raw,  untrained “power of reason”
06:44 can help us to a degree.
06:46 However, it can be amazing
06:49 if we take the time to train it.
06:52 Now, here are  three skills that we can use
06:55 to train our “power of reason.”
06:57 They are illustrating,
06:59 analyzing,
07:01 and balancing.
07:04 Now, to consider our first skill,  illustrating,
07:08 let’s use the general topic  of forgiveness.
07:13 What Bible principles  could help with forgiveness?
07:19 Please think of as many principles  and scriptures as you can.
07:41 Proverbs 12:18 says:
07:43 “The tongue of the wise is a healing”;
07:46 and Colossians 3:13 tells us
07:50 to ‘forgive one another freely.’
07:53 Now, the skill  we want to learn is illustrating
08:30 
08:54 09:06 09:28 and it can also be  quite enjoyable.
09:31 You know,  try at your family worship
09:33 to take  the principles for a topic
09:35 and see  how many similarities,
09:42 10:04 nf
10:46 Did you notice, for example,  what appears to be
10:49 a reverse order  of the steps leading to sin?
10:53 This verse works its way  from sexual immorality
10:57 back to the very roots  of the problem.
11:00 Now, let’s take each phrase  starting with the last,
11:04 “greediness, which is idolatry.”
11:08 So, sexual immorality  starts with selfishness,
11:11 greedily putting our needs  ahead of anything else.
11:24 smelling the bread and cakes  when he can’t pay for it.
11:29 Likewise,  hanging around immoral entertainment
12:43 until we’ve learned  all that we can.
12:45 And we can use  the many research tools we have
12:47 to find valuable comments  and application.
12:51 Now, let’s consider our third
12:53 and final skill: balancing.
12:56 And to do that,
12:58 let’s use a question  on the topic of alcohol.
13:02 What Bible principles  could help a couple to decide
13:06 whether to serve alcohol  at their wedding?
13:10 What principles and scriptures  do you think would help them
13:14 make a balanced decision?
13:17 Again, you’re welcome  to pause the program
13:19 if you’d like to write down  what comes to mind
13:21 or to research something.
13:24 Now, your list probably has  some of these principles.
13:28 At John 2:9,  Jesus made wine for a wedding.

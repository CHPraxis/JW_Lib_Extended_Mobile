00:02.052 --> 00:04.754
You and I make a lot of decisions every day. 


00:04.753 --> 00:07.556
Now, some have a little impact on our lives; 


00:07.557 --> 00:10.227
others have a very big impact. 


00:10.227 --> 00:12.462
And we can appreciate that we can make 


00:12.462 --> 00:15.299
choices and decisions for ourselves. 


00:15.298 --> 00:18.968
Think of how life would be 
if you made no decisions for yourself


00:18.968 --> 00:21.838
—someone tells you when to go to bed,


00:21.838 --> 00:23.840
they pick out your clothes, 


00:23.840 --> 00:25.842
and they tell you what to do for work. 


00:25.842 --> 00:27.744
Well, none of us would like that!


00:27.743 --> 00:31.313
Jehovah gave each of us free will, 


00:31.313 --> 00:33.416
and that’s the precious gift 


00:33.417 --> 00:35.919
of making choices for ourselves. 


00:35.918 --> 00:39.221
Now, have you ever thought 
about why Jehovah gave us this gift? 


00:39.222 --> 00:41.992
I mean, 
why trust us with free will 


00:41.992 --> 00:45.895
when he knew that we could make 
bad choices or decisions? 


00:45.895 --> 00:49.032
Well, one powerful reason is love. 


00:49.032 --> 00:52.235
The only way to give us the gift of love 


00:52.235 --> 00:55.172
is also to give us the gift of free will. 


00:55.172 --> 00:57.240
The two are tied together. 


00:57.240 --> 01:00.910
You really can’t have 
one without the other.


01:00.910 --> 01:03.880
For example, 
if I programmed my computer 


01:03.880 --> 01:06.348
to give me a message 
every day at 2:00 p.m.: 


01:06.348 --> 01:09.418
“John, I love you. 
I think you’re a wonderful guy,” 


01:09.418 --> 01:12.788
I think there’d be a little something 
wrong with me if I thought: 


01:12.788 --> 01:16.558
‘Aw, isn’t that nice? 
My computer, it loves me.’ 


01:16.558 --> 01:18.995
Yeah, love only exists 


01:18.995 --> 01:23.332
if it comes truly 
from a free-will expression.


01:23.332 --> 01:27.470
Now, did Jehovah place 
any boundaries on free will? 


01:27.470 --> 01:29.238
Yes. 


01:29.238 --> 01:31.975
They were stated in the Law 
to the nation of Israel. 


01:31.975 --> 01:34.643
And Jesus later repeated them 


01:34.643 --> 01:39.000
at Matthew 22:37-40: 


01:40.082 --> 01:42.652
“He said to him: 


01:42.652 --> 01:46.322
“‘“You must love Jehovah your God 
with your whole heart 


01:46.322 --> 01:49.859
“‘“and with your whole soul
and with your whole mind.”


01:49.858 --> 01:52.961
“‘This is the greatest
and first commandment.


01:52.962 --> 01:55.265
“‘The second, like it, is this: 


01:55.265 --> 01:58.267
“‘“You must love your
neighbor as yourself.”


01:58.267 --> 02:00.970
“‘On these two commandments 


02:00.970 --> 02:04.540
the whole Law hangs,
and the Prophets.’”


02:04.540 --> 02:07.443
So our use of free will 


02:07.443 --> 02:10.180
has love of God
and love of neighbor 


02:10.180 --> 02:12.182
as its boundaries.


02:12.182 --> 02:14.184
Notice, for example, 


02:14.183 --> 02:16.651
what people are doing 
in this picture, 


02:16.652 --> 02:21.657
both inside the circle boundary 
and outside. 


02:21.657 --> 02:23.727
See, free will allows us to do 


02:23.727 --> 02:25.829
any of the things 
we see in the picture. 


02:25.828 --> 02:28.865
But love of God 
and love of neighbor 


02:28.865 --> 02:31.533
move us to reject 
what’s outside the circle 


02:31.533 --> 02:33.570
and choose 
to do the kinds of things 


02:33.570 --> 02:36.038
that we see inside the circle.


02:36.038 --> 02:39.041
Now, to stay 
within those boundaries, 


02:39.042 --> 02:41.210
Jehovah gave us 
a marvelous brain 


02:41.210 --> 02:43.378
and a built-in conscience, 


02:43.378 --> 02:45.748
but he also knows 
we need more help. 


02:45.748 --> 02:48.985
And that’s why 
he also gave us Bible principles


02:48.985 --> 02:52.055
—basic truths from the Bible 


02:52.055 --> 02:54.723
that can help us 
to make good decisions. 


02:54.723 --> 02:58.360
And it can safely be said 
that any decision we face 


02:58.360 --> 03:01.697
can be guided 
by Bible principles. 


03:01.697 --> 03:04.000
Now, our Creator, Jehovah, 
knows what’s best for us. 


03:05.502 --> 03:08.839
And he also trusts us 
to make decisions 


03:08.838 --> 03:11.240
based on Bible principles 


03:11.240 --> 03:13.577
because he knows 
that when we do that, 


03:13.577 --> 03:16.947
then we’re really, 
truly going to be happy, content, 


03:16.947 --> 03:20.450
and at peace with him 
and with others.


03:20.450 --> 03:22.552
So in review so far: 


03:22.552 --> 03:24.954
Jehovah gave us free will


03:24.953 --> 03:28.423
—that’s the privilege 
to make choices for ourselves—


03:28.423 --> 03:31.860
and he also gave us 
Bible principles 


03:31.860 --> 03:35.798
as the boundaries 
to our choices. 


03:35.798 --> 03:40.336
But making difficult decisions 
requires that we train ourselves 


03:40.337 --> 03:44.674
to recognize Bible principles 
and apply them. 


03:44.673 --> 03:48.911
Now let’s read Romans 12:1, 


03:48.912 --> 03:50.980
and let’s see how this verse 


03:50.980 --> 03:55.452
describes the decision-making process. 


03:55.452 --> 03:58.454
“Therefore, I appeal to you 


03:58.453 --> 04:00.456
“by the compassions of God, brothers, 


04:00.457 --> 04:03.994
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice, 


04:03.993 --> 04:06.728
“holy and acceptable to God, 


04:06.728 --> 04:11.733
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.”


04:11.733 --> 04:16.238
So are we using 
our “power of reason” 


04:16.238 --> 04:19.575
to understand Bible principles? 


04:19.575 --> 04:21.710
For example, young children 


04:21.710 --> 04:24.113
ask lots of questions. 


04:24.113 --> 04:26.248
But has a child ever asked you: 


04:26.248 --> 04:28.416
“What happens when I drop a ball? 


04:28.417 --> 04:30.887
a pencil? a book?” 


04:30.887 --> 04:32.889
No, they don’t ask that. 


04:32.888 --> 04:35.458
They know what happens 
to anything they drop. 


04:35.458 --> 04:37.460
It falls down! 


04:37.460 --> 04:40.463
See, the child doesn’t need 
rules for every object 


04:40.463 --> 04:43.465
but has quickly grasped the principle. 


04:43.465 --> 04:46.000
Anything he drops falls down. 


04:47.137 --> 04:49.972
Now, 
what if an 18-year-old asked you, 


04:49.972 --> 04:53.744
“What’s going to happen
when I drop this pen?”


04:53.743 --> 04:56.878
Well, it’s obvious 
he’s not been paying attention 


04:56.878 --> 04:59.781
to basic principles of life. 


04:59.782 --> 05:03.687
So by us paying attention 
to Bible principles, 


05:10.158 --> 05:12.395
`

05:54.337 --> 05:56.505


06:04.713 --> 06:06.948


06:14.957 --> 06:17.427


06:27.103 --> 06:29.105
it won’t obey, 


06:29.105 --> 06:31.973
but it’ll pull 
the person back from danger. 


06:31.973 --> 06:35.845
Now, it can take a year or more 
of training for the dog to learn 


06:35.845 --> 06:39.948
the amazing skills 
that are so helpful to a blind person.


06:39.948 --> 06:44.086
Likewise, our raw, 
untrained “power of reason” 


06:44.087 --> 06:46.122
can help us to a degree. 


06:46.122 --> 06:49.159
However, it can be amazing 


06:49.158 --> 06:52.161
if we take the time to train it. 


06:52.162 --> 06:55.164
Now, here are 
three skills that we can use 


06:55.163 --> 06:57.166
to train our “power of reason.” 


06:57.167 --> 06:59.502
They are illustrating, 


06:59.502 --> 07:01.504
analyzing, 


07:01.503 --> 07:04.173
and balancing. 


07:04.173 --> 07:08.076
Now, to consider our first skill, 
illustrating, 


07:08.077 --> 07:13.149
let’s use the general topic 
of forgiveness.


07:13.148 --> 07:18.000
What Bible principles 
could help with forgiveness? 


07:19.288 --> 07:23.491
Please think of as many principles 
and scriptures as you can. 


07:41.443 --> 07:43.913
Proverbs 12:18 says: 


07:43.913 --> 07:46.915
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”; 


07:46.915 --> 07:50.418
and Colossians 3:13 tells us 


07:50.418 --> 07:53.788
to ‘forgive one another freely.’


07:53.788 --> 07:56.958
Now, the skill 
we want to learn is illustrating


08:30.893 --> 08:34.730


08:54.350 --> 08:58.853


09:06.562 --> 09:09.432


09:28.783 --> 09:31.020
and it can also be 
quite enjoyable. 


09:31.020 --> 09:33.122
You know, 
try at your family worship 


09:33.122 --> 09:35.592
to take 
the principles for a topic 


09:35.592 --> 09:37.894
and see 
how many similarities, 


09:42.998 --> 09:46.068


10:04.320 --> 10:07.188
nf

10:46.062 --> 10:49.065
Did you notice, for example, 
what appears to be 


10:49.065 --> 10:53.902
a reverse order 
of the steps leading to sin? 


10:53.902 --> 10:57.640
This verse works its way 
from sexual immorality 


10:57.640 --> 11:00.242
back to the very roots 
of the problem.


11:00.242 --> 11:04.514
Now, let’s take each phrase 
starting with the last, 


11:04.513 --> 11:08.350
“greediness, which is idolatry.” 


11:08.350 --> 11:11.553
So, sexual immorality 
starts with selfishness, 


11:11.553 --> 11:15.056
greedily putting our needs 
ahead of anything else. 


11:24.967 --> 11:29.472
smelling the bread and cakes 
when he can’t pay for it. 


11:29.472 --> 11:32.842
Likewise, 
hanging around immoral entertainment 


12:43.412 --> 12:45.580
until we’ve learned 
all that we can. 


12:45.580 --> 12:47.917
And we can use 
the many research tools we have 


12:47.917 --> 12:50.000
to find valuable comments 
and application.


12:51.820 --> 12:53.788
Now, let’s consider our third 


12:53.788 --> 12:56.925
and final skill: balancing. 


12:56.925 --> 12:58.927
And to do that, 


12:58.927 --> 13:02.465
let’s use a question 
on the topic of alcohol.


13:02.465 --> 13:06.702
What Bible principles 
could help a couple to decide 


13:06.702 --> 13:10.305
whether to serve alcohol 
at their wedding? 


13:10.305 --> 13:14.075
What principles and scriptures 
do you think would help them 


13:14.075 --> 13:17.178
make a balanced decision? 


13:17.178 --> 13:19.481
Again, you’re welcome 
to pause the program 


13:19.482 --> 13:21.850
if you’d like to write down 
what comes to mind 


13:21.850 --> 13:24.653
or to research something. 


13:24.653 --> 13:28.523
Now, your list probably has 
some of these principles. 


13:28.523 --> 13:33.361
At John 2:9, 
Jesus made wine for a wedding. 


14:26.882 --> 14:29.719

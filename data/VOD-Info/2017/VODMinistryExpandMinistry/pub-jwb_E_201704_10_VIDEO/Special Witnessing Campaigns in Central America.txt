00:09 Since the 1980’s,
00:11 the Central America branch  has been organizing
00:14 special preaching campaigns to seldom-worked territories
00:18 and unassigned territories —both here in Mexico
00:20 and also throughout all of Central America.
00:22 Matter of fact, in the last campaign,
00:24 we had 13,000 regular pioneers
00:28 assigned to over 900 congregations
00:31 and in some areas where  there weren’t even congregations,
00:34 for example, in El Salvador.
00:37 When we were assigned here,
00:39 we were told that there were no Witnesses,
00:40 no Bible studies, and no publishers.
00:43 This is the second meeting  that we’ve had the public talk,
00:46 and today we had 12 new ones attend.
00:50 Well, since we’re in a rural area,
00:52 you have to do a lot of walking.
00:54 We’ve had to deal with the cows
00:56 and other smaller creatures, like ticks.
00:59 Eight or nine brothers
01:01 were staying in one house,
01:03 so they had to get up super early
01:06 —sometimes at four in the morning—
01:08 just to get ready on time.
01:11 The brothers who come on these campaigns
01:13 come resolved to help the congregation.
01:17 They’re really enthusiastic
01:19 about the ministry, and it’s contagious.
01:22 We’ve found many studies  and many return visits.
01:25 We just don’t have enough time  to care for them all.
01:27 Some of the publishers are assigned
01:29 to areas where the congregations  are small or they’re isolated.
01:33 For example, here in Mexico  there was a group
01:36 of willing, energetic pioneers  that were assigned to an area,
01:40 and it just injected life  into the local publishers,
01:43 and even the entire congregation benefited.
01:47 We could see that the congregation
01:49 really blossomed in showing
01:50 hospitality, generosity, and love.
01:53 It made the congregation more united,
01:56 and we could tell they were happier.
01:59 They encourage me
02:02 and make me want to preach more.
02:05 At one point, we were surrounded by people;
02:08 they were so spiritually starved
02:10 that they were just asking us  for publications.
02:12 It always seems that the ones  that go on these campaigns
02:17 never forget the experiences  that they’ve had.
02:20 The brothers in Costa Rica  are going to share their stories with us.
02:24 I remember one sister
02:26 who said she had to sell bread
02:28 and other products for an entire year
02:30 just to be able to come  and serve in our congregation.
02:34 On one occasion, we preached to a lady  who had ten children.
02:38 It really moved me when she showed up
02:40 at the Kingdom Hall  with all of her ten children.
02:43 The effort I make has even motivated
02:45 my mom to renew her Bible study
02:47 and get to know more about Jehovah.
02:50 In fact, there were some territories
02:53 that we hadn’t preached in for four years
02:56 because they are so far away.
02:57 But thanks to these brothers
02:59 and the effort they made,  we were able to cover
03:01 all of our congregation’s territory.
03:04 Wow!  I’m really happy
03:07 because just seeing the brothers here  gives me strength to keep going.
03:10 We met a young woman  who had been praying all week
03:13 because she wanted to get to know God better.
03:15 She was going through a really tough time.
03:17 So when we showed her one of our tracts
03:19 and she saw that it was based on the Bible,
03:20 she burst into tears.
03:22 She realized it was  the answer to her prayers.
03:26 In Panama,  the brothers and sisters have seen
03:28 the results of their hard work and effort.
03:31 Second Corinthians 9:6 says,
03:33 ‘those that sow bountifully  will reap bountifully.’
03:37 And they’ve seen  the truthfulness of those words.
03:40 My family has benefited.
03:42 For example, my daughter  got baptized
03:43 at the last assembly,  and I’ve been encouraged as well.
03:46 Now I’m a regular pioneer.
03:49 It generates a real pioneer spirit  in the congregation
03:52 and that spurs the brothers on  to greater activity.
03:55 Some even want to fill out  auxiliary pioneer applications.
03:59 When you come on a campaign like this,
04:01 something enjoyable is
04:02 that people you didn’t even know before
04:04 become your closest friends.
04:06 My relationship with Jehovah  has gotten stronger.
04:09 I’ve seen how he never abandons me.
04:13 For many, these campaigns are a life-altering  or life-changing experience.
04:20 All the work  that the brothers and sisters
04:22 put forth is worth it
04:24 when they see the gratitude  and the appreciation
04:27 of their Bible students.
04:29 And Nicaragua is a country
04:31 where people show  that gratefulness for spiritual things.
04:36 We spoke with a farmer on one occasion.
04:39 And farmers in Nicaragua  do not make very much,
04:41 but he was so appreciative  of the publications we had placed with him
04:45 that he gave us a sum  that could possibly amount
04:48 to a good fourth or a third  of his daily wages.
04:52 Anyone who has the opportunity  to go on these campaigns
04:54 —they would not regret it.
04:56 They would have amazing experiences.
04:58 I’ve done it myself.
04:59 And these experiences
05:01 —these wonderful opportunities  that one would have
05:03 to preach on these campaigns—
05:05 would be remembered  for the rest of their lives.

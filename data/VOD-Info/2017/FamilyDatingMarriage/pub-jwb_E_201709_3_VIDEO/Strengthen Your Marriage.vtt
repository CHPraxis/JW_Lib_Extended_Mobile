00:08.862 --> 00:12.000
We do have good friends 
in our congregation, 


00:14.452 --> 00:17.000
but there is so much work!


00:27.172 --> 00:30.000
Why is Jessica so upset? 


00:31.260 --> 00:36.223
OK, maybe I should’ve asked 
before turning down that dinner invite, 


00:36.223 --> 00:39.476
but she knows how busy I am. 


00:39.477 --> 00:42.605
I’ve got elder’s meetings, work, 


00:42.605 --> 00:45.000
pioneering. 


00:48.277 --> 00:52.000
But she just says 
we never do anything fun anymore.


00:58.328 --> 01:01.248
Maybe she’s right. 


01:01.248 --> 01:05.876
Sometimes even when we’re together, 


01:05.877 --> 01:09.000
we’re not really together.


01:25.982 --> 01:29.000
Our lives are filled 
with spiritual activities 


01:36.450 --> 01:41.000
but our family worship 
hasn’t exactly been regular.


01:52.048 --> 01:54.593
Maybe I fooled myself 
into thinking 


01:54.593 --> 01:57.261
that because we’re busy 
doing things for Jehovah,


01:57.262 --> 02:01.000
it’s OK to skip it sometimes.


02:10.317 --> 02:14.000
We argued again tonight 


02:15.530 --> 02:18.283
and then went to bed angry


02:18.283 --> 02:22.000
—something we said we’d never do.


02:42.725 --> 02:46.728
The next morning 
I told Jessica how sorry I was, 


02:46.728 --> 02:49.940
and she admitted 
that she felt bad too. 


02:49.940 --> 02:53.110
We decided to research 
Ephesians chapter 4 


02:53.110 --> 02:55.112
that night for family worship. 


02:55.112 --> 02:57.114
One article mentioned: 


02:57.113 --> 03:00.783
“How sad it would be 
if marriage mates spoke to each other 


03:00.783 --> 03:03.245
with less respect than . . . 
total strangers!”


03:03.245 --> 03:07.498
That really struck us. 


03:07.498 --> 03:11.000
Then we read 
Ephesians 4:31, 32: 


03:12.462 --> 03:15.924
“Put away from yourselves 
every kind of malicious bitterness, 


03:15.923 --> 03:19.365
“anger, wrath, screaming, 
and abusive speech, 


03:19.365 --> 03:21.472
“as well as everything injurious. 


03:21.472 --> 03:24.642
“But become kind to one another, 


03:24.642 --> 03:28.187
“tenderly compassionate, 
freely forgiving one another 


03:28.187 --> 03:32.000
just as God also by Christ 
freely forgave you.”


03:33.650 --> 03:37.320
We both promised to work 
on making our words and tone 


03:37.320 --> 03:40.782
more loving and kind. 


03:40.782 --> 03:44.745
We also studied the Bible accounts
of Aquila and Priscilla, 


03:44.745 --> 03:46.955
who were a beautiful example 
of what it means 


03:46.955 --> 03:49.625
for a married couple 
to be “one flesh.” 


03:49.625 --> 03:53.337
They were together at home, 
at work, 


03:53.337 --> 03:56.000
and in the ministry.


04:05.182 --> 04:10.000
That’s when we realized 
we needed to draw closer as a couple.


04:18.862 --> 04:21.000
Since then, 
we do as much as we can together.


04:31.375 --> 04:34.000
We’re still busy 
in spiritual activities, 


04:36.003 --> 04:40.000
but they’re never an excuse 
to neglect our relationship.


04:42.593 --> 04:47.306
And now we aren’t just marriage mates; 


04:47.307 --> 05:06.807
we’re once again best friends.

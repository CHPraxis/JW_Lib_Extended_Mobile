00:00.783 --> 00:04.620
Well, 100 classes ago, 


00:04.620 --> 00:07.990
in September of 1966, 


00:07.990 --> 00:11.227
the 42nd class of Gilead graduated. 


00:11.227 --> 00:13.229
Here’s their picture. 


00:13.228 --> 00:16.900
Now, if you look carefully 
back in the left corner, 


00:16.900 --> 00:18.902
you’ll see a young man 


00:18.902 --> 00:21.404
who graduated on that day. 


00:21.403 --> 00:26.408
That is our beloved Brother David Splane. 


00:26.408 --> 00:30.046
And so it seemed appropriate 
to mention this occasion, 


00:30.047 --> 00:32.949
being that it’s 100 classes ago. 


00:32.948 --> 00:35.000
I did say classes, not years. 


00:38.187 --> 00:42.192
We’re now looking forward 
to hearing from our dear Brother Splane. 


00:42.192 --> 00:44.360
He is going to give us the talk 


00:44.360 --> 00:48.000
“Don’t Forget the Purpose.”


00:49.132 --> 00:53.637
I’m glad they didn’t get ahold 
of my baby picture. 


00:53.637 --> 00:56.000
That was my baby picture.


01:01.077 --> 01:06.082
Well, I know 
that all of you students will agree 


01:06.082 --> 01:08.885
that Gilead School 


01:08.885 --> 01:11.687
has been a marvelous expression 


01:11.687 --> 01:15.392
of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness


01:15.392 --> 01:18.060
—a dream come true. 


01:18.060 --> 01:21.932
But, really, 
all of us have been recipients 


01:21.932 --> 01:24.767
of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness 
in so many ways. 


01:24.767 --> 01:28.905
All of us have received 
training in so many ways. 


01:28.905 --> 01:30.973
So, really, the apostle Paul’s words 


01:30.973 --> 01:35.378
recorded at 2 Corinthians chapter 6 
can apply to all of us. 


01:35.378 --> 01:40.000
Let’s look it up
—2 Corinthians chapter 6. 


01:42.252 --> 01:46.522
We’re going to read verses 1 and 2


01:46.522 --> 01:51.560
—2 Corinthians 6:1, 2. 


01:51.560 --> 01:53.663
And here Paul writes: 


01:53.663 --> 01:57.300
“Working together with him, 


01:57.300 --> 01:59.502
“we also urge you 


01:59.502 --> 02:03.540
“not to accept 
the undeserved kindness of God 


02:03.540 --> 02:06.408
and miss its purpose.” 


02:06.408 --> 02:09.845
That’s the theme of the talk, 
“Don’t Forget the Purpose.” 


02:09.845 --> 02:11.882
And then verse 2 says: 


02:11.882 --> 02:13.584
“For he says: 


02:13.583 --> 02:16.820
“‘In an acceptable time I heard you, 


02:16.820 --> 02:20.157
and in a day of salvation I helped you.’


02:20.157 --> 02:25.060
“Look! 
Now is the especially acceptable time. 


02:25.060 --> 02:31.100
Look! 
Now is the day of salvation.”


02:31.100 --> 02:34.570
Now, let’s focus first of all 
on the first words 


02:34.570 --> 02:39.000
that Paul writes here, 
“working together with him.” 


02:40.810 --> 02:45.000
That really explains 
why Paul’s ministry was such a success. 


02:46.315 --> 02:51.988
Now, Paul was a worker, 
but it wasn’t enough to be a worker. 


02:51.988 --> 02:54.556
Paul’s ministry was successful 


02:54.557 --> 02:59.395
because Paul was working 
together with Jehovah God. 


02:59.395 --> 03:03.298
It was Jehovah’s purpose that counted. 


03:03.298 --> 03:06.768
As Brother Samuelson 
brought out this morning, 


03:06.768 --> 03:11.773
it was Jehovah’s agenda 
that counted with the apostle Paul. 


03:11.773 --> 03:15.043
Well, our goal should be the same. 


03:15.043 --> 03:18.346
And we could be tested at times. 


03:18.347 --> 03:22.252
Perhaps back home 
you’re waiting for a decision 


03:22.252 --> 03:26.522
and the decision 
is a long-time coming. 


03:26.522 --> 03:30.360
And you could be tempted to run ahead 
as we’ve heard this morning


03:30.360 --> 03:32.362
—act on your own. 


03:32.362 --> 03:34.364
You’d be working. 


03:34.363 --> 03:38.735
But when that temptation arises, 
keep repeating to yourself 


03:38.735 --> 03:41.437
“working together with him,” 


03:41.437 --> 03:44.140
“working together with him,” 


03:44.140 --> 03:46.142
and it’ll help. 


03:46.142 --> 03:48.812
It’ll help you to work within the bounds 


03:48.812 --> 03:51.314
that the organization has set. 


03:51.313 --> 03:54.450
And we heard about that 
this morning as well. 


03:54.450 --> 03:57.187
Now, notice at the beginning of verse 2, 


03:57.187 --> 04:00.524
Paul has been doing some reading. 


04:00.523 --> 04:04.026
His first words are “for he says,” 


04:04.027 --> 04:07.064
and then Paul quotes Scripture. 


04:07.063 --> 04:09.531
And it will be useful for us 


04:09.532 --> 04:13.135
to look up the scripture 
that Paul is quoting, 


04:13.135 --> 04:15.872
because it helps us 
to understand his thinking. 


04:15.872 --> 04:19.709
When Paul was reading this verse, 
or this passage, 


04:19.708 --> 04:22.078
what was it that helped him 
to make the connection 


04:22.078 --> 04:25.448
with the idea of working 
together with Jehovah? 


04:25.448 --> 04:31.000
The scripture, Isaiah 49:8, 9. 


04:32.088 --> 04:34.890
So let’s read that


04:34.890 --> 04:40.930
—Isaiah 49:8, 9. 


04:40.930 --> 04:43.498
Now, as I read this, 


04:43.498 --> 04:45.768
I’d like you to see if you can guess 


04:45.768 --> 04:48.771
when this scripture 
had its first fulfillment. 


04:48.772 --> 04:50.774
It has two fulfillments. 


04:50.773 --> 04:54.776
See if you can guess 
when the scripture was first fulfilled. 


04:54.777 --> 04:56.779
Verse 8: 


04:56.778 --> 04:59.248
“This is what Jehovah says: 


04:59.248 --> 05:01.916
“‘In a time of favor I answered you, 


05:01.917 --> 05:04.620
“‘and in a day of salvation I helped you; 


05:04.620 --> 05:08.658
“‘I kept safeguarding you 
to give you as a covenant for the people, 


05:08.658 --> 05:13.495
“‘to rehabilitate the land, 


05:13.495 --> 05:15.498
“‘to cause them to possess 


05:15.498 --> 05:20.068
“‘their desolate inheritances, 


05:20.068 --> 05:24.173
to say to the prisoners, “Come out!”’”


05:24.173 --> 05:26.175
You got it? 


05:26.175 --> 05:28.177
Sure. 


05:28.177 --> 05:30.179
This scripture was fulfilled 


05:30.178 --> 05:32.548
when the Israelites were being released 


05:32.548 --> 05:35.385
from Babylonian captivity. 


05:35.385 --> 05:37.587
We have a few hints there: 


05:37.587 --> 05:41.890
“to rehabilitate the land,” 
“desolate inheritances,” 


05:41.890 --> 05:44.993
“to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out!’” 


05:44.993 --> 05:47.163
But now, 
they were released from Babylon, 


05:47.163 --> 05:49.265
but what was the purpose? 


05:49.265 --> 05:51.267
It was twofold: 


05:51.267 --> 05:55.204
(a) to resettle Jerusalem, 


05:55.203 --> 06:00.208
and (b) to reestablish pure worship


06:00.208 --> 06:03.378
—the pure worship of Jehovah.


06:03.378 --> 06:06.648
Now, Paul is telling the Corinthians, 


06:06.648 --> 06:09.251
“We have to work together with Jehovah God.” 


06:09.252 --> 06:12.522
And he’s been reading Isaiah 49:8, 9. 


06:12.522 --> 06:14.857
What’s the connection? 


06:14.857 --> 06:17.960
Well, to rehabilitate a land 


06:17.960 --> 06:20.863
that had lain desolate for 70 years 


06:20.863 --> 06:24.666
would require a lot of work. 


06:24.667 --> 06:28.004
So those who agreed to leave Babylon 


06:28.003 --> 06:30.706
and come back to Jerusalem 


06:30.707 --> 06:33.709
would have to be hard workers, 


06:33.708 --> 06:36.578
but it wasn’t enough to be a hard worker. 


06:36.578 --> 06:40.583
To be successful, they would have 
to be working along with Jehovah God, 


06:40.583 --> 06:44.653
because Jehovah God had a purpose 
in bringing them back to Babylon. 


06:44.653 --> 06:48.656
It wasn’t just so that they 
could come back to Jerusalem. 


06:48.657 --> 06:53.395
His purpose was to get 
his pure worship reestablished. 


06:53.395 --> 06:56.765
So they were going to have 
to work together with him.


06:56.765 --> 07:00.135
Now, as The Watchtower pointed out recently, 


07:00.135 --> 07:02.972
it would be a sacrifice on the part of some 


07:02.972 --> 07:06.142
to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem. 


07:06.142 --> 07:08.144
Why? 


07:08.143 --> 07:10.980
Well, do you remember what Jehovah 
had told the Israelites, 


07:10.980 --> 07:13.248
the Jews, 
when they went to Babylon? 


07:13.248 --> 07:15.585
“Build houses and live in them. 


07:15.585 --> 07:17.787
Plant gardens and eat their fruit.” 


07:17.787 --> 07:19.789
Pray for the peace of the city 


07:19.788 --> 07:22.325
because “in its peace you will have peace.” 


07:22.325 --> 07:25.528
So life in Babylon, 
captivity in Babylon, 


07:25.528 --> 07:29.031
wasn’t totally like slavery in Egypt. 


07:29.032 --> 07:33.135
In fact, some Jews got rich in Babylon. 


07:33.135 --> 07:36.805
Some became buyers 
and sellers of precious gems. 


07:36.805 --> 07:39.442
And it’s thought that it was in Babylon 


07:39.442 --> 07:44.447
that the Jews learned trade and commerce
—how to buy and sell so well. 


07:44.447 --> 07:48.217
They didn’t learn that 
on the pastures of Judah; that’s for sure. 


07:48.217 --> 07:51.454
And so it would’ve been 
a sacrifice on the part of some 


07:51.453 --> 07:55.290
to leave Babylon and go to Jerusalem. 


07:55.290 --> 07:58.793
Hard workers were willing to do that.


07:58.793 --> 08:02.598
Now, 
the returning Jews started out very well, 


08:02.598 --> 08:04.766
but they ran into problems. 


08:04.767 --> 08:08.704
They ran into problems 
with the building of the temple. 


08:08.703 --> 08:13.541
And as a result, 
they continued working 


08:13.542 --> 08:17.547
but they weren’t working 
together with Jehovah anymore. 


08:17.547 --> 08:20.750
They were building houses 
and decorating them; 


08:20.750 --> 08:25.287
they were starting a business; 
they were looking after their own families, 


08:25.287 --> 08:27.324
their own lives. 


08:27.323 --> 08:30.560
Now, could it be 
that some of them had reasoned: 


08:30.560 --> 08:32.928
‘I’ve sacrificed enough; 


08:32.928 --> 08:36.698
‘I’ve left a comfortable life in Babylon 
to come here 


08:36.698 --> 08:38.700
‘to this wasteland, 


08:38.700 --> 08:42.238
‘and that’s a lot more 
than my brothers in Babylon have done. 


08:42.238 --> 08:44.240
‘I’ve sacrificed enough. 


08:44.240 --> 08:48.177
‘It’s time to look after my own family, 
look after my own children. 


08:48.177 --> 08:51.180
Let the young people do their share.’ 


08:51.180 --> 08:53.815
Well, we don’t know 
what they were reasoning. 


08:53.815 --> 08:57.185
But the fact is 
that part “b” of Jehovah’s purpose


08:57.185 --> 08:59.555
—to reestablish pure worship—


08:59.555 --> 09:01.557
was not being fulfilled. 


09:01.557 --> 09:06.229
So they were not working together 
with Jehovah God. 


09:06.228 --> 09:08.496
The application: 


09:08.497 --> 09:12.100
All of you have made considerable sacrifices 


09:12.100 --> 09:14.603
in order to go to your present assignments. 


09:14.603 --> 09:18.173
Most of you were not born 
in your assignments; 


09:18.173 --> 09:20.843
you went there of your own volition. 


09:20.843 --> 09:22.845
And you made a lot of sacrifices. 


09:22.845 --> 09:24.847
You learned another language; 


09:24.847 --> 09:28.884
you made financial, material sacrifices; 
and so on. 


09:28.883 --> 09:31.220
But, you know, there’s a danger. 


09:31.220 --> 09:35.892
As we get older, 
there can be a tendency for us to feel: 


09:35.892 --> 09:38.027
‘You know, I’ve sacrificed enough. 


09:38.027 --> 09:41.264
Why not let the young people do more?’


09:41.263 --> 09:46.168
—especially when we see those 
our own age who are taking it easy. 


09:46.168 --> 09:48.170
‘They’ll be in the new world. 


09:48.170 --> 09:50.405
Why do I have to work so hard?’ 


09:50.405 --> 09:52.408
And so if we’re not careful, 


09:52.408 --> 09:55.745
we could lose sight 
of the purpose of our training, 


09:55.745 --> 09:57.747
and we don’t want to do that.


09:57.747 --> 10:01.750
Now, there’s a second application 
to Isaiah 49, 


10:01.750 --> 10:06.722
and we know that because of the way 
Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 6. 


10:06.722 --> 10:09.192
Let’s go back there, 2 Corinthians 6. 


10:09.192 --> 10:11.194
And you can leave your Bibles open there 


10:11.193 --> 10:13.228
because for the rest of this discussion 


10:13.228 --> 10:17.766
we’re going to be considering 
verses in 2 Corinthians 6. 


10:17.767 --> 10:20.102
Now, I’m going to read verse 2, 


10:20.102 --> 10:23.105
and see if you can figure out how we know 


10:23.105 --> 10:27.275
that Paul sees more than one application 


10:27.275 --> 10:29.812
to this scripture at Isaiah 49. 


10:29.812 --> 10:31.814
Verse 2: 


10:31.813 --> 10:33.815
“For he says: 


10:33.815 --> 10:38.553
“‘In an acceptable time I heard you, 


10:38.553 --> 10:43.291
and in a day of salvation I helped you.’ 


10:43.292 --> 10:44.794
“Look! 


10:44.793 --> 10:48.796
“Now is [not acceptable, but] 


10:48.797 --> 10:51.567
“the especially acceptable time. 


10:51.567 --> 10:52.602
“Look! 


10:52.602 --> 10:57.607
Now is the day of salvation.”


10:57.607 --> 10:59.975
You got it, didn’t you? 


10:59.975 --> 11:03.578
The definite and indefinite articles. 


11:03.578 --> 11:05.580
And when Paul is thinking 


11:05.580 --> 11:08.583
about the deliverance 
of the Jews from Babylon, 


11:08.583 --> 11:11.686
quoting Jehovah God, 
it’s “an acceptable time”; 


11:11.687 --> 11:13.689
it’s “a day of salvation.” 


11:13.688 --> 11:16.358
That was one application of the prophecy. 


11:16.358 --> 11:20.863
But now Paul is telling the Christians 
that there’s something much better: 


11:20.863 --> 11:24.733
“Now is the especially acceptable time . . . 


11:24.733 --> 11:27.235
Now is the day of salvation.” 


11:27.235 --> 11:30.138
Yes, when the Jews 
were delivered from Babylon, 


11:30.138 --> 11:33.741
pure worship was going 
to be reestablished. 


11:33.742 --> 11:34.844
But what about today? 


11:34.843 --> 11:38.146
What about the work 
Christians are doing today? 


11:38.147 --> 11:41.684
The everlasting future of people is involved. 


11:41.683 --> 11:44.720
And so if workers were needed back then, 


11:44.720 --> 11:47.657
when the Jews were leaving Babylon, 


11:47.657 --> 11:50.392
how hard should we be working today? 


11:50.392 --> 11:54.530
The lives of people are at stake, 


11:54.530 --> 11:58.267
and so no matter how busy you are, 


11:58.267 --> 12:01.337
no matter whether you are at Bethel, 


12:01.337 --> 12:03.772
don’t neglect the field. 


12:03.772 --> 12:06.875
Have a zealous share in the preaching work. 


12:06.875 --> 12:10.312
This is the work 
that Jesus commanded us to do. 


12:10.312 --> 12:14.317
Jesus never spent a day at Bethel. 


12:14.317 --> 12:17.654
He’ll be very interested 
in what you do at Bethel, 


12:17.653 --> 12:21.990
but he’ll be even more interested 
in what you’re doing in the field.


12:21.990 --> 12:25.193
Now, let’s focus 
on Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. 


12:25.193 --> 12:27.061
We talk about the undeserved kindness 


12:27.062 --> 12:31.834
of being able to come to Gilead 
and get this special training. 


12:31.833 --> 12:34.303
But, now, what was the purpose? 


12:34.303 --> 12:37.506
Why were you selected 


12:37.507 --> 12:41.044
to come to Gilead 
and get this training? 


12:41.043 --> 12:45.915
Well, 
you’re probably wondering that yourselves. 


12:45.915 --> 12:47.983
You were selected, first of all, 


12:47.983 --> 12:50.920
because you’re workers; 
you’re hard workers. 


12:50.920 --> 12:53.788
But you were also chosen 
because we believe 


12:53.788 --> 12:57.425
that you are going to use 
your training unselfishly 


12:57.425 --> 12:59.695
for the benefit of others. 


12:59.695 --> 13:04.267
And how many speakers 
on this platform today have made that point? 


13:04.267 --> 13:07.504
The training is not 
to be kept to yourselves. 


13:07.503 --> 13:09.505
You’ve been trained 


13:09.505 --> 13:13.775
so that you 
can unselfishly benefit other people. 


13:13.775 --> 13:16.945
You have been trained 
to be more effective 


13:16.945 --> 13:19.782
in serving others.


13:19.782 --> 13:22.284
Now, when you return home, 


13:22.283 --> 13:25.086
we know that your friends 
and fellow workers 


13:25.087 --> 13:27.122
are going to be very pleased. 


13:27.122 --> 13:29.492
Your humility


13:29.492 --> 13:32.260
—you’re not going 
to be flashing your diploma 


13:32.260 --> 13:36.498
either literally or figuratively; 


13:36.498 --> 13:38.966
you’re not going 
to be flaunting your knowledge; 


13:38.967 --> 13:43.605
you’re not going to be correcting 
every small mistake and procedure. 


13:43.605 --> 13:46.108
You’re going to earn the respect 


13:46.108 --> 13:48.543
of your fellow workers 
because of your humility 


13:48.543 --> 13:51.046
and because of your willingness 
to work alongside them 


13:51.047 --> 13:53.549
and to do whatever needs to be done. 


13:53.548 --> 13:57.753
In fact, 
the most powerful lesson that you teach 


13:57.753 --> 14:00.923
may not be in anything you say, 


14:00.923 --> 14:03.425
but it may be in your humility 


14:03.425 --> 14:07.763
and your willingness to work humbly 
along with any arrangement 


14:07.763 --> 14:10.231
or any assignment that is given you. 


14:10.232 --> 14:12.969
In this you’ll be copying Paul’s example. 


14:12.968 --> 14:16.405
If you’ve kept your Bible open 
at 2 Corinthians 6, 


14:16.405 --> 14:19.575
we’re going to be reading 
a few more verses. 


14:19.575 --> 14:23.278
Now, Paul mentions a lot 
in verses 4 to 6. 


14:23.278 --> 14:26.848
A lot is involved in humbly serving 


14:26.848 --> 14:28.850
the needs of our brothers. 


14:28.850 --> 14:32.053
And we’re going 
to just highlight a few of these. 


14:32.053 --> 14:35.390
Verses 4 to 6, Paul writes: 


14:35.390 --> 14:40.395
“But in every way we recommend 
ourselves as God’s ministers, 


14:40.395 --> 14:44.933
“by the endurance of much, 


14:44.933 --> 14:48.570
“by tribulations, by times of need, 


14:48.570 --> 14:50.572
“by difficulties, 


14:50.572 --> 14:53.942
“by beatings, 
by imprisonments, by riots, 


14:53.942 --> 14:56.779
“by hard work, 


14:56.778 --> 15:00.215
“by sleepless nights, 
by times without food; 


15:00.215 --> 15:03.352
“by purity, by knowledge, 


15:03.352 --> 15:06.689
“by patience, by kindness, 


15:06.688 --> 15:09.425
by holy spirit.”


15:09.425 --> 15:11.427
Now, look at verse 4. 


15:11.427 --> 15:14.797
One of the things 
Paul mentions is “endurance.” 


15:14.797 --> 15:19.067
“We recommend ourselves 
as God’s ministers, by . . . endurance.” 


15:19.067 --> 15:22.872
Now, that’s something 
all of us need to give attention to. 


15:22.872 --> 15:27.109
Suppose that you were serving 
at Bethel before Gilead, 


15:27.108 --> 15:31.280
and you really, really enjoyed 
your work assignment. 


15:31.280 --> 15:35.550
Well, you’ve been away for five months. 


15:35.550 --> 15:39.722
What do you suppose 
has been happening while you were away? 


15:39.722 --> 15:43.125
Someone else got that work assignment. 


15:43.125 --> 15:45.293
And you know what? 


15:45.293 --> 15:49.230
He’s doing very, very well 
at that assignment. 


15:49.230 --> 15:52.668
In fact, 
it may be that the department 


15:52.668 --> 15:56.538
is not going to want to have 
you back when you return. 


15:56.538 --> 15:59.173
And so you’re given another assignment, 


15:59.173 --> 16:02.010
one that you don’t enjoy so much. 


16:02.010 --> 16:06.548
Now, someone else might say, 
“I’ve been trained at Gilead for this?” 


16:06.548 --> 16:08.583
But not you, 


16:08.583 --> 16:10.585
you’re going to have the attitude, 


16:10.585 --> 16:14.288
‘Well, if the work needs to be done, 
why shouldn’t I do it?’ 


16:14.288 --> 16:18.093
You see, your humility 
is going to be so appreciated. 


16:18.093 --> 16:22.163
And remember, 
other Bethelites are watching you. 


16:22.163 --> 16:24.165
They’re intelligent. 


16:24.165 --> 16:28.070
They know that you’d have probably liked 
to have had your old job back, 


16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
but your humility 


16:30.072 --> 16:33.342
in cheerfully applying yourself 
to whatever you’re given to do 


16:33.342 --> 16:35.744
is going to make 
a tremendous impression on them. 


16:35.743 --> 16:37.178
In fact, you know what? 


16:37.178 --> 16:41.383
You’re going to go up ten points 
in their estimation. 


16:41.383 --> 16:44.185
“Well,” you say, 
“all right, I have to do it, 


16:44.185 --> 16:47.690
but do I really have to be 
cheerful about it?” 


16:47.690 --> 16:49.692
Yes, you do. 


16:49.692 --> 16:51.927
That’s a requirement. 


16:51.927 --> 16:53.929
And you know why? 


16:53.928 --> 16:56.565
At the regional convention last summer, 


16:56.565 --> 16:59.602
do you remember 
the definition of endurance? 


16:59.602 --> 17:03.939
It’s not just a matter of sticking it out 
until something better comes along. 


17:03.938 --> 17:06.275
But we have to be cheerful; 


17:06.275 --> 17:08.343
we have to do 
what we’re asked to do 


17:08.343 --> 17:11.680
with a happy, positive attitude


17:11.680 --> 17:15.083
—not always looking 
for additional responsibility, 


17:15.083 --> 17:18.120
more privileges, 
a different work assignment—


17:18.120 --> 17:23.125
being happy 
with what we are given to do. 


17:23.125 --> 17:27.797
Well, you folks understand that, 
and we love you for it.


17:27.797 --> 17:32.802
Now, in the same verse, verse 4, 
Paul mentions “difficulties.” 


17:32.802 --> 17:34.970
And there will be problems 
in the field; 


17:34.970 --> 17:37.472
there’ll be problems 
at Bethel from time to time. 


17:37.472 --> 17:40.842
And the question is this, 
Will you be the type of person 


17:40.842 --> 17:44.279
that fellow Bethelites 
or those in the congregation 


17:44.278 --> 17:47.381
will want to talk to 
when difficulties arise, 


17:47.382 --> 17:49.985
because whenever they talk to you, 


17:49.985 --> 17:52.220
they always feel better after? 


17:52.220 --> 17:55.090
You have such a good, positive attitude. 


17:55.090 --> 17:57.425
Well, we know you will. 


17:57.425 --> 18:01.397
Now, in verse 5, 
Paul mentions “hard work.” 


18:01.397 --> 18:04.967
When brothers and sisters 
get together for a gathering, 


18:04.967 --> 18:08.204
we know that you’re going to be 
one of the ones in the kitchen 


18:08.203 --> 18:13.008
or one of the ones who 
stays behind after to help clean up. 


18:13.008 --> 18:17.011
You’re going to be volunteering 
to help clean the Kingdom Hall, 


18:17.012 --> 18:20.282
or you’re going to volunteer 
for a local construction project. 


18:20.282 --> 18:25.154
You’re going to be known 
as someone who enjoys serving others, 


18:25.153 --> 18:28.990
someone who loves 
to get his hands dirty


18:28.990 --> 18:32.360
—not someone who shows up 
in a lovely white suit 


18:32.360 --> 18:34.563
when there’s work to be done. 


18:34.563 --> 18:38.666
Or if you have to wear 
a lovely white suit, 


18:38.667 --> 18:41.069
at least bring a change of clothes 


18:41.068 --> 18:44.740
so that you can roll up your sleeves 
and help with the work. 


18:44.740 --> 18:49.043
Well, notice in verse 6, 
Paul mentions “purity.” 


18:49.043 --> 18:51.580
We would certainly never want to think 


18:51.580 --> 18:56.050
that as long as we work hard 
in our assignment at Bethel or in the field, 


18:56.050 --> 19:01.657
Jehovah will turn a blind eye 
to any immorality on our part. 


19:01.657 --> 19:06.362
Jehovah has no blind eye.


19:06.362 --> 19:10.365
Now, Paul mentions 
“kindness” in the same verse. 


19:10.365 --> 19:14.368
Now, some of you brothers 
may get into a position of authority. 


19:14.368 --> 19:16.405
And the question is, 


19:16.405 --> 19:19.575
How are you going to use your authority? 


19:19.575 --> 19:24.580
The proper use of authority 
is to help others, 


19:24.580 --> 19:26.748
to benefit others. 


19:26.748 --> 19:29.183
And you will never ever 


19:29.183 --> 19:32.820
use your authority vindictively 
to punish someone 


19:32.820 --> 19:35.423
or get even for some slight, 


19:35.423 --> 19:38.526
perhaps holding someone back 
from a deserved privilege 


19:38.527 --> 19:40.562
just because he offended you. 


19:40.562 --> 19:43.732
That’s not the way we use authority. 


19:43.732 --> 19:47.904
In the same verse, 
Paul talks about “holy spirit.” 


19:47.903 --> 19:51.138
And that’s going to help you 
to get along with others. 


19:51.138 --> 19:54.241
It’ll help elders and department heads 


19:54.242 --> 19:57.012
to work peacefully with one another, 


19:57.012 --> 20:00.149
to speak kindly and respectfully 
to one another, 


20:00.148 --> 20:02.650
to listen
—to really listen—


20:02.650 --> 20:04.653
to one another. 


20:04.653 --> 20:06.655
Now, you may have a little difference 


20:06.655 --> 20:09.223
with someone 
in the congregation or at Bethel. 


20:09.223 --> 20:13.128
Then you hear that person 
give a morning worship comment 


20:13.128 --> 20:17.298
or a fine public talk in the congregation, 


20:17.298 --> 20:22.136
and his eyes shine 
as he’s talking about the truth. 


20:22.137 --> 20:25.974
You’re sitting there, 
you observe that, 


20:25.973 --> 20:29.176
and it hits you that this man


20:29.177 --> 20:31.680
—this man that I’m having a problem with—


20:31.680 --> 20:35.517
really, really loves Jehovah; 


20:35.517 --> 20:37.519
and so do you. 


20:37.518 --> 20:39.520
You have that in common. 


20:39.520 --> 20:43.425
So now, 
can’t you get the rest to work?


20:43.425 --> 20:45.927
Now, if we walk by the spirit, 


20:45.927 --> 20:49.430
as we heard from Brother Samuelson, 


20:49.430 --> 20:54.002
we’ll be careful not to lobby 
or push our own agenda, 


20:54.002 --> 20:57.572
because Jehovah 
might not agree with our agenda. 


20:57.572 --> 21:01.577
And we’d never want to make 
the other elders or the department feel 


21:01.577 --> 21:06.147
that they can’t make 
any decision without our input. 


21:06.147 --> 21:10.285
We would never want them 
to feel that in our absence 


21:10.285 --> 21:13.755
we would have to go back and revisit 
every decision that has been made, 


21:13.755 --> 21:17.192
as if they can’t do a single thing 
without us because we’re so clever


21:17.192 --> 21:19.194
—we’ve graduated from Gilead. 


21:19.193 --> 21:23.731
No, we realize that they 
have Jehovah’s spirit too. 


21:23.732 --> 21:28.737
So don’t be too impressed 
with your own ideas. 


21:28.737 --> 21:30.972
I’m going to repeat that. 


21:30.972 --> 21:35.710
Don’t be too impressed 
with your own ideas. 


21:35.710 --> 21:38.513
When no Scriptural principle is involved, 


21:38.513 --> 21:40.648
we’ll be willing to yield 


21:40.648 --> 21:42.683
if the majority of the elders make a decision 


21:42.683 --> 21:45.153
that we don’t particularly agree with. 


21:45.153 --> 21:47.388
So when that happens, don’t pout


21:47.388 --> 21:49.390
—pray! 


21:49.390 --> 21:53.162
Ask Jehovah to bless 
the decision that was made, 


21:53.162 --> 21:56.365
you know, the decision 
that you didn’t particularly agree with. 


21:56.365 --> 21:58.633
Ask Jehovah to bless that decision, 


21:58.633 --> 22:03.638
and ask Jehovah to help you 
to be fully supportive of the decision


22:03.638 --> 22:07.408
—and that way you’ll be working 
along with Jehovah’s purpose. 


22:07.408 --> 22:09.410
And what’s his purpose? 


22:09.410 --> 22:11.413
To have a happy group of elders 


22:11.413 --> 22:13.948
serving the needs 
of their brothers and sisters. 


22:13.948 --> 22:15.950
If the elders are happy, 


22:15.950 --> 22:20.522
no doubt the congregation 
and the Bethel family will be happy. 


22:20.522 --> 22:25.527
Be resolved to allow nothing and no one 


22:25.527 --> 22:30.032
to interfere with your unity 
on the body of elders. 


22:30.032 --> 22:32.034
I’m going to repeat that. 


22:32.033 --> 22:36.705
Be resolved to allow nothing or no one 


22:36.705 --> 22:42.443
to interfere with your unity 
on the body of elders.


22:42.443 --> 22:45.113
Well, you know all these things. 


22:45.113 --> 22:48.383
These were just helpful reminders. 


22:48.383 --> 22:53.388
Your time at Gilead 
has been a dream come true, 


22:53.388 --> 22:56.056
but now it’s time to use your training 


22:56.057 --> 22:58.727
to be of service to others. 


22:58.727 --> 23:02.564
Remember, 
you have been trained for a purpose. 


23:02.563 --> 23:04.565
And the purpose: 


23:04.565 --> 23:09.237
to be more effective 
in unselfishly serving others. 


23:09.237 --> 23:14.242
Never ever forget the purpose. 


23:14.242 --> 23:17.000
And may God bless you.


23:38.933 --> 23:40.935
Well, we sincerely thank you, 
Brother Splane, 


23:40.935 --> 23:45.473
for those words of wisdom 
spoken from experience. 


23:45.473 --> 23:48.276
Well, now we’re privileged 
to hear greetings 


23:48.277 --> 23:50.745
from our brothers and sisters 
at many different branches 


23:50.745 --> 23:52.847
who are thinking 
about us here today. 


23:52.847 --> 23:54.917
In fact, 
can you imagine, 


23:54.917 --> 23:58.287
25 different branches 
have sent greetings. 


23:58.287 --> 24:00.689
So let me just share 
a few of these with you. 


24:00.688 --> 24:02.156
Of course, 
we can’t share all of them, 


24:02.157 --> 24:05.760
but perhaps I can just epitomize 
some of the messages.


24:05.760 --> 24:08.597
For example, Armenia says: 


24:08.597 --> 24:13.169
“We are delighted to see how Jehovah 
is training more brothers and sisters 


24:13.168 --> 24:15.470
“to take on additional responsibilities 


24:15.470 --> 24:18.673
in his organization 
for the advancement of Kingdom interests.”


24:18.673 --> 24:19.941
Benin says: 


24:19.942 --> 24:21.777
“We know that the Gilead School has left 


24:21.777 --> 24:24.445
“an indelible impression on your mind


24:24.445 --> 24:27.415
“—with memories 
you’ll carry along all your life—


24:27.415 --> 24:29.417
“and on your heart


24:29.417 --> 24:31.620
“—with a deeper appreciation and joy 


24:31.620 --> 24:35.357
in serving Jehovah 
in a closer relationship with him.”


24:35.357 --> 24:36.525
Bulgaria says: 


24:36.525 --> 24:40.362
“We wish all of you 
much joy on this special day. 


24:40.362 --> 24:45.367
“Bulgaria branch keenly anticipates 
the arrival of one couple from this class. 


24:45.367 --> 24:48.304
“We pray for Jehovah’s blessing 
on you students 


24:48.303 --> 24:51.205
wherever he asks you to serve him.”


24:51.205 --> 24:53.375
Italy said: 


24:53.375 --> 24:58.280
“‘With what will I repay Jehovah 
for all the good he has done for me?’ 


24:58.280 --> 25:01.115
“We are sure 
that these words well describe 


25:01.115 --> 25:04.752
“the feelings of you students 
of the 142nd class. 


25:04.752 --> 25:07.489
“We rejoice with you in this special occasion 


25:07.488 --> 25:11.693
“and give thanks to Jehovah 
for the spiritual enrichment you enjoyed. 


25:11.693 --> 25:14.996
“We are confident it will be 
of great value to yourselves 


25:14.997 --> 25:18.334
“and to the ones you’ll be sharing 
it with in the days to come. 


25:18.333 --> 25:21.001
“Please receive 
the warmest brotherly affection 


25:21.002 --> 25:23.004
of the brothers in Italy.”


25:23.003 --> 25:26.040
And finally, 
Kazakhstan wrote and said: 


25:26.040 --> 25:29.577
“We would like to take this opportunity 
to pass our love and greetings 


25:29.577 --> 25:34.082
“to the 142nd class of Gilead 
on this graduation day. 


25:34.082 --> 25:38.119
“We are confident that they 
will never forget these past five months 


25:38.118 --> 25:41.455
“as they have walked 
hand in hand with our God, Jehovah, 


25:41.455 --> 25:45.127
“journeying page by page 
through his Word, the Bible. 


25:45.127 --> 25:49.030
Our thoughts and prayers 
are with them on this momentous day.” 


25:49.030 --> 25:52.000
Isn’t that wonderful?


26:00.275 --> 26:03.845
Well, now, we know that many of you 
like to hear the statistics about the class. 


26:03.845 --> 26:08.417
So let me share with you some 
of the details about this class—the 142nd. 


26:08.417 --> 26:11.820
So the class was made up 
of nine single brothers 


26:11.820 --> 26:14.188
and four single sisters. 


26:14.188 --> 26:16.190
The average age 


26:16.190 --> 26:19.860
of the students was 44.2. 


26:19.860 --> 26:23.432
The average years in the truth was 28, 


26:23.432 --> 26:28.370
and the average years 
in the full-time ministry was 21.6. 


26:28.370 --> 26:31.505
So, obviously, a very mature class. 


26:31.505 --> 26:34.875
What a pleasure it’s been 
to have them here at Patterson!


26:34.875 --> 26:39.313
Well, now we’re ready 
for the presentation of the diplomas. 


26:39.313 --> 26:41.916
The part that we 
always look forward to so much. 


26:41.917 --> 26:45.420
And Brother Ken Flodin, 
a helper to the Teaching Committee, 


26:45.420 --> 26:48.990
is going to assist me 
in presenting them.


26:48.990 --> 26:52.000
We have Brother and Sister Ajiboye. 
They’ll be returning to Russia.


27:00.902 --> 27:05.000

27:12.513 --> 27:18.000

And now we have 
Brother and Sister Hoffmann.


28:26.187 --> 28:28.355
Now, Brother and Sister Hoffmann 


28:28.355 --> 28:31.692
have been serving 
in the circuit work in France, 


28:31.692 --> 28:34.429
but they’re receiving 
a new assignment today. 


28:34.428 --> 28:36.563
As some of you may know, 


28:36.563 --> 28:40.535
the Service Committee 
has set up some language circuits 


28:40.535 --> 28:42.670
that span all of Europe 


28:42.670 --> 28:46.440
in order to try to move 
different languages fields ahead. 


28:46.440 --> 28:48.777
And so Brother Hoffmann will be taking up 


28:48.777 --> 28:50.979
a circuit in the Romany field 


28:50.978 --> 28:54.000
that will span several countries in Europe.

Sister Huber has been serving 
as a special pioneer in Paraguay, 


29:07.862 --> 29:11.900
but now she is going to take up 
a field missionary assignment 


29:11.900 --> 29:15.170
in a country where 
there is a great need for missionaries


29:15.170 --> 29:18.000
—the United States.


29:25.747 --> 29:27.749

29:29.917 --> 29:32.087

But now he’s going 
to take up a new assignment 


29:34.655 --> 29:37.000

He’s returning to Burundi.


31:11.418 --> 31:13.420
Brother and Sister Palonen.


31:13.420 --> 31:15.690
Now, 
Brother and Sister Palonen have been serving 


31:15.690 --> 31:18.158
for some years 
at the branch office in Finland, 


31:18.158 --> 31:20.261
but now they’re receiving a new assignment 


31:20.262 --> 31:24.000

a new assignment 


32:02.937 --> 32:05.000
in the branch office in Benin.


32:12.380 --> 32:15.650
And this is our last couple, 
Brother and Sister Wikner. 


32:15.650 --> 32:18.000
They’re returning to Scandinavia.


32:29.897 --> 32:33.434
Now that all of our students 
have officially graduated, 


32:33.433 --> 32:35.470
would you like to see now 


32:35.470 --> 32:40.000
the 142nd class 
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?


33:14.708 --> 33:20.000
Brother Sebastian Hoffmann 
has been selected to read the class letter.


33:27.022 --> 33:30.825
“Dear Governing Body and Bethel Family: 


33:30.825 --> 33:34.528
“In one 
of the most beautiful inspired expressions 


33:34.528 --> 33:36.896
“of praise to Jehovah, 


33:36.897 --> 33:39.567
“King David of old said: 


33:39.567 --> 33:43.337
“‘And now, O our God, we thank you 


33:43.337 --> 33:46.374
and praise your beautiful name.’ 
(1 Chron. 29:13) 


33:46.373 --> 33:50.110
“With those words, 
at the close of his 40-year reign, 


33:50.110 --> 33:54.115
“David expressed 
his lifelong feelings for Jehovah. 


33:54.115 --> 33:58.887
“And here we are, 
the 142nd class of Gilead, 


33:58.887 --> 34:02.890
“at the close 
of our 20-week course of Bible education, 


34:02.890 --> 34:06.060
“with those very same feelings. 


34:06.060 --> 34:10.297
“As we have submitted to Jehovah’s molding 
of our hearts and minds, 


34:10.297 --> 34:13.467
“we have come to appreciate more than ever 


34:13.467 --> 34:17.539
“the beauty 
of the oldest personality in the universe


34:17.538 --> 34:19.740
“—Jehovah’s personality. 


34:19.740 --> 34:24.412
“We have chosen it 
to be our own new personality.


34:24.412 --> 34:28.817
“We have deeply appreciated 
being taught by you, 


34:28.817 --> 34:31.585
“members of the Governing Body. 


34:31.585 --> 34:35.122
“Despite your busy and demanding schedules, 


34:35.122 --> 34:37.492
“you made time to travel to Patterson 


34:37.492 --> 34:42.497
“to share with us your love 
for Jehovah’s name and for his Word. 


34:42.497 --> 34:46.067
“We heard it in your expressions, 
and we saw it 


34:46.067 --> 34:48.069
“in your eyes. 


34:48.068 --> 34:52.373
“The way you welcomed us 
into your beautiful new home in Warwick 


34:52.373 --> 34:56.776
“and gave us of your time 
will live long in our memory. 


34:56.777 --> 35:01.782
“You strengthened our trust 
and respect for Jehovah’s organization. 


35:01.782 --> 35:05.854
“Our prayer is that Jehovah give you brothers 


35:05.853 --> 35:09.223
“the holy spirit and energy you need 


35:09.223 --> 35:14.228
“to carry out your assignments 
as the end draws near.


35:14.228 --> 35:16.596
“Throughout our schooling, 


35:16.597 --> 35:20.769
“we felt the power of God’s Word 
at work in us students. 


35:20.768 --> 35:23.736
“The Bible has proven to be a mirror 


35:23.737 --> 35:27.007
“in which we have examined ourselves. 


35:27.007 --> 35:30.077
“You, our dear instructors, 


35:30.077 --> 35:34.149
“held that mirror up 
in front of us every day. 


35:34.148 --> 35:37.016
“With kindness, love, 


35:37.017 --> 35:39.820
“patience, and reassurance, 


35:39.820 --> 35:44.292
“you helped us to look for attitudes, 
thoughts, and inclinations 


35:44.292 --> 35:48.795
“within ourselves that are not 
a reflection of Jehovah. 


35:48.795 --> 35:52.933
“We have come to see who we really are, 


35:52.933 --> 35:55.335
“who Jehovah wants us to be, 


35:55.335 --> 35:58.738
“and how we can bridge that gap. 


35:58.738 --> 36:02.810
“Every step of the way, 
you guided us with God’s Word 


36:02.810 --> 36:05.078
“and never your own opinion. 


36:05.078 --> 36:08.748
“What a lesson that has been to us all! 


36:08.748 --> 36:11.251
“In imitation of the apostle Paul, 


36:11.252 --> 36:14.922
“you imparted to us 
not only the good news of God 


36:14.922 --> 36:17.225
“but also your very selves, 


36:17.225 --> 36:19.893
“because we became beloved to you, 


36:19.893 --> 36:23.563
“and you have become beloved to us.
—1 Thess. 2:8.


36:23.563 --> 36:25.566
“As a class, 


36:25.567 --> 36:29.237
“we must acknowledge 
that part of the education we received 


36:29.237 --> 36:32.907
“has been outside of the Gilead classroom. 


36:32.907 --> 36:35.142
“From the very first day we arrived 


36:35.142 --> 36:37.912
“at the Patterson Educational Center, 


36:37.912 --> 36:40.380
“our education began. 


36:40.380 --> 36:43.885
“The friends at reception, our hosts, 


36:43.885 --> 36:46.253
“and the entire Bethel family 


36:46.253 --> 36:49.123
“immediately made us feel at home. 


36:49.123 --> 36:52.793
“We experienced the same love 
and brotherly affection 


36:52.793 --> 36:56.196
“when we visited Wallkill and Warwick. 


36:56.197 --> 36:58.199
“Over the last five months, 


36:58.198 --> 37:00.701
“we learned much observing you: 


37:00.702 --> 37:03.404
“how you responded to direction 


37:03.403 --> 37:07.241
“that you received 
and humbly followed through, 


37:07.242 --> 37:10.645
“how you reacted to the loss of members 


37:10.645 --> 37:13.047
“of the Bethel family in death, 


37:13.047 --> 37:15.650
“and how quick you were 


37:15.650 --> 37:19.487
“to offer comfort and assistance. 


37:19.487 --> 37:22.122
“Thank you for your constancy 


37:22.122 --> 37:25.525
“in making yourselves available for us. 


37:25.525 --> 37:29.363
“How can we ever forget 
the line of cars of Bethelites 


37:29.363 --> 37:32.231
“queuing up outside our residence building, 


37:32.232 --> 37:35.202
“ready and willing to take us to the meetings 


37:35.202 --> 37:38.039
“and in the ministry every week? 


37:38.038 --> 37:41.875
“You really went the extra mile for us.


37:41.875 --> 37:44.712
“As we leave this awesome place, 


37:44.712 --> 37:46.747
“we take with us 


37:46.747 --> 37:51.752
“an unforgettable 
and rich spiritual heritage. 


37:51.752 --> 37:54.589
“What will we do with it? 


37:54.588 --> 37:59.960
“Our determination is the same 
as that of King David. 


37:59.960 --> 38:05.000
“At Psalm 145:1, 2, 
he promised Jehovah: 


38:06.000 --> 38:09.837
“‘I will exalt you, O my God the King, 


38:09.837 --> 38:13.607
“‘I will praise your name forever and ever. 


38:13.607 --> 38:16.344
“‘All day long I will praise you; 


38:16.343 --> 38:20.046
I will praise your name forever and ever.’


38:20.047 --> 38:23.050
“May the blessing of Jehovah our God 


38:23.050 --> 38:27.455
“be upon all those 
who praise his name forever. 


38:27.455 --> 38:32.460
“With all our appreciation, 
we love you very much. 


38:32.460 --> 38:36.000
Your brothers, 
142nd class of Gilead.”


39:00.020 --> 39:04.392
We thank you very much 
for that beautiful, beautiful letter.


39:04.392 --> 39:07.294
Well, we’ve come 
to the concluding remarks 


39:07.293 --> 39:09.396
of our Gilead program. 


39:09.397 --> 39:12.299
At the beginning, 
we discussed the importance 


39:12.298 --> 39:15.468
of praying to Jehovah to open our eyes 


39:15.468 --> 39:18.038
and help us see clearly his Word. 


39:18.038 --> 39:21.508
You know, 
over time because of imperfection, 


39:21.508 --> 39:25.645
our vision tends to deteriorate. 


39:25.645 --> 39:30.617
And as a result, we may have to 
constantly be seeking a brighter light 


39:30.617 --> 39:34.222
in order for us 
to see things more clearly. 


39:34.222 --> 39:36.224
Well, in the same way, 


39:36.223 --> 39:39.360
as you will deal 
with your own imperfections, 


39:39.360 --> 39:42.797
as you’ll deal 
with the imperfections of others, 


39:42.797 --> 39:45.132
as you’ll cope with health problems 


39:45.132 --> 39:47.134
and a host of other things that will come 


39:47.133 --> 39:50.636
to all of us 
as we live in this system, 


39:50.637 --> 39:54.209
you’ll need to look back 
to God’s Word again 


39:54.208 --> 39:56.476
and again and again. 


39:56.477 --> 39:59.680
In a sense, 
to turn up the light 


39:59.680 --> 40:02.215
so that you can see clearly 


40:02.215 --> 40:07.053
what Jehovah’s will will be 
in so many areas of your life. 


40:07.053 --> 40:09.956
And at times, 
you may scratch your head and say, 


40:09.957 --> 40:13.360
“Jehovah, I just don’t know what to do.” 


40:13.360 --> 40:15.695
But if you do not tire 


40:15.695 --> 40:19.200
of returning over 
and over again to God’s Word, 


40:19.200 --> 40:21.335
he will show you the way. 


40:21.335 --> 40:23.337
And the words of Joshua chapter 1 


40:23.337 --> 40:26.107
will prove to be true in your case. 


40:26.107 --> 40:29.444
Let’s read this together. 


40:29.443 --> 40:34.448
In Joshua 1:7, 


40:34.448 --> 40:37.451
this is what Jehovah said to Joshua: 


40:37.452 --> 40:41.322
“Only be courageous and very strong, 


40:41.322 --> 40:46.194
“and observe carefully the entire Law 
that Moses my servant commanded you. 


40:46.193 --> 40:51.731
“Do not deviate from it 
either to the right or to the left, 


40:51.732 --> 40:55.735
“so that you may act wisely 
wherever you go. 


40:55.735 --> 40:59.105
“This book of the Law 
should not depart from your mouth, 


40:59.105 --> 41:03.310
“and you must read it 
in an undertone day and night, 


41:03.310 --> 41:07.113
“in order to observe carefully 
all that is written in it; 


41:07.113 --> 41:11.085
“for then your way will be successful 


41:11.085 --> 41:14.422
“and then you will act wisely. 


41:14.422 --> 41:16.590
“Have I not commanded you? 


41:16.590 --> 41:19.760
“Be courageous and strong. 


41:19.760 --> 41:23.097
“Do not be struck with terror or fear, 


41:23.097 --> 41:28.735
for Jehovah your God 
is with you wherever you go.”


41:28.735 --> 41:33.173
Well, please know that the good wishes, 


41:33.173 --> 41:35.608
the hopes, the prayers 


41:35.608 --> 41:38.645
of all of us go with you today 


41:38.645 --> 41:41.515
for your success in your assignment. 


41:41.515 --> 41:46.000
And may Jehovah God 
be with you wherever you go.


42:02.770 --> 42:05.238
Well, I know you’ll want 
to know about our attendance. 


42:05.238 --> 42:07.306
We had many sites tied in today. 


42:07.307 --> 42:09.644
So here are the attendance figures. 


42:09.643 --> 42:13.280
For Canada, we had 838. 


42:13.280 --> 42:15.282
In the United States: 


42:15.282 --> 42:19.254
At Patterson, we had 3,469; 


42:19.253 --> 42:22.321
in Brooklyn, 328; 


42:22.322 --> 42:25.525
at Fishkill, 1,030; 


42:25.525 --> 42:28.862
at Wallkill, 2,502; 


42:28.862 --> 42:32.800
at Warwick, 1,571; 


42:32.800 --> 42:36.103
in Curaçao, 71; 


42:36.103 --> 42:41.108
in Florida, 
in Fort Lauderdale, 137; 


42:41.108 --> 42:44.143
in Jamaica, 14; 


42:44.143 --> 42:46.713
in Mira Loma, we’re not certain 


42:46.713 --> 42:50.083
because the program 
will not yet start for a few more minutes 


42:50.083 --> 42:52.285
(but we’ll find out in due time); 


42:52.285 --> 42:55.622
and in Puerto Rico, 149. 


42:55.622 --> 43:01.000
So that gives us a grand total of 10,109.


43:12.372 --> 43:14.775
Well, brothers, 
we’ve had a wonderful program today. 


43:14.775 --> 43:18.145
We have one last chance 
to participate in the program 


43:18.145 --> 43:22.683
by standing now 
and singing song number 150, 


43:22.683 --> 43:24.918
“Seek God for Your Deliverance.” 


43:24.918 --> 43:26.953
And then following the song, 


43:26.953 --> 43:30.656
Brother Herman van Selm, 
a helper to the Writing Committee, 


43:30.657 --> 43:32.660
will offer our concluding prayer. 


43:32.660 --> 45:58.590
That’s song 150.

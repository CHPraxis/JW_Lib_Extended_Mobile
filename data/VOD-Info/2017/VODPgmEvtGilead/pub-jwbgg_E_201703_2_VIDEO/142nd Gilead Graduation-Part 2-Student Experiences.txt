00:01 Well, now we have something exciting.
00:04 We’re pleased to feature a new part
00:07 on our Gilead program this year.
00:10 Now, they’ve made me promise  not to say another word.
00:15 So let’s enjoy this new feature together.
00:20 Thanks for coming.
00:22 Follow me.
00:22 I need to talk to Ken  about something really important.
00:24 Come on!
00:27 Come in!
00:28 Ken, I have some interesting news  I need to share with you.
00:32 It’s exciting!
00:33 I could tell by the look  on your face something is up.
00:36 It is.  It’s about the Gilead graduation program.
00:38 Oh, no!  Not a change!
00:39 Yeah, a change. But it’s so intriguing; it’s positive.
00:42 You know, the student experiences part  that we’ve had for many years?
00:46 They share their field service experiences.
00:47 I love that part.
00:48 And I do too, but the Teaching Committee  wants to broaden it out.
00:52 Look, Ken, the students  are from all over the world,
00:55 coming from various branches.
00:56 Yeah, that’s true.
00:57 They have experiences they can share,
00:58 perhaps from their own branch
01:01 or maybe something  about the Kingdom work
01:03 that is taking place  in that country.
01:05 It’s going to be exciting,  different, interesting.
01:07 I like it, but I’m wondering. . .
01:09 It’s just broadening it out.
01:11 But I’m wondering, you know,  everybody is used to that experiences format.
01:14 Mhm, I know.
01:15 What’s the format  of this new segment going to be?
01:17 You’re going to love it—a talk show!
01:18 A talk show?
01:20 A talk show.
01:20 It means, though,  you’re going to have to build a set.
01:22 You’re going to have to have lighting.
01:24 What about if they can sing
01:25 or there’s musical instruments  that they can play?
01:28 We’ll need a little spot for them  to actually perform a song.
01:31 I’m thinking, though,  if it’s going to be a show,
01:33 it’s got to have a name.
01:35 What are you thinking?  Make it unique.
01:37 OK.  “The Inside Story.”
01:40 Ken, it resonates.
01:43 Because you’re getting it —you’re getting “the inside story.”
01:45 I love it!  “The Inside Story.”
01:46 Let’s go with that.
01:47 OK.
01:48 But, Mark, we are weeks away  from Gilead graduation.
01:51 I know, we’ll have to work hard  to pull this off.
01:53 Do you think we can get  this done in time?
01:55 Let’s see.
02:25 Friends, you are in for a real treat!
02:28 I’m here with the whole class of Gilead,
02:31 and they’ve gotten together  to get better acquainted
02:33 with some of their classmates,
02:34 and we have been invited to this occasion.
02:37 You are going to meet  some lovable brothers and sisters,
02:41 and you are going to hear some exciting,
02:43 faith-strengthening experiences.
02:46 You’re also going to hear  some delightful music
02:49 because some in this class
02:50 have musical talent.
02:53 So, come with me,  and we’re going to get
02:55 “the inside story.”
02:59 Our first guest is Sister Evelyn Huber
03:03 who is a single sister in this class,
03:05 and she’s serving in Paraguay.
03:08 Evelyn, thank you so much for coming.
03:13 You were living in a neighborhood like this
03:16 in Munich, a culturally rich city.
03:20 You lived in an apartment like this
03:24 —very sleek, modern, nice.
03:27 You had a good-paying job  and you were pioneering.
03:31 How did you end up  clear around the world in Paraguay?
03:35 Yes, that was actually quite a change for me.
03:38 So there was this German Kingdom Ministry
03:41 back then in 2005
03:43 that mentioned
03:45 a large German-speaking community  in Paraguay,
03:48 and a great need  for German-speaking publishers
03:52 there in South America.
03:54 And that call—that announcement— really touched my heart.
03:57 I wanted to go there;  I wanted to serve there.
04:00 So I wrote my letter to the branch.
04:02 They invited me over,
04:04 and a few months later,  I arrived in Paraguay.
04:07 And they sent me together  with seven others
04:10 to Santa Rosa del Aguaray,
04:12 and there we started  a German activity from zero.
04:17 Now, when you got there, though,  you got a little bit of a surprise.
04:20 So we arrived in the first colony,  and I talked to a man.
04:24 And after my nice introduction,
04:26 he just looked at me  with big eyes and he said,
04:29 “Ekj kaun die nijch vestohne.”
04:31 So, “Sorry, I can’t understand you.”
04:34 And I looked at him and I said,
04:36 “I can’t understand you either.”
04:39 That was the moment  when I realized these people
04:43 —the Mennonites— they don’t speak our German.
04:46 They have their own language,  the so-called Low German.
04:50 How do you learn Low German?
04:52 There are no books that exist
04:53 for learning the language —Low German.
04:55 And we didn’t have Internet  at that time in our area in Paraguay.
05:00 So we really didn’t know how  to learn the language.
05:03 We prayed to Jehovah and we said,
05:05 “Jehovah, we really want to preach to these people.”
05:07 And an 80-year-old Mennonite man
05:10 was the answer to our prayer.
05:12 That’s him; that’s Willie.
05:15 He really wanted to study the Bible.
05:18 So we taught him the Bible,
05:20 and he taught us the language —Low German.
05:22 And he was an excellent Bible student
05:24 and also a fantastic language teacher.
05:27 Well, isn’t that amazing?
05:30 Now, I do understand, though,
05:31 that you learned a trick that helped you
05:34 to be better understood  by those Low German speakers.
05:37 We found out  that when we spoke our German
05:40 like Americans,  with an American accent. . .
05:42 Now, with an American accent.
05:44 What do you mean by that?
05:46 I’ll give you an example: “Good morning.”
05:48 In German, we would say, “Guten Morgen,”
05:50 and Americans would say,  “Guten Morgen” with the “rrr” sound.
05:53 Oh, OK.  I get it.
05:55 And they said: “Please talk to us like that.
05:57 It is so much better to understand you.”
05:59 So for quite a while,  we kept on going like that.
06:04 So the American accent r-r-really helped you.
06:10 Finally, you came to a realization
06:12 that you were beginning  to get fluent in the language.
06:15 How did that happen?
06:16 We went out again in the ministry,  and a very furious lady
06:20 —Mennonite lady— came out of her house.
06:23 And while she was yelling at us,  I realized, ‘Wow!
06:26 I understand every single word  that she’s saying to me!’
06:30 So I looked at my pioneer partner,  Tanya, and she looked so happy too.
06:34 And the lady thought  we couldn’t understand her.
06:38 Because you’re smiling at her.
06:39 So she repeated the whole thing again.
06:42 And that was our confirmation.
06:43 Wow!
06:44 We really understood her,  and we really understood Low German.
06:48 So with a big smile  and very happy, we left her farm.
06:51 I see.  I’m sure she was really confused.
06:55 Evelyn, could you  just kind of explain to us,
06:58 What are some  of the challenges you face
07:00 as a single sister in your territory  there in Paraguay?
07:03 Let’s go to Paraguay!
07:07 Would you join me  in traveling to a Mennonite colony?
07:10 Let’s go!
07:35 The trip takes us approximately three hours.
07:39 Now we enter the real Paraguayan roads —bright red sand—
07:44 sometimes dry and dusty
07:47 and sometimes just muddy and dirty.
07:51 There we are traveling,
07:53 having time to enjoy  Jehovah’s wonderful creation
07:57 and to think about the people  we are going to visit today.
08:07 Do you know what we especially love?
08:09 When we enter a colony
08:11 and the following happens:
08:14 Children come running out of their homes
08:17 asking for new Caleb  and Sophia videos.
08:20 Kids just love the videos,
08:23 and we are so happy  to have them now also in Low German.
08:28 Ah, now you see  what Mennonite homes look like.
08:32 They have nice houses, lovely gardens.
08:36 They all have their own farm.
08:41 It’s really a pleasure when you get  to study with the Mennonites.
08:48 It’s so encouraging  when one of your studies
08:51 progresses enough  to come to the meetings;
08:55 it takes great courage for them.
09:02 And you really have  to meet my congregation,
09:05 Santa Rosa Low German
09:07 —full of zealous pioneers and publishers.
09:18 Ah, look at them!
09:20 Here are my beloved brothers and sisters.
09:23 So good to see them all again.
09:25 They all send us their love.
09:32 That was a very touching video.
09:34 It seems like such an exciting life.
09:36 I realized how much Jehovah  can do with single sisters
09:40 —how he uses them.
09:41 And in my congregation,
09:43 there are actually  more than 50 percent of single sisters.
09:46 I see.
09:50 There’s a long heritage,  actually, for sisters going to Gilead,
09:53 serving in foreign assignments.
09:55 Jehovah really loves single sisters.
09:58 They are precious to him.
09:59 Well, that’s certainly the truth.
10:01 And we are very proud of you  and all the single sisters
10:05 and very appreciative  of the huge contribution that you’ve made
10:08 to the worldwide work  and the Kingdom efforts.
10:12 It’s amazing,  and we know Jehovah loves you.
10:16 It’s been such a pleasure  getting to know you, Evelyn.
10:18 Thank you so much for sharing  your experiences with us.
10:21 That was my pleasure.  Thank you.
10:25 Now, Evelyn,  I have one more question for you.
10:28 Were you surprised to find out
10:30 that there was  so much musical talent in your class?
10:32 Whoa!  I definitely was, uh-hu.
10:34 Well, now it’s time to get  a sample of that musical talent.
10:37 We have a band!
10:39 They’re going to perform an original song  composed by one of your classmates.
10:44 And the song is entitled  “Pronto Será Realidad.”
10:48 In English that means  “soon it will be a reality.”
10:51 Let’s listen to “Pronto Será Realidad.”
14:10 That was a great song —very touching.
14:15 Our next guest is actually  one of the band members.
14:18 Let’s welcome Brother Joel Hurley.
14:27 So, Joel, you’re serving  at the branch in Australia now.
14:31 But you have a rich heritage in the truth
14:34 given to you by your grandparents, parents.
14:37 Could you just explain  a little bit about that to us?
14:39 My grandfather actually learned the truth  from a fellow band member.
14:43 He was so impressed  with the use of God’s name
14:46 and that God’s name  was Jehovah that he made sure
14:48 that he taught the truth  to many family members.
14:51 But sometime later in 1960,
14:54 they decided as a family to move  to serve where the need was greater,
14:58 so they moved to the Pacific islands in Fiji.
15:01 So my dad grew up in Fiji.
15:03 I see.  I think we have a picture, yeah.
15:05 There’s my dad next to the car;
15:08 they’re witnessing  to the village chief and his family
15:12 —so memories of them  growing up in Fiji.
15:15 Later on, he married my mum
15:16 and they continued  to serve there for some time.
15:19 They really did have  a big impact on my early years
15:22 —preaching in the villages;
15:24 organizing special conventions;
15:26 events, such as  the Around-the-World convention.
15:29 We see Brother Franz.
15:31 So now, as a young person,  then, you decided to learn Japanese.
15:35 Why did you do that?
15:37 Well, in the early 80’s,
15:39 there was a Japanese group attached
15:41 to the Kingdom Hall where we attended,
15:43 so there was a need at the time  in that group.
15:45 In fact, many from Japan came to help out.
15:49 They encouraged me to learn Japanese,
15:51 so I began to learn the language.
15:52 So you’ve been speaking  Japanese now for how long?
15:55 Thirty-odd years.
15:56 My goodness!
15:58 Now, you went to MTS.
15:59 And after MTS graduation,
16:02 tell us about some of your assignments.
16:04 The first assignment  was with the Japanese group,
16:07 and shortly after,  it became a congregation.
16:10 A whole range of different backgrounds  came into the truth:
16:13 CEOs in Japanese companies,
16:16 young ones for the first time  who learned the truth,
16:19 and even a Buddhist monk learned the truth
16:21 and became a zealous pioneer  in the congregation.
16:24 What was your next assignment?
16:25 It was the other side of the country
16:26 —to western Australia— to a country assignment.
16:28 Western Australia,  now, is that the outback?
16:30 We’ve all heard about the outback.
16:32 Well, parts of it  are called the Golden Outback,
16:35 but there’s a lot of bushland.
16:37 There’s a large farming community —wheat, sheep.
16:39 You have a picture here  of some of the things.
16:42 In fact, there’s a variety of people
16:44 that we were able to speak to  in that territory.
16:46 You say, “a variety of people.”
16:49 I don’t see too many people in that picture.
16:52 Where did this variety come from?
16:54 Well, there were townships,  there were the farmers,
16:57 there were “bushies” —ones who live off the land—
17:00 Australian aborigines, and tourists.
17:03 Tourists?
17:04 So way out there  in rural Australia there are tourists?
17:08 What is there to see?
17:09 They’d come to visit the famous icons  in the area, for example, “Wave Rock.”
17:14 This is a natural rock formation  in the shape of a breaking wave.
17:18 In fact, one time  there was this Japanese man
17:20 who cycled across Australia  and was camping not far from the rock.
17:25 I was able to speak to him  and use my Japanese.
17:28 He was interested.
17:29 The next day, he traveled
100 or so kilometers (60 miles)
17:31 to where I was living.
17:33 I followed up the interest  and then was able
17:35 to pass it on to Japan  for further follow-up.
17:38 Was there a congregation  out there in the rural areas?
17:41 It was a small family-like congregation.
17:43 We stuck together.
17:44 I see.
17:45 So how far would they  have to drive sometimes?
17:47 Over 100 kilometers (60 miles)  in many instances,
17:50 on gravel roads—roads whereby
17:53 a mob of kangaroos  could actually come out.
17:56 So quite challenging.
17:57 Sorry, Joel,  one second, a mob of kangaroos.
17:59 What’s that?
18:00 I was wondering the same thing.  What do you mean a mob?
18:03 For example, coming home from a Bible study
18:05 at dusk one night on a dirt road,
18:07 suddenly I find  this mob of kangaroos
18:10 —10, 15 kangaroos around the car.
18:12 So you just have to be careful in those areas
18:15 to make sure you take caution at all times.
18:17 That’s quite a picture —you know, mental picture—
18:19 all of these kangaroos  bouncing around the car.
18:21 After that rural assignment,
18:23 you had some assignments  to some bigger cities
18:26 and then you did  some substitute circuit work
18:28 and then you were reassigned  to Bethel.
18:31 So at Bethel, you are back  in the Japanese congregation.
18:34 So, Joel, tell us,  what is it like being at Bethel
18:39 serving in a Japanese congregation?
18:40 Well, would you like  to have a look at a video
18:42 which explains  what our territory is like?
18:44 Of course we would.
18:50 We only have one  Japanese language congregation in Sydney,
18:53 so our territory is vast.
18:56 We typically spend long days in the ministry.
18:59 Some of us will leave early in the morning  to catch the ferry
19:03 and go to a popular tourist place  called Circular Quay.
19:06 There are many Japanese tourists here.
19:09 We’ll often find a group  of Japanese tourists
19:12 setting up to take a photo.
19:14 We might approach them and say:
19:16 “Shyashin wo torimasho ka?”
19:17 “Can I take a photo for you?”
19:19 A good conversation then begins.
19:23 The many young Japanese pioneers  still in school
19:27 may join up with us  later in the afternoon.
19:31 The interested person may hear  the message for the first time
19:36 and attend the meeting that night.
19:43 We often enjoy refreshing association
19:46 with each other in the congregation,
19:48 particularly after a long day  in the ministry.
19:51 Recently, we just had  our first pioneer school in Japanese.
19:55 They were so grateful  that they didn’t have to travel
19:58 back to Japan to attend the school.
20:02 There’s really no separation  between ministry and life.
20:07 It is life—the best life.
20:10 Kon’ichiwa!
20:17 Thank you for sharing that video.
20:19 It seems like you have  a very nice assignment there.
20:23 Now, looking back over your life,  Joel, would you have chosen
20:26 —now looking back— to do anything else?
20:28 At times there have been challenges,
20:31 whether that be loneliness or isolation
20:35 because of language or the environment.
20:38 But it’s really given me an opportunity
20:39 to rely on Jehovah God at that time
20:41 —to learn endurance.
20:43 He’s provided family,  friends wherever I’ve gone.
20:47 And to be able to sense Jehovah’s pleasure
20:50 and Jehovah’s support at these times
20:52 is something that I’m really grateful for.
20:54 Joel, this has been very pleasurable
20:57 —talking to you— and very encouraging.
20:59 Thank you for sharing  your experiences with us.
21:05 Now, Joel, it’s time  for you to go back to the piano.
21:09 Our band is going to play  another song for us.
21:12 And like the first one,  this is an original composition
21:15 written by one of your classmates.
21:18 This song is entitled  “The Promised Land.”
21:22 Let’s listen.
24:35 What a beautiful song!
24:36 What wonderful sentiments  were expressed there.
24:39 Well, we’ve been to Paraguay;
24:41 we’ve been to Australia;
24:43 now it’s time to go to Russia.
24:47 Our final guest is Brother Moses Ajiboye,  who’s serving in the Russia branch.
24:57 Back in 1988,
24:59 you were a man in your late teens  pioneering in Britain,
25:04 but somehow you ended up in Soviet Russia
25:07 pioneering in a country under ban.
25:10 How did that happen, Moses?
25:12 My pioneer partner and myself,  we were out in the ministry
25:16 and met a man who happened  to be a diplomat from Russia,
25:21 and he was interested,  and we would go back to him
25:24 and make return visits regularly.
25:26 And after a few weeks,
25:29 he asked us  if we want to go to Moscow.
25:33 He offered us, actually,
25:35 a free language scholarship  for three months.
25:38 That was back in 1988.
25:40 What happened in the meantime?
25:42 Following the three months,  during the language course,
25:45 the professor—one of the professors  who was teaching the language—
25:48 helped to upgrade my language scholarship
25:52 into a medical scholarship.
25:53 A medical scholarship?
25:54 Like a medical student.
25:56 My goodness, so now you’re going  to medical school
25:59 and you’re pioneering.
26:01 That’s right, absolutely.
26:09 But, even so, you really didn’t plan  to finish the medical degree.
26:13 But what happened?
26:15 I thought that the ban  would be lifted pretty soon
26:17 and that I would be serving  as a pioneer
26:21 in a territory where the need is great.
26:24 But, you see, the lifting  of the ban took several years.
26:28 And so you kept going to medical school?
26:30 That’s right.
26:31 Nineteen ninety-one, March 27,
26:33 could you just explain to us about that?
26:35 The ban was lifted; we are registered.
26:36 It means that we have freedom of religion,
26:39 so we cannot stay  in those private homes anymore.
26:42 I think we have a picture, yeah.
26:43 And so, yeah,  this is the first place we actually got.
26:45 It was a movie theater
26:47 in one part of Moscow that we rented,
26:50 and we read  the first letter that we got
26:54 from the organization  about the lifting of the ban.
26:57 The brother who read it,  it took him about 20 minutes
27:00 to read a one-and-a-half page letter.
27:04 Why did it take so long?
27:05 Wow, you can imagine.
27:07 Many years they were under ban,
27:10 and now the ban is lifted.
27:11 The friends cannot believe it,  even the brother himself.
27:13 There was a lot of crying and cries of joy.
27:16 And, oh, it was a touching moment.
27:18 I’ll never forget that.
27:20 How did you care  for all the new ones coming in?
27:23 By 1992, we already had  four large congregations in Moscow.
27:27 When you say large,  how many are we talking about?
27:29 Well, up to 800 publishers in each of them.
27:32 If we had enough elders,
27:33 those congregations would have split
27:35 into three, four, or even five.
27:37 We used to have, for example, book studies.
27:39 You only had a few elders.
27:41 How did you have  enough book study conductors?
27:42 We figured out that any male member  of the congregation
27:46 who gets baptized will get a book study.
27:49 We’re happy that they  made themselves available.
27:51 They were very zealous.
27:53 But some of the material we discussed  in the book study was pretty deep.
27:55 Yes.
27:56 How did they manage to teach it correctly?
27:57 We would put  all these newly baptized brothers
28:00 who conducted book studies  together on a Sunday evening
28:03 and have three to four-hour sessions  with them.
28:06 Yes, there are some of them.
28:10 These brothers are  newly baptized book study conductors.
28:13 Now, this was just one of the groups.
28:14 There were several groups like this.
28:16 Many.
28:17 My goodness.
28:18 How did you manage, even on the weekend,
28:20 to have enough speakers  for public talks and things?
28:22 Absolutely.
28:24 And in Moscow at that time,  there were only a few elders;
28:28 so we were all grouped together,
28:30 basically, into one body of elders;
28:32 and each one of us were
28:35 on a rotating list of giving public talks.
28:38 So some brothers on the weekends —Saturdays and Sundays—
28:41 we had many meetings.
28:43 They would go and give two to three talks.
28:45 Myself, because I was single,
28:48 very often gave four to five talks  every weekend.
28:51 Oh, my goodness.
28:53 Amazing!
28:55 Now, let’s take a look  at this next picture we have here.
28:59 So here we see Brother Jaracz.
29:01 This is shortly after the ban.
29:03 And can you tell us one of the things  he’s explaining to you here?
29:05 We were all in the audience,  and he told us of the importance
29:08 to go through the baptismal questions
29:11 with each one individually.
29:14 And then as we sat  in the audience, most of us said,
29:17 “Oh, how on earth are we going to do that?”
29:19 Because before that —you know, Brother Stovall—
29:21 we would put 30, 40 people together
29:24 and just go through  the questions with them
29:26 because the influx was so big;
29:28 we basically  could not handle them individually.
29:31 But Brother Jaracz  proved the point by telling us
29:34 that the Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry  book is for that purpose,
29:39 because we want  a spiritually strong organization,
29:43 not just the statistics.
29:45 We obeyed, but it was not easy  in the beginning.
29:48 So how did you do it?
29:50 I mean, how long did it take  to go through these questions
29:53 with these baptismal candidates?
29:54 Well, it took many hours  for many elders to do that.
29:57 Myself, because I was single  and young back then,
30:00 I remember occasions  where I would sit at 8:00 a.m.
30:04 with the first candidate —baptismal candidate—
30:07 and end up at 12:00 midnight.
30:09 And they would take their turns;
30:11 after work, they would come;  they were not going to miss their turn.
30:14 That was how zealous  the harvest was and the brothers were.
30:18 So let me get this straight.
30:20 So you’re pioneering;
30:21 you’re going to medical school;
30:23 you’re giving five talks on the weekend;
30:26 you’re spending three hours in sessions  with book study conductors;
30:30 you’re spending from eight to midnight  with baptismal candidates.
30:33 How did you do it?
30:34 Holy spirit.
30:37 And we were young.
30:38 When we’re young,  we think we can move mountains,
30:40 but the holy spirit was actually obvious.
30:45 The branch, then, has asked you
30:47 to come to the branch from the field.
30:50 And probably you were happy  because that would have been relief,
30:54 I think, from this schedule.
30:56 You know, to be honest Brother Stovall,
30:58 it was the opposite.
31:00 It was the harvesttime.
31:02 And, you know, to experience
31:04 the joy of what Jesus said  about the harvest
31:07 —that ‘the harvest is great  and the workers are joyous.’
31:11 Many things were happening.
31:13 People were coming in.
31:14 We were studying the Bible  with hundreds of people.
31:17 You say you’ve actually been involved
31:20 with helping hundreds of people  into the truth?
31:23 Yes, directly or indirectly sitting  and studying the Bible.
31:26 And so, I didn’t hurry to go down there.
31:29 Conventions were going on,  all these meetings.
31:32 But they tracked you down.
31:34 Oh, yes, they did.
31:37 And I was obedient  when they tracked me down
31:40 and later on apologized  for my behavior.
31:45 So, what did you do  when you went to the branch?
31:48 The branch actually wanted me to set up
31:50 the Hospital Information Desk work.
31:53 Amazing! So that medical training
31:55 really has been very valuable.
31:58 So, what is it like, then,
32:00 working with the HID in Russia?
32:04 How about if we look at a video?
32:06 It would be easier to just give you the gist
32:08 of what happens  and how that work is going on in Russia.
32:12 That would be great.
32:15 One of our sisters was told  that she needed a blood transfusion.
32:19 But the doctor said,
32:21 “They should forget about their religion
32:23 because I am like God to them.”
32:26 Incidentally, I caught a cockroach
32:29 crawling on the floor of his office.
32:33 Then I smashed the cockroach,
32:35 and I told him:  “That cockroach is dead.
32:40 “Now if you can bring it back to life,
32:43 then I believe you are a god.”
32:47 Well, he could say nothing at all.
32:51 Righteous indignation gave me the courage
32:54 to go and clear our case  with the director of the hospital.
32:57 There’s no doubt Jehovah  really was helping us.
33:02 That director became one  of our strongest advocates
33:05 in bloodless surgeries.
33:07 Later, he would even speak in our behalf
33:10 to many doctors and conferences.
33:14 Look at this beautiful little girl.
33:16 She was born with a blood condition.
33:19 It was a real fight not to give her blood.
33:23 Her case went  all the way to the European Court,
33:27 and we won the case.
33:29 There she is now, healthy and happy.
33:33 Experiences like these in the HLC work
33:37 have really touched my heart.
33:44 Moses, thank you so much  for those very encouraging experiences.
33:51 Wasn’t this just  an amazingly enjoyable occasion?
33:54 It’s been so thrilling,  so faith strengthening
33:57 to get to know these brothers  and sisters who have worked so hard,
34:01 who Jehovah has blessed  to such a degree.
34:04 Really, we wish and hope  that Jehovah blesses you
34:08 as you continue  to work hard in his service
34:10 until the next time we get together
34:12 to get “the inside story.”
34:33 Well, what did you think of the new feature?
34:46 I’m sure we’ll be seeing  more of that in the future.
34:48 We can certainly hope.
34:50 Well, now it’s time  for you to participate again.
34:53 If you can, would you please stand, and we’ll sing song number 110,
34:57 which is entitled  “The Joy of Jehovah,” song 110.

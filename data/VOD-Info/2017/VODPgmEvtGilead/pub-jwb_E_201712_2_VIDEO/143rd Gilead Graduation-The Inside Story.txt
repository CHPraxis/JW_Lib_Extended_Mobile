00:00 The next part is a video  entitled The Inside Story,
00:05 hosted by Brother Ken Stovall,
00:08 who also serves  as a Theocratic Schools instructor.
00:42 I am so excited to be with you here again
00:45 on this segment of The Inside Story!
00:48 This time we’re  with class number 143 of the Gilead School,
00:52 and you are going to meet  some adorable brothers and sisters.
00:56 And let me tell you,
00:57 they have some moving experiences  to relate to you.
01:01 And we’re going to solve  two fascinating mysteries.
01:05 And we have music.
01:06 Students in this class are going
01:08 to thrill you with their musical talent.
01:10 There is a captivating song  that they’re going to sing for you.
01:14 So come with me as we, together,
01:17 get “the inside story.”
01:23 Let’s introduce our first guest.
01:25 And that would be Saša Komaromi  from the Serbia branch.
01:37 So, Brother Komaromi,  you serve at the Serbia branch.
01:42 But you told me that some years ago,  before you were in the truth,
01:46 you discovered that there were  two main interests you had in life.
01:50 One of them had to do with a career choice.
01:52 Could you explain that?
01:54 One was music.
01:56 Music.
01:57 Now, is this a picture of you?
02:01 That was the old me.
02:04 Evidently, you were in a band.
02:07 Yes, we were at a competition at the time.
02:13 That was one of your interests,  but there was another.
02:16 What was that?
02:17 Searching for the purpose of life.
02:19 And how did you  go about searching for life’s purpose?
02:22 I read a lot of books
02:24 —books about parapsychology, Buddhism,
02:28 spiritism, Tibetan Lamaism.
02:30 Amazing!  That’s a lot of books.
02:33 Now, at the time, though,  you were dating your wife, Vicki.
02:38 What did she think of all these books?
02:40 Did she share your interest  in all this reading?
02:42 I wished she did.
02:44 But no, she did not.
02:46 To be honest, it’s not really easy
02:50 to like to read those kinds of books
02:52 —for example, The Book of the Dead.
02:55 The Book of the Dead?
02:57 I can see that’s not going  to be a very enjoyable book.
03:02 Now, was it only books?
03:04 Was that the only way  you were searching for the purpose of life?
03:07 No, I was also experimenting  with different states of mind
03:12 under the influence of drugs.
03:15 During my hallucinations,
03:18 I had many things already “solved.”
03:21 You had everything “solved.”
03:23 This is what I thought.
03:25 But after I came to myself again,
03:30 I was again in the same room  and everything was the same.
03:34 So I was really, really disappointed.
03:37 And then I prayed to God.
03:39 I said:  “God, I’m asking just for one thing.
03:43 But whatever it is, just, please,  help me to be certain that I find the truth.”
03:48 Very interesting.
03:50 So you prayed for Jehovah  to help you find the truth.
03:52 Of course,  you didn’t know Jehovah at the time.
03:55 So how was your prayer answered?
03:59 Soon after that, I went to Germany.
04:01 I had the idea to form my music studio.
04:05 During my visit there,
04:07 I understood that my uncle  and my aunt were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
04:11 And you never knew that before?
04:12 No.  No, I didn’t know.
04:14 So, what did they have in their home  that would have been really exciting to you?
04:20 As all Jehovah’s Witnesses,  they had a lot of theocratic books.
04:25 Ahh.
04:27 So, did you read the books?
04:29 Yes, I read them a lot.
04:31 Actually, I read a book daily.
04:33 Wow!
04:34 So you get back home;  you open up the suitcases.
04:38 And Vicki is there,  and she sees books.
04:42 And you were supposed  to bring home musical equipment.
04:45 What did she think about that?
04:47 She thought,  ‘Now definitely he’s totally crazy.’
04:52 So, what did you do?
04:55 I explained to her immediately  that from now on
04:59 I would like to live according to what I read  in these books and the Bible.
05:03 And I would also like it for her —that she also live like that.
05:08 If this was OK with her,  we could stay together.
05:11 If it was not OK with her,  we were finished.
05:16 You like to be direct, don’t you?
05:18 I know, I was “very tactful.”
05:22 But I also offered her  the book Young People Ask.
05:25 Did she like that?
05:26 Yes.
05:27 Yes, she liked it  much more than my ultimatum.
05:30 I see.
05:31 We started studying the Bible.
05:34 At the beginning,  my wife started because of me,
05:38 but later  she did this because of herself.
05:40 And after six months,  we became unbaptized publishers.
05:45 Then we got married,  and we were baptized in 1994.
05:51 Immediately, we started full-time service,
05:53 and we served five years  as regular pioneers
05:56 and then almost five years  as special pioneers.
06:00 And now we’ve been
13 years at the Serbia branch.
06:05 Jehovah has answered your prayer.
06:07 You’re satisfied;
06:08 you found the truth;  you found the purpose in life.
06:12 But there’s still the music.
06:15 Did you have to give up  your desire to play music,
06:19 to be involved in music,  especially since you’ve come to Bethel now?
06:23 Actually, in 2013,
06:25 there was an idea  that we should start with a project
06:29 of recording vocal renditions  of our theocratic songs.
06:34 And my wife, Violeta, and I had the privilege  to participate in that project.
06:39 Now, was this just for the Serbia branch?
06:42 No, the plan was to record the songs  in four or five languages.
06:46 Four or five languages?
06:48 But would this mean, then,  that you would travel
06:50 around to different countries  surrounding Serbia?
06:53 No, the idea was that singers
06:57 would come from other countries to Serbia,
06:59 and they would be full-time singers
07:02 for a period of time  until we finished that project.
07:05 That must have been  a tremendous amount of work.
07:07 How did you get that accomplished?
07:09 Yeah, it’s easier if we see a video,
07:12 and it will be much more understandable.
07:15 All right, good.  Let’s watch the video.
07:19 One of the first things we needed  was a recording studio.
07:25 So with the help of many, we built our own.
07:34 A typical day began  with a little music theory,
07:41 a little stretching,
07:43 and a brief review  of the song’s Scriptural theme.
07:49 Once they received a new song,
07:51 they practiced in separate groups.
07:55 Then they would all come together.
08:00 Finally, it was time to record.
08:05 This resulted in 450 songs being recorded
08:09 in a period of 22 months.
08:30 Looking back,  these songs were sung not just with words
08:34 but with hearts full of love for Jehovah.
08:44 Look at them.
08:49 Those are nice greetings at the end there.
08:51 Yeah, nice surprise.
08:52 I loved the way the chorus sounded.
08:54 You did a good job with them.
08:55 That must have been  a tremendous amount of work,
08:58 getting that all done, though,  in five different languages.
09:02 Yes, the singers did a great job  and also all the crew.
09:05 And you really could see,  all the time,
09:08 their love for Jehovah  and love for the brotherhood.
09:11 And every day you could see  a lot of their self-sacrificing spirit.
09:16 Now, Saša,  let me ask you one more question.
09:18 We saw the picture there  of you as a musician,
09:20 and I know you have  some musical talent.
09:23 Possibly, you could have become famous.
09:25 Do you ever regret not pursuing  some sort of a career in the world
09:30 as opposed to giving your life  in full-time service to Jehovah?
09:34 As you said, I could be famous.
09:36 Or I could have become  a drug addict and now be dead.
09:41 That’s a good point.
09:43 So no, no regrets at all.
09:46 I received much,  much more than I ever imagined.
09:52 And in my case,  from my first prayer till now,
09:56 Jehovah assured me  that he’s really the “Hearer of prayer,”
09:59 as the psalmist  mentioned in Psalm 65:2.
10:04 Excellent!  Thank you so much, Saša,
10:05 for sharing  these very heartfelt comments.
10:08 You’re welcome.
10:09 Thank you.
10:17 Now, you know what we’re going to do?
10:19 We’re going to give you the opportunity
10:21 to get to know some of the students
10:23 in our audience.
10:24 We’re going to do an activity
10:26 I call What’s My Favorite Scripture?
10:28 So we’re going to ask  the students if they’ll volunteer
10:31 and give us their favorite scripture and,  in a minute or less,
10:34 tell us what it says  and why it’s their favorite scripture.
10:37 OK,
10:38 let’s see now.
10:42 Who would like to go first?
10:45 Shingirai Mapfumo from Zimbabwe.
10:49 Psalm 84:11.
10:51 And what does that say?
10:53 “For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield;
10:57 “he gives favor and glory.
10:59 “Jehovah will not hold back anything good
11:02 from those walking in integrity.”
11:04 OK, so tell us,  Why is that your favorite scripture?
11:08 During the economic crisis in Zimbabwe,
11:11 my pioneer partner and I ran out of food.
11:13 We were really starving,
11:16 and physically we were so weak  that we could not even function.
11:19 Still, we managed to go to town,
11:21 hoping that we could get  some money from the bank.
11:24 There was a long queue,
11:26 and the bank  was not giving any money either.
11:29 We were so distraught.
11:31 At that moment  when we didn’t know what to do,
11:35 a truck from the branch office  brought food supplies for us.
11:40 Then it became so clear to me
11:42 that Jehovah is “a shield,”
11:44 and he never “hold[s] back anything good”  from his loyal servants.
11:48 Amazing! Well, I can see why  that’s your favorite scripture.
11:51 All right, who else?
11:53 Let’s get Sister Tšèpang Mhlongo,
11:56 and she’s from South Africa.
11:58 My favorite scripture is Psalm 68:5,
12:02 and it says about Jehovah
12:04 that he is the “father of the fatherless  and a protector of widows.”
12:08 Why is that your favorite scripture?
12:10 Well, I became motherless  when I was only one year old.
12:14 But Jehovah has provided me  with hundreds of mothers around the globe,
12:19 both black and white.
12:22 And because our Bethel work
12:25 involves traveling  all around the African continent
12:28 working with the translators,
12:30 it makes it even more precious to me
12:32 that I adopt this family wherever we go.
12:36 Truly, Jehovah has proved to be my Father
12:39 and my Protector to this day.
12:41 Hmm, very touching.
12:43 And I’m sure that all  of those parents who have adopted you
12:45 are proud to have you as a daughter.
12:49 Who else could tell us  their favorite scripture?
12:51 All right,  let’s get Brother Sylvain Bois from Benin.
12:56 It is Psalm 94:18, 19.
12:59 And what does it say?
13:01 “Your loyal love, O Jehovah,  kept supporting me.
13:05 “When anxieties overwhelmed me,
13:08 you comforted and soothed me.”
13:11 So tell us,  Why is that scripture special to you?
13:15 Years ago, when I was attending  Ministerial Training School (MTS),
13:19 I had a serious stroke  and I was hospitalized.
13:22 When I awoke from the coma,
13:25 I felt very happy because I was alive.
13:28 But also very discouraged
13:30 because I thought  everything was over for me
13:33 —pioneer service, school,
13:35 and even my dream  to one day become a missionary.
13:40 But one of the instructors  and his wife came to the hospital,
13:44 and they read me that verse.
13:46 And my heart was full of anxieties,
13:50 but I really felt that day that Jehovah
13:52 was able to comfort me and soothe me.
13:55 And you know what?
13:57 One year later,
13:59 I was permitted to again attend MTS.
14:01 And a few months later,
14:03 Jehovah fulfilled another of my dreams,
14:06 as I was assigned as a missionary in Africa.
14:09 Brother Bois, that was very touching.
14:11 Thank you so much, and we’re so glad  to have you in this class of Gilead.
14:14 Well, that’s all  that we’re going to have time for.
14:20 So now it’s time to introduce our next guest,
14:24 and that would be Brother Paulo Maganha,  and he’s from Brazil.
14:37 Now, Brother Maganha,  you’re at the Brazil branch.
14:39 But you came into the truth  at nine years old,
14:43 at the same time as your mother.
14:45 And you went to the branch,  to Bethel, in your early 20’s,
14:49 and you’ve been there for 27 years.
14:52 What department  do you work in at the branch now?
14:55 I am now in LDC for one and a half years.
14:58 LDC.
14:59 OK, would you just tell us,  What does the LDC Department do?
15:03 LDC is  the Local Design/Construction Department.
15:06 It’s responsible for the work of planning,
15:09 construction, and maintenance  of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls.
15:13 You have the LDC Department there at Bethel,
15:17 but who outside of Bethel
15:19 works with building  Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls?
15:23 Outside we have many brothers and sisters
15:26 serving as construction servants,  construction volunteers,
15:29 remote volunteers,  and field representatives.
15:33 Now, this is— This is the mystery.
15:34 This is our first mystery.
15:35 What really, then,  does a field representative do?
15:38 OK, let’s just call them field rep. OK?
15:42 OK.  Field rep, I like that.
15:43 You could say that they are the eyes  and the ears of the LDC at the branch.
15:48 But what if I show you  some pictures regarding the work?
15:51 I would love that!
15:52 OK.
15:52 At the first step, the office asks him  to investigate some congregation needs.
15:57 He meets with the local elders  and the circuit overseer
16:01 to determine the needs.
16:03 And later, he sends  a recommendation to the office.
16:06 I see. So if he has a large region,
16:08 he may have to have  many, many of these meetings
16:11 and do a lot of research to determine  what the needs are for Kingdom Halls.
16:14 Yeah.
16:15 Once the project is approved,
16:17 the next step is to search  for appropriate land, a property.
16:21 To do that,  he goes to the Internet,
16:23 consults real estate agents,  local brothers, neighbors.
16:28 To find the right property  at the right cost can be very time consuming
16:31 and requires of him  a lot of skills and abilities.
16:34 And the field rep  is also responsible for getting the permits,
16:38 the approvals, for construction.
16:40 And he visits  several different agencies every day
16:44 to get the permits to have  everything approved by the government.
16:48 In big cities, he may have to stand  in line after line after line.
16:51 This could take—
16:52 Yeah. And in bigger cities,  it can take even some weeks
16:55 or months  to get everything approved.
16:57 Finally, when everything is approved,  the construction group starts the work.
17:02 And you can see him again visiting the site
17:04 in order to give some technical support  to the construction overseer.
17:08 So, now, does he stay on the site
17:10 when a building is being built?
17:12 No, he returns to his office
17:14 but remains in contact with the group  to give some remote support.
17:18 Especially when some big issues  arise at the site,
17:22 the construction overseer  can always count on his good support.
17:26 OK, good.
17:27 I notice in this picture,  behind the field representative,
17:30 we see a sister pictured there.
17:32 Who might that be?
17:33 Well, if he’s married,
17:35 his wife can do  lots of work to help him.
17:39 But if he is not, he can count  on a local volunteer to help him.
17:43 Once the project is concluded,  he visits the site again,
17:46 now to do the commissioning
17:48 and to make sure that everything  was done according to the plans.
17:51 So, evidently, his job is done now.
17:54 No, not yet.
17:55 He’s also responsible  for giving training to local brothers
17:59 to properly maintain the building.
18:01 Wow!  So you have helped solve this mystery.
18:03 He does have a lot of work to do.
18:07 But really, does working  on one project keep him busy?
18:11 No, it is not just one, Brother Stovall.
18:13 They are very busy and productive workers.
18:16 On average, each field rep  can be working on 10 to 15 projects
18:20 in different phases but at the same time.
18:23 My goodness! That’s amazing!
18:24 So they really do  an amazing amount of work then.
18:28 Paulo, I understand that at your branch,
18:30 you’ve come up with a very innovative idea
18:34 regarding Assembly Halls and Kingdom Halls.
18:37 Could you explain that to us?
18:39 Yes, we have done what is called  an expandable Kingdom Hall.
18:43 Expandable Kingdom Hall?
18:46 Saša, do you have  expandable Kingdom Halls in Serbia?
18:49 Not that I’m aware of.
18:52 I can’t even imagine.
18:53 How do you expand a Kingdom Hall?
18:55 OK, what if we see a brief video about this?
18:58 OK, I’d like that.
19:02 At first,  it looks like a normal Kingdom Hall.
19:06 But something wonderful happens  when the back walls are lifted.
19:11 It’s now large enough to hold  an entire assembly or convention.
19:19 But before we can meet there,  it has to be cleaned.
19:23 Chairs are rented and arranged.
19:27 And audio and video equipment must be set up
19:30 so that no matter where you sit,
19:33 you won’t miss anything.
19:36 All the hard work is worth it  when you see how much the friends benefit.
19:59 When the special weekend of activity is over
20:02 and the walls are lowered,
20:04 it goes right back  to being a Kingdom Hall again.
20:26 That’s our family there.
20:28 Uh-huh.  They sent you some spirited greetings.
20:30 Yeah.
20:31 And what a brilliant way
20:33 to get the most out of a building  and save money!
20:36 Now, Brother Maganha,  I just want to ask you,
20:38 What has impressed you the most  about working with the LDC Department?
20:42 What really touched my heart  is to see the spirit of willingness to help
20:47 shown by all those involved with the LDC.
20:50 You know, these brothers  and sisters have left their families,
20:53 their houses, their friends behind
20:55 to work with these projects.
20:56 All these sacrifices are done out of love
21:00 —love for our brotherhood  and especially love for Jehovah.
21:03 That’s the reason  that I really, really appreciate their work.
21:07 Thank you, Brother Maganha.
21:09 Obviously, those brothers  and sisters that work with LDC
21:12 set a good example for the rest of us.
21:14 Thank you very much.
21:15 My pleasure.
21:21 Now, Brother Komaromi,
21:23 it’s time for you to give us  a sample of your musical talent.
21:26 Would you go and join our band?
21:33 Recently, the Governing Body  has given us loving encouragement
21:37 through our regional convention program  to never give up.
21:41 Now, the Gilead students have written a song
21:44 that goes right along with that spirit  and that theme.
21:48 It’s entitled “We’ll Never Let Go.”
24:43 I thought that was a thrilling song.
24:46 You brothers and sisters did a marvelous job on that.
24:49 And you know what I liked about the song too
24:51 is that it gets progressively more modern
24:53 as you go through the song.
24:56 So it really says to me that our organization
24:58 in its modern-day history,
25:00 even in early times, has never given up,
25:03 and we will never give up.
25:05 And it’s so joyful.
25:07 It says that we’re going to endure with joy.
25:10 No one can take that away from us.
25:11 It’s Jehovah’s gift through his holy spirit.
25:15 Now it’s time to introduce our final guest,
25:18 and that is Sister Angela Khang  from the United States.
25:32 Angela, you are one  of the single sisters in our class,
25:36 but where in the United States  do you serve?
25:39 I’m at the remote translation office (RTO)  in Sacramento, California,
25:42 and they translate into the Hmong language there.
25:44 Now, I have to confess —the Hmong language—
25:47 I never knew until very recently
25:50 that there was such a language  as the Hmong language.
25:53 And I didn’t realize  there was a Hmong people.
25:56 Why is that?
25:58 Well, for a long time, the Hmong story  was kept a secret from the American public.
26:02 Now this is another one of our mysteries
26:04 because why would it be
26:07 that someone would try to keep  the existence of a whole culture secret?
26:13 Well, during the Vietnam War,  which was a very unpopular conflict,
26:16 many U.S. citizens  didn’t want the war to expand.
26:20 So the U.S. government  actually went to Southeast Asia,
26:22 and they secretly recruited the Hmong men
26:24 who were living in the hill tribes of Laos
26:26 to fight Communism in that part of the world.
26:29 In the end, about 40,000 Hmong men  were killed in that war,
26:32 and so that’s about 1 in 4 Hmong men.
26:34 So every family lost someone.
26:36 Forty thousand men.
26:38 I don’t think that people  really are aware of that fact, are they?
26:42 No. Many historians  call that conflict the Secret War.
26:46 Looking at our monitor here,  what is it we are seeing here?
26:49 This was an exhibit  showcasing the Hmong experience
26:51 —how they came to the U.S.
26:53 And it’s a wall of unknown soldiers  who fought in the war,
26:56 and they were asking the Hmong community to identify their loved ones.
26:59 So a few in our congregation  knew some of those men.
27:02 I see.
27:04 Now,  as I think back to the history of that war,
27:06 at some point in time,  the United States pulled out of Vietnam.
27:09 So, what happened then
27:11 to the Hmong that were left there  in Vietnam when the U.S. pulled out?
27:16 It was a desperate situation  because there was an aggressive campaign
27:20 to capture and kill  any of the remaining Hmong families,
27:23 and so many of them  had to find a way to escape.
27:26 And so we see that here in this photo.
27:28 This is Long Tieng Air Base in 1975.
27:32 About 30,000 Hmong people  converged on that airport,
27:34 hoping to find a way out.
27:36 But only about 2,500 were airlifted —the more prominent officials.
27:40 I see.
27:41 You can see  that those thousands of people there
27:42 are not going  to fit on that airplane.
27:44 So all those thousands that were left behind,
27:47 what happened to them?
27:49 They were pretty much left on their own,
27:51 and they had to find their way out  along with thousands of other families.
27:55 And so that’s what happened to my family.
27:56 They found their way  across the Mekong River into Thailand,
27:59 and they were placed in refugee camps.
28:01 I see.
28:02 So who are we seeing  a picture of here now on the monitor?
28:04 This is my father  in a Thailand refugee camp
28:08 and my mother, my grandmother, and my uncle.
28:12 So your family managed to survive  by fleeing into Thailand
28:16 and getting into the refugee camp.
28:18 But then how did they get  to the United States?
28:22 In 1979,  they were sponsored to the United States.
28:25 And the Hmong culture is patriarchal,  so you stick close with your clan.
28:29 And so my entire clan ended up in California,  and they settled in South Sacramento.
28:34 I can imagine that this experience  must have been a tremendous amount of loss
28:39 for the Hmong people, Hmong families.
28:42 My father lost his mother  when they were fleeing;
28:44 he lost his brother.
28:45 He saw many people lose their lives.
28:47 Many clans were separated.
28:49 Some of their relatives ended up in France,
28:51 and the rest of them  ended up in the United States.
28:53 And then when they settled here,  my mom lost her hearing.
28:57 So it was just an added stress  in their lives.
28:59 So how did all this suffering and loss,  how did it affect your mother?
29:03 Even though her background is animist,
29:05 she knew that the Bible was a holy book  that would teach her about the Creator.
29:09 So she found comfort in reading the Bible.
29:11 And she started to collect  different Bibles from different translations
29:15 and comparing them to try  to understand what she was reading.
29:17 And every night she would pray  with me and my sister.
29:20 And so from a young age,  we were taught that God is real,
29:23 even though we didn’t know Jehovah yet.
29:26 Wow, very, very interesting.
29:28 So she was  really, really looking for the truth.
29:31 So how did she eventually find the truth?
29:34 Well, in the meantime,  my uncle (the one who was pictured earlier)
29:38 and his wife started studying the Bible,  and they came into the truth.
29:41 And they asked a sister  to come and study with my mom,
29:43 and soon my entire family was studying.
29:46 In 1996, my mom was baptized.
29:48 In 1997, my sister and I were baptized.
29:51 Amazing! So, now,  you were baptized at the age of 12,
29:55 and then you  started pioneering at the age of 15.
29:58 Yes.
29:59 Now, first of all,  you were in an English congregation.
30:01 But what changed that?
30:04 Our circuit overseer came through,  and he was telling us about a Hmong group
30:07 that had formed in our sister congregation.
30:10 And he told us we had  no reason to be in English,
30:12 and he was right.
30:14 So as a family,  we moved over to the Hmong group,
30:17 and in 1999, that group  became the very first Hmong congregation.
30:20 So that made us very happy.
30:22 So you were associated  with the very first Hmong congregation
30:25 anywhere in the world.
30:26 Yes.
30:27 Amazing!
30:29 Now, later you toured Bethel,  and that had a profound effect on you.
30:32 Can you tell us about that?
30:34 Well, we came to Bethel, and a brother in Translation Services
30:37 found out we were coming through, so he wanted to meet with us.
30:40 And he sat us girls down, and he told us,
30:43 “You have something you can give to Jehovah,  and that’s your language.”
30:47 So it really got me thinking
30:49 about what I could do  to really support the field.
30:52 So I went home, and I really worked on my language
30:55 and worked on supporting the group.
30:56 And in 2007
30:59 when Bethel came looking for translators,
31:01 this same brother came out  and he interviewed a group of us.
31:04 And shortly after that, my mom and another brother and I
31:07 were invited to serve  on the Hmong translation team
31:10 at the first RTO  here in the U.S. branch.
31:13 My goodness!
31:14 So the first Hmong congregation  anywhere in the world
31:17 and the first RTO for the U.S. branch.
31:21 Jehovah certainly has blessed you  with some wonderful privileges.
31:25 Could you just tell us,
31:26 What’s it like working  at the RTO from day to day?
31:30 Sure.  Would you like to see a video?
31:31 Yes, we would.
31:36 At the Hmong RTO,  many hands help in the translation work.
31:41 When questions come up,  we’re not left on our own.
31:44 The Translation Services Department  is always ready to provide support.
31:52 Once everything is approved,  it’s time to record.
31:56 Since Hmong wasn’t a written language  until the 1950’s,
31:59 audio publications are very important  to the Hmong field.
32:03 Some support the RTO  in other valuable ways too,
32:07 such as cooking and cleaning.
32:10 It’s the best feeling  to talk to the Hmong people
32:14 and to show them  something in their language.
32:16 You can see how it touches their heart.
32:21 As a result, we have many interested ones  attend our meetings.
32:28 As the Hmong field continues to grow,
32:31 many are learning our language  to help support the preaching work.
32:37 When we get together, we have a great time
32:40 —with good food,
32:42 association, watching the kids play.
32:46 It’s obvious to everyone in the community
32:50 that we’re not just a congregation
32:52 —we’re a family.
33:05 That is a wonderful video, really.
33:08 Angela, could you just tell us,
33:10 Why does the work done at the RTO
33:13 fill such a great need  among the Hmong people?
33:16 Well, the Hmong are a people without a country, and throughout history,
33:20 they’ve been pushed from one location to another.
33:22 They were pushed out of China in the late 1800’s,
33:25 they were pushed out of Laos,
33:26 and from there  they were scattered across the world
33:29 —to the U.S.,
33:30 to France, to Australia.
33:32 And so for many of the Hmong brothers,
33:34 they feel like a forgotten people.
33:37 Excuse me,  I watched this video for the first time here.
33:42 It’s the first time she’s seen the video.
33:44 It’s the first time.
33:46 So it’s, it’s moving.
33:48 So many of the Hmong brothers  feel like a forgotten people.
33:51 But the work at the RTO is a reminder that Jehovah hasn’t forgotten them.
33:56 In fact, he invites them
33:58 to become part of an international clan —a brotherhood.
34:01 And when they respond to that invitation,
34:04 they find something that they’ve been looking for all along.
34:07 They finally find a place
34:09 —a permanent home— under God’s Kingdom.
34:11 Thank you for those heartfelt comments.
34:13 Really, those were very nice.
34:16 Now, Sister Khang, we have a little surprise for you.
34:18 We really want the audience to know that,
34:23 well, the work done at the Hmong RTO
34:25 is not just for the United States,
34:27 but the effect reaches clear around the world
34:30 In fact,
34:31 we have caught up  with a congregation in northern Thailand.
34:35 And I know this is a surprise; we did not rehearse this.
34:39 No, we did not.
34:41 But we’re going to show you, if you’d like.
34:43 Yes.
34:44 Watch this.
35:18 Well, obviously, they are grateful for the work
35:20 you brothers and sisters do in that RTO.
35:23 Wasn’t this a thrilling occasion?
35:26 It was wonderful, enjoyable, to get to know these brothers and sisters.
35:31 We wish that Jehovah continues to bless you in your faithful service to him
35:36 until the next time we get together  on The Inside Story.
35:50 Thank you very much, Brother Stovall, for sharing with us The Inside Story.
35:55 We appreciate very much your letting us in on it.
35:59 But I have to admit that this is the first Gilead graduation
36:02 I’ve ever been to where I couldn’t help but pat my foot back there.
36:08 I’m just so glad I was behind the curtain.

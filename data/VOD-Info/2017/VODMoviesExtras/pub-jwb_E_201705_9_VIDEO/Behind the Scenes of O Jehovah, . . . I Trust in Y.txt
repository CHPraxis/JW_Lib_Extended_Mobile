00:01 Do you remember the beautiful dramas
00:03 we had at the regional convention  last year?
00:06 One of them was  about King Hezekiah.
00:09 We saw not only  the threat Jehovah’s people faced
00:13 but also the protection  Jehovah provided.
00:16 In producing the drama,
00:18 the Audio/Video Services Department  used a lot of visual effects.
00:23 Let’s go behind the scenes  and find out what the work entailed.
00:34 The goal of our visual effects team
00:37 is to take the work done  during film production and expand it.
00:41 Our work was driven by the Bible account.
00:44 The audience needed to feel
00:46 the intimidating power of the Assyrian army
00:49 while not endangering our actors.
00:51 And the use of visual effects  had the added benefit
00:54 of drastically saving donated funds.
00:58 But this meant creating hundreds   of digital arrows, war machines,
01:03 cities, tents, soldiers,
01:06 and even an Assyrian palace.
01:08 In some cases, the foreground elements
01:11 had to be separated  from the background
01:13 so digital components could be added.
01:17 This was a time-consuming process,
01:19 as many foreground elements  had to be cut out frame by frame,
01:24 24 times for each second of video.
01:28 Our research team ensured  that the world created
01:30 was as accurate as possible.
01:32 For example,
01:34 having period-correct materials  for the temple
01:36 as well as accurate stone reliefs.
01:39 After filming was complete,
01:41 the research team noted  some scenes in the treasury
01:44 were accidentally shot  showing priests wearing sandals.
01:49 As this was inaccurate,
01:51 the issue was corrected  by generating additional digital treasures
01:54 and placing them in the foreground.
01:58 As we didn’t have  the luxury of 185,000 extras,
02:02 actors were dressed in ancient costumes   and their pictures were taken.
02:07 We then used these pictures  to create digital extras,
02:10 using crowd-simulating software
02:12 to place them in the scenes  and drive their movements.
02:17 The angel shot proved to be  one of the most challenging.
02:21 The original version didn’t have  the dramatic feel needed for the scene.
02:27 So the entire sequence was recreated
02:29 to more accurately convey  the immense power
02:32 that those present must have witnessed.
02:37 Finishing this project  on schedule had many challenges.
02:41 After hearing about just a few of them,
02:44 one industry expert said
02:46 what we were attempting was impossible.
02:48 But like Hezekiah  when hearing negative reports,
02:51 we stayed positive  and relied on Jehovah.
02:54 With His help,  the film was completed on time
02:58 and is now a wonderful tool  to bring this Bible account to life.

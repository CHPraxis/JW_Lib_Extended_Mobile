00:06.588 --> 00:08.791
Observers find it difficult 


00:08.792 --> 00:11.000
even to get 
near the nimble mountain goat. 


00:15.432 --> 00:18.000
What accounts for this?


00:20.070 --> 00:23.005
Their hooves 
are designed with two toes 


00:23.005 --> 00:26.000
that can be spread wide apart.


00:37.887 --> 00:41.624
This feature enables 
mountain goats to run, jump,


00:41.623 --> 00:45.000
and feed between narrow ledges.


00:48.798 --> 00:51.300
They can maintain their footing 


00:51.300 --> 00:54.000
on a near-vertical incline. 


00:55.805 --> 00:58.542
Researchers have tried 
to apply these design features 


00:58.542 --> 01:02.000
to advanced footwear, 
with only limited success.


01:17.227 --> 01:19.529
A horse can gallop at speeds 


01:19.528 --> 01:23.000
up to 50 kilometers 
[or 30 miles] per hour.


01:24.700 --> 01:27.737
Even more impressive 
is how efficiently 


01:27.737 --> 01:29.839
the horse expends energy. 


01:29.838 --> 01:32.000
The secret is in its legs.


01:34.843 --> 01:39.581
Like a spring, 
a horse’s leg absorbs energy. 


01:39.582 --> 01:44.000
As its leg leaves the ground, 
that energy is released. 


01:45.087 --> 01:49.459
Specialized muscles 
act as shock absorbers. 


01:49.458 --> 01:52.395
Engineers are trying 
to imitate this design 


01:52.395 --> 01:55.000
but are finding it a challenge.


02:19.088 --> 02:21.790
During an eagle’s flight, 


02:21.790 --> 02:24.493
the feathers 
on the tips of its wings 


02:24.493 --> 02:27.000
are practically vertical.


02:28.565 --> 02:32.268
This configuration 
gives maximum lift 


02:32.268 --> 02:34.470
with minimum wing length. 


02:34.470 --> 02:37.840
Engineers have studied 
such soaring birds as eagles 


02:37.840 --> 02:41.743
with a view to designing 
more efficient aircraft.


02:41.743 --> 02:45.381
The introduction 
of modified wing design 


02:45.382 --> 02:47.384
that includes winglets 


02:47.383 --> 02:52.855
has improved aircraft performance 
by as much as 15 percent.


02:52.855 --> 02:56.592
Planes can now fly farther 
and carry more 


02:56.592 --> 02:58.729
while saving fuel. 


02:58.728 --> 03:02.398
In the decade following 
the introduction of upturned wingtips, 


03:02.398 --> 03:07.336
airlines worldwide 
saved 7,600 million liters 


03:07.337 --> 03:11.000
[or 2 billion gallons] of jet fuel.


03:12.075 --> 03:16.000
But the eagle’s amazing design 
is not limited to flight. 


03:17.713 --> 03:21.150
As the eagle 
descends upon its prey, 


03:21.150 --> 03:23.987
its eyes continuously adjust 


03:23.987 --> 03:27.000
to maintain sharp focus 
throughout the approach.


03:31.827 --> 03:34.364
What man-made camera 
comes even close 


03:34.363 --> 03:37.000
to this ability 
of rapid refocus?


03:56.718 --> 03:58.988
The Behemoth mentioned in Job 


03:58.988 --> 04:02.000
is generally identified 
as the hippopotamus. 


04:03.627 --> 04:06.895
A full-grown hippo 
may be as large as 15 feet 


04:06.895 --> 04:09.032
[or 4 to 5 meters] long 


04:09.032 --> 04:14.000
and weigh around 8,000 pounds 
[or 3,600 kilograms].


04:16.338 --> 04:19.041
Its bones, 
particularly the vertebrae, 


04:19.042 --> 04:21.744
form a strong, rigid structure. 


04:21.743 --> 04:24.946
Its ribs and thick hide protect it 


04:24.947 --> 04:28.000
as it navigates such areas 
as rocky river beds.


04:31.120 --> 04:33.790
You don’t have to have 
bones like a hippo 


04:33.790 --> 04:36.000
to appreciate their strength.


04:38.593 --> 04:43.000
Bone is an essential part 
of countless living organisms.


04:56.878 --> 05:01.616
Researchers say that bones are constructed 
in exactly the same way


05:01.617 --> 05:04.754
that reinforced concrete 
is constructed. 


05:04.753 --> 05:09.658
The steel of reinforced concrete 
provides the tensile strength, 


05:09.658 --> 05:13.295
while the cement, sand, and rock 


05:13.295 --> 05:16.000
provide the compressional strength.


05:18.100 --> 05:21.470
However, 
the compressional strength of bone 


05:21.470 --> 05:25.000
is greater than that of even 
the best reinforced concrete.


05:27.510 --> 05:31.747
Bone is superior to concrete 
in many other ways. 


05:31.747 --> 05:35.952
It responds to hormones 
that affect its growth and development 


05:35.952 --> 05:38.000
and is even able to repair itself.


05:41.723 --> 05:43.693
Also, like muscle, 


05:43.693 --> 05:47.000
it slowly grows stronger 
as the load on it increases.


06:02.812 --> 06:05.882
Leviathan, 
likely the crocodile, 


06:05.882 --> 06:09.152
has an enormously 
powerful bite. 


06:09.152 --> 06:13.589
Some have a bite 
nearly three times more powerful 


06:13.588 --> 06:15.725
than that of a lion. 


06:15.725 --> 06:20.597
Yet, the crocodile’s jaw 
is also more sensitive 


06:20.597 --> 06:22.632
than the human fingertip. 


06:22.632 --> 06:26.269
It is covered 
with thousands of sense organs 


06:26.268 --> 06:28.971
that come out of holes 
in the skull. 


06:28.972 --> 06:33.209
This design allows a mother 
to pick up her babies 


06:33.208 --> 06:36.000
and gently carry them in her mouth.


06:55.197 --> 06:57.234
Without a doubt, 


06:57.233 --> 06:59.301
God’s “invisible qualities 


06:59.302 --> 07:03.000
are clearly seen” in the things he made.


07:08.210 --> 07:10.212
We can also learn much 


07:10.212 --> 07:13.000
from the other animal creation 
mentioned in Job: 


07:14.017 --> 07:17.000
the wild bull, 


07:18.097 --> 07:20.155
the stork,


07:20.155 --> 07:23.000
and the ostrich.


07:30.163 --> 07:34.803
Why not study these animals 
during family worship 


07:34.803 --> 07:37.140
and see what more can be learned 


07:37.140 --> 08:19.465
about Jehovah’s qualities?

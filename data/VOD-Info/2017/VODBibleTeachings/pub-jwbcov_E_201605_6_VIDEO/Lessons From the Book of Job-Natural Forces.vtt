00:09.525 --> 00:11.527
In the Bible book of Job, 


00:11.527 --> 00:14.930
Jehovah described examples of his power 


00:14.930 --> 00:17.000
observable in the natural world. 


00:18.768 --> 00:21.000
Consider just a few.


00:23.138 --> 00:26.000
Thunderhead clouds. 


00:28.512 --> 00:31.580
It is estimated that a single thunderstorm 


00:31.580 --> 00:36.000
can release more energy 
than a 20-kiloton nuclear explosion.


00:40.490 --> 00:43.000
We see some of that energy as lightning. 


00:44.660 --> 00:48.000
But lightning is only half the show.


00:49.032 --> 00:53.904
Thunder is produced when lightning 
heats up the surrounding air.


00:53.903 --> 00:56.940
The superheated air rapidly expands, 


00:56.940 --> 00:59.000
causing a tremendous boom and crackling.


01:03.447 --> 01:05.515
This is followed by rumbles, 


01:05.515 --> 01:08.000
as the air continues to vibrate. 


01:09.252 --> 01:12.822
Although usually associated 
with destructive power, 


01:12.822 --> 01:15.000
lightning strikes can be very beneficial.


01:17.260 --> 01:19.862
As lightning rips through the air, 


01:19.862 --> 01:21.865
nitrogen is converted 


01:21.865 --> 01:24.000
to a form that nourishes plants.


01:26.268 --> 01:30.373
“Who . . . made a path 
for the thunderous storm cloud? 


01:30.373 --> 01:32.708
“Can you send out lightning bolts? 


01:32.708 --> 01:37.000
Will they come and say to you,
‘Here we are!’”


01:45.855 --> 01:49.000
Waves can start far out in the open sea.


01:51.862 --> 01:55.000
They can begin as tiny ripples 
formed by the wind.


01:57.300 --> 01:59.835
As the wind continues to add energy, 


01:59.835 --> 02:02.638
the waves increase in size. 


02:02.638 --> 02:05.241
The stronger the wind and longer the gust, 


02:05.242 --> 02:07.910
the bigger the wave. 


02:07.910 --> 02:10.180
Hurricane winds can produce waves 


02:10.180 --> 02:13.000
of 100 feet or more in height.


02:29.032 --> 02:31.367
Long after the wind stops, 


02:31.367 --> 02:35.000
the tremendous wave energy 
continues to move. 


02:36.038 --> 02:40.000
It can travel great distances 
from where it originated.


02:42.345 --> 02:45.282
The amount of energy 
contained in all the oceans 


02:45.282 --> 02:48.619
could theoretically power the entire globe 


02:48.618 --> 02:51.000
without air pollution.


02:54.090 --> 02:58.393
“Who barricaded the sea behind doors 
when it burst out from the womb, 


02:58.393 --> 03:03.331
“. . . when I established my limit for it 
and put its bars and doors in place, 


03:03.332 --> 03:07.537
“and I said, 
‘You may come this far, and no farther; 


03:07.537 --> 03:10.000
here is where your proud waves will stop’?”


03:14.943 --> 03:17.000
The evening sky. 


03:20.817 --> 03:23.000
Job could see familiar constellations. 


03:24.453 --> 03:27.000
What controls the motion of the stars?


03:29.058 --> 03:31.928
Only thousands of years later did scientists 


03:31.928 --> 03:34.000
learn more about these invisible laws. 


03:36.098 --> 03:41.000
Today, we understand that the motion 
of stars is controlled by gravity.


03:42.405 --> 03:44.440
Although they are in motion, 


03:44.440 --> 03:46.875
we perceive their positions as fixed 


03:46.875 --> 03:49.000
because they are so far away. 


03:51.513 --> 03:55.251
Thus, they can serve 
as reliable navigational markers 


03:55.252 --> 03:58.000
down to this day.


03:59.355 --> 04:02.492
Yet, despite increasing knowledge 


04:02.492 --> 04:04.494
about the force of gravity, 


04:04.493 --> 04:07.763
humans are still unable 
to give a complete answer 


04:07.763 --> 04:10.000
to the questions God posed to Job.


04:12.935 --> 04:15.472
“Do you know the laws 
governing the heavens, 


04:15.472 --> 04:20.000
or can you impose 
their authority on the earth?”


04:22.412 --> 04:24.414
All around us, 


04:24.413 --> 04:26.415
daily reminders 


04:26.415 --> 04:29.000
of Jehovah’s great power can be seen.


04:46.602 --> 05:04.805
What do you see?

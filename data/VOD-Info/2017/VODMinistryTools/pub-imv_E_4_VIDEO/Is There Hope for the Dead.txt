00:08 We all have a common enemy:
00:12 death.
00:15 But many wonder,
00:16 ‘Is death the end of everything?’
00:21 The Bible teaches
00:22 that there is hope for the dead.
00:26 Jesus taught
00:27 that the dead will live again.
00:31 But he did
00:32 more than just talk about this hope.
00:34 He used his God-given power
00:37 to raise people from the dead.
00:41 The Bible promises that you can see
00:43 your dead loved ones again
00:45 right here on earth.

00:08.445 --> 00:12.658
We all have a common enemy: 


00:12.658 --> 00:14.000
death.


00:15.077 --> 00:16.412
But many wonder, 


00:16.412 --> 00:20.000
‘Is death the end of everything?’


00:21.333 --> 00:22.751
The Bible teaches 


00:22.752 --> 00:25.000
that there is hope for the dead.


00:26.130 --> 00:27.798
Jesus taught 


00:27.798 --> 00:30.000
that the dead will live again.


00:31.093 --> 00:32.426
But he did 


00:32.427 --> 00:34.930
more than just talk about this hope. 


00:34.930 --> 00:37.642
He used his God-given power 


00:37.642 --> 00:40.000
to raise people from the dead.


00:41.437 --> 00:43.939
The Bible promises that you can see 


00:43.938 --> 00:45.315
your dead loved ones again 


00:45.315 --> 00:48.000
right here on earth.


00:49.152 --> 00:50.779

00:50.778 --> 00:52.948

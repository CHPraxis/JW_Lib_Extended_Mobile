00:01.483 --> 00:04.586
Have you, though, 
ever felt alone in your assignment,


00:04.587 --> 00:08.925
even if for just a few hours
in the ministry? 


00:08.925 --> 00:13.763
Brother Pontien Mukanga may have felt
that way early in his assignment. 


00:13.763 --> 00:17.833
He was the first circuit overseer
for all of what is now


00:17.833 --> 00:22.000
the Democratic Republic of Congo
and the Republic of Congo. 


00:23.038 --> 00:28.678
He traveled great distances to visit
the few brothers throughout the territory. 


00:28.678 --> 00:32.000
Listen to what encouraged him
the most to keep going.


00:34.883 --> 00:36.886
In 1960,


00:36.887 --> 00:40.000
I was made a circuit overseer
for the whole of Congo. 


00:42.325 --> 00:45.828
I was so happy to receive this privilege. 


00:45.828 --> 00:48.765
But I was shocked and scared. 


00:48.765 --> 00:51.935
The assignment was huge.


00:51.935 --> 00:54.937
Congo is a vast country. 


00:54.937 --> 00:58.000
I was afraid to go to places I didn’t know. 


00:59.442 --> 01:04.000
I felt overwhelmed, 
so I turned to Jehovah.


01:05.082 --> 01:09.552
Sometimes I had to go through
savannahs and across the jungle. 


01:09.552 --> 01:12.189
There were wild animals. 


01:12.188 --> 01:16.358
One day, I climbed up a tree
to find a place to sleep. 


01:16.358 --> 01:19.728
I tied myself to a branch with my belt. 


01:19.728 --> 01:23.000
I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.


01:24.633 --> 01:28.000
I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.


01:29.038 --> 01:32.108
Visiting the brothers was very difficult. 


01:32.108 --> 01:35.411
Sometimes the journey took many days. 


01:35.412 --> 01:38.280
I remember one day, 
I left my house


01:38.280 --> 01:41.000
to visit the brothers to encourage them. 


01:44.253 --> 01:46.488
I left at 5:30 in the morning, 


01:46.488 --> 01:49.000
and I arrived at 7:30 that night. 


01:50.527 --> 01:53.095
I had to push my bicycle through sand


01:53.095 --> 01:56.598
for up to 13 miles (21 km) or even more. 


01:56.598 --> 01:59.001
Other times, we traveled by truck. 


01:59.002 --> 02:01.004
That was not easy. 


02:01.003 --> 02:05.408
You had to climb on top of the truck. 


02:05.408 --> 02:09.000
I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.


02:10.078 --> 02:15.818
Congregations, isolated groups
were far away from one another. 


02:15.818 --> 02:18.721
There were no phones at that time either. 


02:18.722 --> 02:21.925
Even though they did not know I was coming,


02:21.925 --> 02:25.000
they made me feel so welcome. 


02:26.762 --> 02:30.000
The brothers were really very hospitable. 


02:31.233 --> 02:33.268
When I arrived, 


02:33.268 --> 02:38.000
I was exhausted
but so happy to see the brothers.


02:40.710 --> 02:43.000
The Kitawala was a religion. 


02:44.513 --> 02:46.950
They sent many letters
to the Belgium branch


02:46.950 --> 02:50.000
asking to be recognized
as Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


02:51.820 --> 02:53.188
These people used


02:53.188 --> 02:59.595
our publications
and used the name Watch Tower. 


02:59.595 --> 03:02.000
It created a lot of confusion. 


03:03.833 --> 03:06.001
To clarify the matter,


03:06.002 --> 03:09.000
the organization prepared a booklet.


03:10.807 --> 03:12.909
My mission was to check whether


03:12.908 --> 03:16.000
there were any genuine
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kisangani. 


03:19.215 --> 03:21.417
We found out that these people were


03:21.417 --> 03:24.000
not Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:26.055 --> 03:29.492
In all the confusion, 
people even tried to kill me


03:29.492 --> 03:31.527
during the trip. 


03:31.527 --> 03:35.000
Fortunately, I managed to escape. 


03:36.432 --> 03:40.000
Since it was Jehovah
who assigned me this privilege,


03:42.272 --> 03:46.000
I was confident
that he would always help me.


03:49.612 --> 03:52.115
And today, I am very happy


03:52.115 --> 03:55.785
to have at my side my children, 
my grandchildren,


03:55.785 --> 04:00.000
and my great-grandchildren
—all Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


04:02.325 --> 04:05.262
Jehovah has given me many blessings. 


04:05.262 --> 04:07.000
I am truly grateful. 


04:08.063 --> 04:12.000
What a joy to be used by Almighty God.


04:13.268 --> 04:17.000
Through all these years,
I have never lacked anything. 


04:18.407 --> 04:20.410
Jehovah has given me the strength 


04:20.410 --> 04:25.000
to serve him up until now—to the age of 86. 


04:26.348 --> 04:29.551
In everything and for everything, 


04:29.552 --> 04:32.000
my trust really is in Jehovah.


04:33.588 --> 04:35.625
There were 46 publishers


04:35.625 --> 04:37.960
in the whole of Congo. 


04:37.960 --> 04:40.463
Today, I hear there are more than


04:40.463 --> 04:42.798
223,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses 


04:42.798 --> 04:45.000
in the Congo.


04:47.970 --> 04:50.673
Today, when I see


04:50.673 --> 04:54.000
the increase of Jehovah’s people, 


04:56.378 --> 04:59.000
to me it is like a miracle. 


05:01.650 --> 05:05.422
I thank Jehovah 
for allowing me to see 


05:05.422 --> 05:07.424
‘the little one become a thousand’ 


05:07.423 --> 05:10.000
here in the Congo.


05:19.168 --> 05:25.641
Brother Mukanga continues to serve
as an elder at nearly 88 years old. 


05:25.642 --> 05:28.779
Can you imagine yourself
experiencing both the joys


05:28.778 --> 05:31.000
and difficulties he had
as a circuit overseer? 


05:33.082 --> 05:36.685
He courageously visited
the Kitawala religious groups


05:36.685 --> 05:38.922
who claimed to serve Jehovah, 


05:38.922 --> 05:43.559
only to find some were violent
and practiced immorality. 


05:43.558 --> 05:46.561
But it was his reliance on Jehovah


05:46.562 --> 05:49.465
and watching Him turn
the small group of brothers


05:49.465 --> 05:59.993
into more than 200,000
that has kept him going.

00:01 Have you, though,  ever felt alone in your assignment,
00:04 even if for just a few hours in the ministry?
00:08 Brother Pontien Mukanga may have felt that way early in his assignment.
00:13 He was the first circuit overseer for all of what is now
00:17 the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo.
00:23 He traveled great distances to visit the few brothers throughout the territory.
00:28 Listen to what encouraged him the most to keep going.
00:34 In 1960,
00:36 I was made a circuit overseer for the whole of Congo.
00:42 I was so happy to receive this privilege.
00:45 But I was shocked and scared.
00:48 The assignment was huge.
00:51 Congo is a vast country.
00:54 I was afraid to go to places I didn’t know.
00:59 I felt overwhelmed,  so I turned to Jehovah.
01:05 Sometimes I had to go through savannahs and across the jungle.
01:09 There were wild animals.
01:12 One day, I climbed up a tree to find a place to sleep.
01:16 I tied myself to a branch with my belt.
01:19 I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.
01:24 I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.
01:29 Visiting the brothers was very difficult.
01:32 Sometimes the journey took many days.
01:35 I remember one day,  I left my house
01:38 to visit the brothers to encourage them.
01:44 I left at 5:30 in the morning,
01:46 and I arrived at 7:30 that night.
01:50 I had to push my bicycle through sand
01:53 for up to 13 miles (21 km) or even more.
01:56 Other times, we traveled by truck.
01:59 That was not easy.
02:01 You had to climb on top of the truck.
02:05 I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.
02:10 Congregations, isolated groups were far away from one another.
02:15 There were no phones at that time either.
02:18 Even though they did not know I was coming,
02:21 they made me feel so welcome.
02:26 The brothers were really very hospitable.
02:31 When I arrived,
02:33 I was exhausted but so happy to see the brothers.
02:40 The Kitawala was a religion.
02:44 They sent many letters to the Belgium branch
02:46 asking to be recognized as Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:51 These people used
02:53 our publications and used the name Watch Tower.
02:59 It created a lot of confusion.
03:03 To clarify the matter,
03:06 the organization prepared a booklet.
03:10 My mission was to check whether
03:12 there were any genuine Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kisangani.
03:19 We found out that these people were
03:21 not Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:26 In all the confusion,  people even tried to kill me
03:29 during the trip.
03:31 Fortunately, I managed to escape.
03:36 Since it was Jehovah who assigned me this privilege,
03:42 I was confident that he would always help me.
03:49 And today, I am very happy
03:52 to have at my side my children,  my grandchildren,
03:55 and my great-grandchildren —all Jehovah’s Witnesses.
04:02 Jehovah has given me many blessings.
04:05 I am truly grateful.
04:08 What a joy to be used by Almighty God.
04:13 Through all these years, I have never lacked anything.
04:18 Jehovah has given me the strength
04:20 to serve him up until now—to the age of 86.
04:26 In everything and for everything,
04:29 my trust really is in Jehovah.
04:33 There were 46 publishers
04:35 in the whole of Congo.
04:37 Today, I hear there are more than
04:40 223,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses
04:42 in the Congo.
04:47 Today, when I see
04:50 the increase of Jehovah’s people,
04:56 to me it is like a miracle.
05:01 I thank Jehovah  for allowing me to see
05:05 ‘the little one become a thousand’
05:07 here in the Congo.
05:19 Brother Mukanga continues to serve as an elder at nearly 88 years old.
05:25 Can you imagine yourself experiencing both the joys
05:28 and difficulties he had as a circuit overseer?
05:33 He courageously visited the Kitawala religious groups
05:36 who claimed to serve Jehovah,
05:38 only to find some were violent and practiced immorality.
05:43 But it was his reliance on Jehovah
05:46 and watching Him turn the small group of brothers
05:49 into more than 200,000 that has kept him going.

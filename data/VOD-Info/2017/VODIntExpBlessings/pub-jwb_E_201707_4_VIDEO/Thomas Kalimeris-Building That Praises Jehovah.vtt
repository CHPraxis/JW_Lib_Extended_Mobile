00:01.250 --> 00:03.252
Brother Thomas Kalimeris, 


00:03.252 --> 00:05.255
who serves at the United States branch, 


00:05.255 --> 00:07.257
together with his wife, 


00:07.257 --> 00:10.994
has spent close to four decades 
supporting various aspects 


00:10.993 --> 00:14.096
of the organization’s construction projects. 


00:14.097 --> 00:16.599
What has that experience taught him? 


00:16.598 --> 00:21.000
That the work is not run by us.


00:24.607 --> 00:29.000
Throughout history, men have built 
many beautiful and impressive buildings. 


00:30.113 --> 00:32.615
These structures 
have usually brought glory to men, 


00:32.615 --> 00:34.617
not to God. 


00:34.617 --> 00:36.619
But those men are long gone, 


00:36.618 --> 00:41.290
and even many of the structures 
no longer exist. 


00:41.290 --> 00:44.000
How true is the scripture at Psalm 127:1: 


00:45.228 --> 00:48.030
“Unless Jehovah builds the house, 


00:48.030 --> 00:53.670
it is in vain 
that its builders work hard on it.”


00:53.670 --> 00:57.340
In our time too, 
Jehovah is using his people to build. 


00:57.340 --> 01:01.143
We’re working hard 
to build spirituality in interested ones, 


01:01.143 --> 01:03.145
and also we build structures 


01:03.145 --> 01:06.415
in order to help individuals to learn 


01:06.415 --> 01:08.985
about Jehovah and serve him. 


01:08.985 --> 01:11.822
In this type of construction


01:11.822 --> 01:13.824
—both spiritual and physical construction—


01:13.823 --> 01:15.825
I’ve been involved for most of my life.


01:15.825 --> 01:18.293
I was born in Greece. 


01:18.293 --> 01:22.000
Our family came into contact 
with the truth in the early sixties. 


01:23.032 --> 01:26.002
I was baptized when I was in high school. 


01:26.002 --> 01:30.640
I left school to get 
some practical training in architecture, 


01:30.640 --> 01:33.342
but I made pioneering my career. 


01:33.342 --> 01:36.914
In 1973, 
I married my dear wife, Margaret, 


01:36.913 --> 01:39.548
and together 
we enjoyed many assignments. 


01:39.548 --> 01:41.818
We pioneered
—special pioneering. 


01:41.818 --> 01:44.986
We went to Gilead. 


01:44.987 --> 01:47.057
We were invited to Bethel 


01:47.057 --> 01:50.860
in 1979 to work 
in the Engineering Department. 


01:50.860 --> 01:54.563
We worked on designing new branches, 


01:54.563 --> 01:57.466
Assembly Halls, Kingdom Halls, 


01:57.467 --> 02:00.670
renovation of existing branches 


02:00.670 --> 02:04.000
and remote translation offices. 


02:05.142 --> 02:09.612
Before we came to Bethel, we had seen how 
Jehovah provided for us individually. 


02:09.612 --> 02:12.182
But now we had the opportunity 


02:12.182 --> 02:17.000
to see how Jehovah provided 
for the needs of his organization globally.


02:18.655 --> 02:22.792
By the year 2000, 
it became apparent that the present facility 


02:22.792 --> 02:26.000
of the Britain branch 
was not meeting their needs. 


02:27.563 --> 02:29.698
So a site was located 
50 miles (80 km) north of London 


02:29.698 --> 02:32.635
to relocate the branch there. 


02:32.635 --> 02:34.637
However, 


02:34.637 --> 02:37.707
the Governing Body 
decided to cancel the project. 


02:37.707 --> 02:39.709
So in 2008, 


02:39.708 --> 02:43.145
the Governing Body wrote 
that now is the time


02:43.145 --> 02:46.215
—Jehovah’s time—
to find property 


02:46.215 --> 02:48.217
closer to London. 


02:48.217 --> 02:50.354
So a project team was formed, 


02:50.353 --> 02:53.055
and a few years went by,
and a number of properties were searched,


02:53.055 --> 02:56.292
and one was located closer to London. 


02:56.292 --> 02:59.229
If something we plan falls through, 


02:59.228 --> 03:02.198
it could mean 
that Jehovah has something else


03:02.198 --> 03:06.835
—or better— in mind to meet 
the needs of his organization.


03:06.835 --> 03:10.973
While working in the Haiti branch, 
we learned a lesson: 


03:10.973 --> 03:14.776
not to compromise on safety. 


03:14.777 --> 03:18.949
The Brooklyn Engineering Department 
did the drawings for the branch, 


03:18.948 --> 03:22.085
and a local contractor was hired 


03:22.085 --> 03:24.087
to build the structural work. 


03:24.087 --> 03:25.955
Now, the contractor, 
when he reviewed the drawings, 


03:25.955 --> 03:29.458
told the Branch Committee: 
“Really, this is overdesigned. 


03:29.458 --> 03:33.830
You’re wasting a lot of money 
by putting all the steel in the building.” 


03:33.830 --> 03:38.333
So we wrote back and said: 
“No, the drawings are OK. 


03:38.333 --> 03:41.570
“The branch is designed 
according to the seismic zone that it’s in. 


03:41.570 --> 03:45.000
And the contractor is to go ahead 
with the plans as drawn.” 


03:46.275 --> 03:50.880
In 2010, 
when the earthquake came to Haiti, 


03:50.880 --> 03:54.450
hundreds of thousands of people died 


03:54.450 --> 03:58.487
because of inferior materials 
and methods of construction. 


03:58.487 --> 04:00.524
However, 


04:00.523 --> 04:03.091
the branch did not suffer any damage, 


04:03.092 --> 04:07.964
and many people went there to find refuge. 


04:07.963 --> 04:10.666
We’re so glad that Jehovah did not allow us 


04:10.667 --> 04:13.469
to be swayed in this case.


04:13.468 --> 04:17.906
Jehovah continues to direct 
a great physical building work 


04:17.907 --> 04:19.875
and a spiritual work. 


04:19.875 --> 04:22.645
Jehovah trains his people 
how to work together 


04:22.645 --> 04:24.680
for the work just ahead of us


04:24.680 --> 04:29.000
—the beautification of this earth 
to a paradise. 


04:30.420 --> 04:32.988
It is so important that we 
‘trust in Jehovah 


04:32.988 --> 04:36.758
and not to lean 
upon our own understanding.’ 


04:36.758 --> 04:38.995
A life of building with Jehovah


04:38.995 --> 04:41.000
has shown me the wisdom of Psalm 127:1.


04:42.365 --> 04:45.635
If we keep building our lives with Jehovah, 


04:45.635 --> 04:57.630
our building work will never be in vain.

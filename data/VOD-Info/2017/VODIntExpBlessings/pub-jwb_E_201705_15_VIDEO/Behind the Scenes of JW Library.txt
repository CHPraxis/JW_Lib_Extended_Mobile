00:01 One of the tools that can help us
00:03 to actively search out reminders
00:06 is JW Library.
00:08 This amazing app has been installed
00:11 on over 15 million devices.
00:15 But do you know  how much work it takes
00:17 to develop and maintain this app?
00:20 Well, we are now going  to look  behind the scenes
00:24 and meet some of the brothers  who have either worked on this project
00:28 or helped to organize that work.
00:30 This really is an opportunity to visit
00:33 an area in Bethel  that you don’t get to see on tour.
00:37 Of course, there are many brothers  associated with the work.
00:41 But we would like you  to get to know three
00:44 of these very hard-working brothers,
00:46 and let me introduce them to you.
00:49 First of all, Brother Per Christensen,  the overseer of MEPS Programming.
00:53 Now, Per, you’ve been in this country
00:55 working in the U.S. Bethel  for a number of years.
00:58 But where are you from originally?
01:00 I was born in Denmark
01:02 and served there in the branch for years.
01:05 So when did you and your wife, Berit,  come to the United States?
01:10 In 1994.
01:11 And our first year was in Brooklyn.
01:14 And then we had 18 years in Patterson
01:16 and then back to Brooklyn again  for three and a half years.
01:19 And now we’re in Warwick  since November last year.
01:24 Well, I know you worked  in Translation Services for a while
01:27 because, in fact,  the two of us worked together
01:29 in the same department  there for a while.
01:30 But what type of work  have you been involved with
01:34 since you’ve come  to the United States?
01:36 Lots of exciting and challenging jobs.
01:40 Working in Translation Services
01:42 —that was training and support  for our translators worldwide.
01:47 Now in MEPS Programming
01:49 —that is all about  distribution of spiritual food
01:52 to all our brothers and sisters.
01:54 So we have a ton of work  and a lot of challenges.
01:59 But I’m also working with a lot
02:01 of very, very talented  brothers and sisters.
02:04 So it’s a lot of fun,  and it’s great going to work every day.
02:09 That’s great to hear, Per.
02:10 In fact, I’m even tempted  to come back and work with you.
02:14 Oh, we would love that.
02:15 I think I’d love it too.
02:17 Well, let’s turn our attention  to Brother Alfredo Serna.
02:20 Now, you are the assistant overseer  of MEPS Programming.
02:23 In fact, you and I worked together  in Mexico back in 2003.
02:28 Could you tell us a little bit  about what you were doing at that time?
02:31 My last work assignment involved overseeing
02:34 the large Translation Department there.
02:36 It was an amazing privilege to work
02:38 with translators in sign language  and the indigenous languages,
02:42 a true joy to contribute to preparing publications
02:46 for those in the minority groups.
02:48 So when did you and your wife, Gina,  come to the United States to work here?
02:51 We arrived at Patterson in 2007.
02:55 We have fond memories of that time,
02:57 and it’s something we still treasure.
02:59 Very good.
03:00 And now,  Brother Paul Willies,
03:03 where do you originally come from  along with your wife, Su-lin,
03:06 and when did you come to the United States?
03:09 Well, we’re both originally  from South Africa,
03:11 and we served there in Bethel  for a number of years.
03:13 And then in 2010,  we were transferred to work
03:17 along with MEPS Programming  here in the U.S.
03:19 So, what type of work  have you been involved with,
03:22 particularly recently?
03:24 Well, most of my time in Bethel
03:25 I’ve been working  on the Watchtower Translation System,
03:28 or WTS.
03:29 Actually,  I was working along with Per.
03:31 Per was in headquarters,  and I was working
03:33 on the programming team  that we had in South Africa.
03:36 WTS is the program  that the translators use
03:38 to help organize and manage  their translation work.
03:40 And then, of course, most recently  I’ve been working on the mobile apps
03:44 —the JW Library app  and the JW Library Sign Language app.
03:48 Very good.
03:49 Well, now all of you work  in MEPS Programming.
03:52 Per, can you just tell us a little bit?
03:54 We’re familiar with the term MEPS,  but what really is it?
03:57 Well, MEPS stands for
03:59 Multilanguage Electronic Publishing System.
04:03 That didn’t help me at all.
04:04 Sorry.
04:06 Can you make it a little bit  more simple so we can understand?
04:08 We make the tools, or the programs,  that the organization needs
04:12 to make publications
04:15 and have them translated  into hundreds of languages.
04:20 So I can illustrate it this way:
04:22 that we are not making  the spiritual food,
04:25 but we are building  a conveyor belt for the spiritual food
04:29 from the faithful and discreet slave
04:31 down to the printing presses
04:34 or to our website  or to Watchtower Library,
04:37 ONLINE LIBRARY  or, like in this case, JW Library.
04:41 Thanks so much.
04:42 Now, at long last, I do understand  a bit more
04:44 about what MEPS means.
04:46 Now, as I travel around,  the brothers and sisters,
04:49 they tell me how much  they love JW Library.
04:52 But there seems to be no end
04:55 to the suggestions  for improvements and features
04:58 —and long lists of suggestions.
05:01 Can you give us a little bit  of an idea of what’s involved
05:05 with trying to develop  a new feature for JW Library?
05:09 Yes, the brothers and the sisters  really love using the app,
05:12 and because of that,  they’re keen to get many new features.
05:16 Of course, we wish we could just add  all those new features into the app,
05:20 but the truth is we just can’t.
05:23 Yes, adding each new feature  involves a lot of work.
05:27 And we also need to determine  whether a feature
05:30 that’s requested is just a “nice to have”
05:32 or is it something  that’s going to address a real need?
05:35 For example, will it really help an elder  who is out on a shepherding call
05:39 or maybe a pioneer sister  who is at the public witnessing carts
05:42 or at her Bible study or return visit?
05:45 Also, very important  to us is trying to make
05:49 each new feature  very simple to use . . .
05:52 Ah, thanks for doing that.
05:53 . . . especially for a first-time user,  someone who’s never used the app before.
05:57 And then, of course,  before we start working on anything,
06:00 we always get approval  from the Governing Body.
06:01 Ah, that’s a good thing to do too.
06:03 Like one feature  that many have been asking for
06:06 is the ability  to add notes into the app.
06:10 And, of course,  before we start programming it,
06:13 we have to make sure  that it actually does what is wanted.
06:16 We made a video  that shows how we go about that.
06:19 You have?
06:20 Would you like to see it?
06:20 Well, of course.  I’d love to see it!
06:23 Hello.  How are you?
06:25 Good, good, good.
06:26 Welcome!  Thanks for coming.
06:27 How about yourself?
06:28 Fine, thank you.  Have a seat.
06:29 All right, so glad you could be here!
06:31 Thank you so much.
06:32 Oh, so fancy.
06:33 Yeah! So we get to talk about JW Library today.
06:36 So, what are some ways  that you use JW Library?
06:39 I mean, it’s revolutionized  going to meetings.
06:42 Oh, my.
06:43 I go to meetings  and sometimes I just carry my iPad.
06:45 So the fact that you can make  the text larger. . .
06:47 It’s easy to listen  to the readings right in the app now,
06:50 and so I—I find myself doing that.
06:52 So if we were  to make a notes feature,
06:54 what are some things  that you’d like to be able to do?
06:57 I mean, if you could see  all your notes without tapping on
06:59 each one that would be great.
07:01 And even if you make a note in,  maybe, your phone
07:05 and it can also be saved in your tablet,  that would be really nice.
07:07 Yeah.
07:08 Well, what if I told you  that in front of you
07:12 is an early version of JW Library?
07:15 Whoa!  Cool!
07:15 Oh, fantastic!
07:16 This is it?
07:17 With notes—yeah.
07:18 Ooh.
07:20 So a few months ago,  the Governing Body
07:22 gave us approval to start working  on the notes feature.
07:25 We got together as a team,  and we’ll do, like, these rough sketches,
07:28 and programmers write code.
07:29 But before we release an update,
07:31 we have a group of testers.
07:32 And, you know, they’ll find  little glitches or bugs or things,
07:35 but they’ll try to work it out  with the programmers.
07:36 After that, we have  a pretty stable version of JW Library.
07:40 The goal is to show it to you,
07:42 and you can let us know  what you think.
07:45 So now that you’ve seen  the new notes feature
07:48 in JW Library, what do you think?
07:49 I love that I can tag the personal things  that I need to work on
07:54 or a comment or a scripture  that I can encourage someone with.
07:56 This is fantastic!
07:57 Yeah.  It’s great.
07:58 I like that I can find my notes,  especially using the search feature.
08:02 It’s great!
08:03 And it’s really neat  how my comments—
08:05 I can place it right next  to the paragraph for meetings,
08:07 and it doesn’t cover the actual text.
08:10 The ability to back it up  so you can restore it to another device,
08:13 that’s going to be really helpful.
08:15 I love it!
08:16 Amazing!
08:17 OK.  Go ahead.
08:19 Yeah.  Go ahead!
08:20 So you’re telling us we can proceed.
08:23 That’s fantastic!
08:24 But, brothers, you can’t show us  something like that
08:27 and not tell us when  we’re going to get it.
08:30 Well, we said on the website  that it was coming soon.
08:32 I know you said that on the website,  but when?
08:35 Is it OK to be more specific than that?
08:37 I think that’s why they invited us here.
08:38 Paul, let’s hear it.
08:41 Well, we’re happy to tell you  that the notes feature
08:42 in JW Library  will be coming soon,
08:45 and by soon we mean  during May of 2017—this month!
08:49 So we can go and check  the app stores for an update.
08:53 Oh, that’s wonderful to hear.
08:55 So all of us will be happy  to be able to put our own reminders
08:58 right there in the JW Library app.
09:01 Well, I’m looking forward  to being able to do that as well.
09:05 But now,  while I’ve got you here,
09:07 we’re not going to let you go  until we ask this big question:
09:10 What are you working on now?
09:13 In other words, what can we expect  to see soon with JW Library?
09:18 We have another brief video showing  what the team is working on
09:21 to support the Study Bible  on the JW Library app.
09:24 Would you like to see it?
09:25 That’s wonderful.  Let’s have a look.
09:29 Later this year,
09:30 work will begin on adding the Study Edition
09:33 of the New World Translation to JW Library.
09:36 When this edition becomes available
09:37 in your language,
09:39 you will be able to discover
09:40 spiritual gems in the study notes.
09:42 And the new media gallery
09:44 will help you to visualize the people, places,
09:47 and things you read about.
09:49 You will also see the new overviews of each book,
09:52 play the introductory videos,
09:53 and study additional appendix material.
09:56 All of this and more
09:57 is coming soon to JW Library!
10:01 That sounds so exciting.
10:04 So we’ll all look forward  to getting that feature.
10:06 You said, “coming soon,” didn’t you?
10:09 Anyway,  we’d like to thank you very much
10:12 for the fact that you’ve come along  and you’ve explained so much to us
10:15 about what goes on  with MEPS Programming
10:18 and the JW Library app.
10:20 But before you go,
10:22 we’d like to ask you,  when you go back to your department,
10:25 please, take an expression  of our appreciation
10:28 back to the hard-working  brothers and sisters
10:31 who are working behind the scenes  in providing this tool for us.
10:35 Will do.
10:35 Happy to.
10:36 Thanks.
10:36 Thank you very much.

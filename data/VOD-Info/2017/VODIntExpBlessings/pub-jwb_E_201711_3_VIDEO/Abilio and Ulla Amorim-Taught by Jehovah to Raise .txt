00:09 Since I was very young, I was religiously inclined
00:12 and my dream was to get married to a man that worshipped God
00:17 and that together we would worship God and live a peaceful life.
00:23 That didn’t happen with my parents.
00:26 We often had a better relationship with the maid than with my mother.
00:35 My father was a very distant person.
00:37 He was always very busy with his work and friends.
00:42 We wed in 1971 in Paris, France.
00:48 We were baptized in 1974.
00:51 I realized I really didn’t know how to raise children,
00:56 and then I started applying some things
00:58 mentioned in the Bible.
01:01 If I wanted to teach them right,
01:03 I first had to understand things better myself
01:06 so that I could explain them in a way that God would want us to.
01:11 In 1976, we moved to Portugal
01:16 to serve where there was more need.
01:20 By then, our oldest son was four and a half years old,
01:24 Maria was three and a half, and Benjamin, one and a half.
01:29 I remember when we arrived;  we lived in a rural area.
01:34 It was a very small congregation,
01:36 so we really had to participate
01:39 from a very early age.
01:41 They wanted to put,
01:42 for sure, the spiritual interests first in their life,
01:46 and they wanted not only to tell us
01:50 to put the Kingdom interests first but they wanted to show us
01:53 how to do it.
01:54 And it was not only that we sat down for family study
01:58 that we talked about Jehovah and spiritual things.
02:01 I remember walking back home
02:04 from meetings and then my parents would help us
02:06 to look for a star constellation;
02:09 it started a conversation about Jehovah.
02:12 In Deuteronomy chapter 6,
02:15 it says that we  must always talk to our children.
02:17 But it’s good to talk about God
02:20 and help them to see God as a real person
02:22 —a person that is linked to everything around us.
02:25 So now I wanted to teach them very much,
02:28 and not that things about God
02:29 were sad or boring, but were joyful.
02:33 Of course, we were imperfect.
02:35 Many times I did the wrong things.
02:38 I never remember, “You have to do it because you have to do it.”
02:42 They always tried to explain the reasons
02:45 —Bible reasons.
02:47 I was brought up this way.
02:48 My parents dictated laws: “You have to do this.
02:52 You must.  This is the way I want it to be.”
02:55 But I came to understand that God, even in the Bible,
02:58 instead of only giving or dictating laws, he explains them.
03:02 He gives so many reasons;  he gives reasons for everything.
03:05 By teaching my children, I have to say that I have learned a lot too.
03:10 We never felt that we must go to meetings;
03:13 we must go in service because you have to do it.
03:17 And we were always  motivated to do things.
03:20 I remember, for example,  when he gave me a new Bible,
03:24 and he wrote to me in that Bible,
03:28 “May this book always be the motivating force in your life.”
03:33 Several times he told me:
03:36 “Please never,
03:39 “never give up in your service.
03:43 “Jehovah is your Father, and you have to serve him
03:50 all your life.”
03:54 The Almighty has children that failed to respond,
03:59 much like any other parent.
04:02 God does not force anyone.
04:05 He respects our free will very much.
04:09 So we wanted them to build their own future.
04:15 I always felt  that my children were not my own,
04:18 but it was Jehovah who kindly put them into our hands.
04:23 He entrusted them to us so that we could care for them.
04:28 And then when we have done our part, let them fly.
04:44 My parents always encouraged us
04:46 to pursue full-time service,
04:49 even if that meant moving far away from home.
04:54 My husband and I are serving as field missionaries in Klaipeda, Lithuania.
04:59 I know I will be grateful for all eternity
05:01 that I used my youth to serve Jehovah,
05:04 and that I didn’t waste my years of my young age
05:09 doing things for this world.
05:14 My wife and I serve in the Portugal branch office.
05:18 If Jehovah is happy, if my parents are happy, I’m happy too.
05:22 I’m really sure that they like what we’re doing.
05:25 They are happy with that.
05:28 We rejoice that our children are giving their best
05:31 to their Creator and making him happy.
05:33 Jehovah deserves that.
05:38 Of course, we miss our children,
05:40 and we would like to have them around,
05:42 but we are very happy for them
05:45 for having the privilege of serving Jehovah the way they are.

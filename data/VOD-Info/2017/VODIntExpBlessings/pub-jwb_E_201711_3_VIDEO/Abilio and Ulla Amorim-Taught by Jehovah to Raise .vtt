00:09.572 --> 00:12.950
Since I was very young,
I was religiously inclined

00:12.950 --> 00:17.663
and my dream was to get married
to a man that worshipped God

00:17.663 --> 00:22.668
and that together we would worship God
and live a peaceful life.

00:23.377 --> 00:25.880
That didn’t happen with my parents.

00:26.672 --> 00:31.635
We often had a better relationship
with the maid than with my mother.

00:35.097 --> 00:37.516
My father was a very distant person.

00:37.516 --> 00:41.270
He was always very busy
with his work and friends.

00:42.646 --> 00:46.692
We wed in 1971 in Paris, France.

00:48.277 --> 00:51.113
We were baptized in 1974.

00:51.113 --> 00:55.242
I realized I really didn’t know
how to raise children,

00:56.493 --> 00:58.495
and then I started applying some things

00:58.495 --> 01:00.497
mentioned in the Bible.

01:01.290 --> 01:03.459
If I wanted to teach them right,

01:03.459 --> 01:06.587
I first had to understand
things better myself

01:06.587 --> 01:10.716
so that I could explain them
in a way that God would want us to.

01:11.926 --> 01:16.263
In 1976, we moved to Portugal

01:16.263 --> 01:18.474
to serve where there was more need.

01:20.392 --> 01:24.396
By then, our oldest son
was four and a half years old,

01:24.396 --> 01:28.484
Maria was three and a half,
and Benjamin, one and a half.

01:29.485 --> 01:33.489
I remember when we arrived; 
we lived in a rural area.

01:34.782 --> 01:36.825
It was a very small congregation,

01:36.825 --> 01:39.203
so we really had to participate

01:39.662 --> 01:41.413
from a very early age.

01:41.413 --> 01:42.831
They wanted to put,

01:42.831 --> 01:46.251
for sure, the spiritual interests
first in their life,

01:46.251 --> 01:49.046
and they wanted not only to tell us

01:50.089 --> 01:53.008
to put the Kingdom interests first
but they wanted to show us

01:53.676 --> 01:54.969
how to do it.

01:54.969 --> 01:58.597
And it was not only that we
sat down for family study

01:58.597 --> 02:01.433
that we talked about Jehovah
and spiritual things.

02:01.433 --> 02:04.019
I remember walking back home

02:04.019 --> 02:06.397
from meetings
and then my parents would help us

02:06.397 --> 02:09.900
to look for a star constellation;

02:09.900 --> 02:12.111
it started a conversation about Jehovah.

02:12.111 --> 02:14.947
In Deuteronomy chapter 6,

02:15.239 --> 02:17.241
it says that we 
must always talk to our children.

02:17.241 --> 02:19.159
But it’s good to talk about God

02:20.119 --> 02:22.371
and help them to see God as a real person

02:22.371 --> 02:24.164
—a person that is linked
to everything around us.

02:25.207 --> 02:28.544
So now I wanted to teach them very much,

02:28.544 --> 02:29.962
and not that things about God

02:29.962 --> 02:32.881
were sad or boring,
but were joyful.

02:33.132 --> 02:35.426
Of course, we were imperfect.

02:35.426 --> 02:38.679
Many times I did the wrong things.

02:38.679 --> 02:41.765
I never remember, “You have to do it
because you have to do it.”

02:42.266 --> 02:45.102
They always tried to explain the reasons

02:45.477 --> 02:47.229
—Bible reasons.

02:47.229 --> 02:48.230
I was brought up this way.

02:48.731 --> 02:52.067
My parents dictated laws:
“You have to do this.

02:52.067 --> 02:55.195
You must. 
This is the way I want it to be.”

02:55.195 --> 02:58.615
But I came to understand that God,
even in the Bible,

02:58.615 --> 03:02.286
instead of only giving or dictating laws,
he explains them.

03:02.286 --> 03:05.664
He gives so many reasons; 
he gives reasons for everything.

03:05.914 --> 03:10.586
By teaching my children,
I have to say that I have learned a lot too.

03:10.586 --> 03:13.922
We never felt that we must go to meetings;

03:13.922 --> 03:17.217
we must go in service
because you have to do it.

03:17.217 --> 03:20.512
And we were always 
motivated to do things.

03:20.512 --> 03:24.975
I remember, for example, 
when he gave me a new Bible,

03:24.975 --> 03:28.937
and he wrote to me in that Bible,

03:28.937 --> 03:33.942
“May this book always be
the motivating force in your life.”

03:33.942 --> 03:36.278
Several times he told me:

03:36.695 --> 03:39.281
“Please never,

03:39.281 --> 03:42.284
“never give up in your service.

03:43.035 --> 03:47.039
“Jehovah is your Father,
and you have to serve him

03:50.918 --> 03:52.920
all your life.”

03:54.004 --> 03:57.508
The Almighty has children
that failed to respond,

03:59.009 --> 04:01.345
much like any other parent.

04:02.471 --> 04:04.473
God does not force anyone.

04:05.974 --> 04:08.977
He respects our free will very much.

04:09.812 --> 04:13.440
So we wanted them
to build their own future.

04:15.067 --> 04:18.779
I always felt 
that my children were not my own,

04:18.779 --> 04:22.908
but it was Jehovah
who kindly put them into our hands.

04:23.534 --> 04:27.287
He entrusted them to us
so that we could care for them.

04:28.413 --> 04:31.875
And then when we have done our part,
let them fly.

04:44.513 --> 04:46.849
My parents always encouraged us

04:46.849 --> 04:49.476
to pursue full-time service,

04:49.476 --> 04:51.937
even if that meant
moving far away from home.

04:54.940 --> 04:58.986
My husband and I are serving
as field missionaries in Klaipeda, Lithuania.

04:59.444 --> 05:01.530
I know I will be grateful for all eternity

05:01.530 --> 05:04.992
that I used my youth to serve Jehovah,

05:04.992 --> 05:09.788
and that I didn’t waste
my years of my young age

05:09.788 --> 05:11.540
doing things for this world.

05:14.626 --> 05:18.046
My wife and I serve
in the Portugal branch office.

05:18.046 --> 05:22.342
If Jehovah is happy,
if my parents are happy, I’m happy too.

05:22.342 --> 05:25.095
I’m really sure
that they like what we’re doing.

05:25.095 --> 05:26.346
They are happy with that.

05:28.265 --> 05:31.351
We rejoice that our children
are giving their best

05:31.351 --> 05:33.687
to their Creator and making him happy.

05:33.687 --> 05:36.106
Jehovah deserves that.

05:38.442 --> 05:40.319
Of course, we miss our children,

05:40.319 --> 05:42.529
and we would like to have them around,

05:42.529 --> 05:45.866
but we are very happy for them

05:45.866 --> 05:58.526
for having the privilege
of serving Jehovah the way they are.

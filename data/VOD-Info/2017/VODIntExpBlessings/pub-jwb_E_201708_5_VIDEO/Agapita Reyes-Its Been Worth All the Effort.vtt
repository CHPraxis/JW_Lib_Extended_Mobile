00:07.443 --> 00:11.000
It’s not easy raising kids in the truth,


00:12.240 --> 00:16.000
and I had ten. 


00:18.122 --> 00:22.500
I learned the truth when I was 19. 


00:22.500 --> 00:25.587
Some Witnesses came to preach in our town, 


00:25.587 --> 00:27.882
and my father offered them a place to stay. 


00:27.882 --> 00:30.425
He spoke with them all through the night 


00:30.425 --> 00:34.388
and then announced excitedly 
that he had found the truth. 


00:34.388 --> 00:37.473
Eventually, I was baptized in the 1950’s.


00:37.473 --> 00:40.768
My husband was favorable toward the truth 


00:40.768 --> 00:44.063
but got involved 
in political affairs in the community, 


00:44.063 --> 00:47.000
and from there 
he began his political career. 


00:49.193 --> 00:50.946
When I read 1 Peter 3:1, 2, 


00:50.947 --> 00:54.617
I understood that I needed 
to be in subjection to my husband, 


00:54.617 --> 00:56.619
with the hope that he could be won over 


00:56.618 --> 00:59.288
“without a word” by means of my conduct.


00:59.288 --> 01:01.290
When my children were young, 


01:01.290 --> 01:04.125
I made a weekly Bible study program 
for each of them, 


01:04.125 --> 01:06.128
and as they grew up, 


01:06.128 --> 01:10.298
the older kids helped me 
with their younger siblings.


01:10.298 --> 01:13.760
I remember Mom always made 
an effort to teach me how to preach.


01:13.760 --> 01:17.973
I would write presentations 
for the ministry on pieces of paper, 


01:17.973 --> 01:22.268
and the kids would practice while they 
did their chores around the house. 


01:22.268 --> 01:26.273
We set aside time 
one day a week for our family study.


01:26.273 --> 01:27.858
It could be anything


01:27.858 --> 01:31.445
—a sack of potatoes, 
a sack of flour, or a house plant. 


01:31.445 --> 01:32.863
She would tell me: 


01:32.863 --> 01:35.698
“Imagine that this is a person 
you meet in field service. 


01:35.698 --> 01:37.701
What would you say to them?” 


01:37.702 --> 01:39.704
When I finished, she would say to me, 


01:39.703 --> 01:41.705
“The way you did it just now, 


01:41.705 --> 01:44.000
do it like that when you 
go out in the ministry.”


01:45.667 --> 01:49.170
My mom was very creative. 


01:49.170 --> 01:54.000
She would assign us to play 
the part of different Bible characters.


01:55.593 --> 01:59.263
My mom taught us to appreciate the truth 


01:59.263 --> 02:01.683
through her example.


02:01.683 --> 02:05.145
I served as a regular pioneer for many years, 


02:05.145 --> 02:08.648
and I encouraged my kids 
to reach out for spiritual goals. 


02:08.648 --> 02:11.068
My daughter left home at the age of 18 


02:11.068 --> 02:14.946
to serve as a special pioneer.


02:14.947 --> 02:16.949
Later, my oldest son did the same. 


02:16.948 --> 02:21.000
These two proved to be excellent examples 
for their younger brothers.


02:22.370 --> 02:25.582
Raising my son Noé was a challenge. 


02:25.582 --> 02:27.250
He was the youngest, 


02:27.250 --> 02:31.172
and at a very young age, 
he was diagnosed with epilepsy. 


02:31.172 --> 02:33.590
Despite his limitations, 


02:33.590 --> 02:37.177
he was able to serve 
as a ministerial servant 


02:37.177 --> 02:38.679
and regular pioneer. 


02:38.678 --> 02:41.681
He fought his illness for more than 40 years, 


02:41.682 --> 02:44.000
before passing away recently.


02:45.810 --> 02:49.000
Losing my husband in death 
dealt me another blow. 


02:50.523 --> 02:53.318
Now my health and my memory are fading. 


02:53.318 --> 02:55.320
I can’t do as much 


02:55.320 --> 02:57.447
in the ministry as before. 


02:57.447 --> 03:01.910
But even so, thanks to the help 
of the brothers in the congregation, 


03:01.910 --> 03:05.000
I’m not giving up. 


03:06.207 --> 03:09.084
Even though my husband was not a Witness, 


03:09.083 --> 03:12.086
I respected him as the head of the family.


03:12.087 --> 03:14.549
I will never forget the moment 


03:14.548 --> 03:17.000
when my husband asked me 
to study the Bible with him. 


03:18.635 --> 03:21.430
I remember 
that my eldest son gave the talk, 


03:21.430 --> 03:25.475
and his father was 
among the candidates for baptism. 


03:25.475 --> 03:29.228
Forty-two years 
after I received the Kingdom message, 


03:29.228 --> 03:32.065
my husband was baptized. 


03:32.065 --> 03:34.317
Another great blessing 
was seeing my children 


03:34.317 --> 03:39.907
grow in the truth 
and use their youth to serve Jehovah. 


03:39.907 --> 03:42.367
Some have served as special pioneers, 


03:42.367 --> 03:45.745
circuit overseers, or in Bethel.


03:45.745 --> 03:47.748
If it wasn’t for her help 


03:47.748 --> 03:49.791
and the support of my siblings, 


03:49.792 --> 03:53.795
perhaps we wouldn’t be part 
of the organization today. 


03:53.795 --> 03:58.000
But thanks to her, 
we started out on the best course in life. 


04:01.010 --> 04:05.682
Words cannot express 
how grateful I am to her.


04:05.682 --> 04:07.684
I now find great joy 


04:07.683 --> 04:11.020
in seeing my grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren 


04:11.020 --> 04:13.357
follow their parents’ example. 


04:13.357 --> 04:15.442
Thinking about all I have experienced 


04:15.442 --> 04:18.320
in over 60 years of service to Jehovah


04:18.320 --> 04:21.198
—raising my ten children in the truth, 


04:21.198 --> 04:24.743
my husband becoming a servant of Jehovah, 


04:24.743 --> 04:28.038
and seeing 30 members 
of my family in full-time service—


04:28.038 --> 04:30.331
I can do nothing 
but thank Jehovah 


04:30.332 --> 04:32.459
for his blessings. 


04:32.458 --> 04:52.291
It’s been worth all the effort.

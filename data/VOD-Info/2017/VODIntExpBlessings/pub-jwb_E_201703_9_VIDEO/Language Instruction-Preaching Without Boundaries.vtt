00:01.483 --> 00:05.955
Have you ever considered 
helping out in a foreign-language field? 


00:05.955 --> 00:09.958
Perhaps there is a need 
in your local circuit. 


00:09.958 --> 00:12.161
All over the earth, 


00:12.162 --> 00:16.099
the organization 
provides language courses 


00:16.098 --> 00:21.003
with the goal of reaching 
every nation, tribe, tongue, and people 


00:21.003 --> 00:24.773
with the good news of God’s Word. 


00:24.773 --> 00:28.445
Brother Juan Carlos Chacón 


00:28.445 --> 00:31.613
serves as a special pioneer 


00:31.613 --> 00:34.883
in the rapidly growing Shuar language field


00:34.883 --> 00:37.386
in Ecuador.


00:37.387 --> 00:39.889
He was recently asked to attend


00:39.888 --> 00:42.625
a course at the local branch 


00:42.625 --> 00:45.628
to become a language teacher 


00:45.628 --> 00:48.330
so that he could help 
willing publishers 


00:48.330 --> 00:51.000
learn the language.


00:53.737 --> 01:02.945
[Speaking Shuar]


01:02.945 --> 01:06.850
It has been said before, 


01:06.850 --> 01:09.952
“This is a language of the Devil”


01:09.952 --> 01:13.355
—that it should be forgotten. 


01:13.355 --> 01:16.000
It serves no purpose. 


01:19.162 --> 01:23.332
But to Jehovah, 


01:23.332 --> 01:26.000
no nation is insignificant.


01:30.140 --> 01:32.708
I grew up in an area 
of the Ecuadorian jungle 


01:32.708 --> 01:34.710
where there is 
a large community 


01:34.710 --> 01:37.000
of Shuar people.


01:40.483 --> 01:42.518
Like many native languages, 


01:42.518 --> 01:46.000
Shuar is very complex. 


01:50.227 --> 01:52.729
We need many, many workers in the field. 


01:52.728 --> 01:54.996
But if we don’t give them a foundation, 


01:54.997 --> 01:58.535
if we don’t help them 
or give them a little push, 


01:58.535 --> 02:01.000
it’s difficult for them to enter this field.


02:03.005 --> 02:06.508
I received an invitation to attend 


02:06.508 --> 02:09.000
a seminar for language instructors. 


02:13.850 --> 02:17.353
There were 58 students in the class, 


02:17.353 --> 02:22.000
representing 16 different languages 
or language groups.


02:32.302 --> 02:34.737
We are learning 
fantastic teaching techniques, 


02:34.737 --> 02:37.000
real techniques that work.


02:42.578 --> 02:45.715
The instructor told us how humor helps 
our minds to create a world of connections, 


02:45.715 --> 02:48.000
which stimulates our brain.


02:57.193 --> 02:59.861
Yeah, I’m like a small child 


02:59.862 --> 03:01.899
when it comes to drawing. 


03:01.898 --> 03:03.000
I never learned to draw well. 


03:05.502 --> 03:07.537
We draw a scene, 


03:07.537 --> 03:09.705
and starting with our native language 


03:09.705 --> 03:12.642
along with large gestures, 


03:12.642 --> 03:15.077
we act out a dialogue.


03:15.077 --> 03:17.080
Little by little,


03:17.080 --> 03:20.000
we convert the scene
into the new language.


03:39.735 --> 03:41.737
What scares me? 


03:41.737 --> 03:43.000
That I’ve never done this before. 


03:44.807 --> 03:48.000
This will be my first time. 


03:49.245 --> 03:54.000
I don’t have any experience 
teaching languages.


04:05.027 --> 04:07.964
Although I felt intimidated by this, 


04:07.963 --> 04:12.000
I knew that with Jehovah 
all things are possible.


04:17.340 --> 04:22.000
Welcome to the first day 
of the Shuar language course.


04:38.393 --> 04:42.298
The techniques they offered us 
in the course were like a box of tools 


04:42.298 --> 04:45.901
that we need to study more carefully 
and see how to apply them 


04:45.902 --> 04:48.000
in each circumstance.


04:52.542 --> 04:54.544
When we are in the territory, 


04:54.543 --> 04:57.980
we see how people’s eyes 
light up when they learn 


04:57.980 --> 04:59.982
the name of God. 


04:59.982 --> 05:03.000
Just seeing that there is so much need 
for them to learn the truth, 


05:04.920 --> 05:07.290
that has motivated us to come here 


05:07.290 --> 05:10.000
and continue serving here.


05:16.065 --> 05:18.067
Since God has created us,


05:18.067 --> 05:20.537
we know that he will
never abandon us.


05:20.537 --> 05:22.539
He thinks about us all the time,


05:22.538 --> 05:25.708
and he loves us very much.


05:25.708 --> 05:27.743
I didn’t know that before.


05:27.743 --> 05:29.511
I feel so happy now 


05:29.512 --> 05:33.000
because I can really understand 
the Word of God.


05:35.385 --> 05:39.555
Being in an isolated group
far from other congregations,


05:39.555 --> 05:41.790
my wife and I 
have felt every day 


05:41.790 --> 05:44.527
how real Jehovah is.


05:44.527 --> 05:46.529
Jehovah is now looking 


05:46.528 --> 05:49.798
and giving his attention 
to these small places, 


05:49.798 --> 05:52.335
no matter how small they are. 


05:52.335 --> 05:56.805
If people have a good heart 
and want to serve Jehovah, 


05:56.805 --> 06:00.000
he will send workers
to give the help that is needed.


06:01.377 --> 06:05.782
And in reality, this moves us 
to say to him with all of our heart, 


06:05.782 --> 06:21.415
“Thank you, Jehovah.”

00:08.487 --> 00:12.283
I was the first to start studying the Bible.

00:12.283 --> 00:15.744
After that, I started studying too.

00:15.744 --> 00:17.746
After watching them for a year,

00:17.746 --> 00:19.748
I began studying too.

00:19.748 --> 00:22.793
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:22.793 --> 00:25.796
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:27.214 --> 00:30.217
We saved our allowance 
to take the bus to meetings.

00:30.217 --> 00:32.928
But sometimes
when we were short of money—

00:32.928 --> 00:35.723
My sisters let me ride the bus,

00:35.723 --> 00:39.435
since I’m the youngest,
and they would walk.

00:39.435 --> 00:42.646
We used to walk
an hour and a half each way.

00:45.107 --> 00:48.861
Meetings were so important to us 
that we never felt it was a burden.

00:48.861 --> 00:51.655
May 2007.

00:51.655 --> 00:54.700
For me, it was October 2006.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.746
I was baptized in October 2005.

01:00.122 --> 01:02.583
Three years later,
I spent a week

01:02.583 --> 01:05.628
with a special pioneer 
who was serving in the countryside.

01:06.921 --> 01:09.590
We prayed together every night

01:09.590 --> 01:12.760
and read life stories from The Watchtower.

01:12.760 --> 01:17.097
I told Jehovah
that I wanted to be just like her.

01:18.182 --> 01:21.977
Although my relatives 
were unhappy with my decision,

01:21.977 --> 01:25.856
with Jehovah’s help,
I decided to become a pioneer.

01:25.856 --> 01:29.443
I followed her example,
and I became a pioneer too.

01:30.319 --> 01:33.697
I was working six days a week 
to support my family,

01:33.697 --> 01:38.035
so I prayed to Jehovah 
for the opportunity to become a pioneer.

01:38.035 --> 01:40.996
After my boss reduced
my work to five days a week,

01:40.996 --> 01:43.499
I started pioneering.

01:45.209 --> 01:47.795
Pioneer service gives you the opportunity

01:47.795 --> 01:50.047
to serve Jehovah more fully.

01:50.047 --> 01:54.635
Working closely with Jehovah,
I really feel part of his family.

01:55.719 --> 01:59.431
My relationship with Jehovah
has gotten stronger.

01:59.431 --> 02:03.477
When I pray now,
it feels like I’m talking to my close friend.

02:03.477 --> 02:06.355
It allows you to expand your ministry.

02:06.355 --> 02:10.651
I became a special pioneer in June 2013.

02:10.651 --> 02:15.531
I’ve served at Bethel since September 2013.

02:15.531 --> 02:20.160
In April 2014,
I was appointed a special pioneer.

02:21.245 --> 02:24.248
Now I can serve Jehovah more fully.

02:24.248 --> 02:28.002
My appreciation for Jehovah has deepened.

02:28.002 --> 02:32.715
Our mother, who had opposed us,
became a pioneer too.

02:32.715 --> 02:34.383
Full-time service is—

02:34.383 --> 02:43.832
—really awesome!

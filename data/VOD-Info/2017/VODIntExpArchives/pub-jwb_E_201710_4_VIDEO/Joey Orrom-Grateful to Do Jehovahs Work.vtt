00:05.525 --> 00:07.528
I had the privilege for two years


00:07.528 --> 00:10.446
of sitting at the same table
as Sister Orrom for morning worship. 


00:10.447 --> 00:13.075
She expected nothing and appreciated


00:13.075 --> 00:14.702
everything that you did for her.


00:14.702 --> 00:18.205
Sister Orrom
was affectionately known as Joey. 


00:18.205 --> 00:20.540
And if you take the “e” out of Joey, 


00:20.540 --> 00:23.752
you’re left with the English word “joy,”


00:23.752 --> 00:25.420
and that summed her up. 


00:25.420 --> 00:27.965
My impression of Joey
when I first met her


00:27.965 --> 00:30.550
was here is this frail old lady. 


00:30.550 --> 00:33.512
But then when you
started to speak to Joey, 


00:33.512 --> 00:36.724
you were tapping
into a tremendous depth.


00:36.723 --> 00:38.350
About the age of 20, 


00:38.350 --> 00:39.518
round about that time,


00:39.518 --> 00:41.145
I had the heavenly calling. 


00:41.145 --> 00:42.688
That was a big battle. 


00:42.688 --> 00:46.691
I couldn’t understand why Jehovah
would use a person like me. 


00:46.692 --> 00:49.279
And when I was 21,


00:49.278 --> 00:51.988
I got into pioneering, in 1939. 


00:51.988 --> 00:54.031
But the police were after me


00:54.032 --> 00:57.870
because I wouldn’t join the armed forces,
and I was tried under a new act. 


00:57.870 --> 01:00.413
And they kept taking me
into a side room and saying,


01:00.413 --> 01:03.041
“If you will say you are not connected
with Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


01:03.042 --> 01:06.254
not connected with the Watch Tower,
you’ll have a walk away.” 


01:06.253 --> 01:08.671
I said: “I am connected
with the Watch Tower. 


01:08.672 --> 01:10.882
I’m proud to be connected
with the Watch Tower.” 


01:10.882 --> 01:14.262
And they said,
“Then they are directing you.” 


01:14.262 --> 01:19.182
I said, “No, my stand of not doing
as you wish is my own personal stand.” 


01:19.182 --> 01:20.267
So this went on. 


01:20.267 --> 01:23.020
In the end, they sent me
to prison just for two months 


01:23.020 --> 01:24.355
and then let me out. 


01:24.355 --> 01:26.357
I partnered with another sister, 


01:26.357 --> 01:29.944
and she and I went to Northern Ireland 


01:29.943 --> 01:31.695
and pioneered there for 18 months. 


01:31.695 --> 01:33.947
And it was in Northern Ireland
that we had our call to Gilead.


01:33.947 --> 01:36.659
In 1948, Joey was invited to Gilead, 


01:36.658 --> 01:39.035
and that was the 11th class.


01:39.035 --> 01:42.790
It left an impression on me, 
which I will never ever, ever forget. 


01:42.790 --> 01:46.293
You pick up that spirit 
of good behavior, of love. 


01:46.293 --> 01:48.920
It’s something that leaves
its mark, or it should. 


01:48.920 --> 01:52.257
It has left its mark on me
—very, very much so. 


01:52.257 --> 01:54.760
One thing Brother Knorr impressed on us:


01:54.760 --> 01:58.972
“You’ll be three years on your assignment
before you really love it.” 


01:58.972 --> 02:01.642
And it was true 
because it was a hard assignment.


02:01.642 --> 02:05.187
After Gilead, 
she was assigned to be a missionary


02:05.187 --> 02:07.189
in Dublin,
in the Irish Republic. 


02:07.188 --> 02:09.941
That was the time when Catholic priests


02:09.942 --> 02:12.987
used to organize mobs against the pioneers. 


02:12.987 --> 02:15.030
She was full of joy, 
but that didn’t mean to say


02:15.030 --> 02:16.740
that she’d had an easy life.


02:16.740 --> 02:19.283
We never went out from door to door
without being mobbed


02:19.283 --> 02:22.453
and attacked and beaten up
and thrown around. 


02:22.453 --> 02:25.081
And you could only do
a few houses in a row, 


02:25.082 --> 02:27.125
and you’d have to get away very quickly. 


02:27.125 --> 02:28.877
But we made a very good name. 


02:28.877 --> 02:31.172
People got to know
we were completely neutral.


02:31.172 --> 02:34.842
They chose four of us
to work the business property, 


02:34.842 --> 02:37.094
and I got some studies
going in their offices. 


02:37.093 --> 02:41.098
But one place I went into,
I walked the length of this draper shop,


02:41.098 --> 02:44.141
and I asked if I could go
into the manager’s office. 


02:44.142 --> 02:46.812
As I went in, I didn’t say a word. 


02:46.812 --> 02:49.272
I didn’t open my mouth
and even say good morning, 


02:49.272 --> 02:52.317
but this man stood up,
and he said, “Russellite!” 


02:52.317 --> 02:55.320
And he took hold of me
by the scruff of my neck


02:55.320 --> 02:57.782
and the seat of my pants,
and he lifted me up


02:57.782 --> 03:00.742
and he carried me
the length of the store. 


03:00.742 --> 03:05.289
Well, like a silly one,
I should’ve gone heavy on him, you see. 


03:05.288 --> 03:07.415
But instead of that, 
I let my legs paddle


03:07.415 --> 03:10.418
and I was hanging onto my book bag,
not wanting to lose it. 


03:10.418 --> 03:13.046
And when he got 
to the front door, the staff, 


03:13.047 --> 03:15.632
their eyes were absolutely aghast
at what was happening. 


03:15.632 --> 03:18.344
He opened his front door
and threw me out, literally. 


03:18.343 --> 03:21.180
And I went zoom!
just managed to go zoom! 


03:21.180 --> 03:24.348
And one of the brothers was passing,


03:24.348 --> 03:26.935
and he caught me
—caught me steady—


03:26.935 --> 03:28.353
and said, 
“Whatever is going on?” 


03:28.353 --> 03:30.355
And I couldn’t stop laughing. 


03:30.355 --> 03:32.357
To me it was very, very funny. 


03:32.357 --> 03:35.777
The rest were so cross about it,
but I wasn’t at all cross. 


03:35.777 --> 03:37.279
I thought it was quite hilarious. 


03:37.278 --> 03:40.823
I could see myself being carried
through this shop sky-high. 


03:40.823 --> 03:42.575
Things like that happened.


03:42.575 --> 03:45.370
These experiences 
did not dampen her zeal. 


03:45.370 --> 03:48.415
She always retained that missionary spirit.


03:48.415 --> 03:50.167
I first met Joey


03:50.167 --> 03:51.585
when I was commuting to Bethel


03:51.585 --> 03:53.170
in the infirmary.


03:53.170 --> 03:57.800
She was sitting on that old-fashioned chair
with this huge Bible,


03:57.800 --> 04:01.762
and she stayed there hours reading the Bible,


04:01.762 --> 04:02.972
praying to Jehovah.


04:02.972 --> 04:05.890
Often, when you came in, 
she’d be in the middle of Bible reading. 


04:05.890 --> 04:07.517
And she’d be saying something like,


04:07.517 --> 04:09.729
“Daniel has just been thrown
into the lion’s den!” 


04:09.728 --> 04:11.730
or “Oh, Jehovah is really angry. 


04:11.730 --> 04:13.523
He’s thundering from the heavens!” 


04:13.523 --> 04:14.733
And it made me think, ‘Wow! 


04:14.733 --> 04:16.818
‘She must have read
the Bible so many times,


04:16.818 --> 04:19.905
but every time it was as if it was
happening right in front of her.’


04:19.905 --> 04:23.158
Right up until she became incapacitated,


04:23.158 --> 04:25.368
she was conducting Bible studies


04:25.368 --> 04:28.038
and helping people
to come to know Jehovah.


04:28.038 --> 04:31.166
She was looking forward
to her heavenly reward. 


04:31.167 --> 04:34.670
And for her that was the culmination


04:34.670 --> 04:36.922
of a life of joy in Jehovah’s service


04:36.922 --> 04:40.467
and that she was just transferring
to her next assignment.


04:40.467 --> 04:42.344
I’m very, very grateful for work. 


04:42.343 --> 04:44.261
In fact, often in my prayers,


04:44.262 --> 04:47.099
I’ll pray to Jehovah that I’ll have
some good work to do today. 


04:47.098 --> 05:02.635
I’m very grateful to have work to do.

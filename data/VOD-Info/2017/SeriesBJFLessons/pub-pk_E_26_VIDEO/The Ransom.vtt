00:06.853 --> 00:10.061
Thank you so much 
for your visit.


00:10.062 --> 00:13.000
See you later, 
Sister Elsa.


00:19.895 --> 00:21.895
Mom, 


00:21.895 --> 00:24.478
is Elsa going to die?


00:24.478 --> 00:27.000
Ah, we don’t know yet.


00:28.437 --> 00:31.937
Can’t Jehovah just fix her? 


00:31.937 --> 00:35.979
Oh, honey. 
Oh. 


00:35.978 --> 00:38.395
He’s already done 
something to help her. 


00:38.395 --> 00:41.062
Do you remember 
who he sent?


00:41.062 --> 00:43.562
Jesus? 


00:43.562 --> 00:47.000
But how does 
that help her now?


00:48.062 --> 00:50.062
Hmm, 


00:50.062 --> 00:52.062
do you remember how long 


00:52.062 --> 00:54.104
Adam was supposed to live?


00:54.103 --> 00:56.478
Forever! 


00:56.478 --> 00:58.561
But then 
he didn’t listen to Jehovah 


00:58.562 --> 01:00.562
and ruined everything.


01:00.562 --> 01:03.479
Since we are 
all Adam’s children,  


01:03.478 --> 01:07.020
that means 
we also get sick, old, 


01:07.020 --> 01:09.437
and eventually die. 


01:09.437 --> 01:11.937
But what hope 
did Jehovah give us?


01:11.937 --> 01:14.645
He sent Jesus 
to give his life 


01:14.645 --> 01:16.978
in place of the one 
that Adam lost.


01:16.978 --> 01:19.956
How could he do that?


01:19.957 --> 01:21.437
Because he 
was perfect like Adam, 


01:21.437 --> 01:23.604
but he obeyed Jehovah!


01:23.603 --> 01:25.603
Yes! 


01:25.603 --> 01:27.270
Thanks to Jehovah 


01:27.270 --> 01:28.978
for giving us Jesus 
as the ransom. 


01:28.978 --> 01:30.645
Now we all have the hope 


01:30.645 --> 01:33.603
of living forever in Paradise! 


01:33.603 --> 01:35.645
And when we are going 
through tough times, 


01:35.645 --> 01:36.853
like right now, 


01:36.853 --> 01:41.000
that hope can get us through.


01:50.437 --> 01:52.000
Elsa? 


01:54.465 --> 02:07.208
Sister Elsa!

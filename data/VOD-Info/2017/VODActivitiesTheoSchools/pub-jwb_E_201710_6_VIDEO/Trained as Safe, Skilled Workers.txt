00:07 There were a few factors
00:09 that created the need at Bethel
00:11 for a more structured training program.
00:14 One of those factors included the regular changeover in personnel.
00:19 The brothers have to be more versatile
00:20 in their assignments.
00:21 They may have to do tasks they
00:23 previously weren’t trained on.
00:25 Printing equipment became more technologically advanced;
00:28 our building systems became more complicated;
00:32 computer systems were now starting
00:34 to be used to control virtually everything.
00:36 Well, I feel like Bethel has definitely always been good about training,
00:41 but especially now.
00:43 I think everyone sees  the need to continue investing
00:45 in the brothers and sisters that are currently at Bethel.
00:49 I don’t think it’s possible for someone
00:51 to know less about the trades
00:53 than I did when I started.
00:54 I remember my first reaction
00:56 when I was invited to help
00:58 in electrical was fear.
01:00 So when I received my assignment,
01:02 I found out that it involved
01:05 running the heavy equipment.
01:07 So I called my parents.
01:08 I was really excited about it.
01:10 I said, “Mom and Dad, guess what I get to do?”
01:12 And Dad said, “OK, Son.
01:15 Well, did you tell them that you don’t know how to drive?”
01:19 It was decided to pull a group
01:21 of highly experienced,  highly skilled brothers
01:25 to concentrate  on developing and teaching
01:28 repeatable, consistent classes
01:31 that could bring people’s skill levels up to what was needed.
01:35 We teach well over 100 different classes
01:37 in 12 major categories.
01:39 Here at Bethel,  I’ve probably been
01:41 a part of over 30 different classes,
01:44 so it’s been a variety,  depending on
01:47 the needs at the time  of the assignment.
01:48 I would estimate  that I’ve taken about 15
01:52 or 20 different courses from safety and training
01:54 over the course of my 13 years  in learning a trade.
01:57 I’ve become certified
01:58 in at least these seven different licensed requirements.
02:02 We teach people technical skills,
02:03 but that’s not the sole purpose
02:05 of the training.
02:06 If you aren’t skilled in safety,
02:07 you can’t be skilled in your trade and vice versa.
02:10 The objective in all of our safety courses
02:13 is to get them to view safety the same way Jehovah views it
02:17 —as a reflection of their spirituality.
02:19 So training in safety is essential.
02:22 So our goal is to take them
02:24 into the classroom
02:25 and give them some time
02:26 to consider the theoretical.
02:27 And then we take them out
02:29 where there is a lab set up,  and we have them do some tests on it.
02:31 Typically, they will tell us
02:33 that they’ve been able to learn  more in a week
02:37 than what they have learned in a year of trade school.
02:39 We’ve done over 60,000 instances of training.
02:43 And so now receiving this training,
02:45 it provides an area or an aspect
02:48 in which I can give  my 100 percent to Jehovah.
02:51 You see it in their eyes.
02:53 They’re just so happy
02:54 that they now have maybe a new skill
02:58 or a new understanding that they can use to benefit Jehovah.
03:02 I love the fact that I came into Bethel with virtually no experience.
03:06 And not only did I  receive a trade that I could use
03:09 to carry out a work  that glorifies Jehovah
03:13 but I was trained well enough that I can share that with others,
03:16 and they can be trained too.
03:18 Helping someone else  to go from that feeling
03:21 of not knowing anything  to feeling productive
03:25 and feeling like they’re  contributing is a real joy for me.
03:28 And they can take what they learn
03:29 wherever they go.
03:31 The confidence that people leave with once they’ve received
03:35 that investment —it’s confidence that they can carry out
03:37 whatever assignment Jehovah has given them,
03:40 and the confidence that Jehovah is going to train them
03:42 for whatever is being asked of them.
03:44 I think if younger brothers and sisters
03:46 are trying to learn a skill so that they can come to Bethel,
03:49 that’s commendable,  but more important is spirituality.
03:53 Let Jehovah “finish your training.”
03:55 In regard to training, we’re really only getting started.
03:57 The training that we are getting  in this system of things by Jehovah,
04:02 and especially related to safety,
04:04 is absolutely going to be vital in the new world.
04:08 I can imagine the idea
04:09 of being able to use some of the things I’ve learned
04:11 to figure out how
04:13 we can use the natural resources in a way without using them up.
04:16 We know that we serve a God  who is known as the “Grand Instructor.”
04:20 So the things that we’re teaching and training right now,
04:23 it can only expand in the future.
04:26 And as long as you let him train you, you’re going to be all right.

00:07.110 --> 00:09.028
There were a few factors


00:09.028 --> 00:11.531
that created the need at Bethel 


00:11.532 --> 00:14.159
for a more structured training program. 


00:14.158 --> 00:19.163
One of those factors included
the regular changeover in personnel.


00:19.163 --> 00:20.875
The brothers have to be more versatile


00:20.875 --> 00:21.875
in their assignments. 


00:21.875 --> 00:23.752
They may have to do tasks they


00:23.752 --> 00:25.004
previously weren’t trained on.


00:25.003 --> 00:28.548
Printing equipment became
more technologically advanced; 


00:28.548 --> 00:32.595
our building systems
became more complicated; 


00:32.595 --> 00:34.597
computer systems were now starting


00:34.597 --> 00:36.932
to be used to control virtually everything.


00:36.932 --> 00:41.354
Well, I feel like Bethel has definitely
always been good about training,


00:41.353 --> 00:43.313
but especially now. 


00:43.313 --> 00:45.983
I think everyone sees 
the need to continue investing


00:45.983 --> 00:49.403
in the brothers and sisters
that are currently at Bethel.


00:49.403 --> 00:51.905
I don’t think it’s possible for someone


00:51.905 --> 00:53.698
to know less about the trades 


00:53.698 --> 00:54.950
than I did when I started.


00:54.950 --> 00:56.577
I remember my first reaction


00:56.577 --> 00:58.079
when I was invited to help 


00:58.078 --> 01:00.455
in electrical was fear.


01:00.455 --> 01:02.583
So when I received my assignment,


01:02.583 --> 01:05.043
I found out that it involved


01:05.043 --> 01:07.211
running the heavy equipment. 


01:07.212 --> 01:08.547
So I called my parents. 


01:08.547 --> 01:10.549
I was really excited about it. 


01:10.548 --> 01:12.760
I said, “Mom and Dad,
guess what I get to do?” 


01:12.760 --> 01:15.095
And Dad said, “OK, Son. 


01:15.095 --> 01:19.642
Well, did you tell them
that you don’t know how to drive?”


01:19.642 --> 01:21.852
It was decided to pull a group


01:21.852 --> 01:25.022
of highly experienced, 
highly skilled brothers


01:25.022 --> 01:28.484
to concentrate 
on developing and teaching


01:28.483 --> 01:31.070
repeatable, consistent classes


01:31.070 --> 01:35.615
that could bring people’s skill levels
up to what was needed.


01:35.615 --> 01:37.492
We teach well over 100 different classes


01:37.492 --> 01:39.954
in 12 major categories.


01:39.953 --> 01:41.830
Here at Bethel, 
I’ve probably been


01:41.830 --> 01:44.248
a part of over 30 different classes,


01:44.248 --> 01:47.043
so it’s been a variety, 
depending on


01:47.043 --> 01:48.878
the needs at the time 
of the assignment.


01:48.878 --> 01:52.173
I would estimate 
that I’ve taken about 15


01:52.173 --> 01:54.718
or 20 different courses
from safety and training 


01:54.718 --> 01:57.303
over the course of my 13 years 
in learning a trade. 


01:57.303 --> 01:58.763
I’ve become certified


01:58.763 --> 02:02.350
in at least these
seven different licensed requirements.


02:02.350 --> 02:03.768
We teach people technical skills, 


02:03.768 --> 02:05.353
but that’s not the sole purpose 


02:05.353 --> 02:06.396
of the training.


02:06.397 --> 02:07.732
If you aren’t skilled in safety, 


02:07.732 --> 02:10.192
you can’t be skilled
in your trade and vice versa.


02:10.192 --> 02:13.154
The objective in all of our safety courses


02:13.153 --> 02:17.031
is to get them to view safety
the same way Jehovah views it


02:17.032 --> 02:19.369
—as a reflection of their spirituality.


02:19.368 --> 02:22.788
So training in safety is essential.


02:22.788 --> 02:24.121
So our goal is to take them


02:24.122 --> 02:25.207
into the classroom


02:25.207 --> 02:26.292
and give them some time


02:26.292 --> 02:27.877
to consider the theoretical. 


02:27.877 --> 02:29.002
And then we take them out 


02:29.002 --> 02:31.672
where there is a lab set up, 
and we have them do some tests on it. 


02:31.672 --> 02:33.674
Typically, they will tell us 


02:33.673 --> 02:37.051
that they’ve been able to learn 
more in a week 


02:37.052 --> 02:39.680
than what they have learned
in a year of trade school.


02:39.680 --> 02:43.808
We’ve done over 60,000 instances of training.


02:43.808 --> 02:45.810
And so now receiving this training, 


02:45.810 --> 02:48.522
it provides an area or an aspect


02:48.522 --> 02:51.984
in which I can give 
my 100 percent to Jehovah.


02:51.983 --> 02:53.568
You see it in their eyes. 


02:53.568 --> 02:54.986
They’re just so happy


02:54.987 --> 02:58.074
that they now have maybe a new skill 


02:58.073 --> 03:02.160
or a new understanding
that they can use to benefit Jehovah.


03:02.160 --> 03:06.082
I love the fact that I came
into Bethel with virtually no experience. 


03:06.082 --> 03:09.835
And not only did I 
receive a trade that I could use


03:09.835 --> 03:13.380
to carry out a work 
that glorifies Jehovah 


03:13.380 --> 03:16.508
but I was trained well enough
that I can share that with others, 


03:16.508 --> 03:18.135
and they can be trained too.


03:18.135 --> 03:21.847
Helping someone else 
to go from that feeling 


03:21.847 --> 03:25.017
of not knowing anything 
to feeling productive


03:25.017 --> 03:28.062
and feeling like they’re 
contributing is a real joy for me.


03:28.062 --> 03:29.814
And they can take what they learn


03:29.813 --> 03:31.273
wherever they go.


03:31.273 --> 03:35.068
The confidence that people
leave with once they’ve received 


03:35.068 --> 03:37.988
that investment
—it’s confidence that they can carry out


03:37.988 --> 03:40.073
whatever assignment
Jehovah has given them, 


03:40.073 --> 03:42.325
and the confidence that Jehovah
is going to train them


03:42.325 --> 03:44.662
for whatever is being asked of them. 


03:44.662 --> 03:46.664
I think if younger brothers and sisters


03:46.663 --> 03:49.458
are trying to learn a skill
so that they can come to Bethel,


03:49.458 --> 03:53.586
that’s commendable, 
but more important is spirituality. 


03:53.587 --> 03:55.380
Let Jehovah “finish your training.”


03:55.380 --> 03:57.967
In regard to training,
we’re really only getting started.


03:57.967 --> 04:02.179
The training that we are getting 
in this system of things by Jehovah,


04:02.178 --> 04:04.765
and especially related to safety, 


04:04.765 --> 04:08.102
is absolutely going
to be vital in the new world.


04:08.102 --> 04:09.604
I can imagine the idea


04:09.603 --> 04:11.771
of being able to use
some of the things I’ve learned


04:11.772 --> 04:13.649
to figure out how 


04:13.648 --> 04:16.360
we can use the natural resources
in a way without using them up.


04:16.360 --> 04:20.072
We know that we serve a God 
who is known as the “Grand Instructor.” 


04:20.072 --> 04:23.159
So the things that we’re
teaching and training right now,


04:23.158 --> 04:26.035
it can only expand in the future.


04:26.035 --> 04:41.698
And as long as you let him train you,
you’re going to be all right.

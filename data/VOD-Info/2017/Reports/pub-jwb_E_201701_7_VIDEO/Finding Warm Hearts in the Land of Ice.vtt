00:01.517 --> 00:04.054
Bible translations 
in common languages 


00:04.053 --> 00:07.323
started to spread 
across Europe in the 1500’s, 


00:07.323 --> 00:09.325
but it took much longer 


00:09.325 --> 00:12.295
for more remote places 
to receive the Bible.


00:12.295 --> 00:15.365
It was in 1766 


00:15.365 --> 00:18.802
that the complete Greek Scriptures, 
or New Testament, 


00:18.802 --> 00:21.537
was first published in Greenlandic


00:21.537 --> 00:26.042
—a language spoken today 
by about 50,000 people. 


00:26.042 --> 00:28.344
In August of last year, 


00:28.343 --> 00:32.415
I had the privilege of serving 
a regional convention in Greenland, 


00:32.415 --> 00:35.685
which is overseen 
by the Scandinavia branch. 


00:35.685 --> 00:39.422
Greenland is the neighbor 
to the north of Newfoundland, 


00:39.422 --> 00:41.759
where I pioneered for 11 years. 


00:41.758 --> 00:46.695
So it was a wonderful experience 
to go there and meet our brothers. 


00:46.695 --> 00:51.500
Some 400 brothers and sisters 
traveled at their own expense 


00:51.500 --> 00:56.138
from all over Scandinavia to support 
the convention in Greenland. 


00:56.138 --> 01:00.843
Although Greenland is a land 
covered by large ice caps, 


01:00.843 --> 01:06.000
there are many warm hearts 
yearning for the truth.


01:15.858 --> 01:18.428
I think that Jesus had Greenland in mind 


01:18.428 --> 01:23.566
when he spoke about preaching 
to the most distant part of the earth. 


01:23.567 --> 01:25.669
My name is Arne Mattsson. 


01:25.668 --> 01:30.806
My wife, Karin, and I have lived 
in Greenland for more than 34 years. 


01:30.807 --> 01:34.310
We have traveled all over the country 
preaching about God’s Kingdom, 


01:34.310 --> 01:37.680
and we have had 
some fantastic experiences.


01:37.680 --> 01:42.218
In the 1950’s, two young special pioneers
 came to Greenland 


01:42.218 --> 01:44.453
as the first publishers. 


01:44.453 --> 01:47.190
They traveled by boat 
from town to town 


01:47.190 --> 01:50.260
carrying just tents 
and simple equipment. 


01:50.260 --> 01:52.795
They had to endure 
the cold weather, 


01:52.795 --> 01:55.365
face resistance 
from the local ministers, 


01:55.365 --> 01:59.268
and even fight with sledge dogs 
that took their food. 


01:59.268 --> 02:01.770
But they laid the groundwork 
for the great effort 


02:01.770 --> 02:05.375
that has been made 
to preach to all in this country.


02:05.375 --> 02:08.310
In the 1960’s and ’70’s, 


02:08.310 --> 02:10.880
many families 
moved here from Denmark 


02:10.880 --> 02:12.948
to help with the preaching work. 


02:12.948 --> 02:16.251
I remember how I, 
as a teenager in 1971, 


02:16.252 --> 02:19.622
moved from Denmark 
to Greenland with my family. 


02:19.622 --> 02:22.825
It was not easy 
to learn the language, 


02:22.825 --> 02:25.695
but the brothers and sisters 
from Denmark did their best, 


02:25.695 --> 02:28.000
and it had a good effect 
on the territory.


02:29.565 --> 02:34.670
In 1973, The Watchtower began 
to be published in Greenlandic. 


02:34.670 --> 02:36.672
Just to pronounce the name, 


02:36.672 --> 02:40.075
Napassuliak’ Alapernaerssuivfik, 
was a challenge. 


02:40.075 --> 02:45.000
But it has been a popular magazine 
in Greenland ever since. 


02:46.315 --> 02:48.350
Once, we met a couple 


02:48.350 --> 02:51.687
who for many years 
had received copies of The Watchtower 


02:51.687 --> 02:53.957
when publishers visited their settlement. 


02:53.957 --> 02:57.000
They told us that they often felt depressed 
when they woke up in the morning, 


02:59.895 --> 03:01.998
but when they read the magazine, 
they felt better. 


03:01.998 --> 03:05.000
And they would read 
the same copies over and over again.


03:12.808 --> 03:15.945
When the temperature drops 
and the snow falls, 


03:15.945 --> 03:17.947
the landscape gets covered 


03:17.947 --> 03:20.617
by a beautiful white blanket for half a year, 


03:20.617 --> 03:24.620
so the publishers 
make good use of the summer. 


03:24.620 --> 03:27.490
Some towns and settlements 


03:27.490 --> 03:29.792
only seldom receive a witness. 


03:29.792 --> 03:34.164
There are no roads between the towns, 
but we reach isolated areas by boat. 


03:34.163 --> 03:36.165
When someone shows interest 
in our message, 


03:36.165 --> 03:40.000
the contact 
is maintained by phone. 


03:41.070 --> 03:44.140
Many have great respect for the Bible, 


03:44.140 --> 03:49.078
and so My Book of Bible Stories 
has found its way into many, many homes.


03:49.078 --> 03:53.381
Over a period of 24 years, 
Karin and I have sailed so much 


03:53.382 --> 03:56.252
that it equals a trip 
twice around the globe. 


03:56.252 --> 03:58.755
This has cost a lot of effort and money, 


03:58.755 --> 04:01.023
but with Jehovah’s blessing, 


04:01.023 --> 04:04.293
we have been able 
to continue year after year 


04:04.293 --> 04:07.000
preaching to the distant parts 
of Greenland. 


04:12.835 --> 04:16.905
The preaching work here 
is a great experience. 


04:16.905 --> 04:19.208
People are attentive and kind. 


04:19.208 --> 04:21.510
But it took a long time 
before the first native Greenlander 


04:21.510 --> 04:23.512
was baptized


04:23.512 --> 04:27.000
—actually 18 years of zealous preaching. 


04:28.885 --> 04:32.355
Today, there are 
more than 150 publishers 


04:32.355 --> 04:34.423
in 5 congregations. 


04:34.423 --> 04:36.425
Jehovah has really blessed 


04:36.425 --> 04:41.000
the work that has been done here 
for more than 60 years.


04:49.838 --> 04:52.675
In August 2016, 


04:52.675 --> 04:56.278
a very special convention 
was held in the capital of Nuuk. 


04:56.278 --> 04:59.748
Brothers and sisters 
from all over Scandinavia 


04:59.748 --> 05:03.000
traveled all the way 
to attend the convention. 


05:06.388 --> 05:08.390
We were very encouraged 


05:08.390 --> 05:10.560
by the visit of a member 
of the Governing Body, 


05:10.560 --> 05:12.562
Brother Mark Sanderson, 


05:12.562 --> 05:15.000
who gave us 
some faith-strengthening talks.


05:18.433 --> 05:21.170
I think it’s a great privilege 


05:21.170 --> 05:23.272
to be able to understand the truth. 


05:23.272 --> 05:26.275
It’s amazing that Jehovah 
gave his attention 


05:26.275 --> 05:29.000
to an insignificant human like me.


05:32.315 --> 05:34.317
When I started to follow 


05:34.317 --> 05:37.787
the Bible’s unique teachings 
and principles, 


05:37.787 --> 05:39.989
I clearly understood 


05:39.988 --> 05:43.591
how it would benefit my own life.


05:43.592 --> 05:47.664
After this convention, 
even though we live in small towns 


05:47.663 --> 05:50.866
far away 
from the rest of the world, 


05:50.867 --> 05:54.000
we feel closer than ever before 
to the worldwide brotherhood.


06:01.377 --> 06:05.815
The peak attendance 
at the convention was 614


06:05.815 --> 06:08.350
—the largest ever in Greenland. 


06:08.350 --> 06:10.953
Our brothers 
from other parts of Scandinavia 


06:10.953 --> 06:13.488
who attended 
the convention also took part


06:13.488 --> 06:16.025
in a campaign 
inviting interested ones. 


06:16.025 --> 06:18.293
In only two hours, 


06:18.293 --> 06:21.196
the whole capital city of Nuuk 
was covered. 


06:21.197 --> 06:29.890
It was a wonderful witness!

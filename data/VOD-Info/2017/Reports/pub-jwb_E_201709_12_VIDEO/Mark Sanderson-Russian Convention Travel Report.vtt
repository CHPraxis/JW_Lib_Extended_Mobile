00:01.885 --> 00:04.553
Just after the Supreme Court decision 


00:04.553 --> 00:06.621
banning our activity in Russia 


00:06.622 --> 00:08.859
that was given in April, 


00:08.858 --> 00:12.461
the Finland Branch Committee 
wrote to the Teaching Committee 


00:12.462 --> 00:16.499
and right away requested permission 
to arrange a convention 


00:16.498 --> 00:21.236
for about 4,000 of our dear brothers 
from Russia. 


00:21.237 --> 00:25.000
Well, now, quite coincidentally 
or perhaps not, 


00:26.042 --> 00:28.945
back in January, 
I was feeling a little bit tired, 


00:28.945 --> 00:30.713
and I have some good friends 
in Finland, 


00:30.713 --> 00:33.383
and so we arranged
to go to a convention together 


00:33.383 --> 00:37.053
in the month of June
—that was all approved back in January. 


00:37.053 --> 00:40.090
Well, by coincidence
—can you imagine?—it turned out to be 


00:40.090 --> 00:42.692
the same weekend 
that this Russian convention 


00:42.692 --> 00:44.827
was being planned for Finland. 


00:44.827 --> 00:47.130
And so the Teaching Committee 
asked me if I’d be willing 


00:47.130 --> 00:50.800
to serve this Russian convention 
instead of the Finnish one. 


00:50.800 --> 00:53.035
And, of course, I was delighted.


00:53.035 --> 00:56.705
Beds were needed 
for all of these 4,000 brothers. 


00:56.705 --> 01:00.177
Well—can you imagine?—in just a short time, 


01:00.177 --> 01:04.947
4,373 beds were offered. 


01:04.947 --> 01:09.452
In many cases, the brothers had no place 
to house visitors, but what did they do? 


01:09.452 --> 01:13.022
They called the branch and said: 
“We’ll pay for a hotel room. 


01:13.022 --> 01:14.324
“We don’t care who it’s for; 


01:14.323 --> 01:17.593
put whoever you want there, 
but we want to pay the cost.” 


01:17.593 --> 01:20.996
So everyone was able to be accommodated.


01:20.997 --> 01:23.734
When the brothers arrived in Finland, 


01:23.733 --> 01:27.036
some had come from as far away 
as Vladivostok, 


01:27.037 --> 01:29.172
traveling some 6,000 miles (9,600 km), 


01:29.172 --> 01:31.875
if you can imagine, 
to attend this convention. 


01:31.875 --> 01:33.943
The brothers were at the train stations; 


01:33.943 --> 01:37.780
they were at the airport 
to welcome all the guests. 


01:37.780 --> 01:39.782
Now, when the first brothers and sisters 


01:39.782 --> 01:42.085
arrived at the convention venue, 


01:42.085 --> 01:45.087
they asked, 
“Well, where is the Russian section?” 


01:45.087 --> 01:48.190
since they believed 
that this was a Finnish convention 


01:48.190 --> 01:50.025
with Russian sessions. 


01:50.025 --> 01:51.727
Well, when they were told 
that this convention 


01:51.727 --> 01:56.332
had been organized just for them, 
they immediately began to cry. 


01:56.332 --> 01:59.235
Can you imagine
the joy that the brothers had 


01:59.235 --> 02:02.372
when they were able 
to sing out with full voice? 


02:02.372 --> 02:04.974
The singing was so, so moving.


02:04.973 --> 02:06.843
Well, the peak attendance 


02:06.843 --> 02:11.680
of the convention was 5,137, 


02:11.680 --> 02:13.683
and 33 were baptized. 


02:13.683 --> 02:15.518
Well, during the convention, 


02:15.518 --> 02:19.788
the Finland Branch Committee arranged 
for the delegates to be able to tour Bethel. 


02:19.788 --> 02:22.658
And to allow as many as possible 
to come through, 


02:22.658 --> 02:26.528
Bethel was kept open until 8:00 p.m. 


02:26.528 --> 02:29.631
on Thursday, Friday, and Monday, 


02:29.632 --> 02:31.400
and also on Sunday evening 


02:31.400 --> 02:34.137
from 6:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. 


02:34.137 --> 02:35.372
And can you imagine? 


02:35.372 --> 02:38.440
During the day, 
the kitchen arranged to feed 


02:38.440 --> 02:42.778
all of the brothers and sisters 
who came through in the dining room. 


02:42.778 --> 02:46.381
The love that was witnessed was amazing. 


02:46.382 --> 02:48.384
And although it’s perhaps not their culture, 


02:48.383 --> 02:50.386
do you know that 
the Finnish brothers hugged 


02:50.387 --> 02:53.422
every single brother and sister 
that came through.


02:53.422 --> 02:56.392
Well, when it was time to say good-bye, 


02:56.392 --> 02:59.962
the bond of love that had been
established between the Finnish 


02:59.962 --> 03:03.399
and the Russian brothers 
was just wonderful to see. 


03:03.398 --> 03:05.468
And although we all thought 
we would be crying 


03:05.468 --> 03:08.070
to see them go back to Russia 
and the challenges there, 


03:08.070 --> 03:10.172
you know, we just couldn’t
cry because the brothers


03:10.172 --> 03:12.309
were too happy about the convention. 


03:12.308 --> 03:14.976
And there was no one saying, “Poor me.” 


03:14.977 --> 03:17.999
They all went back with just a joyful spirit, 


03:17.998 --> 03:19.015
and it moved us.


03:19.015 --> 03:21.283
Well, just a few weeks later, 


03:21.283 --> 03:25.921
we had to return to Russia again 
for the appeal hearing at the Supreme Court. 


03:25.922 --> 03:27.990
Most of you are aware, of course, 


03:27.990 --> 03:30.960
that an international delegation 
of 18 brothers 


03:30.960 --> 03:33.228
were present in the courtroom 
for the hearing, 


03:33.228 --> 03:37.666
but perhaps this last part 
of the story you haven’t heard. 


03:37.667 --> 03:39.669
World headquarters Legal Department 
had explained to us 


03:39.668 --> 03:41.803
that if the decision was negative, 


03:41.803 --> 03:45.608
we would have to leave the country 
of Russia that same night. 


03:45.608 --> 03:47.743
Well, of course, 
we didn’t know if the hearing 


03:47.743 --> 03:51.313
would be just that one day 
or if it would stretch on for other days. 


03:51.313 --> 03:56.118
So our only choice was to take 
all of our things with us to the court, 


03:56.118 --> 03:57.820
and if the decision came, 


03:57.820 --> 04:01.190
we would have to make 
immediate plans to leave Russia. 


04:01.190 --> 04:06.195
Well, sure enough, at 7:00 p.m. 
the negative decision was announced. 


04:06.195 --> 04:07.997
We had to leave Russia, 


04:07.997 --> 04:11.334
but the problem was 
that none of us had tickets. 


04:11.333 --> 04:13.435
So, what did we do? 


04:13.435 --> 04:17.640
Well, we told the brothers just get
in the vehicles and head for the airport 


04:17.640 --> 04:21.877
while we were communicating 
with the world headquarters Travel Desk. 


04:21.877 --> 04:25.080
Well, thanks to the wonderful 
and very hard work 


04:25.080 --> 04:29.452
of those wonderful brothers and sisters 
that work with the Travel Desk, 


04:29.452 --> 04:32.189
about halfway to the airport, 


04:32.188 --> 04:37.160
I began to receive the tickets 
for all 18 brothers via e-mail. 


04:37.160 --> 04:40.028
By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, 


04:40.028 --> 04:44.833
all 18 brothers were able 
to get out on the same flight


04:44.833 --> 04:48.000
—can you imagine?—
the last flight out of Moscow. 


04:49.072 --> 04:52.575
And here we are just before 1:00 a.m. 


04:52.575 --> 04:56.078
when we arrived in Riga, Latvia. 


04:56.078 --> 04:59.948
We truly felt as though 
we had been picked up by Jehovah 


04:59.948 --> 05:02.000
and safely carried out of Russia.


05:03.485 --> 05:08.123
Well, all of the brothers and sisters 
that I met along the way on these trips 


05:08.123 --> 05:12.461
wanted to send their warm Christian love 
and greetings to all of you 


05:12.462 --> 05:15.499
and let you know that 
just as you are praying for them, 


05:15.498 --> 05:24.140
they’re also praying for you.

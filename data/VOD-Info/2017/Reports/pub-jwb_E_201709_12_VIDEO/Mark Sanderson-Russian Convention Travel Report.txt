00:01 Just after the Supreme Court decision
00:04 banning our activity in Russia
00:06 that was given in April,
00:08 the Finland Branch Committee  wrote to the Teaching Committee
00:12 and right away requested permission  to arrange a convention
00:16 for about 4,000 of our dear brothers  from Russia.
00:21 Well, now, quite coincidentally  or perhaps not,
00:26 back in January,  I was feeling a little bit tired,
00:28 and I have some good friends  in Finland,
00:30 and so we arranged to go to a convention together
00:33 in the month of June —that was all approved back in January.
00:37 Well, by coincidence —can you imagine?—it turned out to be
00:40 the same weekend  that this Russian convention
00:42 was being planned for Finland.
00:44 And so the Teaching Committee  asked me if I’d be willing
00:47 to serve this Russian convention  instead of the Finnish one.
00:50 And, of course, I was delighted.
00:53 Beds were needed  for all of these 4,000 brothers.
00:56 Well—can you imagine?—in just a short time,
01:00 4,373 beds were offered.
01:04 In many cases, the brothers had no place  to house visitors, but what did they do?
01:09 They called the branch and said:  “We’ll pay for a hotel room.
01:13 “We don’t care who it’s for;
01:14 put whoever you want there,  but we want to pay the cost.”
01:17 So everyone was able to be accommodated.
01:20 When the brothers arrived in Finland,
01:23 some had come from as far away  as Vladivostok,
01:27 traveling some 6,000 miles (9,600 km),
01:29 if you can imagine,  to attend this convention.
01:31 The brothers were at the train stations;
01:33 they were at the airport  to welcome all the guests.
01:37 Now, when the first brothers and sisters
01:39 arrived at the convention venue,
01:42 they asked,  “Well, where is the Russian section?”
01:45 since they believed  that this was a Finnish convention
01:48 with Russian sessions.
01:50 Well, when they were told  that this convention
01:51 had been organized just for them,  they immediately began to cry.
01:56 Can you imagine the joy that the brothers had
01:59 when they were able  to sing out with full voice?
02:02 The singing was so, so moving.
02:04 Well, the peak attendance
02:06 of the convention was 5,137,
02:11 and 33 were baptized.
02:13 Well, during the convention,
02:15 the Finland Branch Committee arranged  for the delegates to be able to tour Bethel.
02:19 And to allow as many as possible  to come through,
02:22 Bethel was kept open until 8:00 p.m.
02:26 on Thursday, Friday, and Monday,
02:29 and also on Sunday evening
02:31 from 6:00 p.m. until 8:00 p.m.
02:34 And can you imagine?
02:35 During the day,  the kitchen arranged to feed
02:38 all of the brothers and sisters  who came through in the dining room.
02:42 The love that was witnessed was amazing.
02:46 And although it’s perhaps not their culture,
02:48 do you know that  the Finnish brothers hugged
02:50 every single brother and sister  that came through.
02:53 Well, when it was time to say good-bye,
02:56 the bond of love that had been established between the Finnish
02:59 and the Russian brothers  was just wonderful to see.
03:03 And although we all thought  we would be crying
03:05 to see them go back to Russia  and the challenges there,
03:08 you know, we just couldn’t cry because the brothers
03:10 were too happy about the convention.
03:12 And there was no one saying, “Poor me.”
03:14 They all went back with just a joyful spirit,
03:17 and it moved us.
03:19 Well, just a few weeks later,
03:21 we had to return to Russia again  for the appeal hearing at the Supreme Court.
03:25 Most of you are aware, of course,
03:27 that an international delegation  of 18 brothers
03:30 were present in the courtroom  for the hearing,
03:33 but perhaps this last part  of the story you haven’t heard.
03:37 World headquarters Legal Department  had explained to us
03:39 that if the decision was negative,
03:41 we would have to leave the country  of Russia that same night.
03:45 Well, of course,  we didn’t know if the hearing
03:47 would be just that one day  or if it would stretch on for other days.
03:51 So our only choice was to take  all of our things with us to the court,
03:56 and if the decision came,
03:57 we would have to make  immediate plans to leave Russia.
04:01 Well, sure enough, at 7:00 p.m.  the negative decision was announced.
04:06 We had to leave Russia,
04:07 but the problem was  that none of us had tickets.
04:11 So, what did we do?
04:13 Well, we told the brothers just get in the vehicles and head for the airport
04:17 while we were communicating  with the world headquarters Travel Desk.
04:21 Well, thanks to the wonderful  and very hard work
04:25 of those wonderful brothers and sisters  that work with the Travel Desk,
04:29 about halfway to the airport,
04:32 I began to receive the tickets  for all 18 brothers via e-mail.
04:37 By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,
04:40 all 18 brothers were able  to get out on the same flight
04:44 —can you imagine?— the last flight out of Moscow.
04:49 And here we are just before 1:00 a.m.
04:52 when we arrived in Riga, Latvia.
04:56 We truly felt as though  we had been picked up by Jehovah
04:59 and safely carried out of Russia.
05:03 Well, all of the brothers and sisters  that I met along the way on these trips
05:08 wanted to send their warm Christian love  and greetings to all of you
05:12 and let you know that  just as you are praying for them,
05:15 they’re also praying for you.

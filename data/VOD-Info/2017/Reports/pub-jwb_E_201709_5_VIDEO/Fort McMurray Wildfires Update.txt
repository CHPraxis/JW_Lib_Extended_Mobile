00:01 At times,  world events may highlight
00:04 the importance of being punctual.
00:06 In May of last year,  a wildfire overtook
00:09 the Canadian city of Fort McMurray,  in the province of Alberta.
00:13 The brothers and sisters  there benefited from promptly
00:17 following the direction  they had received
00:19 from their local congregations.
00:30 There was a local needs part,
00:32 and we try to do it every year,
00:34 and this year  it was at the perfect time
00:36 because the next week  we had the fire.
00:39 And when the brother  was reviewing,
00:41 he was saying it was  a high fire-hazard year,
00:43 so be prepared.
00:45 And it was nice  that the brothers were so obedient
00:47 and took that to heart and were ready.
00:51 It happened so quickly,
00:54 from being fine and safe  to ‘We got to get out of here.’
00:57 We started to hear  the municipality saying
01:00 there are mandatory evacuations
01:02 for different neighborhoods.
01:04 So within noon, two o’clock, four o’clock,
01:07 90,000 people are in motion.
01:10 When you were standing outside,  you could hear the helicopters going,
01:12 the sirens going.
01:13 The smoke was so thick and intense.
01:16 Both the left and the right  were all in flames;
01:18 it was totally in flames.
01:21 Ugh, it was chaotic.
01:24 People running to their cars,  seeing and looking
01:26 at the big cloud of smoke  approaching them
01:28 and just the fright in their eyes.
01:32 It just came to mind:
01:34 During the local needs,  the brothers said,
01:36 “If in case of an emergency,  you have to follow directions.
01:38 “Listen to the local authorities
01:41 and listen to your local elders.”
01:44 Each elder  for the field service groups
01:47 had to care  for a small amount of people.
01:51 I was calling  all the brothers and sisters
01:53 that I could to find out
01:55 where they were and if they were safe.
01:57 Every group overseer knew exactly
02:00 where everybody in his group  was at all times.
02:03 One brother came  to help my wife and the kids
02:06 to evacuate while I was at work.
02:09 So I felt very indebted  to this brother
02:12 —that he acted in my behalf  to get my family to a safe place.
02:15 To see the brothers OK and calm,  it makes me calm.
02:23 It’s all gone,
02:25 and it went away overnight.
02:28 If we are to put  our trust in such things—
02:32 Where are they now?
02:36 Although we’ve lost all this,
02:39 our relationship with Jehovah —we haven’t lost that.
02:47 We can’t salvage nothing .
02:49 Yeah.
02:50 Everything is gone. Gone—everything is gone.
02:53 Yeah, this is our basement.
02:56 People are always asking us, like,  “Did you lose your home?”
03:00 And we’re like, “Yeah, we did.”
03:02 Seeing how quickly things can go,  how things can disappear,
03:07 it helps you appreciate the things  that are most important.
03:11 And not only  do we have our own lives
03:14 but we still have  our brothers and sisters
03:16 there with us.
03:20 When we escaped
03:22 and moved to Edmonton,
03:25 which is about  a four-and-a-half-hour drive from here,
03:29 the friends opened their homes to us
03:31 in the middle of the night —2:30 a.m.—
03:33 and welcomed us.
03:34 They gave us food;  they gave us clothing;
03:37 they gave us a place to stay.
03:40 That kind of hospitality  really touched our heart.
03:42 We realized that we  hadn’t missed anything.
03:56 Some of the friends,  we haven’t seen them
03:58 since the disaster occurred
04:00 and to meet the friends again
04:02 —you know, about a month  and a half after the disaster—
04:05 at the convention  was really, really encouraging.
04:09 We see brothers that are working  with different departments
04:12 here at the convention  and also with the disaster relief committee
04:15 who have no home to go back to.
04:17 Yet, they’re so concerned  about someone else
04:19 that they don’t even think about  what they’ve really lost.
04:23 Although we’ve lost  everything materially,
04:26 we have everything spiritually.
04:29 What is gone is gone.
04:32 What is important is our lives  and our relationship with Jehovah.
04:55 The local needs part  proved very helpful
04:59 for our brothers and sisters  in Fort McMurray.
05:01 The part included direction  about having a “go bag”
05:05 and keeping the gas tanks  of their vehicles full.
05:08 Because of the distance  to the nearest town
05:11 and the heavy traffic  during the evacuation,
05:13 having a full tank of gas  proved to be very timely advice.
05:17 Instead of procrastinating,
05:20 our brothers and sisters  in Alberta followed the direction,
05:23 to their benefit.

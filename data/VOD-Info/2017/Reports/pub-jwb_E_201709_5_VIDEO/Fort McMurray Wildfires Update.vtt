00:01.383 --> 00:04.053
At times, 
world events may highlight 


00:04.053 --> 00:06.088
the importance of being punctual. 


00:06.088 --> 00:09.558
In May of last year, 
a wildfire overtook 


00:09.558 --> 00:13.530
the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, 
in the province of Alberta. 


00:13.530 --> 00:17.233
The brothers and sisters 
there benefited from promptly 


00:17.233 --> 00:19.901
following the direction 
they had received 


00:19.902 --> 00:22.000
from their local congregations.


00:30.413 --> 00:32.748
There was a local needs part, 


00:32.748 --> 00:34.783
and we try to do it every year, 


00:34.783 --> 00:36.953
and this year 
it was at the perfect time 


00:36.953 --> 00:39.055
because the next week 
we had the fire. 


00:39.055 --> 00:41.090
And when the brother 
was reviewing, 


00:41.090 --> 00:43.860
he was saying it was 
a high fire-hazard year, 


00:43.860 --> 00:45.395
so be prepared. 


00:45.395 --> 00:47.763
And it was nice 
that the brothers were so obedient 


00:47.763 --> 00:50.000
and took that to heart and were ready.


00:51.935 --> 00:54.403
It happened so quickly, 


00:54.403 --> 00:57.206
from being fine and safe 
to ‘We got to get out of here.’


00:57.207 --> 01:00.210
We started to hear 
the municipality saying 


01:00.210 --> 01:02.045
there are mandatory evacuations 


01:02.045 --> 01:04.047
for different neighborhoods. 


01:04.047 --> 01:07.417
So within noon, two o’clock, four o’clock, 


01:07.417 --> 01:10.287
90,000 people are in motion.


01:10.287 --> 01:12.689
When you were standing outside, 
you could hear the helicopters going, 


01:12.688 --> 01:13.990
the sirens going. 


01:13.990 --> 01:16.125
The smoke was so thick and intense.


01:16.125 --> 01:18.662
Both the left and the right 
were all in flames; 


01:18.662 --> 01:21.497
it was totally in flames. 


01:21.497 --> 01:24.000
Ugh, it was chaotic.


01:24.000 --> 01:26.202
People running to their cars, 
seeing and looking 


01:26.202 --> 01:28.439
at the big cloud of smoke 
approaching them 


01:28.438 --> 01:31.000
and just the fright in their eyes.


01:32.075 --> 01:34.077
It just came to mind: 


01:34.077 --> 01:36.245
During the local needs, 
the brothers said, 


01:36.245 --> 01:38.848
“If in case of an emergency, 
you have to follow directions. 


01:38.848 --> 01:41.083
“Listen to the local authorities 


01:41.083 --> 01:44.986
and listen to your local elders.”


01:44.987 --> 01:47.724
Each elder 
for the field service groups 


01:47.723 --> 01:51.293
had to care 
for a small amount of people.


01:51.293 --> 01:53.261
I was calling 
all the brothers and sisters 


01:53.262 --> 01:55.965
that I could to find out 


01:55.965 --> 01:57.900
where they were and if they were safe.


01:57.900 --> 02:00.403
Every group overseer knew exactly 


02:00.403 --> 02:03.205
where everybody in his group 
was at all times.


02:03.205 --> 02:06.142
One brother came 
to help my wife and the kids 


02:06.142 --> 02:09.112
to evacuate while I was at work. 


02:09.112 --> 02:12.249
So I felt very indebted 
to this brother


02:12.248 --> 02:15.718
—that he acted in my behalf 
to get my family to a safe place.


02:15.718 --> 02:20.000
To see the brothers OK and calm, 
it makes me calm.


02:23.493 --> 02:25.495
It’s all gone, 


02:25.495 --> 02:28.297
and it went away overnight. 


02:28.297 --> 02:32.002
If we are to put 
our trust in such things— 


02:32.002 --> 02:35.000
Where are they now?


02:36.907 --> 02:39.742
Although we’ve lost all this, 


02:39.742 --> 02:43.000
our relationship with Jehovah
—we haven’t lost that.


02:47.117 --> 02:49.319
We can’t salvage nothing .


02:49.318 --> 02:50.386
Yeah.


02:50.387 --> 02:53.724
Everything is gone.
Gone—everything is gone. 


02:53.723 --> 02:56.158
Yeah, this is our basement. 


02:56.158 --> 03:00.330
People are always asking us, like, 
“Did you lose your home?” 


03:00.330 --> 03:02.165
And we’re like, “Yeah, we did.”


03:02.165 --> 03:06.000
Seeing how quickly things can go, 
how things can disappear, 


03:07.270 --> 03:11.440
it helps you appreciate the things 
that are most important. 


03:11.440 --> 03:14.077
And not only 
do we have our own lives


03:14.077 --> 03:16.179
but we still have 
our brothers and sisters 


03:16.178 --> 03:19.000
there with us.


03:20.617 --> 03:22.619
When we escaped 


03:22.618 --> 03:25.421
and moved to Edmonton, 


03:25.422 --> 03:29.192
which is about 
a four-and-a-half-hour drive from here, 


03:29.192 --> 03:31.560
the friends opened their homes to us 


03:31.560 --> 03:33.597
in the middle of the night
—2:30 a.m.—


03:33.597 --> 03:34.730
and welcomed us. 


03:34.730 --> 03:37.133
They gave us food; 
they gave us clothing; 


03:37.133 --> 03:40.001
they gave us a place to stay. 


03:40.002 --> 03:42.172
That kind of hospitality 
really touched our heart. 


03:42.172 --> 03:45.000
We realized that we 
hadn’t missed anything.


03:56.318 --> 03:58.553
Some of the friends, 
we haven’t seen them 


03:58.553 --> 04:00.790
since the disaster occurred 


04:00.790 --> 04:02.925
and to meet the friends again


04:02.925 --> 04:05.695
—you know, about a month 
and a half after the disaster—


04:05.695 --> 04:08.000
at the convention 
was really, really encouraging.


04:09.665 --> 04:12.135
We see brothers that are working 
with different departments 


04:12.135 --> 04:15.338
here at the convention 
and also with the disaster relief committee 


04:15.338 --> 04:17.373
who have no home to go back to. 


04:17.373 --> 04:19.275
Yet, they’re so concerned 
about someone else 


04:19.275 --> 04:22.000
that they don’t even think about 
what they’ve really lost.


04:23.680 --> 04:26.282
Although we’ve lost 
everything materially, 


04:26.282 --> 04:29.485
we have everything spiritually. 


04:29.485 --> 04:32.255
What is gone is gone. 


04:32.255 --> 04:36.000
What is important is our lives 
and our relationship with Jehovah.


04:55.912 --> 04:59.015
The local needs part 
proved very helpful 


04:59.015 --> 05:01.517
for our brothers and sisters 
in Fort McMurray. 


05:01.517 --> 05:05.120
The part included direction 
about having a “go bag” 


05:05.120 --> 05:08.523
and keeping the gas tanks 
of their vehicles full. 


05:08.523 --> 05:11.060
Because of the distance 
to the nearest town 


05:11.060 --> 05:13.628
and the heavy traffic 
during the evacuation, 


05:13.628 --> 05:17.900
having a full tank of gas 
proved to be very timely advice. 


05:17.900 --> 05:20.035
Instead of procrastinating, 


05:20.035 --> 05:23.572
our brothers and sisters 
in Alberta followed the direction, 


05:23.572 --> 05:31.265
to their benefit.

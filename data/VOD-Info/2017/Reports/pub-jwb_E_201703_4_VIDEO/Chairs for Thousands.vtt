00:01.517 --> 00:05.055
In addition to the many avenues 
of full-time service 


00:05.055 --> 00:08.358
we mentioned earlier 
in the program, 


00:08.358 --> 00:13.195
making yourself available 
when a need arises locally 


00:13.195 --> 00:18.067
is a fine way 
to seek the Kingdom first. 


00:18.067 --> 00:22.905
For example, in San Antonio, 
in the state of Texas, 


00:22.905 --> 00:25.608
in the United States, 


00:25.608 --> 00:28.110
a large convention 


00:28.110 --> 00:32.948
with over 20,000 
in attendance was planned. 


00:32.948 --> 00:36.218
However, 
the venue could only provide 


00:36.218 --> 00:40.990
about one third of the chairs needed 
for the convention. 


00:40.990 --> 00:44.927
Where would our brothers 
find the needed chairs? 


00:44.927 --> 00:47.797
Well, Jehovah provided, 


00:47.797 --> 00:52.000
and many young ones 
were eager to help.


00:56.572 --> 00:58.875
When I heard 
that this needed to happen, 


00:58.875 --> 01:01.477
I was thinking, 
‘How are we going to do this?’


01:01.477 --> 01:03.980
I thought, ‘It’s a big job!’


01:03.980 --> 01:06.515
It was amazing!


01:06.515 --> 01:08.785
The first thing I was asked to do 


01:08.785 --> 01:11.353
was try to find a storage place 
that we could use 


01:11.353 --> 01:14.056
for six to eight thousand chairs. 


01:14.057 --> 01:16.692
A sister manages a storage place, 


01:16.692 --> 01:18.462
and we saw Jehovah’s blessing 


01:18.462 --> 01:21.297
because the owner said, 
“You can have this stall 


01:21.297 --> 01:24.500
“at no charge for a year 
as long as you sign a contract 


01:24.500 --> 01:26.502
that it’s 
for Jehovah’s Witnesses’ organization.”


01:26.502 --> 01:29.672
Truckload after truckload 
after truckload came in. 


01:29.672 --> 01:31.374
We had to unload the trucks. 


01:31.373 --> 01:33.308
The brothers had 
to unstack the chairs, 


01:33.308 --> 01:36.011
repair the chairs, clean the chairs, 
put them back on pallets, 


01:36.012 --> 01:37.947
restack them, 


01:37.947 --> 01:40.484
load them onto trucks, 
and that was half of it. 


01:40.483 --> 01:42.485
Those were the ones 
in the warehouse. 


01:42.485 --> 01:45.455
On the other side, 
we got permission to ask  


01:45.455 --> 01:47.757
the San Antonio congregations 
if we could use their chairs 


01:47.757 --> 01:49.492
for the convention. 


01:49.492 --> 01:51.727
We were hoping 
to get three thousand chairs.


01:51.727 --> 01:53.797
And then the numbers 
grew for the audience,


01:53.797 --> 01:55.832
so we had to increase 
our numbers. 


01:55.832 --> 01:58.367
So we were able to gather 
six thousand chairs 


01:58.367 --> 02:03.640
from the willing volunteers 
of congregations around San Antonio.


02:03.640 --> 02:06.508
So we prayed about it and the brothers 
started asking for volunteers, 


02:06.508 --> 02:09.245
and it was a great cooperation 
right at the beginning.


02:09.245 --> 02:11.613
As soon as 
we let the friends know 


02:11.613 --> 02:14.083
that this was going 
to be the case, 


02:14.083 --> 02:15.685
all of them—
all of them said, 


02:15.685 --> 02:17.220
“We’re going to get off 
of work early.”


02:17.220 --> 02:19.655
We immediately wanted 
to clear our schedules 


02:19.655 --> 02:23.660
so that we could be available 
to help in any way that we could.


02:23.660 --> 02:25.828
It was a privilege to know 


02:25.828 --> 02:28.498
that our congregation 
was going to be part of it.


02:28.498 --> 02:31.800
We are so grateful to Jehovah 
that he has given us 


02:31.800 --> 02:33.803
this privilege to do.


02:33.803 --> 02:35.538
We had thousands of chairs 


02:35.538 --> 02:39.208
of every color
—green, red, brown, blue. 


02:39.208 --> 02:42.578
We even had some bright orange ones 
left out of the ‘70’s, 


02:42.578 --> 02:44.380
and we’re putting those in the back. 


02:44.380 --> 02:47.083
But it was not just the colors 
but the sizes. 


02:47.083 --> 02:49.118
They were all different sizes. 


02:49.118 --> 02:51.320
And so how do you make 
sections with straight rows 


02:51.320 --> 02:53.488
when the chairs 
are all different sizes?


02:53.488 --> 02:56.658
But I knew somehow, 
as Jehovah’s people, we’d get it done. 


02:56.658 --> 03:00.028
And we definitely— 
As you see, a lot of volunteers, 


03:00.028 --> 03:01.696
and we’re here getting it done.


03:01.697 --> 03:04.234
And it’s made 
for a beautiful experience 


03:04.233 --> 03:06.635
because the friends have gotten to know 
each other as never before. 


03:06.635 --> 03:08.572
And they’re willingly 
working together, 


03:08.572 --> 03:10.374
and the excitement is there. 


03:10.373 --> 03:14.276
It doesn’t matter whose venue it is, 
it’s all for Jehovah, 


03:14.277 --> 03:16.445
and that’s been 
the attitude everybody has had.


03:16.445 --> 03:19.548
It just tells you 
that Jehovah is a God of order.


03:19.548 --> 03:22.651
It’s good to feel 
that you’re doing your best for Jehovah.


03:22.652 --> 03:27.124
Well, it reminds me of Psalm 127:1,
where it mentions 


03:27.123 --> 03:29.958
that ‘unless Jehovah builds the house, 


03:29.958 --> 03:32.595
it’s in vain that his workers 
even work hard.’ 


03:32.595 --> 03:35.097
So it’s because of Jehovah’s hand 
and his blessing


03:35.097 --> 03:37.100
—that is why everything 
runs so smoothly.


03:37.100 --> 03:38.568
What other organization! 


03:38.568 --> 03:53.800
No one else can do that 
except Jehovah’s people.

00:02.940 --> 00:05.525
A visit to the city of Salvador in Brazil 


00:05.525 --> 00:07.778
is an amazing experience. 


00:07.778 --> 00:10.280
The beaches and the city’s natural beauty 


00:10.280 --> 00:12.992
are appreciated 
by the almost three million people 


00:12.992 --> 00:14.994
that live here today. 


00:14.993 --> 00:17.161
The people of the city of Salvador 


00:17.162 --> 00:20.207
are known for their friendly smile, 


00:20.207 --> 00:23.002
hospitality, and united spirit. 


00:23.002 --> 00:29.000
But something else 
is remarkable in this city.


00:30.633 --> 00:33.303
After serving in many parts of Brazil, 


00:33.303 --> 00:34.930
I noted a big difference 


00:34.930 --> 00:36.973
when I came to Salvador. 


00:36.973 --> 00:40.143
The people here have a strong inclination 


00:40.143 --> 00:43.000
toward spiritual things.


00:48.277 --> 00:53.115
The city of Salvador 
alone has just over 2,900,000 inhabitants, 


00:53.115 --> 00:56.952
around 36,800 publishers, 


00:56.952 --> 01:01.165
and almost 41,400 Bible studies


01:01.165 --> 01:03.542
—divided into 22 circuits 


01:03.542 --> 01:07.087
and 351 congregations. 


01:07.087 --> 01:10.382
This means that there is about 1 publisher 


01:10.382 --> 01:14.000
for every 78 inhabitants.


01:15.845 --> 01:18.723
When we find someone who’s interested, 


01:18.723 --> 01:21.351
they have either studied in the past, 


01:21.352 --> 01:23.687
their parents are Witnesses, 


01:23.687 --> 01:27.692
they already study the Bible, 
or they want to study.


01:27.692 --> 01:32.000
Such growth creates new difficulties 
and challenges for Jehovah’s people. 


01:33.238 --> 01:38.118
Where will all these interested people 
meet to serve Jehovah?


01:38.118 --> 01:40.578
There in Salvador, 


01:40.578 --> 01:42.580
many brothers and sisters are concentrated 


01:42.580 --> 01:44.542
in a very small area. 


01:44.542 --> 01:47.000
We had a hard time finding properties. 


01:48.295 --> 01:51.340
Besides that, 
the city is very hilly. 


01:51.340 --> 01:54.510
It’s almost impossible 
to find level properties. 


01:54.510 --> 01:56.678
And then there’s the city’s zoning ordinance. 


01:56.678 --> 01:59.000
It’s very restrictive. 


02:00.432 --> 02:04.060
So finding a suitable property 
was a real challenge. 


02:04.060 --> 02:06.605
But then we came across this one. 


02:06.605 --> 02:10.000
We thought, ‘Why not build there?’


02:12.152 --> 02:14.780
That’s why these complexes are needed. 


02:14.780 --> 02:16.782
Like this one in Pituba,


02:16.782 --> 02:19.117
which has six Kingdom Halls on one property


02:19.117 --> 02:21.954
for 15 congregations.


02:21.953 --> 02:23.955
There are about 20 of these complexes. 


02:23.955 --> 02:25.665
Some have four Kingdom Halls, 


02:25.665 --> 02:27.835
others have three, or two, 


02:27.835 --> 02:30.000
according to the needs locally.


02:33.090 --> 02:35.925
This is not a standard Kingdom Hall. 


02:35.925 --> 02:38.012
We usually don’t approve or recommend


02:38.012 --> 02:40.514
a building this size due to the complexity 


02:40.513 --> 02:44.000
in planning the project 
and even in using the building. 


02:46.687 --> 02:49.899
There will be high traffic 
of both people and vehicles every day 


02:49.898 --> 02:52.108
for meetings throughout the week. 


02:52.108 --> 02:54.820
But the branch
made an exception in this case 


02:54.820 --> 02:58.000
due to the large concentration 
of publishers in the area. 


02:59.575 --> 03:02.953
That’s why this six-auditorium complex 
was built. 


03:02.953 --> 03:06.706
It has three double Kingdom Halls 
with about 200 seats 


03:06.707 --> 03:09.000
in each auditorium.


03:11.212 --> 03:14.297
One complex I visit has two Kingdom Halls


03:14.297 --> 03:18.760
—six congregations with about 750 publishers. 


03:18.760 --> 03:20.762
That creates another challenge. 


03:20.762 --> 03:22.347
When I meet a brother, 


03:22.347 --> 03:24.850
it’s hard to know 
what congregation he belongs to, 


03:24.850 --> 03:27.000
since everybody lives 
so close to each other.


03:33.192 --> 03:36.654
For many publishers, 
this was no more than just a dream: 


03:36.653 --> 03:39.906
‘A well-structured Kingdom Hall 
that’s comfortable and well-ventilated


03:39.907 --> 03:41.617
—we can’t afford that.’ 


03:41.617 --> 03:45.620
One brother even said, 
“It won’t happen in my lifetime.”


03:45.620 --> 03:47.832
The hall is so big. 


03:47.832 --> 03:50.000
It has many pretty things.


03:51.335 --> 03:54.295
I thank Jehovah
so much for having used us 


03:54.295 --> 03:57.758
to build such a beautiful place 
for his worship, 


03:57.758 --> 04:00.000
and really, all credit goes to him. 


04:01.887 --> 04:04.014
I’m so grateful to him, 


04:04.013 --> 04:06.600
and I hope to praise him 
even more in this Kingdom Hall 


04:06.600 --> 04:08.643
that he’s prepared for us.


04:08.643 --> 04:10.000
It’s like a dream come true.


04:11.897 --> 04:15.192
And now we have a suitable place 
where we can worship Jehovah.


04:15.192 --> 04:16.194
Thank you. 


04:16.193 --> 04:17.861
I don’t deserve something this wonderful.


04:17.862 --> 04:19.572
Thank you so much.


04:19.572 --> 04:21.532
In Salvador 


04:21.532 --> 04:24.619
and in many other regions of the earth,


04:24.618 --> 04:25.910
we clearly see the prophecy


04:25.910 --> 04:28.580
of Isaiah 54:2 being fulfilled


04:28.580 --> 04:32.000
by means of the construction
of Kingdom Halls.


04:34.335 --> 04:37.255
The natural beauty
of Salvador itself moves us


04:37.255 --> 04:39.925
to praise the One who created it all.


04:39.925 --> 04:42.970
But seeing how Jehovah
is speeding things up


04:42.970 --> 04:46.140
and caring for his servants’ needs
in this crowded city


04:46.140 --> 05:04.345
—now that’s something really special.

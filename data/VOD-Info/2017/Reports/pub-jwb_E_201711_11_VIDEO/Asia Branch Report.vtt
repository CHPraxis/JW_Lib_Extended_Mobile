00:00.855 --> 00:03.690
The prophet Isaiah foretold 


00:03.690 --> 00:07.360
that “in the final part of the days”
people of all nations 


00:07.360 --> 00:11.823
would flock to Jehovah’s elevated place 
of pure worship. 


00:11.823 --> 00:13.158
They would say, 


00:13.158 --> 00:15.285
“[Jehovah] will instruct us about his ways, 


00:15.285 --> 00:17.955
and we will walk in his paths.” 


00:17.955 --> 00:20.917
Well, how happy we are to see this prophecy 


00:20.917 --> 00:23.877
undergoing fulfillment right before our eyes. 


00:23.877 --> 00:28.757
The result is multicultural 
and multilingual united worshippers 


00:28.757 --> 00:31.385
giving praise to Jehovah. 


00:31.385 --> 00:35.097
This morning we want 
to share with you proof of this, 


00:35.097 --> 00:38.642
as we experienced on our recent branch visit.


00:38.642 --> 00:41.270
It was truly a pleasure for Terry and me 


00:41.270 --> 00:43.813
to be teamed up with 
Robert and Faith Luccioni 


00:43.813 --> 00:47.191
for the branch visit 
to three countries in Asia 


00:47.192 --> 00:51.572
from March 29 through April 19, 2016.


00:51.572 --> 00:54.700
Our first stop was in Japan. 


00:54.700 --> 00:58.203
The 214,000 publishers in Japan 


00:58.203 --> 01:00.330
are very active in the ministry. 


01:00.330 --> 01:03.000
With over 65,000 regular pioneers, 


01:04.000 --> 01:08.338
they maintain one of the highest ratios 
of pioneers to publishers. 


01:08.338 --> 01:11.508
The branch facilities in Japan 


01:11.508 --> 01:14.000
are surrounded by beautiful gardens 
and water features, 


01:15.303 --> 01:18.000
which certainly bring honor 
to Jehovah’s name.


01:19.098 --> 01:22.560
We also enjoyed a tour of the printery. 


01:22.560 --> 01:26.107
Their presses print magazines, 
brochures, tracts, and books 


01:26.107 --> 01:28.442
for the entire Asia region. 


01:28.442 --> 01:30.444
When it comes to Bible printing, 


01:30.443 --> 01:33.030
they team up with the United States printery 


01:33.030 --> 01:35.615
to print all 
of the New World Translation Bibles 


01:35.615 --> 01:37.785
for the whole world. 


01:37.785 --> 01:39.912
The bindery in Japan has produced 


01:39.912 --> 01:43.499
over 8,500,000 deluxe Bibles 


01:43.498 --> 01:48.711
in 45 languages since the release 
of the revised New World Translation.


01:48.712 --> 01:51.424
With the reduction in personnel 
in the Bethel family, 


01:51.423 --> 01:54.676
a number of sisters are making adjustments 
to new assignments, 


01:54.677 --> 01:56.679
which were formerly handled by brothers. 


01:56.678 --> 01:59.515
It was very commendable to note 


01:59.515 --> 02:02.000
how these sisters make 
an excellent contribution to the work. 


02:03.227 --> 02:05.312
The Translation Department 


02:05.312 --> 02:10.817
cares for the Japanese language 
and the Japanese Sign-Language translations.


02:10.817 --> 02:14.739
On Monday, we enjoyed 
a special noon meal with the family. 


02:14.738 --> 02:18.158
One truly special feature 
was the song sung by the translators 


02:18.158 --> 02:22.871
and missionaries who joined 
the branch visit from Bangladesh. 


02:22.872 --> 02:27.877
What a beautiful group 
of loyal, hard-working brothers and sisters. 


02:27.877 --> 02:31.630
Along with the Luccionis, 
we also enjoyed field service 


02:31.630 --> 02:33.882
with a local congregation. 


02:33.882 --> 02:37.052
Over the years, the brothers and sisters 
in Japan have set 


02:37.052 --> 02:40.000
such a good example 
in their zeal for Kingdom preaching. 


02:41.182 --> 02:45.894
They continue to find great joy 
in their ministry.


02:45.893 --> 02:49.188
On Saturday we enjoyed a special program 


02:49.188 --> 02:51.191
at the Ebina Assembly Hall. 


02:51.192 --> 02:54.487
The program was also streamed 
to Kingdom Halls throughout Japan, 


02:54.487 --> 02:57.530
Bangladesh, and Mongolia. 


02:57.530 --> 03:01.910
The total attendance was 226,000. 


03:01.910 --> 03:05.163
Everyone enjoyed 
a fine “interchange of encouragement” 


03:05.163 --> 03:09.083
from the program and the association.


03:09.083 --> 03:13.713
Well, the time had come for us to move 
from Japan to Mongolia. 


03:13.713 --> 03:17.383
Mongolia is landlocked 
between Russia and China 


03:17.383 --> 03:21.596
and is one of the most sparsely 
populated countries in the world. 


03:21.597 --> 03:25.600
The landscape of Mongolia 
consists of rivers, streams, 


03:25.600 --> 03:29.480
towering mountains, and rolling grasslands. 


03:29.480 --> 03:33.608
Buddhism maintains a strong foothold 
in Mongolia today. 


03:33.608 --> 03:37.153
Interestingly, it wasn’t until the 1990’s 


03:37.153 --> 03:40.531
that the good news began 
to be preached in this land. 


03:40.532 --> 03:43.410
In fact, the first Mongolian publishers 


03:43.410 --> 03:46.913
were baptized in 1996. 


03:46.913 --> 03:50.083
There are now over 458 publishers 


03:50.083 --> 03:53.253
who are currently conducting 
over 800 Bible studies. 


03:53.253 --> 03:56.423
The 15 members of the Bethel family 


03:56.423 --> 04:00.426
make up this remote translation office, 
or RTO. 


04:00.427 --> 04:05.724
They are located in this five-story building.


04:05.723 --> 04:10.020
On our visit, it was our pleasure 
to meet Batzorigt and his wife. 


04:10.020 --> 04:13.315
They are both deaf 
and learned the truth in the mid-’90’s 


04:13.315 --> 04:16.610
while attending college 
in St. Petersburg, Russia. 


04:16.610 --> 04:19.905
After college they returned to Mongolia, 


04:19.905 --> 04:23.158
only to find 
there were no publishers in the country, 


04:23.158 --> 04:27.830
so their baptism was held 
at a convention in Russia. 


04:27.830 --> 04:30.415
They became the first native Mongolians 


04:30.415 --> 04:33.252
to serve in Mongolia. 


04:33.252 --> 04:36.922
Brother Batzorigt now serves 
as a congregation elder 


04:36.922 --> 04:39.000
in Ulaanbaatar’s sign-language congregation.


04:40.550 --> 04:44.095
It was very encouraging 
to visit with Sister Narantuya, 


04:44.095 --> 04:46.682
who works with the Translation Department. 


04:46.682 --> 04:49.560
She related how she came 
into the truth through her husband, 


04:49.560 --> 04:51.562
who also worked 
in the Translation Department 


04:51.562 --> 04:54.064
before he passed away. 


04:54.063 --> 04:57.608
However, his translation work 
did not begin there. 


04:57.608 --> 05:00.195
Brother Oyunbat was a doctor. 


05:00.195 --> 05:02.238
Prior to learning the truth, 


05:02.238 --> 05:05.866
he went to Poland alone 
to make money for his family. 


05:05.867 --> 05:08.745
When he was there, 
he met Jehovah’s Witnesses 


05:08.745 --> 05:10.788
and studied the Knowledge book. 


05:10.788 --> 05:13.458
He was so impressed with what he learned 


05:13.458 --> 05:16.085
that he wanted to share 
the truth with his family. 


05:16.085 --> 05:19.463
But there was no Knowledge book 
in Mongolian back then. 


05:19.463 --> 05:22.258
So he translated the book himself, 


05:22.258 --> 05:24.260
one chapter a week, 


05:24.260 --> 05:28.390
and sent it as a form of handwritten letters 
to his family in Mongolia. 


05:28.390 --> 05:33.395
Our dear brother did this for his family 
out of love for them. 


05:33.395 --> 05:36.565
As a result, his wife and children, 


05:36.565 --> 05:39.860
as well as a relative’s family, 
came into the truth. 


05:39.860 --> 05:44.865
In December 1997, he returned to Mongolia 
to help his family spiritually, 


05:44.865 --> 05:49.620
even though he had hoped to stay in Europe 
until the next summer to get baptized. 


05:49.620 --> 05:53.957
He was finally baptized in May 1998. 


05:53.957 --> 05:58.170
And in 1999, 
he officially became a translator, 


05:58.170 --> 06:03.800
and the Mongolian Knowledge book 
was officially released in 2001.


06:03.800 --> 06:05.802
Along with the Luccionis, 


06:05.802 --> 06:08.430
we visited Sister Tsetsegee, 


06:08.430 --> 06:12.683
who lives in a traditional Mongolian ger, 
or yurt. 


06:12.683 --> 06:15.520
Sister Tsetsegee 
has been paralyzed and bedridden 


06:15.520 --> 06:19.107
for 15 years because of tumors. 


06:19.107 --> 06:21.402
She recently learned the truth 


06:21.402 --> 06:24.697
and was baptized in July 2015, 


06:24.697 --> 06:27.157
but she cannot leave her yurt, 


06:27.157 --> 06:30.119
so she attends meetings regularly 
on the phone 


06:30.118 --> 06:32.828
and makes well-prepared comments. 


06:32.828 --> 06:34.831
Because she is bedridden, 


06:34.832 --> 06:38.000
she does all she can 
to informally witness to any visitors. 


06:39.085 --> 06:42.923
Twice a week, she conducts Bible studies 
with her grandchildren 


06:42.923 --> 06:46.760
and at the same time 
cares for her family worship. 


06:46.760 --> 06:49.345
Sadly, the time came for us to leave 


06:49.345 --> 06:53.892
this beautiful, happy family 
whom we fell in love with.


06:53.892 --> 06:57.687
From Mongolia, we traveled to Nepal


06:57.687 --> 06:59.940
—a land of majestic mountains. 


06:59.940 --> 07:04.653
The majority of its 20 million inhabitants 
are Hindus. 


07:04.653 --> 07:09.000
There is, however, a great diversity 
in the ethnic origins of the people. 


07:10.325 --> 07:12.618
The truth began to be cultivated 
in the 1970’s. 


07:12.618 --> 07:16.956
There are now 2,362 publishers. 


07:16.957 --> 07:21.002
The brothers and sisters 
are working hard in the ministry, 


07:21.002 --> 07:25.340
conducting about 4,500 Bible studies. 


07:25.340 --> 07:27.968
This has resulted 
in bringing in approximately 


07:27.968 --> 07:31.000
150 newly baptized ones each year. 


07:32.763 --> 07:36.225
After a short ride from the airport, 
we arrived at the country office, 


07:36.225 --> 07:38.770
located in the heart of Kathmandu. 


07:38.770 --> 07:41.272
Thirty members of the Bethel family 


07:41.272 --> 07:43.567
live and work in six rented buildings. 


07:43.567 --> 07:46.654
While the buildings are 
in the vicinity of each other, 


07:46.653 --> 07:51.198
it is not an efficient arrangement, 
either work-wise or financially. 


07:51.198 --> 07:53.201
So it was thrilling for the family 


07:53.202 --> 07:55.787
to learn that just a week before our arrival, 


07:55.787 --> 07:58.499
they had closed on a purchase 


07:58.498 --> 08:02.418
of a five-story office building.


08:02.418 --> 08:07.000
On Monday, Brother Luccioni and I 
took the opportunity to visit the new site. 


08:08.092 --> 08:10.552
The lower floors 
will comfortably accommodate 


08:10.552 --> 08:14.932
the Translation Department, 
audio recording, the Service Department, 


08:14.932 --> 08:17.684
as well as the Bethel Office. 


08:17.683 --> 08:20.228
This then allows for enough space 


08:20.228 --> 08:23.481
for all the residence rooms 
on the upper floors. 


08:23.482 --> 08:25.734
A key role for this country office 


08:25.733 --> 08:27.985
is the translation work. 


08:27.985 --> 08:31.698
Here at the meeting with the Translation 
and Audio/Video departments, 


08:31.698 --> 08:35.868
it was so encouraging to see 
their zeal for their work.


08:35.868 --> 08:39.371
Meet Brother Hira Maharjan, who is deaf 


08:39.372 --> 08:43.377
and commutes to Bethel twice a week 
to assist with sign-language translation. 


08:43.377 --> 08:45.587
During the earthquake last year, 


08:45.587 --> 08:47.630
his home where he lived with his family 


08:47.630 --> 08:50.000
was completely destroyed. 


08:51.050 --> 08:54.805
Following the earthquake, it was doubtful 
if he could continue commuting to Bethel 


08:54.805 --> 08:57.390
and supporting the translation work. 


08:57.390 --> 09:00.393
How are such ones faring now? 


09:00.393 --> 09:03.980
A tremendous amount 
of relief work was carried out 


09:03.980 --> 09:07.025
by the Disaster Relief Committee, or DRC. 


09:07.025 --> 09:11.237
This included building homes 
for about 90 families, 


09:11.237 --> 09:14.909
as seen in the photos 
of the buildings with the blue roofs. 


09:14.908 --> 09:17.000
As a result of the DRC construction, 


09:18.412 --> 09:21.205
Brother Hira now has a new home 


09:21.205 --> 09:23.917
and has resumed commuting 
to Bethel twice a week, 


09:23.917 --> 09:26.000
working around his secular work schedule. 


09:27.378 --> 09:31.090
Despite the earthquake 
and all the disruption that it brought, 


09:31.090 --> 09:35.178
the brothers and sisters never lost 
their focus on the ministry 


09:35.178 --> 09:38.265
and the need to bring comfort 
to their neighbors. 


09:38.265 --> 09:43.000
They just love talking 
about the wonderful good news.


09:44.312 --> 09:48.192
On Saturday, April 16, 
brothers and sisters from Kathmandu 


09:48.192 --> 09:51.360
began filing into the city’s Academy Hall 


09:51.360 --> 09:54.000
for the special meeting 
for the congregations. 


09:55.115 --> 09:59.243
In addition to the 13 congregations 
that were invited to the venue, 


09:59.243 --> 10:02.955
30 congregations throughout Nepal 
were tied in. 


10:02.955 --> 10:06.000
The total attendance was 3,137.


10:07.210 --> 10:10.422
Indeed, all praise goes to Jehovah 


10:10.422 --> 10:12.924
for drawing the sheeplike ones to him. 


10:12.923 --> 10:14.926
Whether they live in Nepal, 


10:14.927 --> 10:17.137
Mongolia, Japan, 


10:17.137 --> 10:19.305
or any other part of the world, 


10:19.305 --> 10:23.685
Jehovah is not partial and he brings them 
into his beautiful organization 


10:23.685 --> 10:26.228
that is truly united. 


10:26.228 --> 10:32.000
We are so thankful and proud 
to be with his people.


10:33.068 --> 10:36.698
Yes, people of all nations are flocking 


10:36.698 --> 10:39.616
to Jehovah’s mountain of true worship. 


10:39.617 --> 10:45.374
Of course, Jehovah deserves the credit 
for elevating pure worship in this time. 


10:45.373 --> 10:49.376
Still, as fellow workers, 
we are privileged to share in this work


10:49.377 --> 10:52.422
—sharing in this work 
with our brothers and sisters 


10:52.422 --> 10:54.842
from every part of the earth. 


10:54.842 --> 10:57.719
Ah, how marvelous it will be 


10:57.718 --> 11:09.920
when this entire globe is filled only 
with pure worshippers of Jehovah!

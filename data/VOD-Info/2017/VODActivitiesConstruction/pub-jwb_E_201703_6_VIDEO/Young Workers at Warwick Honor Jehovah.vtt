00:00.850 --> 00:03.887
Earlier in the program, 


00:03.887 --> 00:07.357
we saw some examples 
of how young ones 


00:07.357 --> 00:11.294
are building a future 
with Jehovah. 


00:11.293 --> 00:16.000
But what impact are such efforts 
having on the organization? 


00:17.200 --> 00:19.368
Let’s look at one example: 


00:19.368 --> 00:22.738
the construction 
of the new world headquarters 


00:22.738 --> 00:26.000
at Warwick, New York.


00:27.810 --> 00:32.215
Jehovah’s Witnesses built 
1.6 million square feet (149,000 sq m) 


00:32.215 --> 00:36.318
in less than four years.


00:36.318 --> 00:39.255
Of the 27,035 volunteers, 


00:39.255 --> 00:44.660
3,247 were between the ages of 19 and 25.


00:44.660 --> 00:46.797
I thought this was a project 


00:46.797 --> 00:49.032
that was going to strictly need 


00:49.032 --> 00:52.735
very experienced brothers and sisters. 


00:52.735 --> 00:55.172
Early on, I realized I was wrong. 


00:55.172 --> 00:58.340
It was also going to take youthful energy 


00:58.340 --> 01:00.843
because of the volume of work.


01:00.843 --> 01:02.845
The mix of older and younger ones 


01:02.845 --> 01:05.348
was really a helpful thing 
on the Warwick project. 


01:05.348 --> 01:08.618
The older ones 
brought skill and experience. 


01:08.618 --> 01:11.686
The younger ones 
brought the energy, the muscle, 


01:11.687 --> 01:14.157
and the diligence to stay 
with hard physical tasks 


01:14.157 --> 01:15.325
all the way through the project.


01:15.325 --> 01:20.263
Whether it was in the kitchen
or night watch


01:20.263 --> 01:22.498
or the early 5:00 a.m. start 
with the concrete crew 


01:22.498 --> 01:23.633
at 10 degrees Fahrenheit (-12°C), 


01:23.633 --> 01:26.301
their joy and their humility was outstanding 


01:26.302 --> 01:28.672
to accept any work that needed to be done.


01:28.672 --> 01:31.507
And a lot of young ones, 
brothers and sisters, 


01:31.507 --> 01:33.810
moved into the area 
so they could commute.


01:33.810 --> 01:36.278
And they would work 
day after day tirelessly, 


01:36.278 --> 01:39.815
into the evenings even, 
to have the project ready for the next day. 


01:39.815 --> 01:43.920
Their energy was just astonishing.


01:43.920 --> 01:47.457
Jehovah loves young ones, 
and he’s willing to invest in them 


01:47.457 --> 01:52.262
and train them and make them 
a part of his organization. 


01:52.262 --> 01:54.730
And I saw that so much.


01:54.730 --> 01:56.732
We had a lot of young people 
who offered themselves 


01:56.732 --> 01:58.469
with technical skills. 


01:58.468 --> 02:03.171
But if the humility of these 
very technically-skilled young people 


02:03.172 --> 02:05.675
didn’t match 
or exceed their abilities, 


02:05.675 --> 02:07.677
then, really, 
Jehovah couldn’t use them. 


02:07.677 --> 02:12.349
And they were willing to adjust, 
and we really saw the benefit.


02:12.348 --> 02:14.850
We knew and they knew 


02:14.850 --> 02:16.987
that they were building 


02:16.987 --> 02:19.755
not just a project at Warwick


02:19.755 --> 02:22.758
—they were building 
a spiritual project for Jehovah.


02:22.758 --> 02:25.661
You could see Jehovah’s spirit 
operating on them. 


02:25.662 --> 02:29.000
You could see them 
mature so quickly.


02:30.098 --> 02:32.101
These young brothers 
are the next generation 


02:32.102 --> 02:34.204
of elders 
and traveling overseers. 


02:34.203 --> 02:37.206
They’re to be commended 
and highly respected 


02:37.207 --> 02:39.575
for the contribution 
they made as young men.


02:39.575 --> 02:41.577
They all talk about the effect 


02:41.577 --> 02:44.580
that their Bethel service
has had on their outlook


02:44.580 --> 02:46.917
and how they don’t want 
to get caught up 


02:46.917 --> 02:49.000
in this world 
and its daily pursuits.


02:50.553 --> 02:53.288
Use the skills you’ve learned 


02:53.288 --> 02:56.325
here on this project and in Bethel. 


02:56.325 --> 02:58.728
You are needed. 


02:58.728 --> 03:01.830
Continue to keep your spirituality up 


03:01.830 --> 03:06.068
and to keep your association 
at a high level.


03:06.068 --> 03:09.638
The highest quality of life is when, 


03:09.638 --> 03:13.976
as clay, we put ourselves 
in the hands of the Great Potter, Jehovah, 


03:13.977 --> 03:16.980
and we say: 
“Here I am! Send me!”. 


03:16.980 --> 03:20.717
And I’m fully confident 
they will have no regrets 


03:20.717 --> 03:33.147
building their future 
with Jehovah.

00:00.770 --> 00:02.773
Jehovah highly values 


00:02.773 --> 00:03.940
the loyalty 


00:03.940 --> 00:05.985
of his worshippers. 


00:05.985 --> 00:08.278
He especially appreciates it 


00:08.278 --> 00:13.075
when we are loyal to him 
even under adversity. 


00:13.075 --> 00:17.705
How does Jehovah respond 
when we remain loyal to him? 


00:17.705 --> 00:21.083
He, in turn, 
takes great pleasure 


00:21.083 --> 00:24.126
in showing his loyalty to us. 


00:24.127 --> 00:28.590
Psalm 145:17 says: 


00:28.590 --> 00:33.428
“Jehovah is . . . loyal in all that he does.” 


00:33.428 --> 00:36.931
This means that Jehovah is dependable


00:36.932 --> 00:39.435
—always faithful. 


00:39.435 --> 00:43.188
He will never abandon his friends.


00:43.188 --> 00:48.193
How do you feel 
about having Jehovah on your side? 


00:48.193 --> 00:51.000
There is no greater blessing! 


00:52.615 --> 00:57.620
Jehovah is willing and able 
to use his limitless power 


00:57.620 --> 01:00.915
in behalf of his people. 


01:00.915 --> 01:04.125
So it makes sense 
to be on Jehovah’s side. 


01:04.125 --> 01:08.922
For that reason most, if not all, 
of Jehovah’s worshippers 


01:08.922 --> 01:13.927
start out with every intention 
of being loyal to him. 


01:13.927 --> 01:15.930
But there is a difference 


01:15.930 --> 01:19.267
between wanting to be loyal to God, 


01:19.267 --> 01:21.894
claiming to be loyal to God, 


01:21.893 --> 01:25.813
and actually remaining loyal to God.


01:25.813 --> 01:27.900
Every one of us will have 


01:27.900 --> 01:31.278
our loyalty to Jehovah 
put to the test. 


01:31.278 --> 01:33.530
When that happens, 


01:33.530 --> 01:37.743
will you take 
a firm stand on Jehovah’s side? 


01:37.743 --> 01:40.286
The issue of loyalty 


01:40.287 --> 01:43.499
is clearly illustrated 
by the events that took place 


01:43.498 --> 01:45.666
in the wilderness of Sinai 


01:45.667 --> 01:48.879
shortly after the Israelites left Egypt. 


01:48.878 --> 01:51.965
God’s people started out 
with every intention 


01:51.965 --> 01:53.967
of being loyal to Jehovah. 


01:53.967 --> 01:55.970
They entered into a covenant 


01:55.970 --> 01:58.847
in which they promised 
to be loyal to God, 


01:58.847 --> 02:01.100
and Jehovah, in turn, 


02:01.100 --> 02:04.645
offered them his unbreakable loyalty. 


02:04.645 --> 02:07.940
What lessons can we learn 
from this account? 


02:07.940 --> 02:09.942
Let us start 


02:09.942 --> 02:14.000
by reading Exodus 20:1-7.


03:29.772 --> 03:33.192
Try to visualize what happened here. 


03:33.192 --> 03:37.989
Just three months 
after the awesome display of Jehovah’s power 


03:37.988 --> 03:42.450
in the Ten Plagues on Egypt 
and the crossing of the Red Sea, 


03:42.450 --> 03:45.287
God’s people find themselves in front 


03:45.287 --> 03:48.915
of a violently trembling Mount Sinai. 


03:48.915 --> 03:52.335
There is thunder and lightning, 


03:52.335 --> 03:55.088
a heavy cloud, smoke, 


03:55.088 --> 03:57.090
and what seems to be 


03:57.090 --> 04:00.000
the loud and constant sound of a horn.


04:01.095 --> 04:03.097
In this setting, 


04:03.097 --> 04:07.225
Jehovah describes himself as a loyal God, 


04:07.225 --> 04:10.103
promising to show “loyal love” 


04:10.103 --> 04:13.815
to those who give him “exclusive devotion.” 


04:13.815 --> 04:17.277
In effect, Jehovah was telling his people: 


04:17.277 --> 04:20.322
‘If you prove to be on my side, 


04:20.322 --> 04:23.742
I will prove to be on your side.’ 


04:23.742 --> 04:26.370
How did the Israelites respond 


04:26.370 --> 04:29.038
to Jehovah’s pledge of loyalty? 


04:29.038 --> 04:31.333
Let’s follow this account 


04:31.333 --> 04:36.000
by reading Exodus 24:3-18.


07:32.597 --> 07:37.019
Imagine how thrilled 
the Israelites must have been! 


07:37.018 --> 07:41.523
There they were 
in the presence of the only true God, 


07:41.523 --> 07:44.608
listening to Jehovah’s promise of loyalty 


07:44.608 --> 07:47.361
and making a covenant with him. 


07:47.362 --> 07:50.157
At Exodus 19:5, 


07:50.157 --> 07:52.659
Jehovah tells them: 


07:52.658 --> 07:55.620
“If you will strictly obey my voice 


07:55.620 --> 07:57.622
“and keep my covenant, 


07:57.622 --> 07:59.624
“you will certainly become 


07:59.623 --> 08:03.461
“my special property out of all peoples, 


08:03.462 --> 08:05.839
for the whole earth belongs to me.”


08:05.838 --> 08:08.008
As you might expect, 


08:08.008 --> 08:12.553
the Israelites responded 
with a strong determination to be obedient, 


08:12.553 --> 08:17.141
faithful, yes loyal, to Jehovah. 


08:17.142 --> 08:20.187
Unanimously, they replied: 


08:20.187 --> 08:24.524
“All that Jehovah has spoken 
we are willing to do, 


08:24.523 --> 08:27.026
and we will be obedient.” 


08:27.027 --> 08:30.322
However, as mentioned earlier, 


08:30.322 --> 08:32.365
there is a difference 


08:32.365 --> 08:35.452
between wanting to be loyal to God, 


08:35.452 --> 08:37.954
claiming to be loyal to God, 


08:37.953 --> 08:41.958
and actually remaining loyal to God.


08:41.958 --> 08:44.795
In the account we are reading, 


08:44.795 --> 08:47.005
the Israelites had every intention 


08:47.005 --> 08:49.298
of being loyal to Jehovah. 


08:49.298 --> 08:52.468
But could their loyalty withstand 


08:52.468 --> 08:55.305
an unexpected test? 


08:55.305 --> 08:58.225
Let’s follow along with the reading 


08:58.225 --> 09:03.000
of Exodus 32:1-35.


16:35.473 --> 16:37.891
The Israelites appeared to have 


16:37.892 --> 16:41.312
every intention of being loyal to Jehovah. 


16:41.312 --> 16:44.774
But their faith was evidently too dependent 


16:44.773 --> 16:47.651
on Moses’ visible presence. 


16:47.652 --> 16:50.070
When Moses remained on Mount Sinai 


16:50.070 --> 16:52.073
longer than expected, 


16:52.073 --> 16:54.366
the Israelites became anxious. 


16:54.367 --> 16:57.370
Perhaps they felt abandoned by Moses,


16:57.370 --> 16:59.538
or perhaps they feared that Moses 


16:59.538 --> 17:01.665
had died up on the mountain! 


17:01.665 --> 17:03.668
Whatever the case, 


17:03.668 --> 17:05.670
they thought of themselves 


17:05.670 --> 17:08.005
as being stranded in the desert 


17:08.005 --> 17:11.008
without their trustworthy leader. 


17:11.008 --> 17:15.638
Their loyalty was put to the test.


17:15.638 --> 17:19.308
True loyalty would have moved the Israelites 


17:19.308 --> 17:22.728
to view these disconcerting circumstances 


17:22.728 --> 17:24.813
as an opportunity to prove 


17:24.813 --> 17:27.608
their exclusive devotion to Jehovah 


17:27.608 --> 17:31.236
even when they were in distress. 


17:31.237 --> 17:33.530
They sought comfort by pursuing 


17:33.530 --> 17:37.035
a fleshly course that included merrymaking, 


17:37.035 --> 17:41.330
eating, drinking, and idolatrous rituals. 


17:41.330 --> 17:45.000
Ironically, they described the event 


17:45.000 --> 17:47.837
as “a festival to Jehovah.” 


17:47.837 --> 17:49.839
What is more, 


17:49.838 --> 17:51.881
they deluded themselves into believing 


17:51.882 --> 17:53.885
that the golden calf 


17:53.885 --> 17:57.430
was a representation of Jehovah himself! 


17:57.430 --> 17:59.890
They actually thought 


17:59.890 --> 18:02.393
that they could engage in idolatry 


18:02.393 --> 18:05.646
and still be loyal to Jehovah!


18:05.647 --> 18:09.067
They wanted to be loyal to Jehovah, 


18:09.067 --> 18:11.235
and they claimed to be loyal 


18:11.235 --> 18:15.238
even while venerating a golden calf. 


18:15.238 --> 18:17.700
How did Jehovah view them 


18:17.700 --> 18:19.910
and their form of worship? 


18:19.910 --> 18:22.330
Jehovah told Moses that the people 


18:22.330 --> 18:24.332
had “corrupted themselves” 


18:24.332 --> 18:27.127
and had “deviated” from doing his will. 


18:27.127 --> 18:29.212
In his “burning anger,” 


18:29.212 --> 18:31.214
Jehovah considered annihilating 


18:31.213 --> 18:33.215
the newly formed nation of Israel 


18:33.215 --> 18:35.217
for their betrayal.


18:35.217 --> 18:37.720
Not all of the Israelites, however, 


18:37.720 --> 18:39.930
proved to be disloyal to Jehovah. 


18:39.930 --> 18:41.932
Moses, for example, 


18:41.932 --> 18:45.185
took a firm stand against the idolaters. 


18:45.185 --> 18:47.855
“He took the calf that they had made 


18:47.855 --> 18:49.857
“and he burned it with fire 


18:49.857 --> 18:52.069
and crushed it into powder.” 


18:52.068 --> 18:54.445
And when Moses took his position 


18:54.445 --> 18:56.447
in the gate of the camp and said: 


18:56.447 --> 18:59.659
“Who is on Jehovah’s side? 
Come to me!” 


18:59.658 --> 19:02.661
all the Levites gathered around him! 


19:02.662 --> 19:05.039
In their loyalty to Jehovah, 


19:05.038 --> 19:07.041
the Levites went so far 


19:07.042 --> 19:09.044
as to take up the sword 


19:09.043 --> 19:11.086
against their own idolatrous relatives 


19:11.087 --> 19:13.130
and neighbors! 


19:13.130 --> 19:15.132
Moses and the Levites 


19:15.132 --> 19:18.762
were unquestionably on Jehovah’s side.


19:18.762 --> 19:20.972
In response, 


19:20.972 --> 19:23.640
Jehovah proved loyal to them. 


19:23.640 --> 19:25.643
Jehovah was also loyal 


19:25.643 --> 19:28.436
to his friends Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 


19:28.437 --> 19:30.440
by remembering the promises 


19:30.440 --> 19:32.442
he had made to them, 


19:32.442 --> 19:36.737
so he did not exterminate 
the entire nation. 


19:36.737 --> 19:40.450
Jehovah is indeed on the side of those 


19:40.450 --> 19:42.452
who are loyal to him. 


19:42.452 --> 19:44.454
Please follow along 


19:44.453 --> 19:46.705
as we conclude our Bible reading. 


19:46.705 --> 19:48.750
Let us now read 


19:48.750 --> 19:53.000
Exodus 34:1-14.


23:22.838 --> 23:24.840
What lesson do we learn 


23:24.840 --> 23:27.133
from this Bible account? 


23:27.133 --> 23:31.680
Wanting to be loyal 
to Jehovah is not enough. 


23:31.680 --> 23:34.058
This world’s corrupting influences 


23:34.058 --> 23:36.060
can deceive us into thinking 


23:36.060 --> 23:39.272
that we can deviate 
from Jehovah’s principles 


23:39.272 --> 23:42.107
and still be loyal to him. 


23:42.107 --> 23:46.945
But Jehovah 
“requires exclusive devotion.”


23:46.945 --> 23:50.407
Granted, we will face adversities. 


23:50.407 --> 23:54.204
We might have 
unexpected family problems 


23:54.203 --> 23:57.873
or encounter serious financial difficulties. 


23:57.873 --> 24:01.335
Members of the congregation may offend us. 


24:01.335 --> 24:05.965
Poor health may cause us great suffering. 


24:05.965 --> 24:09.427
When experiencing such distress, 


24:09.427 --> 24:11.970
we must always remember 


24:11.970 --> 24:14.598
that violating Jehovah’s principles 


24:14.598 --> 24:17.810
is never a solution. 


24:17.810 --> 24:21.022
But taking a firm stand on Jehovah’s side 


24:21.022 --> 24:24.025
will always bring blessings. 


24:24.025 --> 24:26.360
This is guaranteed 


24:26.360 --> 24:30.613
because Jehovah is always dependable, 


24:30.613 --> 24:34.660
reliable, and unfailing. 


24:34.660 --> 24:38.205
He promises to show “loyal love” 


24:38.205 --> 24:41.750
to those who give him “exclusive devotion.” 


24:41.750 --> 24:44.712
In effect, Jehovah is telling us: 


24:44.712 --> 24:47.757
‘If you prove to be on my side, 


24:47.757 --> 24:50.927
I will prove to be on your side.’ 


24:50.927 --> 24:53.345
As we just read, 


24:53.345 --> 24:55.765
Jehovah “will do wonderful things” 


24:55.765 --> 24:57.767
for his people. 


24:57.767 --> 25:01.812
Jehovah is “a God merciful 
and compassionate, 


25:01.812 --> 25:13.595
slow to anger 
and abundant in loyal love.”

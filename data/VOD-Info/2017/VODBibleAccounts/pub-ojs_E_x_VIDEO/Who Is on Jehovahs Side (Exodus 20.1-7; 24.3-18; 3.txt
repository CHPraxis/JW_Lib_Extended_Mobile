00:00 Jehovah highly values
00:02 the loyalty
00:03 of his worshippers.
00:05 He especially appreciates it
00:08 when we are loyal to him  even under adversity.
00:13 How does Jehovah respond  when we remain loyal to him?
00:17 He, in turn,  takes great pleasure
00:21 in showing his loyalty to us.
00:24 Psalm 145:17 says:
00:28 “Jehovah is . . . loyal in all that he does.”
00:33 This means that Jehovah is dependable
00:36 —always faithful.
00:39 He will never abandon his friends.
00:43 How do you feel  about having Jehovah on your side?
00:48 There is no greater blessing!
00:52 Jehovah is willing and able  to use his limitless power
00:57 in behalf of his people.
01:00 So it makes sense  to be on Jehovah’s side.
01:04 For that reason most, if not all,  of Jehovah’s worshippers
01:08 start out with every intention  of being loyal to him.
01:13 But there is a difference
01:15 between wanting to be loyal to God,
01:19 claiming to be loyal to God,
01:21 and actually remaining loyal to God.
01:25 Every one of us will have
01:27 our loyalty to Jehovah  put to the test.
01:31 When that happens,
01:33 will you take  a firm stand on Jehovah’s side?
01:37 The issue of loyalty
01:40 is clearly illustrated  by the events that took place
01:43 in the wilderness of Sinai
01:45 shortly after the Israelites left Egypt.
01:48 God’s people started out  with every intention
01:51 of being loyal to Jehovah.
01:53 They entered into a covenant
01:55 in which they promised  to be loyal to God,
01:58 and Jehovah, in turn,
02:01 offered them his unbreakable loyalty.
02:04 What lessons can we learn  from this account?
02:07 Let us start
02:09 by reading Exodus 20:1-7.
03:29 Try to visualize what happened here.
03:33 Just three months  after the awesome display of Jehovah’s power
03:37 in the Ten Plagues on Egypt  and the crossing of the Red Sea,
03:42 God’s people find themselves in front
03:45 of a violently trembling Mount Sinai.
03:48 There is thunder and lightning,
03:52 a heavy cloud, smoke,
03:55 and what seems to be
03:57 the loud and constant sound of a horn.
04:01 In this setting,
04:03 Jehovah describes himself as a loyal God,
04:07 promising to show “loyal love”
04:10 to those who give him “exclusive devotion.”
04:13 In effect, Jehovah was telling his people:
04:17 ‘If you prove to be on my side,
04:20 I will prove to be on your side.’
04:23 How did the Israelites respond
04:26 to Jehovah’s pledge of loyalty?
04:29 Let’s follow this account
04:31 by reading Exodus 24:3-18.
07:32 Imagine how thrilled  the Israelites must have been!
07:37 There they were  in the presence of the only true God,
07:41 listening to Jehovah’s promise of loyalty
07:44 and making a covenant with him.
07:47 At Exodus 19:5,
07:50 Jehovah tells them:
07:52 “If you will strictly obey my voice
07:55 “and keep my covenant,
07:57 “you will certainly become
07:59 “my special property out of all peoples,
08:03 for the whole earth belongs to me.”
08:05 As you might expect,
08:08 the Israelites responded  with a strong determination to be obedient,
08:12 faithful, yes loyal, to Jehovah.
08:17 Unanimously, they replied:
08:20 “All that Jehovah has spoken  we are willing to do,
08:24 and we will be obedient.”
08:27 However, as mentioned earlier,
08:30 there is a difference
08:32 between wanting to be loyal to God,
08:35 claiming to be loyal to God,
08:37 and actually remaining loyal to God.
08:41 In the account we are reading,
08:44 the Israelites had every intention
08:47 of being loyal to Jehovah.
08:49 But could their loyalty withstand
08:52 an unexpected test?
08:55 Let’s follow along with the reading
08:58 of Exodus 32:1-35.
16:35 The Israelites appeared to have
16:37 every intention of being loyal to Jehovah.
16:41 But their faith was evidently too dependent
16:44 on Moses’ visible presence.
16:47 When Moses remained on Mount Sinai
16:50 longer than expected,
16:52 the Israelites became anxious.
16:54 Perhaps they felt abandoned by Moses,
16:57 or perhaps they feared that Moses
16:59 had died up on the mountain!
17:01 Whatever the case,
17:03 they thought of themselves
17:05 as being stranded in the desert
17:08 without their trustworthy leader.
17:11 Their loyalty was put to the test.
17:15 True loyalty would have moved the Israelites
17:19 to view these disconcerting circumstances
17:22 as an opportunity to prove
17:24 their exclusive devotion to Jehovah
17:27 even when they were in distress.
17:31 They sought comfort by pursuing
17:33 a fleshly course that included merrymaking,
17:37 eating, drinking, and idolatrous rituals.
17:41 Ironically, they described the event
17:45 as “a festival to Jehovah.”
17:47 What is more,
17:49 they deluded themselves into believing
17:51 that the golden calf
17:53 was a representation of Jehovah himself!
17:57 They actually thought
17:59 that they could engage in idolatry
18:02 and still be loyal to Jehovah!
18:05 They wanted to be loyal to Jehovah,
18:09 and they claimed to be loyal
18:11 even while venerating a golden calf.
18:15 How did Jehovah view them
18:17 and their form of worship?
18:19 Jehovah told Moses that the people
18:22 had “corrupted themselves”
18:24 and had “deviated” from doing his will.
18:27 In his “burning anger,”
18:29 Jehovah considered annihilating
18:31 the newly formed nation of Israel
18:33 for their betrayal.
18:35 Not all of the Israelites, however,
18:37 proved to be disloyal to Jehovah.
18:39 Moses, for example,
18:41 took a firm stand against the idolaters.
18:45 “He took the calf that they had made
18:47 “and he burned it with fire
18:49 and crushed it into powder.”
18:52 And when Moses took his position
18:54 in the gate of the camp and said:
18:56 “Who is on Jehovah’s side?  Come to me!”
18:59 all the Levites gathered around him!
19:02 In their loyalty to Jehovah,
19:05 the Levites went so far
19:07 as to take up the sword
19:09 against their own idolatrous relatives
19:11 and neighbors!
19:13 Moses and the Levites
19:15 were unquestionably on Jehovah’s side.
19:18 In response,
19:20 Jehovah proved loyal to them.
19:23 Jehovah was also loyal
19:25 to his friends Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
19:28 by remembering the promises
19:30 he had made to them,
19:32 so he did not exterminate  the entire nation.
19:36 Jehovah is indeed on the side of those
19:40 who are loyal to him.
19:42 Please follow along
19:44 as we conclude our Bible reading.
19:46 Let us now read
19:48 Exodus 34:1-14.
23:22 What lesson do we learn
23:24 from this Bible account?
23:27 Wanting to be loyal  to Jehovah is not enough.
23:31 This world’s corrupting influences
23:34 can deceive us into thinking
23:36 that we can deviate  from Jehovah’s principles
23:39 and still be loyal to him.
23:42 But Jehovah  “requires exclusive devotion.”
23:46 Granted, we will face adversities.
23:50 We might have  unexpected family problems
23:54 or encounter serious financial difficulties.
23:57 Members of the congregation may offend us.
24:01 Poor health may cause us great suffering.
24:05 When experiencing such distress,
24:09 we must always remember
24:11 that violating Jehovah’s principles
24:14 is never a solution.
24:17 But taking a firm stand on Jehovah’s side
24:21 will always bring blessings.
24:24 This is guaranteed
24:26 because Jehovah is always dependable,
24:30 reliable, and unfailing.
24:34 He promises to show “loyal love”
24:38 to those who give him “exclusive devotion.”
24:41 In effect, Jehovah is telling us:
24:44 ‘If you prove to be on my side,
24:47 I will prove to be on your side.’
24:50 As we just read,
24:53 Jehovah “will do wonderful things”
24:55 for his people.
24:57 Jehovah is “a God merciful  and compassionate,
25:01 slow to anger  and abundant in loyal love.”

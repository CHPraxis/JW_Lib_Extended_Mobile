00:01.438 --> 00:06.443
Jesus came to “bear witness to the truth.” 


00:06.443 --> 00:11.448
Standing on trial
before the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate,


00:11.448 --> 00:14.158
Jesus boldly stated, 


00:14.158 --> 00:17.328
as recorded at John 18:37:


00:17.328 --> 00:20.916
“For this I have come into the world,


00:20.917 --> 00:24.337
“that I should bear witness to the truth. 


00:24.337 --> 00:27.549
“Everyone who is
on the side of the truth


00:27.548 --> 00:30.000
listens to my voice.”


00:31.468 --> 00:35.596
Jesus used his
three-and-a-half year ministry on earth 


00:35.597 --> 00:38.267
to teach people the truth


00:38.267 --> 00:41.854
about Jehovah God and His purpose. 


00:41.853 --> 00:44.856
Those who were
“on the side of the truth”


00:44.857 --> 00:48.000
responded favorably
and wanted to learn more. 


00:49.528 --> 00:53.865
Others, however,
by their response to the good news, 


00:53.865 --> 00:58.000
revealed themselves
to be enemies of the truth.


00:59.913 --> 01:03.541
As Jesus neared the end
of his earthly ministry,


01:03.542 --> 01:07.922
he ‘bore witness
to the truth’ during a series


01:07.922 --> 01:11.000
of dramatic confrontations
in the temple. 


01:13.177 --> 01:17.724
What lessons can we learn
from the exciting events recorded


01:17.723 --> 01:21.000
in Matthew chapters 21 and 22? 


01:22.227 --> 01:24.229
As we will see, 


01:24.228 --> 01:30.110
these two chapters of Matthew
highlight Jesus’ courage, 


01:30.110 --> 01:33.072
his masterful teaching ability, 


01:33.072 --> 01:38.952
and his persistence in bearing 
thorough witness to the truth. 


01:38.952 --> 01:40.955
Studying these chapters


01:40.955 --> 01:44.000
will help us to imitate
Jesus’ fine qualities. 


01:45.208 --> 01:50.005
Let us begin with Matthew chapter 21. 


01:50.005 --> 01:53.883
Verses 12 to 14 relate how Jesus


01:53.883 --> 01:58.596
threw out those selling
and buying animals in the temple


01:58.597 --> 02:03.000
and overturned the tables
of the money changers. 


02:04.268 --> 02:09.000
These events took place
on Nisan 10, 33 C.E. 


02:10.067 --> 02:11.694
The next day, 


02:11.693 --> 02:15.238
the chief priests
directly challenged Jesus’ authority


02:15.238 --> 02:18.450
to disrupt their business. 


02:18.450 --> 02:20.910
How would he respond? 


02:20.910 --> 02:24.000
Let us start the reading at verse 23:


07:29.887 --> 07:34.000
In challenging Jesus
with the words in verse 23,


07:35.350 --> 07:39.228
“By what authority
do you do these things? 


07:39.228 --> 07:43.441
And who gave you this authority?”


07:43.442 --> 07:48.447
the chief priests and elders
showed gross disrespect for Jehovah,


07:48.447 --> 07:53.452
his temple, 
and his inspired Word of truth. 


07:53.452 --> 07:56.872
Jesus boldly countered their challenge


07:56.872 --> 08:01.209
with a question
that left them speechless,


08:01.208 --> 08:03.211
for it exposed them 


08:03.212 --> 08:07.924
as treacherous and calculating. 


08:07.923 --> 08:09.926
Before they could recover, 


08:09.927 --> 08:13.055
Jesus followed up with two illustrations. 


08:13.055 --> 08:16.517
First, he compared the religious leaders


08:16.517 --> 08:19.770
to a rebellious son. 


08:19.770 --> 08:22.647
They had made a promise
to do God’s will 


08:22.647 --> 08:25.859
but had not kept it. 


08:25.858 --> 08:28.861
Next, Jesus denounced them


08:28.862 --> 08:32.407
as wicked caretakers
of Jehovah’s “vineyard”


08:32.407 --> 08:36.579
who would be held responsible
for their failure


08:36.578 --> 08:41.000
to cultivate the “fruitage” of faith
in God’s Son. 


08:42.250 --> 08:46.463
Jesus’ illustrations were so masterful


08:46.463 --> 08:49.590
that the chief priests and elders


08:49.590 --> 08:55.000
unwittingly pronounced judgment
on themselves. 


08:56.055 --> 08:59.558
The religious leaders were furious, 


08:59.558 --> 09:04.688
and they would have tried to kill Jesus
but they feared the crowds. 


09:04.688 --> 09:07.566
So they took the indirect approach


09:07.567 --> 09:11.864
and conspired to trap Jesus
in his speech. 


09:11.863 --> 09:15.000
How would Jesus handle
this new challenge? 


09:16.452 --> 09:18.454
Please turn your attention


09:18.453 --> 09:23.000
to Matthew 22:15-33:


12:37.443 --> 12:40.196
Jesus was approached first


12:40.197 --> 12:46.035
by party followers of Herod
and disciples of the Pharisees. 


12:46.035 --> 12:48.245
Although these two groups


12:48.245 --> 12:51.833
held conflicting
political and social views, 


12:51.833 --> 12:56.000
they were united
in their hatred for Jesus. 


12:57.172 --> 13:00.592
Flattering words prefaced


13:00.592 --> 13:03.887
a dangerous question: 


13:03.887 --> 13:08.000
“Is it lawful to pay head tax
to Caesar or not?” 


13:09.142 --> 13:13.145
Had Jesus answered, 
“Yes, it is lawful,”


13:13.145 --> 13:15.898
he could have enraged the crowd,


13:15.898 --> 13:20.195
for many would have felt
that he was condoning the injustices


13:20.195 --> 13:24.407
they suffered at the hands
of the Romans. 


13:24.407 --> 13:27.952
On the other hand,
a response such as, 


13:27.952 --> 13:30.372
“It is not lawful,” 


13:30.372 --> 13:33.082
could have sparked a revolt, 


13:33.082 --> 13:38.000
resulting in Jesus’ immediate
arrest for sedition. 


13:39.005 --> 13:44.052
Jesus did not fall into either trap. 


13:44.052 --> 13:47.305
Instead, using a coin, 


13:47.305 --> 13:53.268
he responded with an object lesson
that amazed his questioners.


13:53.268 --> 13:57.815
Next, the Sadducees,
intending to discredit Jesus, 


13:57.815 --> 14:00.443
proposed a scenario


14:00.443 --> 14:04.280
that they thought would expose
belief in the resurrection


14:04.280 --> 14:07.242
as foolishness. 


14:07.242 --> 14:11.662
In response,
Jesus used flawless reasoning


14:11.662 --> 14:13.665
to highlight Scriptural evidence 


14:13.665 --> 14:18.000
that the Sadducees had apparently 
never considered before. 


14:19.378 --> 14:24.383
They professed to believe the words
of Jehovah recorded at Exodus 3:6:


14:24.383 --> 14:28.136
“I am . . . the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,


14:28.137 --> 14:31.099
and the God of Jacob.” 


14:31.098 --> 14:33.308
When Jehovah spoke those words, 


14:33.308 --> 14:37.000
Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob had long since died. 


14:38.313 --> 14:42.651
Yet, Jehovah said “I am” their God, 


14:42.652 --> 14:45.000
not “I was” their God. 


14:46.530 --> 14:49.450
By speaking
of these long-dead patriarchs


14:49.450 --> 14:51.618
as though they were still alive,


14:51.618 --> 14:55.956
Jehovah showed that his purpose
to resurrect his faithful servants


14:55.957 --> 14:58.000
is sure of fulfillment. 


15:00.087 --> 15:03.715
Additionally, 
Jesus told the Sadducees


15:03.715 --> 15:07.635
that “in the resurrection
neither do men marry


15:07.635 --> 15:10.180
nor are women given in marriage,


15:10.180 --> 15:13.975
but they are as angels in heaven.” 


15:13.975 --> 15:16.602
He may have been using
the opportunity


15:16.602 --> 15:19.689
to reveal truths
about the heavenly resurrection


15:19.688 --> 15:22.650
for the benefit of sincere disciples


15:22.650 --> 15:26.278
who would one day
be in line to receive


15:26.278 --> 15:29.115
such a resurrection. 


15:29.115 --> 15:31.952
The crowds were astounded


15:31.952 --> 15:36.000
at Jesus’ authoritative teaching
from the Scriptures.


15:38.500 --> 15:44.213
Finally, the Pharisees
and Sadducees joined forces


15:44.213 --> 15:48.341
to test Jesus one last time. 


15:48.342 --> 15:52.055
A scribe from among them,
“versed in the Law,”


15:52.055 --> 15:56.852
presented a deceptively
simple question, 


15:56.852 --> 16:01.000
namely: “Which is
the greatest commandment?” 


16:02.398 --> 16:07.236
In Jesus’ day,
this was a hotly debated question. 


16:07.237 --> 16:12.700
Would Jesus say something in answer
that would damage his credibility? 


16:12.700 --> 16:14.535
Let us listen


16:14.535 --> 16:18.665
to Matthew 22:34-46 


16:18.665 --> 16:21.877
to learn from Jesus’ response. 


16:21.877 --> 16:27.000
That’s Matthew 22,
beginning with verse 34:


18:46.937 --> 18:49.774
Quoting from God’s Word, 


18:49.773 --> 18:55.738
Jesus captured the essence
of true worship—love. 


18:55.738 --> 19:00.116
The Mosaic Law consisted
of more than 600 individual laws


19:00.117 --> 19:01.869
and regulations,


19:01.868 --> 19:05.748
yet Jesus
—without hesitation—


19:05.748 --> 19:10.000
selected the two commandments 
on which “the whole Law hangs.” 


19:11.753 --> 19:14.048
The clear truth of his answer


19:14.048 --> 19:19.803
cut through human tradition
and empty debate.


19:19.803 --> 19:24.000
Jesus then turned the tables 
on his opposers with this question: 


19:25.225 --> 19:28.603
‘If the Christ is to be a “son of David,”


19:28.603 --> 19:34.818
then why does David refer to him
in the psalms as “my Lord”?’ 


19:34.818 --> 19:36.820
More than a mere riddle, 


19:36.820 --> 19:40.575
this question uncovered
the spiritual ignorance


19:40.575 --> 19:43.368
of Jesus’ enemies. 


19:43.368 --> 19:45.996
Exposed as spiritually blind, 


19:45.997 --> 19:47.999
his opposers


19:47.998 --> 19:51.000
never dared
to question Jesus again. 


19:53.545 --> 19:56.132
How can we follow Jesus’ example


19:56.132 --> 19:59.677
in bearing witness to the truth?


19:59.677 --> 20:03.000
First, by imitating his courage. 


20:04.557 --> 20:08.937
Jesus’ courage
was based on faith in God. 


20:08.937 --> 20:13.024
We grow in faith
by praying for holy spirit,


20:13.023 --> 20:16.235
by meditating
on Bible accounts that highlight


20:16.235 --> 20:19.613
the courageous acts of God’s servants, 


20:19.613 --> 20:23.826
and by allowing what we learn
at Christian meetings 


20:23.827 --> 20:26.954
to sink into our hearts. 


20:26.953 --> 20:30.833
Doing this enables us
to build strong faith


20:30.833 --> 20:34.000
on the foundation of truth.


20:35.337 --> 20:38.090
Another way
that we can follow Jesus’ example


20:38.090 --> 20:40.427
in bearing witness to the truth


20:40.427 --> 20:45.000
is by imitating his masterful teaching. 


20:46.348 --> 20:50.101
We can reach the hearts
of sincere listeners with the truth


20:50.102 --> 20:54.815
by imitating Jesus’ use of questions,


20:54.815 --> 20:59.403
illustrations, and object lessons


20:59.403 --> 21:01.780
as well as his reasoning


21:01.780 --> 21:05.000
and skillful use of God’s written Word.


21:06.535 --> 21:10.498
Third, 
we are following Jesus’ example


21:10.498 --> 21:15.000
when we persevere in our efforts
to bear thorough witness. 


21:16.337 --> 21:20.000
Never give up in preaching
and teaching the good news; 


21:21.008 --> 21:26.596
those who reject the truth at first
may respond later. 


21:26.597 --> 21:30.309
The inspired record
in Acts of Apostles tells us 


21:30.308 --> 21:32.311
that in time


21:32.312 --> 21:35.649
thousands of Jews
began paying attention 


21:35.648 --> 21:39.151
to the good news
that had been preached by Jesus, 


21:39.152 --> 21:44.157
including “a large crowd of priests”


21:44.157 --> 21:49.662
and some who had been Pharisees. 


21:49.662 --> 21:52.957
These no longer acted in ignorance. 


21:52.957 --> 21:57.000
Rather, they repented
and gained Jehovah’s favor. 


21:58.295 --> 22:01.923
So whether you are facing
direct challenges


22:01.923 --> 22:04.010
or indirect ones,


22:04.010 --> 22:07.805
be determined
to bear witness to the truth, 


22:07.805 --> 22:21.798
as Jesus did.

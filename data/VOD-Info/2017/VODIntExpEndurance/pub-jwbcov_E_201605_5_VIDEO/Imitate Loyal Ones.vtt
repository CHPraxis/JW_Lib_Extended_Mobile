00:01.688 --> 00:04.023
My father was a patriotic man, 


00:04.023 --> 00:07.318
and he passed away while in combat 
when I was only a year old.


00:07.318 --> 00:10.363
I decided that I wanted to do 
what he highly valued, 


00:10.363 --> 00:13.000
so I decided to serve in the army.


00:14.243 --> 00:18.413
However, when I began 
seriously studying the Bible, 


00:18.413 --> 00:21.500
I cultivated a desire 
to please only Jehovah, 


00:21.500 --> 00:24.000
which helped me 
to change my decision.


00:26.297 --> 00:28.799
When I read Isaiah 2:4,


00:28.798 --> 00:31.176
I understood 
that the person who wants 


00:31.177 --> 00:34.639
to live a life pleasing to Jehovah 
will not learn combat 


00:34.638 --> 00:37.000
and will not participate in wars.


00:40.102 --> 00:42.772
My stand on neutrality 
was challenged 


00:42.772 --> 00:45.857
when I became an adult 
and was required to serve 


00:45.857 --> 00:48.000
in the army.


00:49.152 --> 00:53.032
But my Bible beliefs did not allow me 
to perform such service.


00:53.032 --> 00:56.244
That was why 
I was arrested and sentenced 


00:56.243 --> 00:59.000
to two and a half years 
of imprisonment.


01:00.538 --> 01:03.750
In prison, 
prayers really helped me. 


01:03.750 --> 01:06.253
I asked Jehovah 
many times to give me 


01:06.253 --> 01:09.340
“the power beyond what is normal 
so that I could endure.”


01:09.340 --> 01:12.802
And in order for me to receive 
the answers to my prayers, 


01:12.802 --> 01:16.000
I regularly did 
personal study and Bible reading.


01:17.138 --> 01:20.976
The visits the elders 
made were very encouraging. 


01:20.977 --> 01:24.605
At those times, 
I felt Jehovah’s warm care.


01:24.605 --> 01:27.148
Jehovah has been my support 


01:27.148 --> 01:29.318
through his organization, his Word, 


01:29.318 --> 01:33.155
the holy spirit, 
and also through his “gifts in men.”


01:33.155 --> 01:35.282
It is true that I suffered 


01:35.282 --> 01:37.367
both physically and emotionally, 


01:37.367 --> 01:53.072
but I never regretted 
the position I took.

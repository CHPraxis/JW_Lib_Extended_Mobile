00:01 My father was a patriotic man,
00:04 and he passed away while in combat  when I was only a year old.
00:07 I decided that I wanted to do  what he highly valued,
00:10 so I decided to serve in the army.
00:14 However, when I began  seriously studying the Bible,
00:18 I cultivated a desire  to please only Jehovah,
00:21 which helped me  to change my decision.
00:26 When I read Isaiah 2:4,
00:28 I understood  that the person who wants
00:31 to live a life pleasing to Jehovah  will not learn combat
00:34 and will not participate in wars.
00:40 My stand on neutrality  was challenged
00:42 when I became an adult  and was required to serve
00:45 in the army.
00:49 But my Bible beliefs did not allow me  to perform such service.
00:53 That was why  I was arrested and sentenced
00:56 to two and a half years  of imprisonment.
01:00 In prison,  prayers really helped me.
01:03 I asked Jehovah  many times to give me
01:06 “the power beyond what is normal  so that I could endure.”
01:09 And in order for me to receive  the answers to my prayers,
01:12 I regularly did  personal study and Bible reading.
01:17 The visits the elders  made were very encouraging.
01:20 At those times,  I felt Jehovah’s warm care.
01:24 Jehovah has been my support
01:27 through his organization, his Word,
01:29 the holy spirit,  and also through his “gifts in men.”
01:33 It is true that I suffered
01:35 both physically and emotionally,
01:37 but I never regretted  the position I took.

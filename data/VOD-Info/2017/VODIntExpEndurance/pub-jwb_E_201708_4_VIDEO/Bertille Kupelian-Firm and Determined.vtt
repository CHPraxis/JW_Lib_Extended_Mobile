00:01.752 --> 00:03.954
Thousands of our sisters have been active 


00:03.953 --> 00:06.000
for many years 
in that “large army” of women. 


00:07.323 --> 00:09.325
Bertille Kupelian, 


00:09.325 --> 00:13.228
a special pioneer in West Virginia, 
in the United States, 


00:13.228 --> 00:17.033
entered the full-time service in 1958. 


00:17.033 --> 00:22.438
In that time, she’s helped 
more than 60 people to baptism. 


00:22.438 --> 00:24.840
How has her outlook toward the ministry 


00:24.840 --> 00:28.000
kept her going for almost 60 years?


00:34.182 --> 00:38.789
My father was opposed  


00:38.788 --> 00:40.956
to the truth as I was growing up, 


00:40.957 --> 00:44.000
but my mother was very, very zealous.


00:45.628 --> 00:49.531
I knew the things my mother 
was teaching me was the truth. 


00:49.532 --> 00:53.069
I knew that this was 
what I was going to do. 


00:53.068 --> 00:58.775
And it was not easy, but we did it.


00:58.775 --> 01:01.410
I was Daddy’s girl, 


01:01.410 --> 01:04.747
but my mom made sure 


01:04.747 --> 01:07.750
that I and my siblings knew the truth. 


01:07.750 --> 01:11.053
And she studied with us 
when no other children 


01:11.053 --> 01:16.058
in the congregation 
had Bible studies at home. 


01:16.058 --> 01:20.061
Of course, we kind of kicked 
and didn’t like it, 


01:20.062 --> 01:23.265
but I was glad she did it.


01:23.265 --> 01:26.937
My mother was a very, very positive person, 


01:26.937 --> 01:30.072
and although she had the opposition, 


01:30.072 --> 01:32.909
I saw how she dealt with it 


01:32.908 --> 01:35.645
and how firm and determined she was. 


01:35.645 --> 01:38.000
And that was something she taught us.


01:39.348 --> 01:41.885
It’s a mind-set. 


01:41.885 --> 01:45.322
You know, 
your mind is a wonderful thing. 


01:45.322 --> 01:50.727
It can really influence you 
toward good or maybe not so good. 


01:50.727 --> 01:54.130
And so then, 
I was determined in my mind 


01:54.130 --> 01:59.435
that I was going to serve Jehovah then.


01:59.435 --> 02:03.773
In our congregation, there were brothers 
and sisters of the anointed. 


02:03.773 --> 02:06.375
They were always very kind to me, 


02:06.375 --> 02:09.878
and they encouraged me. 


02:09.878 --> 02:12.148
I worked in service with them. 


02:12.148 --> 02:16.000
And I thought, 
‘That’s the way I want to be.’


02:17.253 --> 02:20.121
Children like attention. 


02:20.122 --> 02:22.559
And so then, if you give them attention


02:22.558 --> 02:24.560
—you talk with them 


02:24.560 --> 02:27.997
and ask if you could work 
with them in the ministry 


02:27.997 --> 02:30.167
and help them prepare a presentation


02:30.167 --> 02:32.335
and go over it and over it 


02:32.335 --> 02:35.205
so that they’re ready for the ministry


02:35.205 --> 02:38.000
—then they’ll enjoy it more.


02:39.108 --> 02:41.945
That was one of the things 
that the anointed


02:41.945 --> 02:43.947
did in the congregation where I was. 


02:43.947 --> 02:47.000
They paid attention to me, and I loved it.


02:50.320 --> 02:53.690
How I learned to teach 
was I think about the person, 


02:53.690 --> 02:56.525
and I think about their situation, 


02:56.525 --> 03:01.030
and I try to think in my mind 
what they are thinking, 


03:01.030 --> 03:04.433
and I work on that 


03:04.433 --> 03:08.336
and think of what kind of scriptures 
I can find to help them. 


03:08.337 --> 03:09.705
And so then, 


03:09.705 --> 03:14.710
I try to pattern our studies 


03:14.710 --> 03:18.000
to incorporate some of those things.


03:20.683 --> 03:23.385
There are always challenges. 


03:23.385 --> 03:28.000
Some of the winters right on the lake 
where I lived were very harsh. 


03:29.258 --> 03:33.295
And my trailer was parked 
in such a way that every time 


03:33.295 --> 03:36.532
the wind blew 
and the snow came and the ice came, 


03:36.532 --> 03:38.534
it sealed the door. 


03:38.533 --> 03:41.270
And so then, I carried a big knife in my car, 


03:41.270 --> 03:43.707
and I would have to cut around the door 


03:43.707 --> 03:48.210
to get the door to open
—break the ice seal. 


03:48.210 --> 03:51.580
It was interesting.


03:51.580 --> 03:54.317
I had some opposition in the territories, 


03:54.317 --> 03:56.819
and one was this lady who was very irate. 


03:56.818 --> 04:00.323
And she went to kick me, 
and she kicked me right in the stomach, 


04:00.323 --> 04:04.760
and so then, anyway, 
I dismissed myself. 


04:04.760 --> 04:08.230
Then, a while later, 
it was time to work the territory again. 


04:08.230 --> 04:11.367
Nobody wanted to go there, 
and we didn’t have do-not-calls, 


04:11.367 --> 04:15.104
I don’t think, at that time, 
at least there wasn’t any in the territory. 


04:15.103 --> 04:19.041
So then anyway, I called by 
and I mentioned to her:


04:19.042 --> 04:21.044
“Why, hello there. 


04:21.043 --> 04:23.680
I know I’ve had the opportunity 
to talk with you before.” 


04:23.680 --> 04:25.682
Yes, she remembered. 


04:25.682 --> 04:28.000
And I said, “Well, perhaps 
you were having a bad day that day.”


04:31.120 --> 04:34.690
I hit a lull when I had few Bible studies, 


04:34.690 --> 04:38.127
and so I prayed diligently to Jehovah: 


04:38.127 --> 04:40.564
“Jehovah, help me. 
I need Bible studies.” 


04:40.563 --> 04:43.733
And then you have to be 
out there looking for them.


04:43.733 --> 04:47.003
Well, I’ve lost my father, my mother, 


04:47.003 --> 04:50.506
my sister, my brother. 


04:50.507 --> 04:55.312
Well, naturally you feel at a loss, 


04:55.312 --> 04:59.815
but Jehovah strengthened me, 
and the friends strengthened me, 


04:59.815 --> 05:03.052
and I kept busy in the ministry. 


05:03.052 --> 05:05.087
But again, it goes back to that mind-set. 


05:05.087 --> 05:07.490
Are you going to let the challenge beat you, 


05:07.490 --> 05:10.827
or are you going to beat the challenge?


05:10.827 --> 05:13.000
You and Jehovah can beat the challenge.


05:15.230 --> 05:19.435
You know, discouragement 
is one of Satan’s biggest tools. 


05:19.435 --> 05:22.738
And I always tell myself, 


05:22.738 --> 05:25.908
‘I’m not going to let Satan beat me down.’


05:25.908 --> 05:30.078
As far as health is concerned, 
my everyday health is very good. 


05:30.078 --> 05:34.950
But I have a leg that drives me crazy.


05:34.950 --> 05:38.353
I think back to Jacob. 


05:38.353 --> 05:40.756
He served Jehovah with a limp. 


05:40.757 --> 05:44.000
And then I think of Paul. 


05:45.928 --> 05:49.000
And so then, those things keep you humble.


05:51.300 --> 05:53.302
I’ve prayed and prayed and prayed about it, 


05:53.302 --> 05:55.772
but just like with the apostle Paul, 


05:55.772 --> 05:58.174
it didn’t disappear. 


05:58.173 --> 06:01.810
And so then, I just say: 
“Patch me up till Armageddon. 


06:01.810 --> 06:04.813
It’ll disappear then.”


06:04.813 --> 06:08.016
If your mind is made up 
that this is what you’re going to do, 


06:08.017 --> 06:12.020
this is your life, 
this is what Jehovah wants you to do, 


06:12.020 --> 06:16.392
and so then you do it.


06:16.392 --> 06:21.000
I’ve seen how he’s kept me going. 


06:22.332 --> 06:26.169
You know that I’ve needed work; 
I’ve needed money; 


06:26.168 --> 06:28.403
I’ve needed strength. 


06:28.403 --> 06:30.406
I’ve needed companionship 


06:30.407 --> 06:33.142
because a lot of times 
I’m in the ministry by myself. 


06:33.142 --> 06:35.144
I talk to Jehovah. 


06:35.143 --> 06:38.680
And so then, he’s always there for me.


06:38.680 --> 06:42.118
I definitely want to keep pioneering 


06:42.118 --> 06:44.920
or serving Jehovah the best I can, 


06:44.920 --> 06:48.190
regardless of what comes up.


06:48.190 --> 06:51.627
There is nothing more joyful 


06:51.627 --> 06:56.000
than to see that you have helped 
somebody to live forever. 


06:57.700 --> 07:01.000
Well, how much better could it be?


07:06.142 --> 07:10.947
Sister Kupelian had a profound effect
on those she witnessed to. 


07:10.947 --> 07:15.150
I know this because she found me 
in the door-to-door ministry 


07:15.150 --> 07:17.587
when I was 14 years old. 


07:17.587 --> 07:21.790
At that age, I had the goal to be a doctor. 


07:21.790 --> 07:24.593
One night after the meeting, 
Bertille said to me, 


07:24.593 --> 07:27.096
“Well, you know, 
in the new world, 


07:27.097 --> 07:30.967
we won’t need doctors 
because Jesus will do all the healing.” 


07:30.967 --> 07:34.304
Honestly, that hit me hard 


07:34.303 --> 07:38.340
because I wanted to help people 
as well as provide for my mother. 


07:38.340 --> 07:40.342
But she added, 


07:40.342 --> 07:43.245
“What we will need are teachers.” 


07:43.245 --> 07:45.782
I thought that was a good idea. 


07:45.782 --> 07:50.219
Still focused on a career, 
I had one type of teacher in mind, 


07:50.218 --> 07:52.255
but she had another. 


07:52.255 --> 07:54.290
Through her patience and reasoning, 


07:54.290 --> 07:58.660
she helped me to become 
the most important kind of teacher


07:58.660 --> 08:01.997
—a teacher of God’s Word. 


08:01.997 --> 08:06.635
Is there someone like Sister Kupelian 
in your congregation? 


08:06.635 --> 08:10.338
We are grateful 
for these sisters’ zealous spirit 


08:10.338 --> 08:13.308
and for the personal interest 
they show toward us. 


08:13.308 --> 08:22.970
And we’re sure Jehovah 
values them like we do.

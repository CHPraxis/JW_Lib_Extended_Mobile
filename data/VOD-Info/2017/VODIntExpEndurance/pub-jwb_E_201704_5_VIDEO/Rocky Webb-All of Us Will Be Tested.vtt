WEBVTT

00:02.118 --> 00:05.688
When we build strong faith 
in times of peace, 


00:05.688 --> 00:09.891
we can find courage during times 
of testing and persecution. 


00:09.892 --> 00:13.597
Brother Rocky Webb 
from the United States 


00:13.597 --> 00:15.965
learned to be a fighter 
as a young man. 


00:15.965 --> 00:20.103
But as his faith grew, 
he learned that Jehovah is there 


00:20.103 --> 00:23.000
“to help us and to fight our battles.”


00:41.190 --> 00:44.627
All of us are going to be tested 
one way or the other 


00:44.627 --> 00:47.000
before we make it into the new world. 


00:49.098 --> 00:53.235
And if we can endure 
those tests faithfully, 


00:53.235 --> 00:57.000
faithfully, 
then we’ll make it.


00:59.042 --> 01:02.879
My dad and my mother 
taught me the truth. 


01:02.878 --> 01:06.783
What drove me to be baptized 


01:06.783 --> 01:09.285
was the convention in Washington, D.C. 


01:09.285 --> 01:14.623
Brother Rutherford gave the talk 
on “the meek shall inherit the earth.” 


01:14.623 --> 01:18.326
It touched my heart in a way 
that it’s never left 


01:18.327 --> 01:22.065
from that minute on,
right on up to now. 


01:22.065 --> 01:23.933
It gave me faith to stay 


01:23.933 --> 01:26.000
with Jehovah all the way.


01:29.172 --> 01:32.142
The bullies would come 
and jump onto me, 


01:32.142 --> 01:34.844
and I would come home 
pretty well beat up. 


01:34.843 --> 01:39.481
So that’s when I started training for boxing. 


01:39.482 --> 01:44.720
I was offered $40,000 for a fight
—win or lose. 


01:44.720 --> 01:49.000
And if I won the second fight, 
they would double the amount.


01:50.427 --> 01:55.365
Brother Macmillan was like a second 
dad to me and my brother. 


01:55.365 --> 01:58.267
And he asked me, and he said, 
“Would you do me a favor?” 


01:58.267 --> 02:01.170
He said, “Don’t put the gloves on no more.” 


02:01.170 --> 02:05.942
And so I didn’t put them on anymore. 


02:05.942 --> 02:09.345
I think he knew 
that it wouldn’t be very long 


02:09.345 --> 02:11.413
before there’d be an article on it. 


02:11.413 --> 02:16.651
It came out and told 
that boxing wasn’t for Christians. 


02:16.652 --> 02:18.889
I was drafted during this time, 


02:18.888 --> 02:22.558
and I refused to serve 
and was sent to prison.


02:22.558 --> 02:24.660
All the time, 


02:24.660 --> 02:28.063
I never, never, 
ever slowed down 


02:28.063 --> 02:30.666
on my theocratic deals, 


02:30.667 --> 02:32.135
never. 


02:32.135 --> 02:33.737
I kept right on on it. 


02:33.737 --> 02:36.339
The jail warden overheard me 


02:36.338 --> 02:38.808
witnessing to another inmate. 


02:38.808 --> 02:40.210
He told me, 


02:40.210 --> 02:41.978
“Don’t do anymore of that.” 


02:41.978 --> 02:44.213
He said, “We don’t allow it here.” 


02:44.213 --> 02:49.000
Three days had passed by, 
and he’d seen me talking to him again. 


02:50.820 --> 02:54.357
And they put me in a car that was shaded


02:54.357 --> 02:57.000
—you couldn’t see out. 


02:58.227 --> 02:59.895
I didn’t know where I was going. 


02:59.895 --> 03:02.698
It was an old, old prison, 


03:02.698 --> 03:05.000
just dark as could be in there. 


03:06.268 --> 03:09.738
It was three feet (1 m) around. 


03:09.738 --> 03:12.000
And they called it “the Sweat Box.” 


03:14.043 --> 03:17.546
All the time I was in there, 
I’d just sweat, sweat, sweat. 


03:17.547 --> 03:23.820
And I went in 
weighing 213 pounds (97 kg), 


03:23.820 --> 03:27.000
and I came out 
weighing 133 pounds (60 kg).


03:29.725 --> 03:32.328
Psalm 144 says:


03:32.328 --> 03:36.398
“May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised, 


03:36.398 --> 03:39.168
“who trains my hands for battle, 


03:39.168 --> 03:42.838
my fingers for warfare.” 


03:42.838 --> 03:45.775
I gave my life 


03:45.775 --> 03:48.000
to give Jehovah my faith.


03:49.378 --> 03:52.248
I lived in Wewoka. 


03:52.248 --> 03:55.451
Several congregations 
would come together to work. 


03:55.452 --> 03:58.755
We were confronted by mobs. 


03:58.755 --> 04:01.657
There were a lot of them 
that were injured. 


04:01.657 --> 04:06.829
I had 80 stitches up here, 


04:06.828 --> 04:11.100
and I had 13 in the side there, 


04:11.100 --> 04:13.202
on each stab. 


04:13.202 --> 04:17.000
I was really, really beat up. 


04:18.540 --> 04:21.810
But I couldn’t have stood up 
if it hadn’t been for Jehovah. 


04:21.810 --> 04:24.000
I knew he was with me 
some way or another. 


04:26.748 --> 04:31.000
So we sued the town and won $20,000. 


04:32.255 --> 04:36.558
The Society called us and said: 


04:36.558 --> 04:40.930
“You did very good 
in what all you’ve done” 


04:40.930 --> 04:45.668
but said, 
“Remember, we’re not out for money. 


04:45.668 --> 04:50.038
Make sure 
that that’s made known to them.” 


04:50.038 --> 04:52.275
When we walked up to the desk, 


04:52.275 --> 04:55.378
they slid the papers out to us 


04:55.378 --> 04:57.080
and said, “Sign them up.” 


04:57.080 --> 05:00.000
And we just took them and slid them back.


05:01.117 --> 05:03.419
It came out in the papers, 


05:03.418 --> 05:07.523
‘Tell them to come back 
and do all they want to do 


05:07.523 --> 05:10.125
in the way of their witnessing.’ 


05:10.125 --> 05:12.662
It said, ‘We won’t touch them.’ 


05:12.662 --> 05:17.000
They really highly respected us
for what we did, 


05:18.133 --> 05:21.036
and so that opened it up. 


05:21.037 --> 05:26.142
And we had 
a real good congregation there 


05:26.142 --> 05:29.000
that got started and everything.


05:37.687 --> 05:40.590
My first wife was a blessing for me, 


05:40.590 --> 05:43.425
but when she died, 


05:43.425 --> 05:46.328
Jehovah stepped in 
and gave me another good one. 


05:46.328 --> 05:49.000
We mow the lawns together. 


05:50.032 --> 05:54.537
No, no, we do most everything together. 


05:54.537 --> 05:58.407
We study to where 
we can feel it in our hearts. 


05:58.407 --> 06:01.310
When you give your faith to Jehovah, 


06:01.310 --> 06:03.947
you’re giving your life to him. 


06:03.947 --> 06:06.582
He’s permitted these things 
to come upon me; 


06:06.582 --> 06:08.617
I knew that. 


06:08.617 --> 06:11.000
But he protected me.


06:13.588 --> 06:17.593
Brother Webb is now 94 years old. 


06:17.593 --> 06:21.296
But as we saw, 
he and his wife, Charlene, 


06:21.297 --> 06:24.200
keep themselves spiritually active. 


06:24.200 --> 06:28.503
What lessons did you see 
in Rocky’s experience? 


06:28.503 --> 06:32.475
For one, we heard 
that Rocky learned to be a boxer 


06:32.475 --> 06:35.010
to protect himself from bullies; 


06:35.010 --> 06:39.315
yet he responded in faith 
to loving counsel to quit


06:39.315 --> 06:41.350
—even before God’s people 


06:41.350 --> 06:44.787
had a clear understanding 
of violent sports. 


06:44.787 --> 06:46.789
Making that change 


06:46.788 --> 06:49.158
helped Rocky to continue cultivating 


06:49.158 --> 06:51.560
a Christlike personality. 


06:51.560 --> 06:54.397
That prepared him to stand firm 


06:54.397 --> 06:56.699
when imprisoned for his faith, 


06:56.698 --> 07:00.168
and it helped him 
to not return evil for evil 


07:00.168 --> 07:02.805
when persecuted for his ministry. 


07:02.805 --> 07:05.173
He had faith that although Jehovah 


07:05.173 --> 07:07.210
permitted these things to happen, 


07:07.210 --> 07:10.913
He was also there to protect him. 


07:10.913 --> 07:15.316
Examples like those of Rocky 
and the others we’ve considered


07:15.317 --> 07:18.720
warm our hearts and let us know 


07:18.720 --> 07:28.215
we’re never alone 
in our fight for the faith.

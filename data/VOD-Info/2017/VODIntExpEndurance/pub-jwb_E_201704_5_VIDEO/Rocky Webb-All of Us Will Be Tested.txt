00:02 When we build strong faith  in times of peace,
00:05 we can find courage during times  of testing and persecution.
00:09 Brother Rocky Webb  from the United States
00:13 learned to be a fighter  as a young man.
00:15 But as his faith grew,  he learned that Jehovah is there
00:20 “to help us and to fight our battles.”
00:41 All of us are going to be tested  one way or the other
00:44 before we make it into the new world.
00:49 And if we can endure  those tests faithfully,
00:53 faithfully,  then we’ll make it.
00:59 My dad and my mother  taught me the truth.
01:02 What drove me to be baptized
01:06 was the convention in Washington, D.C.
01:09 Brother Rutherford gave the talk  on “the meek shall inherit the earth.”
01:14 It touched my heart in a way  that it’s never left
01:18 from that minute on, right on up to now.
01:22 It gave me faith to stay
01:23 with Jehovah all the way.
01:29 The bullies would come  and jump onto me,
01:32 and I would come home  pretty well beat up.
01:34 So that’s when I started training for boxing.
01:39 I was offered $40,000 for a fight —win or lose.
01:44 And if I won the second fight,  they would double the amount.
01:50 Brother Macmillan was like a second  dad to me and my brother.
01:55 And he asked me, and he said,  “Would you do me a favor?”
01:58 He said, “Don’t put the gloves on no more.”
02:01 And so I didn’t put them on anymore.
02:05 I think he knew  that it wouldn’t be very long
02:09 before there’d be an article on it.
02:11 It came out and told  that boxing wasn’t for Christians.
02:16 I was drafted during this time,
02:18 and I refused to serve  and was sent to prison.
02:22 All the time,
02:24 I never, never,  ever slowed down
02:28 on my theocratic deals,
02:30 never.
02:32 I kept right on on it.
02:33 The jail warden overheard me
02:36 witnessing to another inmate.
02:38 He told me,
02:40 “Don’t do anymore of that.”
02:41 He said, “We don’t allow it here.”
02:44 Three days had passed by,  and he’d seen me talking to him again.
02:50 And they put me in a car that was shaded
02:54 —you couldn’t see out.
02:58 I didn’t know where I was going.
02:59 It was an old, old prison,
03:02 just dark as could be in there.
03:06 It was three feet (1 m) around.
03:09 And they called it “the Sweat Box.”
03:14 All the time I was in there,  I’d just sweat, sweat, sweat.
03:17 And I went in  weighing 213 pounds (97 kg),
03:23 and I came out  weighing 133 pounds (60 kg).
03:29 Psalm 144 says:
03:32 “May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised,
03:36 “who trains my hands for battle,
03:39 my fingers for warfare.”
03:42 I gave my life
03:45 to give Jehovah my faith.
03:49 I lived in Wewoka.
03:52 Several congregations  would come together to work.
03:55 We were confronted by mobs.
03:58 There were a lot of them  that were injured.
04:01 I had 80 stitches up here,
04:06 and I had 13 in the side there,
04:11 on each stab.
04:13 I was really, really beat up.
04:18 But I couldn’t have stood up  if it hadn’t been for Jehovah.
04:21 I knew he was with me  some way or another.
04:26 So we sued the town and won $20,000.
04:32 The Society called us and said:
04:36 “You did very good  in what all you’ve done”
04:40 but said,  “Remember, we’re not out for money.
04:45 Make sure  that that’s made known to them.”
04:50 When we walked up to the desk,
04:52 they slid the papers out to us
04:55 and said, “Sign them up.”
04:57 And we just took them and slid them back.
05:01 It came out in the papers,
05:03 ‘Tell them to come back  and do all they want to do
05:07 in the way of their witnessing.’
05:10 It said, ‘We won’t touch them.’
05:12 They really highly respected us for what we did,
05:18 and so that opened it up.
05:21 And we had  a real good congregation there
05:26 that got started and everything.
05:37 My first wife was a blessing for me,
05:40 but when she died,
05:43 Jehovah stepped in  and gave me another good one.
05:46 We mow the lawns together.
05:50 No, no, we do most everything together.
05:54 We study to where  we can feel it in our hearts.
05:58 When you give your faith to Jehovah,
06:01 you’re giving your life to him.
06:03 He’s permitted these things  to come upon me;
06:06 I knew that.
06:08 But he protected me.
06:13 Brother Webb is now 94 years old.
06:17 But as we saw,  he and his wife, Charlene,
06:21 keep themselves spiritually active.
06:24 What lessons did you see  in Rocky’s experience?
06:28 For one, we heard  that Rocky learned to be a boxer
06:32 to protect himself from bullies;
06:35 yet he responded in faith  to loving counsel to quit
06:39 —even before God’s people
06:41 had a clear understanding  of violent sports.
06:44 Making that change
06:46 helped Rocky to continue cultivating
06:49 a Christlike personality.
06:51 That prepared him to stand firm
06:54 when imprisoned for his faith,
06:56 and it helped him  to not return evil for evil
07:00 when persecuted for his ministry.
07:02 He had faith that although Jehovah
07:05 permitted these things to happen,
07:07 He was also there to protect him.
07:10 Examples like those of Rocky  and the others we’ve considered
07:15 warm our hearts and let us know
07:18 we’re never alone  in our fight for the faith.

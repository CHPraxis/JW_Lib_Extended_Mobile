00:01.550 --> 00:04.353
Jesus’ words 
at Matthew 11:28 


00:04.353 --> 00:06.823
are very appropriate 
considering everything 


00:06.823 --> 00:09.625
we go through 
in this system of things: 


00:09.625 --> 00:14.130
“Come to me, all you who 
are toiling and loaded down, 


00:14.130 --> 00:16.332
and I will refresh you.” 


00:16.332 --> 00:19.969
Yes, conventions 
can be of refreshment to us, 


00:19.968 --> 00:22.405
giving us the boost we need. 


00:22.405 --> 00:25.442
But such refreshment 
is also available 


00:25.442 --> 00:28.779
when the world around us 
seems to be falling apart. 


00:28.778 --> 00:32.415
How does the organization 
help our brothers and sisters  


00:32.415 --> 00:34.850
in times of national crisis? 


00:34.850 --> 00:39.322
We met two Witness couples
who personally experienced 


00:39.322 --> 00:43.000
two of the largest terrorist attacks 
in recent years.


00:49.598 --> 00:52.201
Not a day goes by 
when we don’t think 


00:52.202 --> 00:55.000
about our son, Paulie.


01:03.413 --> 01:06.215
There was horror and suffering, 


01:06.215 --> 01:09.000
things we don’t want to witness anymore.


01:19.495 --> 01:25.000
September 11 
was a very scary, terrifying day.


01:26.402 --> 01:28.705
As for me, 


01:28.705 --> 01:31.875
when I really understood 
what was happening, I got scared. 


01:31.875 --> 01:33.443
I didn’t know what to do. 


01:33.443 --> 01:35.378
I didn’t know what to think. 


01:35.378 --> 01:38.815
I felt helpless.


01:38.815 --> 01:41.717
When the second tower fell, 


01:41.717 --> 01:44.687
Paulie was on the 110th floor 


01:44.687 --> 01:47.957
and everybody was shouting, crying. 


01:47.957 --> 01:50.460
I was praying to Jehovah 


01:50.460 --> 01:53.000
because I was heartbroken.


01:57.433 --> 02:01.003
We live on Voltaire Boulevard; 
 it’s a broad avenue. 


02:01.003 --> 02:04.006
There is a concert hall called the Bataclan. 


02:04.007 --> 02:06.642
When the doors of the Bataclan are open, 


02:06.642 --> 02:10.000
we can hear everything that goes on inside.


02:13.148 --> 02:16.351
That night, three men 
entered the Bataclan concert hall, 


02:16.352 --> 02:20.224
and they started shooting into the crowd. 


02:20.223 --> 02:22.325
We immediately grabbed our “go bag.” 


02:22.325 --> 02:25.127
And then we sat in front of the sofa, 


02:25.127 --> 02:27.797
and we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit 


02:27.797 --> 02:30.000
so we could face the situation.


02:39.542 --> 02:43.212
It was around 10:00 p.m. 
when there was a news flash 


02:43.212 --> 02:46.082
that announced that there was an attack. 


02:46.082 --> 02:49.519
I was in shock when I heard the news, 


02:49.518 --> 02:53.000
and then I immediately thought 
about our brothers and sisters. 


02:55.392 --> 02:59.062
I quickly got in contact 
with the circuit overseer 


02:59.062 --> 03:02.665
in order to get some news 
about our brothers and sisters, 


03:02.665 --> 03:05.033
to know how they were doing. 


03:05.033 --> 03:06.870
Then, 


03:06.870 --> 03:08.605
very early the next morning, 


03:08.605 --> 03:12.042
we set up an emergency committee 
made up of several brothers 


03:12.042 --> 03:14.044
from the Service Department. 


03:14.043 --> 03:17.713
We decided to write a letter 
and make other arrangements 


03:17.713 --> 03:20.616
to assist the friends who, 
in one way or another, 


03:20.617 --> 03:23.920
were affected by this event. 


03:23.920 --> 03:25.087
In turn, 


03:25.087 --> 03:27.557
the circuit overseer 
would make an effort 


03:27.557 --> 03:30.660
to rapidly get in touch 
with the elders 


03:30.660 --> 03:33.000
who oversee 
the affected territory.


03:37.100 --> 03:40.135
One of our challenges, on a personal level, 


03:40.135 --> 03:42.205
was whether we would even be able 


03:42.205 --> 03:44.273
to encourage our brothers and sisters 


03:44.273 --> 03:47.810
because we had never experienced 
such a terrible event. 


03:47.810 --> 03:49.878
We organized ourselves; 


03:49.878 --> 03:52.000
we paired up as elders 
and headed off to do shepherding.


03:53.917 --> 03:57.654
We started calling midmorning 
on Tuesday. 


03:57.653 --> 03:59.388
We received a report back 


03:59.388 --> 04:01.223
from all the traveling overseers 


04:01.223 --> 04:02.458
by the end of Thursday. 


04:02.458 --> 04:04.660
And unfortunately, 


04:04.660 --> 04:07.497
we learned that 14 
of our brothers and sisters 


04:07.497 --> 04:10.000
had lost their lives. 


04:11.033 --> 04:16.138
We knew that we needed 
to encourage the families; 


04:16.138 --> 04:20.310
we knew that we needed 
to shepherd them as soon as possible.


04:20.310 --> 04:24.113
The elders immediately came. 


04:24.113 --> 04:26.448
We went over the book of Job, 


04:26.448 --> 04:28.951
and I just listened. 


04:28.952 --> 04:30.887
You know, I was just listening. 


04:30.887 --> 04:33.790
I’ve heard the same words before, 
but it was different now. 


04:33.790 --> 04:37.000
The things that were being said 
went straight to my heart.


04:39.595 --> 04:43.098
A few days later, we were visited 
by two brothers from Bethel. 


04:43.098 --> 04:46.335
It was very touching 
that they came to see us 


04:46.335 --> 04:48.638
and that they 
were concerned about us. 


04:48.638 --> 04:53.508
It shows us that Jehovah 
was aware of how we felt that night.


04:53.508 --> 04:55.945
Our brothers were there. 


04:55.945 --> 04:58.447
They were ready 
to help one another out. 


04:58.447 --> 05:02.419
Then there was 
so much empathy and love shown.


05:02.418 --> 05:04.253
When we were ultimately granted 


05:04.253 --> 05:06.088
access to ground zero 


05:06.088 --> 05:08.825
and we started encountering 


05:08.825 --> 05:10.760
the first responders, 


05:10.760 --> 05:13.997
we let them know how much 
we appreciated their hard work 


05:13.997 --> 05:15.999
and that they had a skill set 


05:15.998 --> 05:17.900
that we didn’t have. 


05:17.900 --> 05:19.268
But yet our skill set 


05:19.268 --> 05:22.005
was trying 
to offer comfort to them. 


05:22.005 --> 05:24.607
We shared a scripture with them. 


05:24.607 --> 05:27.444
Immediately, we could tell 
that that was something 


05:27.443 --> 05:30.913
that caused emotion 
to rise up in them right away. 


05:30.913 --> 05:33.315
And they expressed 


05:33.315 --> 05:34.717
great appreciation for that. 


05:34.717 --> 05:37.954
It’s one of the beautiful things 
about the Scriptures


05:37.953 --> 05:41.990
—that they’re calming, 
soothing, comforting. 


05:41.990 --> 05:44.860
And the Scriptures 
did not let down the workers 


05:44.860 --> 05:47.000
that were there at ground zero either.


05:49.132 --> 05:52.135
The visit of the brothers 
from Bethel was really 


05:52.135 --> 05:54.170
a gift from Jehovah. 


05:54.170 --> 05:56.872
It showed his genuine interest in us. 


05:56.872 --> 05:59.000
It was really wonderful.


06:00.977 --> 06:02.945
After the brothers visited us, 


06:02.945 --> 06:05.047
we felt so comforted, 


06:05.047 --> 06:06.782
so encouraged, 


06:06.782 --> 06:08.584
that we said to each other: 


06:08.583 --> 06:11.986
“We have to get back in the ministry 


06:11.987 --> 06:13.990
“and comfort people in the territory. 


06:13.990 --> 06:17.000
We have to console 
our brothers and sisters as well.” 


06:18.627 --> 06:21.097
We can only thank and glorify Jehovah, 


06:21.097 --> 06:23.000
who really is a God of love.


06:28.938 --> 06:31.106
I kind of felt 


06:31.107 --> 06:33.609
Jehovah’s hand just reaching out to me, 


06:33.608 --> 06:36.978
which I needed. 


06:36.978 --> 06:40.000
But I cannot wait till the day 
that I’m totally refreshed. 


06:41.183 --> 06:44.153
Where I can see, 
 I can actually see, 


06:44.153 --> 06:45.955
Paulie. 


06:45.955 --> 06:48.557
I can see him just coming back 


06:48.557 --> 06:50.594
into our lives, 


06:50.593 --> 06:53.000
and I want to embrace him so much.


06:56.365 --> 07:00.000
After something like this, 
we are not the same. 


07:01.070 --> 07:03.000
But 


07:04.207 --> 07:07.244
with the help of the organization


07:07.243 --> 07:08.945
—the brothers—


07:08.945 --> 07:11.147
Jehovah is there for us. 


07:11.147 --> 07:12.915
So that— 


07:12.915 --> 07:15.000
That is refreshing.


07:16.252 --> 07:18.254
And I thank Jehovah a lot 


07:18.253 --> 07:21.523
for what he wants to do for me 


07:21.523 --> 07:25.561
and also for the millions of people 


07:25.562 --> 07:40.760
that feel the same way.

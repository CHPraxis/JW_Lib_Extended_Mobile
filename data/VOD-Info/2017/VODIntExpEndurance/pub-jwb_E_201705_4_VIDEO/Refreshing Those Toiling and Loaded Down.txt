00:01 Jesus’ words  at Matthew 11:28
00:04 are very appropriate  considering everything
00:06 we go through  in this system of things:
00:09 “Come to me, all you who  are toiling and loaded down,
00:14 and I will refresh you.”
00:16 Yes, conventions  can be of refreshment to us,
00:19 giving us the boost we need.
00:22 But such refreshment  is also available
00:25 when the world around us  seems to be falling apart.
00:28 How does the organization  help our brothers and sisters
00:32 in times of national crisis?
00:34 We met two Witness couples who personally experienced
00:39 two of the largest terrorist attacks  in recent years.
00:49 Not a day goes by  when we don’t think
00:52 about our son, Paulie.
01:03 There was horror and suffering,
01:06 things we don’t want to witness anymore.
01:19 September 11  was a very scary, terrifying day.
01:26 As for me,
01:28 when I really understood  what was happening, I got scared.
01:31 I didn’t know what to do.
01:33 I didn’t know what to think.
01:35 I felt helpless.
01:38 When the second tower fell,
01:41 Paulie was on the 110th floor
01:44 and everybody was shouting, crying.
01:47 I was praying to Jehovah
01:50 because I was heartbroken.
01:57 We live on Voltaire Boulevard;   it’s a broad avenue.
02:01 There is a concert hall called the Bataclan.
02:04 When the doors of the Bataclan are open,
02:06 we can hear everything that goes on inside.
02:13 That night, three men  entered the Bataclan concert hall,
02:16 and they started shooting into the crowd.
02:20 We immediately grabbed our “go bag.”
02:22 And then we sat in front of the sofa,
02:25 and we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit
02:27 so we could face the situation.
02:39 It was around 10:00 p.m.  when there was a news flash
02:43 that announced that there was an attack.
02:46 I was in shock when I heard the news,
02:49 and then I immediately thought  about our brothers and sisters.
02:55 I quickly got in contact  with the circuit overseer
02:59 in order to get some news  about our brothers and sisters,
03:02 to know how they were doing.
03:05 Then,
03:06 very early the next morning,
03:08 we set up an emergency committee  made up of several brothers
03:12 from the Service Department.
03:14 We decided to write a letter  and make other arrangements
03:17 to assist the friends who,  in one way or another,
03:20 were affected by this event.
03:23 In turn,
03:25 the circuit overseer  would make an effort
03:27 to rapidly get in touch  with the elders
03:30 who oversee  the affected territory.
03:37 One of our challenges, on a personal level,
03:40 was whether we would even be able
03:42 to encourage our brothers and sisters
03:44 because we had never experienced  such a terrible event.
03:47 We organized ourselves;
03:49 we paired up as elders  and headed off to do shepherding.
03:53 We started calling midmorning  on Tuesday.
03:57 We received a report back
03:59 from all the traveling overseers
04:01 by the end of Thursday.
04:02 And unfortunately,
04:04 we learned that 14  of our brothers and sisters
04:07 had lost their lives.
04:11 We knew that we needed  to encourage the families;
04:16 we knew that we needed  to shepherd them as soon as possible.
04:20 The elders immediately came.
04:24 We went over the book of Job,
04:26 and I just listened.
04:28 You know, I was just listening.
04:30 I’ve heard the same words before,  but it was different now.
04:33 The things that were being said  went straight to my heart.
04:39 A few days later, we were visited  by two brothers from Bethel.
04:43 It was very touching  that they came to see us
04:46 and that they  were concerned about us.
04:48 It shows us that Jehovah  was aware of how we felt that night.
04:53 Our brothers were there.
04:55 They were ready  to help one another out.
04:58 Then there was  so much empathy and love shown.
05:02 When we were ultimately granted
05:04 access to ground zero
05:06 and we started encountering
05:08 the first responders,
05:10 we let them know how much  we appreciated their hard work
05:13 and that they had a skill set
05:15 that we didn’t have.
05:17 But yet our skill set
05:19 was trying  to offer comfort to them.
05:22 We shared a scripture with them.
05:24 Immediately, we could tell  that that was something
05:27 that caused emotion  to rise up in them right away.
05:30 And they expressed
05:33 great appreciation for that.
05:34 It’s one of the beautiful things  about the Scriptures
05:37 —that they’re calming,  soothing, comforting.
05:41 And the Scriptures  did not let down the workers
05:44 that were there at ground zero either.
05:49 The visit of the brothers  from Bethel was really
05:52 a gift from Jehovah.
05:54 It showed his genuine interest in us.
05:56 It was really wonderful.
06:00 After the brothers visited us,
06:02 we felt so comforted,
06:05 so encouraged,
06:06 that we said to each other:
06:08 “We have to get back in the ministry
06:11 “and comfort people in the territory.
06:13 We have to console  our brothers and sisters as well.”
06:18 We can only thank and glorify Jehovah,
06:21 who really is a God of love.
06:28 I kind of felt
06:31 Jehovah’s hand just reaching out to me,
06:33 which I needed.
06:36 But I cannot wait till the day  that I’m totally refreshed.
06:41 Where I can see,   I can actually see,
06:44 Paulie.
06:45 I can see him just coming back
06:48 into our lives,
06:50 and I want to embrace him so much.
06:56 After something like this,  we are not the same.
07:01 But
07:04 with the help of the organization
07:07 —the brothers—
07:08 Jehovah is there for us.
07:11 So that—
07:12 That is refreshing.
07:16 And I thank Jehovah a lot
07:18 for what he wants to do for me
07:21 and also for the millions of people
07:25 that feel the same way.

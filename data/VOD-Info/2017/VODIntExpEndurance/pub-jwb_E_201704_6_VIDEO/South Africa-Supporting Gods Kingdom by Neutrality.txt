00:01 Jehovah gives us his holy spirit,
00:04 both individually and as a group.
00:07 To see evidence of that,  we need only go to a part of the world
00:12 where Jehovah’s people  were put under intense pressure.
00:16 In South Africa, for example,
00:18 the government’s policy  of racial segregation, called apartheid,
00:23 lasted for 46 years, until 1994.
00:27 Our brothers were pressured  to take sides in armed conflict.
00:32 Their freedom to worship together  was limited.
00:35 And the prevailing attitudes   towards people of different races
00:39 threatened their unity.
00:41 In this report, we learn  how our South African brothers
00:45 remained united and neutral  and in support of God’s Kingdom.
00:59 One afternoon  when we came to the station,
01:03 there were men who were directing things and we were directed
01:07 to a coach for whites only.
01:09 That was the first time
01:11 that we saw apartheid being law enforced.
01:18 You could not leave the black areas
01:21 where your home was  without getting a permit.
01:25 We were even given a permit that stipulated  which area we were allowed
01:29 to do the preaching work in.
01:34 People would always ask us:
01:36 “What are you doing to fight apartheid?”
01:39 We had to boldly tell them:
01:41 “God’s Kingdom is the only solution.
01:43 “God will help the whole earth  to live in peace one day,
01:47 so we cannot take sides  on political issues now.”
01:53 Here at home in Soweto,  we heard the sound
01:55 of children running in the streets.
01:59 We heard the sound of gunshots;
02:02 tear gas was everywhere.
02:05 When my husband came home that day,
02:08 we sat with the children  and took out the book
02:11 Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It
02:13 and we studied the topic  “How Do You View Your Parents?”
02:18 This was appropriate
02:20 because children had the spirit of rebelling
02:22 against their own parents.
02:26 They went as far as burning people.
02:31 They came shouting my son’s name:
02:34 “Aquila, Mathiba, come out, come out!”
02:39 And one of them defended him and said:
02:41 “No, no, no, not Aquila!
02:45 “Aquila does not do these things.
02:48 He will never protest.”
02:52 Ahh, I saw Jehovah’s hand in this.
02:58 Even under those circumstances,
03:00 Jehovah helped our children
03:02 not to dwell on the madness  in the streets,
03:05 and we focused on spiritual things.
03:09 In 1968, when I was 19 years old,
03:13 I was sentenced to jail
03:15 for refusing to do military service.
03:17 Over a period of 20 years,
03:20 close to 1,000 young white Witness men
03:23 similarly took their stand  for neutrality in this country.
03:26 We used to pray  for our white brothers in prison.
03:30 People in the black townships respected us
03:34 for the stand these brothers were taking.
03:42 In 1974,
03:44 over 30,000 black and white brothers met
03:48 for the afternoon session  of the “Divine Victory” Assembly.
03:54 When we first arrived,
03:56 there were policemen everywhere.
04:01 But after half an hour,
04:03 they saw how peaceful it was
04:06 and so they left.
04:10 For those few hours
04:12 in the dark era of apartheid,
04:15 we felt
04:17 the glorious brotherly love  as we praised Jehovah
04:22 together.
04:31 Brother Moses Nyamussua was asked
04:34 by a group on their way to a political rally
04:37 to weld weapons for them.
04:39 He refused to do so.
04:42 After their rally,  they went back to him and said:
04:45 “You refused to weld our weapons,
04:48 “and some of our comrades  were killed in a fight at the rally.
04:52 Now you will die.”
04:55 Brother Nyamussua maintained his neutrality
04:58 all the way to death,
05:01 and Jehovah will remember him.
05:07 In 1993, I was amazed
05:10 when a white person  came preaching house to house.
05:12 They came with another white man
05:14 who could speak Venda fluently.
05:17 That excited me a lot,  and as time went by,
05:20 I came to realize
05:22 that this is the true religion  because they were faithful friends
05:25 and they spoke to me like we were family.
05:29 In the late 1980’s,  the government granted us permission
05:32 to come in and build Kingdom Halls
05:35 in the black townships.
05:37 The local community  was absolutely amazed
05:39 to see all these whites
05:41 pouring in and working hard
05:43 along with their black brothers
05:45 to build these beautiful Kingdom Halls.
05:47 It was a wonderful privilege  to get to know other young people
05:50 of different races.
05:52 Everyone in the congregation feels  like family
05:55 as long as they serve Jehovah.
05:57 Just see yourself.
06:00 Just see me too.
06:03 Just see us all. . .
06:05 . . . in a world that is new.
06:10 Today, in South Africa,
06:12 there are more than 100,000 Witnesses
06:15 worshipping together in spirit and truth.
06:19 South Africa has 11 official languages.
06:22 Yet, across that cultural variety,
06:25 our brothers and sisters  are all speaking the “pure language”
06:29 —the truth about Jehovah God  and his purposes.

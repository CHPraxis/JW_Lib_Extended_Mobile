00:03.937 --> 00:05.479
When you were younger,

00:05.479 --> 00:07.312
your parents were probably the first ones

00:07.312 --> 00:09.645
you ran to for advice.

00:13.020 --> 00:15.062
But now you might feel 
that your parents

00:15.062 --> 00:17.062
just don’t understand you.

00:18.979 --> 00:22.020
Deep down, 
you still want to talk to them.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.395
But what if you try,

00:24.395 --> 00:27.020
and you feel 
they just aren’t listening?

00:27.020 --> 00:29.812
Well, you could raise your voice,

00:29.812 --> 00:31.479
but shouting won’t make

00:31.479 --> 00:33.479
your parents more receptive

00:33.479 --> 00:35.979
and won’t show them 
the respect they deserve.

00:35.979 --> 00:37.812
You could give your parents

00:37.812 --> 00:39.145
the silent treatment,

00:39.145 --> 00:42.604
but the Bible suggests 
at Proverbs 15:22

00:42.604 --> 00:44.604
that things only get more frustrating

00:44.604 --> 00:46.604
when you don’t talk.

00:46.604 --> 00:48.187
So saying nothing

00:48.187 --> 00:49.770
really gets you nowhere.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.895
It’s smarter to just wait

00:51.895 --> 00:54.020
for a better time to talk.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.020
Or you might even write them

00:56.020 --> 00:58.145
an honest but respectful letter

00:58.145 --> 01:00.479
expressing how you feel.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.437
But what if the situation is flipped?

01:03.437 --> 01:05.187
Yeah, that’s right.

01:05.187 --> 01:06.812
Your parents want to talk,

01:06.812 --> 01:08.270
but you don’t.

01:08.270 --> 01:11.937
Maybe you had a bad day at school.

01:11.937 --> 01:13.979
It’s true that choosing to talk

01:13.979 --> 01:15.770
when you don’t feel like it could mean

01:15.770 --> 01:17.812
the conversation will be forced,

01:17.812 --> 01:19.645
which makes everyone tense

01:19.645 --> 01:22.562
and leads to poor communication.

01:22.562 --> 01:24.729
But refusing to talk

01:24.729 --> 01:26.729
means you’ll still be stressed,

01:26.729 --> 01:28.437
and your parents might think

01:28.437 --> 01:30.937
that the problem is bigger than it is,

01:30.937 --> 01:33.604
or worse, 
that you’re hiding something.

01:33.604 --> 01:35.979
Instead, you could start off 
talking with them

01:35.979 --> 01:38.437
on a subject that isn’t as stressful

01:38.437 --> 01:40.937
or even one that makes you happy.

01:40.937 --> 01:43.479
That will ease the tension

01:43.479 --> 01:45.937
or get rid of it all together.

01:46.479 --> 01:48.437
The bottom line:

01:48.437 --> 01:50.562
Your parents want to help you

01:50.562 --> 01:53.354
and you can use their help.

01:53.854 --> 01:56.229
So choose your words carefully,

01:56.229 --> 01:58.229
deliver them respectfully,

01:58.229 --> 02:00.229
and think of your parents as friends,

02:00.229 --> 02:02.437
not enemies.

02:03.562 --> 02:05.104
Because let’s face it,

02:05.104 --> 02:07.729
you’ll need all the allies 
you can get to cope

02:07.729 --> 02:19.210
with the challenges that lie ahead.

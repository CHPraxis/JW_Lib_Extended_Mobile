00:07.728 --> 00:09.311
Many people equate drinking


00:09.312 --> 00:11.562
with having a good time.


00:11.562 --> 00:13.562
But at Proverbs 23:32,


00:13.562 --> 00:15.562
the Bible says that alcohol


00:15.562 --> 00:18.270
can ‘bite like a snake.’


00:18.270 --> 00:21.728
Are there laws
on drinking alcohol where you live?


00:21.728 --> 00:25.270
If so, you could be fined,


00:25.270 --> 00:28.145
be sentenced to community service,


00:28.145 --> 00:30.645
lose your freedom to drive,


00:30.645 --> 00:32.978
or even go to jail.


00:32.978 --> 00:35.103
Even if none of those things happen,


00:35.103 --> 00:37.311
alcohol can lower your inhibitions


00:37.312 --> 00:39.895
—and not in a good way.


00:39.895 --> 00:42.895
Under the influence,
you could say or do things


00:42.895 --> 00:44.895
you’ll later regret.


00:44.895 --> 00:46.562
But what if you’re at a party


00:46.562 --> 00:48.562
and unexpectedly find


00:48.562 --> 00:51.354
that some are drinking
and heading for trouble?


00:51.353 --> 00:53.353
What would you do?


00:53.353 --> 00:55.936
The Bible says that an intelligent person


00:55.937 --> 00:58.354
sees trouble coming and avoids it.


00:58.353 --> 01:00.353
Stop and think.


01:00.353 --> 01:03.186
What might happen if you stay?


01:03.187 --> 01:05.520
How could you leave before trouble comes


01:05.520 --> 01:08.270
without inviting ridicule?


01:08.270 --> 01:09.687
Here’s a tip:


01:09.687 --> 01:11.687
Make a plan with your parents


01:11.687 --> 01:15.645
to call or text if you need to leave early.


01:15.645 --> 01:17.645
How about this?


01:17.645 --> 01:21.353
What would you do
if someone pressures you to drink?


01:21.353 --> 01:23.978
At Romans 6:16, the Bible indicates


01:23.978 --> 01:26.770
that when you let others 
control your decisions, 


01:26.770 --> 01:29.645
you become their slave.


01:29.645 --> 01:31.812
You could just follow along


01:31.812 --> 01:34.145
and let your peers rule your life.


01:34.145 --> 01:36.770
Or you could give a firm response


01:36.770 --> 01:38.395
—perhaps something like,


01:38.395 --> 01:42.103
“No thanks!” or “Sorry, I’m not into that!”


01:42.103 --> 01:44.186
What if you’re out with friends


01:44.187 --> 01:46.937
and realize the driver has been drinking?


01:46.937 --> 01:48.937
According to the Bible,


01:48.937 --> 01:52.354
the person who spends time with fools
“will fare badly.”


01:52.353 --> 01:57.000
What could happen
if you let that person drive you home?


01:59.687 --> 02:01.812
What other options do you have?


02:01.812 --> 02:03.354
Try this:


02:03.353 --> 02:05.436
Avoid situations
where you’ll be with a driver


02:05.437 --> 02:08.687
who has a reputation
for drinking and driving.


02:08.687 --> 02:12.395
Always have a Plan B for transportation.


02:12.395 --> 02:15.937
Remember, you don’t have to drink
to have a good time,


02:15.937 --> 02:17.937
and you don’t have to associate with people


02:17.937 --> 02:20.520
who think that you do.


02:20.520 --> 02:31.625
Have the courage to think past the drink.

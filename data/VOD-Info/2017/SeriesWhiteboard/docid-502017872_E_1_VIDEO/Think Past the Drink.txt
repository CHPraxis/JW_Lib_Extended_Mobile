00:07 Many people equate drinking
00:09 with having a good time.
00:11 But at Proverbs 23:32,
00:13 the Bible says that alcohol
00:15 can ‘bite like a snake.’
00:18 Are there laws on drinking alcohol where you live?
00:21 If so, you could be fined,
00:25 be sentenced to community service,
00:28 lose your freedom to drive,
00:30 or even go to jail.
00:32 Even if none of those things happen,
00:35 alcohol can lower your inhibitions
00:37 —and not in a good way.
00:39 Under the influence, you could say or do things
00:42 you’ll later regret.
00:44 But what if you’re at a party
00:46 and unexpectedly find
00:48 that some are drinking and heading for trouble?
00:51 What would you do?
00:53 The Bible says that an intelligent person
00:55 sees trouble coming and avoids it.
00:58 Stop and think.
01:00 What might happen if you stay?
01:03 How could you leave before trouble comes
01:05 without inviting ridicule?
01:08 Here’s a tip:
01:09 Make a plan with your parents
01:11 to call or text if you need to leave early.
01:15 How about this?
01:17 What would you do if someone pressures you to drink?
01:21 At Romans 6:16, the Bible indicates
01:23 that when you let others  control your decisions,
01:26 you become their slave.
01:29 You could just follow along
01:31 and let your peers rule your life.
01:34 Or you could give a firm response
01:36 —perhaps something like,
01:38 “No thanks!” or “Sorry, I’m not into that!”
01:42 What if you’re out with friends
01:44 and realize the driver has been drinking?
01:46 According to the Bible,
01:48 the person who spends time with fools “will fare badly.”
01:52 What could happen if you let that person drive you home?
01:59 What other options do you have?
02:01 Try this:
02:03 Avoid situations where you’ll be with a driver
02:05 who has a reputation for drinking and driving.
02:08 Always have a Plan B for transportation.
02:12 Remember, you don’t have to drink to have a good time,
02:15 and you don’t have to associate with people
02:17 who think that you do.
02:20 Have the courage to think past the drink.

00:08 I was the ringleader of a criminal gang.
00:13 We extorted money, put people out of business,
00:16 threatened them,  dragged them away.
00:25 And they would hand over everything.
00:28 People were afraid of me,  and I liked it that way.
00:33 I never forgave anybody.
00:35 If someone wronged me,
00:37 I would say:  “Throw one stone at me!
00:41 I’ll bury you in a mountain of rocks!”
00:47 In 1993,  I was working for the police.
00:50 They assigned me to gather information
00:52 about a gang  whose leader was Vladimir Olkhov.
00:58 One time, when committing a crime,  they caught me at the scene.
01:10 I swore revenge on everybody involved  with my arrest.
01:16 During interrogations, I did everything
01:18 to humiliate Vladimir  and tried to break him.
01:28 We just hated each other!
01:31 I told Valery, “Just remember:
01:34 “Sooner or later  I’m getting out of prison
01:37 and then you’re a dead man!”
01:39 I thought to myself: ‘For a start,
01:42 ‘I’m going to blow up his car.
01:44 If he doesn’t understand,  then I’ll just eliminate him.’
01:50 His threats sounded so serious  that I started to fear for my life.
01:54 I decided to have my friends  and acquaintances
01:57 make his life behind bars unbearable
02:00 and to make sure  that he would never get out.
02:08 I saw that one of my cell mates  had a pocket New Testament.
02:11 I asked him if I could read it.
02:13 Seeing my interest in spiritual things,
02:16 someone gave me a Watchtower magazine.
02:20 When I started reading the magazine,
02:22 I realized that there are  other people out there—real people.
02:25 There’s a totally different way  of life to be had, even now,
02:28 and with such prospects.
02:31 I was just stunned.
02:33 Then I found another five magazines  around the prison.
02:37 I devoured them as well.
02:39 And I became thoroughly convinced  that I had found the truth.
02:44 When my wife was first allowed to visit me,
02:47 I told her right away, “I’ve found the truth!”
02:52 My wife made pretty fast progress and was baptized two years later.
02:57 Her support was invaluable.
02:59 She would visit me,  constantly encouraging me
03:02 to be faithful  and remain loyal to God.
03:07 In 1993,  Jehovah’s Witnesses visited me.
03:11 I agreed to a Bible study,  but the truth didn’t touch my heart.
03:17 One time, Jehovah’s Witnesses  invited me to a gathering,
03:20 and there they told me that Vladimir Olkhov
03:23 —that criminal—
03:25 was about to get baptized  and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
03:28 I was cut to the heart!
03:32 When I got home,  I burst into tears.
03:37 Because if he,  in his circumstances,
03:40 could do it, then I could do it.
03:42 That very moment, I prayed for the first time in my life.
03:47 I was released in October of 1997.
03:51 After I was released,  the brothers organized a gathering.
03:54 They invited me to this gathering.
03:58 I remember  that as I was approaching the place,
04:01 I suddenly realized this is where  I once conducted a search!
04:05 And then Valery walked into the room.
04:09 We just hugged each other and burst into tears.
04:16 And I saw in his eyes  a completely different look,
04:18 not like before —it was a kind look.
04:21 It brought tears to my eyes.
04:24 It was like a big weight  was lifted from my chest.
04:26 ‘My brother!’
04:28 We begged one another for forgiveness.
04:33 On the 23rd of November 1997,
04:36 I was baptized together in the same pool
04:40 as my new friend Valery.
04:46 We really became the best of friends.
04:49 And now we serve as elders  in the same congregation.
04:52 My wife and I often talk about
04:54 what would have happened to us
04:56 if we had not started to study the Bible.
04:59 Probably we wouldn’t even be alive now.
05:02 We’ve kept our family together.
05:04 Even better,  we now have a spiritual family
05:07 in the Christian congregation.
05:09 And my former enemy  is now my brother and best friend.
05:13 More importantly, we’ve developed
05:15 a close relationship with Jehovah.
05:19 Only God is able to change the thinking
05:21 of such bitter enemies as Vlad and I were.
05:26 And I eagerly look forward to the day
05:28 when everything that divides people
05:30 will be gone forever.

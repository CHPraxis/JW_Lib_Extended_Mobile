00:08.695 --> 00:11.000
I was the ringleader of a criminal gang. 


00:13.408 --> 00:16.536
We extorted money,
put people out of business, 


00:16.537 --> 00:19.000
threatened them, 
dragged them away.


00:25.587 --> 00:28.049
And they would hand over everything. 


00:28.048 --> 00:32.000
People were afraid of me, 
and I liked it that way. 


00:33.678 --> 00:35.763
I never forgave anybody. 


00:35.763 --> 00:37.808
If someone wronged me, 


00:37.808 --> 00:41.228
I would say: 
“Throw one stone at me! 


00:41.228 --> 00:45.000
I’ll bury you in a mountain of rocks!”


00:47.525 --> 00:50.487
In 1993, 
I was working for the police. 


00:50.487 --> 00:52.405
They assigned me to gather information 


00:52.405 --> 00:56.000
about a gang 
whose leader was Vladimir Olkhov.


00:58.995 --> 01:02.000
One time, when committing a crime, 
they caught me at the scene.


01:10.132 --> 01:14.000
I swore revenge on everybody involved 
with my arrest.


01:16.847 --> 01:18.890
During interrogations,
I did everything 


01:18.890 --> 01:21.000
to humiliate Vladimir 
and tried to break him.


01:28.275 --> 01:30.000
We just hated each other!


01:31.612 --> 01:34.197
I told Valery,
“Just remember: 


01:34.197 --> 01:37.367
“Sooner or later 
I’m getting out of prison 


01:37.367 --> 01:39.912
and then you’re a dead man!” 


01:39.912 --> 01:42.497
I thought to myself:
‘For a start, 


01:42.497 --> 01:44.500
‘I’m going to blow up his car. 


01:44.500 --> 01:48.000
If he doesn’t understand, 
then I’ll just eliminate him.’


01:50.838 --> 01:54.551
His threats sounded so serious 
that I started to fear for my life. 


01:54.552 --> 01:57.345
I decided to have my friends 
and acquaintances 


01:57.345 --> 02:00.140
make his life behind bars unbearable 


02:00.140 --> 02:04.000
and to make sure 
that he would never get out.


02:08.315 --> 02:11.443
I saw that one of my cell mates 
had a pocket New Testament. 


02:11.443 --> 02:13.486
I asked him if I could read it. 


02:13.487 --> 02:16.782
Seeing my interest in spiritual things, 


02:16.782 --> 02:19.000
someone gave me a Watchtower magazine. 


02:20.493 --> 02:22.495
When I started reading the magazine, 


02:22.495 --> 02:25.790
I realized that there are 
other people out there—real people. 


02:25.790 --> 02:28.960
There’s a totally different way 
of life to be had, even now, 


02:28.960 --> 02:31.380
and with such prospects. 


02:31.380 --> 02:33.673
I was just stunned. 


02:33.673 --> 02:37.093
Then I found another five magazines 
around the prison. 


02:37.093 --> 02:39.095
I devoured them as well. 


02:39.095 --> 02:44.810
And I became thoroughly convinced 
that I had found the truth.


02:44.810 --> 02:47.312
When my wife was first allowed to visit me, 


02:47.312 --> 02:51.000
I told her right away,
“I’ve found the truth!” 


02:52.067 --> 02:57.155
My wife made pretty fast progress
and was baptized two years later. 


02:57.155 --> 02:59.198
Her support was invaluable. 


02:59.198 --> 03:02.576
She would visit me, 
constantly encouraging me 


03:02.577 --> 03:05.000
to be faithful 
and remain loyal to God.


03:07.457 --> 03:10.000
In 1993, 
Jehovah’s Witnesses visited me. 


03:11.587 --> 03:16.000
I agreed to a Bible study, 
but the truth didn’t touch my heart. 


03:17.592 --> 03:20.887
One time, Jehovah’s Witnesses 
invited me to a gathering, 


03:20.887 --> 03:23.557
and there they told me that Vladimir Olkhov


03:23.557 --> 03:25.142
—that criminal—


03:25.142 --> 03:28.812
was about to get baptized 
and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


03:28.812 --> 03:32.274
I was cut to the heart! 


03:32.273 --> 03:35.000
When I got home, 
I burst into tears. 


03:37.863 --> 03:40.865
Because if he, 
in his circumstances, 


03:40.865 --> 03:42.868
could do it, then I could do it. 


03:42.868 --> 03:47.538
That very moment,
I prayed for the first time in my life.


03:47.538 --> 03:51.000
I was released in October of 1997. 


03:51.000 --> 03:54.838
After I was released, 
the brothers organized a gathering.


03:54.838 --> 03:57.000
They invited me to this gathering. 


03:58.300 --> 04:01.010
I remember 
that as I was approaching the place, 


04:01.010 --> 04:05.723
I suddenly realized this is where 
I once conducted a search!


04:05.723 --> 04:08.000
And then Valery walked into the room. 


04:09.520 --> 04:12.000
We just hugged each other
and burst into tears.


04:16.318 --> 04:18.903
And I saw in his eyes 
a completely different look, 


04:18.903 --> 04:21.990
not like before
—it was a kind look. 


04:21.990 --> 04:24.075
It brought tears to my eyes. 


04:24.075 --> 04:26.870
It was like a big weight 
was lifted from my chest. 


04:26.870 --> 04:28.247
‘My brother!’ 


04:28.247 --> 04:31.000
We begged one another for forgiveness.


04:33.002 --> 04:36.672
On the 23rd of November 1997, 


04:36.672 --> 04:40.884
I was baptized together in the same pool 


04:40.883 --> 04:44.000
as my new friend Valery.


04:46.265 --> 04:49.225
We really became the best of friends. 


04:49.225 --> 04:52.687
And now we serve as elders 
in the same congregation.


04:52.687 --> 04:54.857
My wife and I often talk about


04:54.857 --> 04:56.859
what would have happened to us 


04:56.858 --> 04:59.068
if we had not started to study the Bible. 


04:59.068 --> 05:02.321
Probably we wouldn’t even be alive now. 


05:02.322 --> 05:04.700
We’ve kept our family together. 


05:04.700 --> 05:07.410
Even better, 
we now have a spiritual family 


05:07.410 --> 05:09.412
in the Christian congregation. 


05:09.412 --> 05:13.125
And my former enemy 
is now my brother and best friend. 


05:13.125 --> 05:15.252
More importantly, we’ve developed 


05:15.252 --> 05:18.000
a close relationship with Jehovah.


05:19.923 --> 05:21.925
Only God is able to change the thinking 


05:21.925 --> 05:24.000
of such bitter enemies as Vlad and I were. 


05:26.847 --> 05:28.849
And I eagerly look forward to the day


05:28.848 --> 05:30.850
when everything that divides people 


05:30.850 --> 05:49.432
will be gone forever.

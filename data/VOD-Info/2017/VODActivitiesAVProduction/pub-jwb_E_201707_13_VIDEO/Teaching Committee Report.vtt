00:01.217 --> 00:05.089
While there is a lot of work 
to be done on a local level, 


00:05.088 --> 00:08.323
there is an unprecedented global effort 


00:08.323 --> 00:11.593
to provide spiritual food 
to all of God’s people. 


00:11.593 --> 00:13.596
Under the direction 
of the Teaching Committee 


00:13.597 --> 00:15.599
of the Governing Body, 


00:15.598 --> 00:18.935
the Audio/Video Services Department, 
or AVS, 


00:18.935 --> 00:23.707
takes the lead in producing 
audio and video publications.


00:23.707 --> 00:26.109
It’s been said that if a picture 


00:26.108 --> 00:28.276
is worth a thousand words, 


00:28.277 --> 00:31.280
then a video is worth a million! 


00:31.280 --> 00:34.350
Videos stir our emotions, don’t they? 


00:34.350 --> 00:37.453
And they can be 
very powerful teaching tools. 


00:37.453 --> 00:40.156
Brother Russell recognized this fact. 


00:40.157 --> 00:43.760
Back in 1914, 
the small group of Bible Students 


00:43.760 --> 00:46.695
presented the “Photo-Drama of Creation” 


00:46.695 --> 00:50.700
to over nine million people worldwide, 


00:50.700 --> 00:53.102
and the response was overwhelming. 


00:53.102 --> 00:56.439
It was clear that Jehovah 
blessed their efforts 


00:56.438 --> 01:01.443
at spreading the Bible’s message 
in a visual way. 


01:01.443 --> 01:04.280
Well, over a hundred years later, 


01:04.280 --> 01:07.783
“the faithful and discreet slave” 
is producing videos.


01:07.783 --> 01:10.153
And for many years, basically, 


01:10.153 --> 01:13.756
one large public-release video 


01:13.757 --> 01:17.360
was being released, 
or produced, each year. 


01:17.360 --> 01:20.497
For example, back in 2011, 


01:20.497 --> 01:24.567
the video Faith in Action, Part 2 
was released. 


01:24.567 --> 01:29.039
And it required a tremendous effort 
to produce the video master, 


01:29.038 --> 01:31.775
the audio tracks, the graphics, 


01:31.775 --> 01:36.780
the music, the on-screen text 
for one video.


01:36.780 --> 01:40.082
However, just five years later, 


01:40.082 --> 01:42.385
the work has grown from producing 


01:42.385 --> 01:45.288
an average of one video per year 


01:45.288 --> 01:48.991
to one video per day. 


01:48.992 --> 01:53.997
This is because videos are now 
a regular part of our website, 


01:53.997 --> 01:57.734
the broadcasts, 
our ministry, the conventions, 


01:57.733 --> 02:00.403
meetings, and other special events. 


02:00.403 --> 02:02.505
In 2016, 


02:02.505 --> 02:06.442
more than 350 videos were produced. 


02:06.442 --> 02:09.145
Under the direction 
of the Teaching Committee, 


02:09.145 --> 02:12.948
Audio/Video Services (AVS) 
has been entrusted with this work.


02:12.948 --> 02:17.520
But with this rapid increase 
in the amount of videos produced, 


02:17.520 --> 02:20.357
how is all this accomplished? 


02:20.357 --> 02:22.525
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression 


02:22.525 --> 02:24.727
“it takes a village.” 


02:24.727 --> 02:28.430
In this case, 
it takes an entire globe. 


02:28.430 --> 02:31.868
Please enjoy the following video 
for a close-up look 


02:31.868 --> 02:35.000
at how audio and video work 
is accomplished worldwide.


02:45.548 --> 02:48.885
To assist with the growing workload 
in Audio/Video Services, 


02:48.885 --> 02:50.887
the Governing Body has approved 


02:50.887 --> 02:53.890
11 full-time Regional Video Teams (RVT) 


02:53.890 --> 02:55.992
in branches around the world.


02:55.992 --> 02:57.994
But it doesn’t stop there. 


02:57.993 --> 03:01.931
Bethelites, commuters, 
and remote workers in many other branches 


03:01.932 --> 03:05.034
also provide valuable assistance.


03:05.033 --> 03:07.336
How do we work with all these teams? 


03:07.337 --> 03:10.774
After receiving direction 
from the Governing Body committees 


03:10.773 --> 03:12.875
for upcoming videos, 


03:12.875 --> 03:17.000
AVS then assigns 
each video to a capable team.


03:19.048 --> 03:21.483
Once the team accepts the assignment, 


03:21.483 --> 03:24.320
we provide them 
with the necessary direction 


03:24.320 --> 03:28.090
as well as answer 
any questions they may have. 


03:28.090 --> 03:31.000
Then the team goes to work.


03:47.043 --> 03:49.211
Because of being a small group, 


03:49.212 --> 03:53.584
each team member may have to wear 
multiple hats to get the job done.


03:53.583 --> 03:57.386
From start to finish, 
they all work very hard 


03:57.387 --> 03:59.622
to deliver a completed, edited video 


03:59.622 --> 04:02.625
to us by the designated time. 


04:02.625 --> 04:06.595
Later, you may see these videos 
on JW Broadcasting, 


04:06.595 --> 04:10.000
jw.org, or other places. 


04:15.538 --> 04:19.000
Would you like to meet 
some of our RVT family?


04:23.445 --> 04:26.983
It’s a privilege. 


04:26.983 --> 04:30.000
We meet friends who have suffered 
some hardships and trials, 


04:31.988 --> 04:34.256
but because of their trust in Jehovah, 


04:34.257 --> 04:36.259
they were able to overcome them, 


04:36.258 --> 04:39.461
and we see the results of their loyalty. 


04:39.462 --> 04:42.632
I think it strengthens our determination 


04:42.632 --> 04:47.137
to also stay loyal.


04:47.137 --> 04:49.772
We are a joyful team 


04:49.772 --> 04:52.209
with a lot of humor, 


04:52.208 --> 04:53.810
and we work together very harmoniously. 


04:53.810 --> 04:56.578
You could say that we 
are like a little family. 


04:56.578 --> 04:59.981
We look forward to the next day 
when we go to work again. 


04:59.982 --> 05:02.285
It’s unbelievable how many dear brothers 


05:02.285 --> 05:05.788
and sisters we’ve gotten to know 
through these projects. 


05:05.788 --> 05:07.790
Close ties can develop, 


05:07.790 --> 05:10.727
and it is not uncommon 
that tears flow when the project is over 


05:10.727 --> 05:14.000
and it is time to say good-bye.


05:17.733 --> 05:20.168
Sometimes we would film 
on private or state property, 


05:20.168 --> 05:22.338
and I would have to approach the manager 


05:22.338 --> 05:24.540
and let them know 
what we were planning to shoot 


05:24.540 --> 05:26.542
at the location. 


05:26.542 --> 05:31.880
This wasn’t easy for me 
because I’m not very good with words. 


05:31.880 --> 05:35.852
And many people in Korea tend to have 
a biased view of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


05:35.852 --> 05:38.000
so this made it even harder for me. 


05:40.657 --> 05:42.825
So I prayed to Jehovah, 


05:42.825 --> 05:46.362
asking for his guidance and wisdom. 


05:46.362 --> 05:51.000
I was surprised to find that many 
were more than willing to help us. 


05:53.668 --> 05:57.005
These experiences help me to realize 


05:57.005 --> 06:02.000
that Jehovah always answers 
our prayers for strength and courage.


06:04.847 --> 06:07.184
You have to balance your time around work, 


06:07.183 --> 06:10.686
around being the head of a family, 


06:10.687 --> 06:12.789
being an elder, 


06:12.788 --> 06:16.058
or other responsibilities 
that you have in the congregation. 


06:16.058 --> 06:19.128
That’s when you really see Jehovah’s hand


06:19.128 --> 06:23.565
—when you see the mountain of challenge, 


06:23.565 --> 06:25.033
but you overcome it. 


06:25.033 --> 06:26.135
And you know it wasn’t you. 


06:26.135 --> 06:29.000
It was impossible for you to do it yourself. 


06:30.072 --> 06:33.977
When I put even half 
the amount of energy and effort 


06:33.977 --> 06:37.980
that I do into working for Jehovah 
into something secular, 


06:37.980 --> 06:40.450
I’m wiped out; I need a vacation. 


06:40.450 --> 06:43.920
But the more 
I put into working for Jehovah, 


06:43.920 --> 06:46.388
the more I want to work. 


06:46.388 --> 06:49.691
To know that you 
are offering your skills to Jehovah


06:49.692 --> 06:52.229
—that is a blessing. 


06:52.228 --> 06:55.396
But, really, the blessing is seeing 
your relationship with Jehovah 


06:55.397 --> 06:57.834
thrive and become stronger, 


06:57.833 --> 07:01.103
and you can see 
that he does keep his promises 


07:01.103 --> 07:06.475
and that he supports you 
more than you’re supporting him.


07:06.475 --> 07:10.245
Many of us aren’t able 
to be full-time Bethelites, 


07:10.245 --> 07:12.248
but commuting really helps us 


07:12.248 --> 07:14.650
get that small snippet of what it’s like 


07:14.650 --> 07:17.000
to be a Bethelite 
and realize what a privilege it is. 


07:18.220 --> 07:21.890
And if you’ve got a specific talent, use it. 


07:21.890 --> 07:24.627
One day in Paradise, 
someone is going to come to you 


07:24.627 --> 07:26.629
and say, 
“How did you use your talent?” 


07:26.628 --> 07:28.363
Maybe you’re a brilliant artist, 


07:28.363 --> 07:30.933
and you’re going 
to proudly turn around and say: 


07:30.933 --> 07:33.035
“You know what? 
I used it for Jehovah.” 


07:33.035 --> 07:36.638
Even if you’re young, 
you can learn skills 


07:36.638 --> 07:40.510
and you can really assist 
Jehovah’s organization 


07:40.510 --> 07:43.112
now and in the future. 


07:43.112 --> 07:47.184
And there is no better boss 
to work for than Jehovah. 


07:47.183 --> 07:50.486
My advice to young ones: Go for it!


07:50.487 --> 07:53.355
And during this past year, 


07:53.355 --> 07:57.293
we were excited to add 
a new team to our AVS family


07:57.293 --> 08:01.000
—located in Mira Loma, California. 


08:03.032 --> 08:05.835
All in this group 
have made themselves available 


08:05.835 --> 08:08.670
for video needs out there.


08:08.670 --> 08:11.307
You’re able to take a person— 


08:11.307 --> 08:13.910
You’re able to take an individual 
that has dedicated their life to Jehovah, 


08:13.910 --> 08:15.143
and maybe they 
didn’t know at the time 


08:15.143 --> 08:16.645
that they were going 
to inspire somebody else 


08:16.645 --> 08:17.647
and have somebody 


08:17.647 --> 08:19.982
somewhere across the planet say: 


08:19.982 --> 08:21.984
“Wow! That’s exactly my life too. 


08:21.983 --> 08:24.520
“I’m so glad that this person 


08:24.520 --> 08:27.022
“was selected to be on here 
because that’s my life. 


08:27.022 --> 08:31.000
And that has triggered me 
to want to do more for Jehovah.” 


08:33.362 --> 08:35.364
You know it’s Jehovah’s holy spirit; 
he’s putting together a team; 


08:35.363 --> 08:37.366
he’s the Great Producer. 


08:37.367 --> 08:40.002
And what he really wants 
is he wants people who have the talent, 


08:40.002 --> 08:42.004
but he wants people 
who have the holy spirit more 


08:42.003 --> 08:44.006
and are willing to work for it. 


08:44.007 --> 08:48.110
But he gives you the ability, 
like Oholiab and Bezalel, 


08:48.110 --> 08:51.613
to be able to put your talents 
that you’ve learned to work for him.


08:51.613 --> 08:53.615
As you can see, 


08:53.615 --> 08:57.953
we’re part of a beautiful, 
hardworking global team. 


08:57.953 --> 09:02.325
With so many hands helping the load 
in so many time zones, 


09:02.325 --> 09:07.000
we’re literally working on videos 24/7. 


09:09.232 --> 09:12.134
It’s a great privilege 
to work alongside our extended family. 


09:12.133 --> 09:14.236
We learn from each other. 


09:14.237 --> 09:17.039
Their willing spirit, humble attitude, 


09:17.038 --> 09:19.108
and contagious joy 


09:19.108 --> 09:22.000
inspire all of us here in AVS.


09:24.380 --> 09:29.252
Additionally, we receive 
incredible support right at home too. 


09:29.252 --> 09:31.720
Virtually every department at Bethel 


09:31.720 --> 09:34.557
supports the audio/video work in some way, 


09:34.557 --> 09:39.429
and we are very, very thankful. 


09:39.428 --> 09:44.000
With everyone’s help, 
the Bible’s message is being spread visually 


09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
throughout the earth 
at unprecedented levels.


09:51.240 --> 09:54.610
But how is any of this possible? 


09:54.610 --> 09:56.945
Brother Russell said it best: 


09:56.945 --> 09:59.000
‘This is not man’s work. It’s God’s.’ 


10:01.883 --> 10:05.053
Jehovah is certainly at the helm. 


10:05.053 --> 10:08.623
As he foretold at Haggai 2:7: 


10:08.623 --> 10:11.193
“I will shake all the nations, 


10:11.193 --> 10:14.463
“and the precious things 
of all the nations will come in; 


10:14.463 --> 10:18.533
and I will fill this house with glory.”


10:18.533 --> 10:20.535
There is certainly 


10:20.535 --> 10:22.805
a great shaking taking place 


10:22.805 --> 10:24.807
worldwide. 


10:24.807 --> 10:28.677
And many of these precious ones 
are offering themselves willingly 


10:28.677 --> 10:32.682
to help Audio/Video Services 
accomplish this great work, 


10:32.682 --> 10:34.784
thanks to Jehovah God, 


10:34.783 --> 10:47.213
our Grand and Visual Instructor.

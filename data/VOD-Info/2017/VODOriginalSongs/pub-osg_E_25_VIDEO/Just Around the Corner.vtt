00:12.742 --> 00:20.832
You can hear the songbirds singing,
And you watch the clouds roll by.


00:20.832 --> 00:28.924
Then you’re walking in the valley
As the sun shines in a clear blue sky.


00:28.923 --> 00:36.515
You’re welcoming your loved ones,
And you can’t believe your eyes.


00:36.515 --> 00:45.000
Yes, this earthly Paradise
Was just around the corner.


00:48.985 --> 00:56.327
There’s a house down in the valley
And a house high on the hill.


00:56.327 --> 01:05.169
There is singing by the river
As the water flows and turns the mill.


01:05.168 --> 01:13.093
The golden fields are waiting.
Let the harvesting begin.


01:13.093 --> 01:20.766
Once the world we’re living in
Was just around the corner.


01:20.767 --> 01:28.942
It’s great to share with friends who care
The things that we looked forward to.


01:28.942 --> 01:36.950
Now every tear has disappeared.
The world is young, and life is new.


01:36.950 --> 01:44.542
There’s the sound of happy voices
And the scent of new mown hay.


01:44.542 --> 01:52.967
Now you’re calling to your loved ones
As you start another perfect day.


01:52.967 --> 02:00.307
Then we thank our God, Jehovah,
For his tender loving care.


02:00.307 --> 02:08.899
Yes, the blessings we all share
Were just around the corner.


02:08.898 --> 02:16.990
And evʹry day I smile and say,
“How good to see your happy face!”


02:16.990 --> 02:25.165
ʹCause once, it seemed, I only dreamed
That you’d be in my warm embrace.


02:25.165 --> 02:32.715
Waiting ʹround the corner
Is a world I long to see.


02:32.715 --> 02:40.888
It’s a promise from Jehovah.
It’s a guaranteed reality.


02:40.888 --> 02:48.896
And it’s hard to get downhearted
When I think of what’s in store.


02:48.897 --> 03:18.990
It’s the day I’m waiting for,
And it’s just around the corner.

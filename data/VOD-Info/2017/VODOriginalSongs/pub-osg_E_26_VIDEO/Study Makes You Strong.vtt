00:08.028 --> 00:14.033
Since we could crawl, 
our family studied it all.


00:14.033 --> 00:19.956
Even though small, 
we understood what we were learning.


00:19.957 --> 00:25.795
Father would read to me 
before I would sleep.


00:25.795 --> 00:31.718
Now I am taller; 
I still keep up with that routine.


00:31.718 --> 00:37.933
And when I’m by myself, 
I take that book down off the shelf.


00:37.933 --> 00:42.605
I remember what the scripture said 
that I would need so I could stand firm.


00:42.605 --> 00:44.607
Study makes you strong,


00:44.607 --> 00:49.445
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


00:49.445 --> 00:50.695
Study makes you strong.


00:50.695 --> 00:55.367
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


00:55.367 --> 00:56.535
Study makes you strong,


00:56.535 --> 01:01.165
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


01:01.165 --> 01:02.373
Study makes you strong.


01:02.373 --> 01:10.000
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.


01:12.383 --> 01:17.806
What will I say when a big chance 
comes my way?


01:17.807 --> 01:24.272
What will my classmates say 
if I don’t follow with them?


01:24.272 --> 01:30.527
All of the information’s 
here on display.


01:30.527 --> 01:37.159
I’m not afraid, 
because I learned this as an infant.


01:37.158 --> 01:42.330
ʹCause when I’m by myself, 
I take that book down off the shelf.


01:42.330 --> 01:47.085
I remember what the scripture said 
that I would need so I could stand firm.


01:47.085 --> 01:49.087
Study makes you strong,


01:49.087 --> 01:54.009
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


01:54.008 --> 01:55.176
Study makes you strong.


01:55.177 --> 01:59.932
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


01:59.932 --> 02:01.100
Study makes you strong,


02:01.100 --> 02:05.770
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


02:05.770 --> 02:07.022
Study makes you strong.


02:07.022 --> 02:16.782
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.


02:16.782 --> 02:28.919
Every word that’s helping me
Could contain the very key


02:28.918 --> 02:39.471
To offer just the help 
and encouragement somebody needs.


02:39.472 --> 02:51.984
Study makes you strong.
Study makes you strong.


02:51.983 --> 03:04.120
Study makes you strong.
Study makes you strong.


03:04.120 --> 03:05.622
Study makes you strong,


03:05.622 --> 03:10.502
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


03:10.502 --> 03:11.712
Study makes you strong.


03:11.712 --> 03:16.467
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


03:16.467 --> 03:17.592
Study makes you strong,


03:17.592 --> 03:22.514
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


03:22.513 --> 03:23.598
Study makes you strong.


03:23.598 --> 03:50.730
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.

00:21.838 --> 00:30.000
They looked up at the stars
With godly fear in their hearts.


00:31.580 --> 00:42.225
They thanked their God up above
For revealing to them His love.


00:42.225 --> 00:51.735
So You gave them your name,
A Kingdom hope to proclaim.


00:51.735 --> 01:01.778
They’re words preserved for our day.
They’re faithful words to show us the way.


01:01.778 --> 01:12.421
They loved you from their heart,
And they were proud to play their part—


01:12.422 --> 01:22.965
Approved by you to preserve your Word,
Wrote it down so you would be heard.


01:22.965 --> 01:33.208
Your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


01:33.208 --> 01:38.313
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


01:38.313 --> 01:44.000
And your sayings I just want to keep.


01:45.688 --> 01:55.998
Oh, whatever Your enemies tried,
They could not silence You.


01:55.998 --> 02:05.975
Your loyal ones who loved your Word
Kept their faith, integrity too.


02:05.975 --> 02:16.085
And when they tried to ban their Bibles,
They were prepared to give their lives.


02:16.085 --> 02:21.825
For so strong was their faith 
and the witness they gave,


02:21.825 --> 02:26.562
Not one of your words was erased.


02:26.562 --> 02:36.539
And so your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


02:36.538 --> 02:42.111
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


02:42.112 --> 02:47.117
And your sayings I just want to keep.


02:47.117 --> 02:57.260
And you told us your name is Jehovah.
In your Word it’s plain to see.


02:57.260 --> 03:02.798
So your name will endure,
All your words will come true,


03:02.798 --> 03:09.805
And we’ll praise you all of our days.


03:09.805 --> 03:20.350
So your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


03:20.350 --> 03:25.488
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


03:25.488 --> 03:32.628
And your sayings I just want to keep,


03:32.628 --> 03:56.403
All of my days.

00:21 They looked up at the stars With godly fear in their hearts.
00:31 They thanked their God up above For revealing to them His love.
00:42 So You gave them your name, A Kingdom hope to proclaim.
00:51 They’re words preserved for our day. They’re faithful words to show us the way.
01:01 They loved you from their heart, And they were proud to play their part—
01:12 Approved by you to preserve your Word, Wrote it down so you would be heard.
01:22 Your Word endures forever, And your sayings are, oh, so deep.
01:33 The good news you declare  is a breath of fresh air,
01:38 And your sayings I just want to keep.
01:45 Oh, whatever Your enemies tried, They could not silence You.
01:55 Your loyal ones who loved your Word Kept their faith, integrity too.
02:05 And when they tried to ban their Bibles, They were prepared to give their lives.
02:16 For so strong was their faith  and the witness they gave,
02:21 Not one of your words was erased.
02:26 And so your Word endures forever, And your sayings are, oh, so deep.
02:36 The good news you declare  is a breath of fresh air,
02:42 And your sayings I just want to keep.
02:47 And you told us your name is Jehovah. In your Word it’s plain to see.
02:57 So your name will endure, All your words will come true,
03:02 And we’ll praise you all of our days.
03:09 So your Word endures forever, And your sayings are, oh, so deep.
03:20 The good news you declare  is a breath of fresh air,
03:25 And your sayings I just want to keep,
03:32 All of my days.

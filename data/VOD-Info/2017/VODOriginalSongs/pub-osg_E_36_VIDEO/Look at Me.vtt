00:10.697 --> 00:16.370
Think—think outside the box.
Be someone who talks.


00:16.370 --> 00:19.498
Don’t waste away behind that tiny screen


00:19.498 --> 00:23.376
’Cause you know 
that there’s much more to life


00:23.377 --> 00:29.132
Than friend requests and likes.
Think of all the things we haven’t seen. 


00:29.132 --> 00:30.217
Well, you—


00:30.217 --> 00:34.680
You’ll never see them
if you’re focused on the superficial.


00:34.680 --> 00:38.267
You need real friends, 
if you know what I mean.


00:38.267 --> 00:42.772
Look at me.
Can you see


00:42.772 --> 00:47.860
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


00:47.860 --> 00:51.863
Look at me.
Do you know


00:51.863 --> 00:56.160
What I know?
That you belong. 


00:56.160 --> 01:00.000
Put down the phone, and look at me.


01:02.875 --> 01:08.338
Take—take the time to see.
See what others see.


01:08.338 --> 01:11.841
Don’t trade that plastic box
for all your friends.


01:11.842 --> 01:17.932
You can make friends you know are true,
Who love Jehovah too,


01:17.932 --> 01:21.352
Who’ll stand right 
by your side until the end. 


01:21.352 --> 01:22.310
But, you—


01:22.310 --> 01:26.815
You’ll never meet them
if you’re focused on the superficial.


01:26.815 --> 01:30.610
You need real friends,
if you know what I mean.


01:30.610 --> 01:34.782
Look at me.
Can you see


01:34.782 --> 01:40.162
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


01:40.162 --> 01:44.165
Look at me.
Do you know


01:44.165 --> 01:48.462
What I know?
That you belong.


01:48.462 --> 01:53.000
Put down the phone, and look at me.


02:09.858 --> 02:14.915
Don’t let it play you for a fool.


02:14.915 --> 02:19.618
What you’re getting 
could be fact or could be fiction.


02:19.618 --> 02:24.748
Life in the cloud can be so cruel.


02:24.748 --> 02:32.000
Why don’t you come back down to earth,
converse, and reverse the addiction?


02:50.357 --> 02:56.155
Put—put down your device
’Cause if you don’t think twice,


02:56.155 --> 02:59.742
The best in life will surely pass you by.


02:59.742 --> 03:05.789
Look, listen, taste, and touch—
The things we love so much


03:05.788 --> 03:10.001
Have been here all along. 
All you need to do is


03:10.002 --> 03:14.632
Realize what’s in your hand
is only superficial.


03:14.632 --> 03:18.344
You’ve got real friends, 
if you know what I mean.


03:18.343 --> 03:22.638
Look at me.
Can you see


03:22.638 --> 03:27.936
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


03:27.937 --> 03:31.940
Look at me.
Do you know


03:31.940 --> 03:36.237
What I know?
That you belong. 


03:36.237 --> 03:39.280
Put down the phone, and look at me.


03:39.280 --> 03:43.952
Can you see
What I see?


03:43.952 --> 03:46.955
Around the world, this happy family.


03:46.955 --> 03:50.958
Look at me.
Do you know


03:50.958 --> 03:55.213
What I know?
That you belong. 


03:55.213 --> 04:05.620
Put down the phone, and look at me.

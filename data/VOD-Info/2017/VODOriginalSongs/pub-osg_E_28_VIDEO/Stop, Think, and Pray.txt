00:12 Life’s not easy when trouble’s around And the whole situation is getting you down.
00:22 So-called friends, they just want a reaction. Turn to Jehovah and pray—
00:34 Silently pray.
00:40 Don’t give up; don’t give in. Put your trust in Jehovah.
00:50 Keep it calm; we can win If we stop, think, and pray.
01:00 When there seems no way out, He’ll be there, always by our side.
01:10 He will be our guide, never doubt; No, just stop, think, and pray.
01:20 Make Jehovah smile. Let him show the way.
01:39 Ev’ry day will have troubles to share.
01:44 There are bills to be paid  with no money to spare.
01:49 Even so, we’ll be happy in giving If we can make someone smile—
02:00 Make someone smile.
02:06 Never doubt; never fear. Put your trust in Jehovah.
02:16 And our road will be clear If we stop, think, and pray.
02:27 When we’re weak, we are strong. And we’ll see he was by our side.
02:37 He has been our guide all along. Always stop, think, and pray.
02:47 Make Jehovah smile. Let him show the way.
02:58 Put your trust in Jehovah. And our road will be clear
03:08 If we stop, think, and pray. When we’re weak, we are strong.
03:18 And we’ll see he was by our side. He has been our guide all along.
03:28 Always stop, think, and pray. Make Jehovah smile.
03:38 Thank him ev’ry day.

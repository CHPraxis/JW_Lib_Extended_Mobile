00:12.783 --> 00:22.835
Life’s not easy when trouble’s around
And the whole situation is getting you down.


00:22.835 --> 00:34.347
So-called friends, they just want a reaction.
Turn to Jehovah and pray—


00:34.347 --> 00:39.000
Silently pray.


00:40.018 --> 00:50.361
Don’t give up; don’t give in.
Put your trust in Jehovah.


00:50.362 --> 01:00.164
Keep it calm; we can win
If we stop, think, and pray.


01:00.163 --> 01:10.340
When there seems no way out,
He’ll be there, always by our side.


01:10.340 --> 01:20.433
He will be our guide, never doubt;
No, just stop, think, and pray.


01:20.433 --> 01:28.000
Make Jehovah smile.
Let him show the way.


01:39.202 --> 01:44.417
Ev’ry day will have troubles to share.


01:44.417 --> 01:49.672
There are bills to be paid 
with no money to spare.


01:49.672 --> 02:00.890
Even so, we’ll be happy in giving
If we can make someone smile—


02:00.890 --> 02:05.000
Make someone smile.


02:06.980 --> 02:16.657
Never doubt; never fear.
Put your trust in Jehovah.


02:16.657 --> 02:27.584
And our road will be clear
If we stop, think, and pray.


02:27.583 --> 02:37.093
When we’re weak, we are strong.
And we’ll see he was by our side.


02:37.093 --> 02:47.103
He has been our guide all along.
Always stop, think, and pray.


02:47.103 --> 02:55.000
Make Jehovah smile.
Let him show the way.


02:58.198 --> 03:08.083
Put your trust in Jehovah.
And our road will be clear


03:08.083 --> 03:18.551
If we stop, think, and pray.
When we’re weak, we are strong.


03:18.552 --> 03:28.604
And we’ll see he was by our side.
He has been our guide all along.


03:28.603 --> 03:36.000
Always stop, think, and pray.
Make Jehovah smile.


03:38.572 --> 03:54.359
Thank him ev’ry day.

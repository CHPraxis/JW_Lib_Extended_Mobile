00:11.573 --> 00:17.538
A heart full of questions, 
a life so unsure,


00:17.538 --> 00:21.958
I heard what you told me; 
I wanted more.


00:21.958 --> 00:33.345
What you told me, 
I wanted more.


00:33.345 --> 00:38.600
Unanswered questions 
were answered that day.


00:38.600 --> 00:43.438
The worry I was feeling 
melted away.


00:43.438 --> 00:53.000
All my worries 
faded away.


00:54.073 --> 01:04.751
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But faith can make things happen.


01:04.752 --> 01:10.757
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


01:10.757 --> 01:22.000
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.


01:28.983 --> 01:34.406
I love what I’m learning 
and share what I know.


01:34.407 --> 01:39.412
I’m ready and waiting, 
so here I go.


01:39.412 --> 01:49.000
Yes, I’m ready
To share what I know.


01:50.172 --> 01:55.802
My faith is like a fire 
that burns within my heart.


01:55.802 --> 02:01.184
I’ve got to keep it burning 
and do my part.


02:01.183 --> 02:11.318
Keep it burning 
deep in my heart.


02:11.318 --> 02:21.786
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But this I’ve not forgotten:


02:21.787 --> 02:28.169
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


02:28.168 --> 02:40.805
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.


02:40.805 --> 02:51.317
Seeing sad days, bad days, 
bring stormy weather.


02:51.317 --> 03:01.577
Praying over and over, 
staying close to Jehovah.


03:01.577 --> 03:07.875
He said, “If you put your trust in me,
I’ll give you strength, and then you’ll see


03:07.875 --> 03:12.838
The trials that came to be,
We faced them together.”


03:12.838 --> 03:23.265
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But this I’ve not forgotten:


03:23.265 --> 03:29.438
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


03:29.438 --> 03:34.358
Faith can make things happen.


03:34.358 --> 03:44.368
Now I’m so sure, I have no doubt,
Faith can make things happen.


03:44.368 --> 03:50.625
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


03:50.625 --> 04:12.795
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.

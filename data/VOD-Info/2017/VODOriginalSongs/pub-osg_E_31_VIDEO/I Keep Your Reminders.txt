00:18 What should I do?  Who should I look to?
00:30 This could just be harmless,  could be respectable.
00:36 There may be no need  for me to reject it all.
00:42 Oh, what is the right course for me?  Which path will it be?
00:54 What should I do?  Take which point of view?
01:06 It could be excessive,  with many dangers there—
01:12 All the kinds of things  that could prove to be a snare.
01:18 Oh, what is the right course for me?  Jehovah, give ear to my plea.
01:29 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
01:35 I’ll treasure them every day,  monthly, yearly.
01:41 All the things I have heard in accord  with your Word, help me understand.
01:56 I know what’s required.  I’d better inquire.
02:08 I don’t want to act  in a way to cause offense,
02:14 But it sounds like  there likely would be consequence.
02:21 It’s clear what’s the right course for me —the key, the guarantee.
02:31 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
02:37 They strengthen my heart  and help me to see clearly.
02:43 All the things I have heard in accord with your Word, help me understand.
03:16 I keep your reminders,  and I love them dearly.
03:22 They strengthen my heart  and help me to see clearly.
03:29 As I read day and night,  my life fills up with light.
03:35 I’ve got you by my side  as I think of your might.
03:42 All the things I have heard in accord  with your Word, help me understand.

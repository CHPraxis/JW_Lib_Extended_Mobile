00:18.663 --> 00:29.000
What should I do? 
Who should I look to?


00:30.425 --> 00:35.000
This could just be harmless, 
could be respectable.


00:36.973 --> 00:41.000
There may be no need 
for me to reject it all.


00:42.605 --> 00:51.000
Oh, what is the right course for me? 
Which path will it be?


00:54.533 --> 01:05.000
What should I do? 
Take which point of view?


01:06.420 --> 01:11.000
It could be excessive, 
with many dangers there—


01:12.968 --> 01:18.890
All the kinds of things 
that could prove to be a snare.


01:18.890 --> 01:29.360
Oh, what is the right course for me? 
Jehovah, give ear to my plea.


01:29.360 --> 01:35.907
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


01:35.907 --> 01:41.872
I’ll treasure them every day, 
monthly, yearly.


01:41.872 --> 01:50.000
All the things I have heard in accord 
with your Word, help me understand.


01:56.053 --> 02:07.000
I know what’s required. 
I’d better inquire.


02:08.815 --> 02:14.363
I don’t want to act 
in a way to cause offense,


02:14.363 --> 02:21.036
But it sounds like 
there likely would be consequence.


02:21.037 --> 02:31.464
It’s clear what’s the right course for me
—the key, the guarantee.


02:31.463 --> 02:37.093
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


02:37.093 --> 02:43.558
They strengthen my heart 
and help me to see clearly.


02:43.558 --> 02:52.000
All the things I have heard in accord
with your Word, help me understand.


03:16.050 --> 03:22.890
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


03:22.890 --> 03:29.228
They strengthen my heart 
and help me to see clearly.


03:29.228 --> 03:35.151
As I read day and night, 
my life fills up with light.


03:35.152 --> 03:42.075
I’ve got you by my side 
as I think of your might.


03:42.075 --> 04:05.245
All the things I have heard in accord 
with your Word, help me understand.

00:20 Jehovah, the Maker of heaven, By heaven you can’t be contained,
00:29 Even less an earthly dwelling place. But your spirit can here remain.
00:40 Adorning this center of worship Are people who walk in your light.
00:49 We rejoice to serve in unity;  Our devotion is your delight.
00:58 There is nothing we have That you haven’t provided.
01:07 From your own hand, we’ve given All that we offer you.
01:17 For all you have done, we are grateful; Our voices in song we now raise.
01:27 For you’ve made our hope reality With this place that will bring you praise.
01:39 Jehovah, you knew that we wanted A place that will bring to you praise
01:49 And will serve the needs of worshippers, Helping others to walk your ways.
01:58 And now may this place serve your purpose. There’s work needing yet to be done,
02:08 To pick up the pace and carry on In the work given by your Son.
02:17 So we offer the best Of our time and possessions.
02:27 You alone are deserving— Giver of all good things.
02:37 For all you have done, we are grateful; Our voices in song we now raise.
02:47 For you’ve made our hope reality With this place that will bring you praise.

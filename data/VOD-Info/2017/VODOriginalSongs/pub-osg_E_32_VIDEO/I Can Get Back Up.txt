00:16 This loneliness I feel inside  is hard to bear.
00:25 Jehovah, I can see where I went wrong.
00:33 Feeling so downhearted,  I need strength to carry on.
00:40 I’m yearning to be back where I belong.
00:48 I remember things you taught me —things I still recall—
00:56 The precious truths found  in your Holy Word.
01:04 That even if I stumble, even if I fall, I can get back up.
01:20 I know the ones who care for me, Who showed their love before,
01:29 Those who love Jehovah from the heart.
01:36 Your word is like a lamp  that lights the way that leads me back.
01:45 The road to life is where I want to be.
01:53 Ev’rywhere I go, ev’rything I see,  reminds me of the truth:
02:00 The end is drawing near.
02:08 So Jehovah, Father,  please hear my prayer tonight
02:16 And help me now,  I’m in my time of need.
02:24 You know that when I stumble  so many times,
02:33 I can get back up.
02:40 I know Jehovah understands;  sometimes I need a helping hand.
02:56 He knows that I am weak  and sees what others cannot see.
03:04 He’s looking for the best in me.
03:12 So I’m going to the hall tonight  to feel the love I lost,
03:21 Back to where I know I belong.
03:29 And even if I stumble,  even if I fall, I will get back up.
03:53 I can get back up.

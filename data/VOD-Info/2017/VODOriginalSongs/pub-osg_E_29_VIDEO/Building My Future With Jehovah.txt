00:11 At times, I wish I could see  exactly what my future will be
00:18 And how my life will turn out  and which road is the right one for me.
00:28 But one thing’s for sure,  no matter what comes along,
00:36 I live for Jehovah,  to him I belong.
00:44 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
00:49 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
00:54 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
01:02 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
01:07 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
01:11 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
01:20 At times, the chance comes along  to take a path I know to be wrong,
01:28 A path that leads me away  from the place that I know I belong.
01:38 But keeping in mind  the dedication I made
01:46 Can give me the firmness and faith  that won’t fade.
01:54 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
01:59 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
02:03 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
02:12 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
02:17 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
02:21 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
02:30 I’m building a future  that never will end
02:34 If I build it with help  from Jehovah, my Friend.
02:39 The happiest moments,  the best life can give,
02:43 Come from pleasing Jehovah  each day that I live.
03:08 Of all the people and things  my life could be filled with,
03:12 The best one of all,  the best one to build with,
03:17 Is pleasing Jehovah each day  with the choices I make.
03:25 He gave me all that I have;  I’ll never forget it.
03:30 I’m safe in his hands;  I’ll never regret it.
03:35 I’m building my future with him  ev’ry step that I take.
03:47 I’m building my future  with him ev’ry step that I take.

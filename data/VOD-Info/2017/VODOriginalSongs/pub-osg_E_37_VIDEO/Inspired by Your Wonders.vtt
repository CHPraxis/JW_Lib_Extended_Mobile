00:01.313 --> 00:06.318
I hear the birds singing out
to the sunrise.

00:08.946 --> 00:15.911
I see the stars fading away
in the morning light.

00:20.708 --> 00:26.130
Golden sun shines on down
through the treetops,

00:27.923 --> 00:36.348
Where there is a summer breeze
that whispers so soft.

00:37.349 --> 00:41.770
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

00:41.770 --> 00:46.775
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.”

00:46.775 --> 00:55.534
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

00:56.994 --> 01:03.292
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

01:07.046 --> 01:14.053
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

01:15.638 --> 01:17.640
I sing to you.

01:23.020 --> 01:28.525
These wondrous, moving,
breathing creations—

01:30.110 --> 01:38.661
Oh, in the night, in the day—
can you hear what they say?

01:42.081 --> 01:47.962
From mountaintops
to the bottoms of oceans,

01:49.546 --> 01:59.056
Let ev’ry living thing
sing out to your praise.

01:59.056 --> 02:03.227
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

02:03.227 --> 02:08.107
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.”

02:08.107 --> 02:17.700
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

02:17.700 --> 02:26.709
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

02:27.793 --> 02:36.802
I see your wonders, 
and I sing to you.

02:37.594 --> 02:39.930
I sing to you.

02:41.557 --> 02:47.521
Looking past what we 
can see with our eyes,

02:50.107 --> 02:58.490
We will come to know more 
about the One who gave us life.

03:01.035 --> 03:05.831
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

03:05.831 --> 03:10.794
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.”

03:10.794 --> 03:19.303
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

03:20.846 --> 03:29.688
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

03:29.688 --> 03:37.988
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

03:39.281 --> 03:47.748
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

03:49.792 --> 03:56.715
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

03:59.134 --> 04:06.183
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

04:08.477 --> 04:19.052
I sing to you.

00:14.827 --> 00:27.255
Yes, you had the best of intentions.
Kindnesses too numerous to mention.


00:27.255 --> 00:32.302
But thoughtless words 
just cut me to the heart.


00:32.302 --> 00:41.729
Then, as a tear appears, I see.
Things aren’t what they seem to be.


00:41.728 --> 00:53.990
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


00:53.990 --> 01:00.000
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


01:02.082 --> 01:08.339
Sisters today, sisters we’ll stay.


01:08.338 --> 01:21.060
Getting along is not always easy.
Angry words can bring you down, believe me.


01:21.060 --> 01:30.568
Then you find a reason to forgive,
And now you realize it’s true;


01:30.568 --> 01:35.740
Letting go’s the thing to do.


01:35.740 --> 01:48.003
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


01:48.003 --> 01:56.220
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


01:56.220 --> 02:01.808
Brothers today, brothers we’ll stay.


02:01.808 --> 02:13.000
Not one thing said or done can break us up. 
Love’s a bond of unity.


02:14.530 --> 02:26.250
Cancel the debt; forgive and forget.
That’s the way true friendship should be.


02:26.250 --> 02:37.845
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


02:37.845 --> 02:46.103
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


02:46.103 --> 02:54.000
Here in our hearts, that’s where it starts.


02:59.032 --> 03:28.709
Bonded in love, forgiving one another.

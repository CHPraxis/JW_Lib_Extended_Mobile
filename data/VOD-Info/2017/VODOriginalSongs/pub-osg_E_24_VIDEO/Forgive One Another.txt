00:14 Yes, you had the best of intentions. Kindnesses too numerous to mention.
00:27 But thoughtless words  just cut me to the heart.
00:32 Then, as a tear appears, I see. Things aren’t what they seem to be.
00:41 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
00:53 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
01:02 Sisters today, sisters we’ll stay.
01:08 Getting along is not always easy. Angry words can bring you down, believe me.
01:21 Then you find a reason to forgive, And now you realize it’s true;
01:30 Letting go’s the thing to do.
01:35 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
01:48 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
01:56 Brothers today, brothers we’ll stay.
02:01 Not one thing said or done can break us up.  Love’s a bond of unity.
02:14 Cancel the debt; forgive and forget. That’s the way true friendship should be.
02:26 Before the sun slips from the sky, Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.
02:37 We’ll forget the things we said, And, please, let’s forgive.
02:46 Here in our hearts, that’s where it starts.
02:59 Bonded in love, forgiving one another.

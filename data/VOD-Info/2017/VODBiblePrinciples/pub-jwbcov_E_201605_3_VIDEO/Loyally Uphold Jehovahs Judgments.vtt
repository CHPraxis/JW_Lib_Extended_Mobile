00:01.980 --> 00:03.982
It feels so good 


00:03.982 --> 00:06.277
to be with my family 
and friends. 


00:06.277 --> 00:09.364
When I’m with the brothers and sisters 
in our congregation, 


00:09.363 --> 00:12.406
it’s the best place 
I could be. 


00:12.407 --> 00:15.954
My children and I 
are so happy now. 


00:15.953 --> 00:20.000
But it hasn’t always been 
this way.


00:23.252 --> 00:27.000
My parents were missionaries 
when my mom got pregnant with me. 


00:28.423 --> 00:30.758
Mom and Dad were very zealous, 


00:30.758 --> 00:34.000
and people just assumed 
that I would follow in their footsteps.


00:36.723 --> 00:39.058
And for a while, 
I did. 


00:39.058 --> 00:41.145
I was the model child 


00:41.145 --> 00:44.940
who was always 
held up as an example. 


00:44.940 --> 00:48.000
Sure, the attention 
boosted my self-confidence, 


00:49.278 --> 00:53.865
but it also put me 
under enormous pressure. 


00:53.865 --> 00:56.160
It was like everyone 
was watching me, 


00:56.160 --> 00:59.000
and I couldn’t make 
a mistake.


01:02.958 --> 01:04.960
In my mid-teens, 


01:04.960 --> 01:08.213
I began to feel torn. 


01:08.213 --> 01:10.966
I liked the truth, 


01:10.967 --> 01:14.000
but I felt so confined. 


01:15.303 --> 01:18.556
I didn’t tell 
anyone how I felt. 


01:18.557 --> 01:20.935
I just pretended 
that everything was all right 


01:20.935 --> 01:24.000
and went 
through the motions.


01:27.650 --> 01:30.110
I envied kids 
who didn’t have to live 


01:30.110 --> 01:33.000
under so many restrictions. 


01:35.073 --> 01:37.743
And if they got 
the truth later in life,


01:37.743 --> 01:39.786
they got to experience 


01:39.787 --> 01:42.000
the best of both worlds.


01:47.418 --> 01:49.671
I thought maybe 
things would improve 


01:49.672 --> 01:52.000
after I graduated high school.


01:56.762 --> 01:59.014
But then, 
at my new job, 


01:59.013 --> 02:02.643
I met Eric. 


02:02.643 --> 02:05.000
He truly understood me. 


02:08.023 --> 02:11.000
He made me feel special, 


02:12.778 --> 02:15.000
and I loved him. 


02:16.615 --> 02:18.000
I loved him.


02:20.118 --> 02:22.411
In many ways, 


02:22.412 --> 02:25.000
I felt free. 


02:26.000 --> 02:28.668
For the first time 
in my life, 


02:28.668 --> 02:32.000
I could just do 
what I wanted.


02:34.132 --> 02:38.137
It wasn’t long 
before our relationship became 


02:38.137 --> 02:39.972
intimate. 


02:39.972 --> 02:43.392
I felt guilt at first, 


02:43.392 --> 02:46.229
but after a while 
it just seemed 


02:46.228 --> 02:50.231
that this is what two people 
who love each other do. 


02:50.232 --> 02:54.152
And I was willing 
to give up everything for him


02:54.152 --> 02:59.000
—everything.


03:04.162 --> 03:06.207
Looking back, 


03:06.207 --> 03:09.042
my parents tried hard 
to do the right thing


03:09.042 --> 03:13.000
—to do things Jehovah’s way. 


03:14.088 --> 03:17.675
But because I didn’t have 
a hatred for what’s bad, 


03:17.675 --> 03:19.678
I couldn’t see anything wrong 


03:19.678 --> 03:22.000
with my choices. 


03:23.182 --> 03:27.895
This eventually led me 
to do things I later regretted.


03:27.895 --> 03:30.938
I ended up 
getting disfellowshipped.


03:30.938 --> 03:34.000
Sonja Ericsson 
has been disfellowshipped.


03:35.277 --> 03:38.000
It crushed my whole family.


03:48.248 --> 03:50.916
Later, 
my father explained to me 


03:50.917 --> 03:52.920
that I couldn’t remain 
in the home 


03:52.920 --> 03:55.088
because I refused 
to change my lifestyle. 


03:55.088 --> 03:57.800
He told me I was having


03:57.800 --> 04:00.927
a negative effect 
on my younger brother and sister.


04:00.927 --> 04:03.000
Then I’m out of this house.


04:07.142 --> 04:10.000
I was determined 
to do what I wanted. 


04:11.855 --> 04:14.148
When I left 
home that day, 


04:14.148 --> 04:17.651
all I could think 
about was Eric. 


04:17.652 --> 04:20.197
I didn’t even care 


04:20.197 --> 04:23.000
that my parents’ hearts 
were breaking.


04:29.748 --> 04:31.791
I didn’t think 
about the devastation 


04:31.792 --> 04:35.000
and disappointment 
that I had caused them. 


04:38.548 --> 04:41.000
I blamed my parents 
for my situation. 


04:42.218 --> 04:45.000
I even blamed Jehovah.


04:47.808 --> 04:51.603
My family missed me so much 


04:51.603 --> 04:55.065
even after all I had done. 


04:55.065 --> 04:58.818
What helped them 
to remain loyal to Jehovah 


04:58.818 --> 05:01.821
for the many years 
that I was disfellowshipped? 


05:01.822 --> 05:04.407
It was the Bible account of Aaron.


05:04.407 --> 05:08.120
Jehovah directly judged 
two of Aaron’s sons 


05:08.120 --> 05:09.705
and put them to death. 


05:09.705 --> 05:11.540
In this case, 


05:11.540 --> 05:14.585
Jehovah asked Aaron 
and his family not to mourn 


05:14.585 --> 05:16.795
in order to show 
the entire nation 


05:16.795 --> 05:19.000
that they supported 
Jehovah’s judgment.


05:20.340 --> 05:22.968
Mom and Dad saw 
that they needed to be loyal 


05:22.968 --> 05:25.720
just like Aaron.


05:25.720 --> 05:28.348
They loved me 


05:28.348 --> 05:30.475
and wanted me 
to come back to Jehovah. 


05:30.475 --> 05:32.937
I tried to contact them. 


05:32.937 --> 05:36.000
I just wanted to talk 
and to hear their voice. 


05:38.067 --> 05:41.152
I missed being with my family. 


05:41.152 --> 05:45.157
And they thought 
about reaching out to me. 


05:45.157 --> 05:48.077
But they knew that if they 
had associated with me 


05:48.077 --> 05:50.829
even a little, 
just to check on me, 


05:50.828 --> 05:53.540
that small dose of association 


05:53.540 --> 05:55.542
might have satisfied me. 


05:55.542 --> 05:58.170
It could have made me think 


05:58.170 --> 06:02.000
that there was no need 
to return to Jehovah.


06:06.678 --> 06:10.890
I was disfellowshipped 
for more than 15 years. 


06:10.890 --> 06:12.893
I had two children now, 


06:12.893 --> 06:14.895
and as time went by, 


06:14.895 --> 06:17.313
I thought about their future. 


06:17.313 --> 06:21.360
I thought more and more 
about returning to Jehovah 


06:21.360 --> 06:23.028
and the congregation. 


06:23.028 --> 06:26.823
But I didn’t feel worthy.


06:26.823 --> 06:31.118
One day, two elders stopped by 
and kindly reminded me 


06:31.118 --> 06:33.830
that Jehovah wants me 
to return to him. 


06:33.830 --> 06:37.500
They showed me 
Psalm 86:5, 


06:37.500 --> 06:41.000
where it says 
that Jehovah is “ready to forgive.” 


06:42.713 --> 06:45.716
I thought about that verse 
the rest of the day: 


06:45.717 --> 06:49.847
Jehovah is “ready to forgive.”


06:49.847 --> 06:52.599
So I decided 
to go to the Kingdom Hall 


06:52.598 --> 06:54.601
for the first time in many years.


06:54.602 --> 06:56.185
. . . a feeling of remorse is healthy. 


06:56.185 --> 06:59.857
It can move us to take positive steps 
to correct our mistakes.


06:59.857 --> 07:01.859
It made me realize 


07:01.858 --> 07:05.070
just how far off track I had gotten. 


07:05.070 --> 07:07.072
I was determined 


07:07.072 --> 07:10.117
to qualify for reinstatement.


07:10.117 --> 07:12.119
Nearly a year later, 


07:12.118 --> 07:14.411
my reinstatement 


07:14.412 --> 07:17.415
was announced 
to the congregation.


07:17.415 --> 07:19.668
Sonja Ericsson is reinstated 


07:19.668 --> 07:22.000
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


07:25.840 --> 07:28.000
I was so happy. 


07:32.930 --> 07:36.000
The brothers and sisters 
welcomed me very warmly. 


07:38.103 --> 07:40.563
Being back together again


07:40.563 --> 07:43.733
with my family and Jehovah 


07:43.733 --> 07:46.570
made me feel so good. 


07:46.570 --> 07:49.030
I knew this is 
where I needed to be, 


07:49.030 --> 07:53.000
and I didn’t ever want 
to leave again.


07:55.370 --> 07:57.372
But when I’m alone, 


07:57.372 --> 08:02.794
I struggle with whether Jehovah 
has really forgiven me. 


08:02.793 --> 08:05.713
One time, 
I was so distraught 


08:05.713 --> 08:08.000
that I called my father for help.


08:09.383 --> 08:13.513
He comforted me 
with the words of Isaiah 1:18, 


08:13.513 --> 08:16.223
where Jehovah 
says that our sins, 


08:16.223 --> 08:18.601
which are like scarlet 
or crimson cloth, 


08:18.602 --> 08:21.000
can become white 
like snow.


08:24.148 --> 08:27.943
Then my father related 
the Bible account of Manasseh. 


08:27.943 --> 08:31.238
Manasseh “did on a grand scale 


08:31.238 --> 08:34.658
what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, 
to offend him.” 


08:34.658 --> 08:38.996
He even sacrificed 
his sons in false worship.


08:38.997 --> 08:43.544
Eventually, 
Manasseh genuinely repented 


08:43.543 --> 08:46.000
and Jehovah forgave him.


08:47.130 --> 08:51.000
This Bible account 
touched me deeply. 


08:52.052 --> 08:56.139
Now, I have to be willing 
to forgive myself. 


08:56.138 --> 08:59.183
If Jehovah was willing 


08:59.183 --> 09:01.185
to forgive 
the sins of Manasseh, 


09:01.185 --> 09:03.397
as bad as they were, 


09:03.397 --> 09:06.000
surely he has forgiven me. 


09:07.567 --> 09:10.695
What a blessing 
to understand 


09:10.695 --> 09:14.365
that Jehovah forgives 
in a large way, 


09:14.365 --> 09:28.152
and now 
I’m truly happy!

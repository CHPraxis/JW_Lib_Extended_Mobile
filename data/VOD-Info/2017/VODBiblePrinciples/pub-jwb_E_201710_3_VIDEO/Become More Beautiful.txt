00:22 My name is Miki.
00:24 I moved here one year ago.
00:27 Everyone was so nice and friendly.
00:38 Well, that’s how I felt in the beginning.
00:56 I am not your babysitter!
01:06 Didn’t you see we were talking?
01:20 Come on!  This is not a park!
01:25 And the elders are always busy.
01:28 I’m not sure if they really want me here.
01:42 Yoko, a pioneer sister from my former congregation, visited me.
01:48 She asked me how I was doing.
01:52 I told her how I felt about my congregation.
01:57 Then she told me that she had a similar experience.
02:01 And she shared with me a Watchtower article that helped her.
02:07 I made this my next personal study project.
02:13 “What do you see when you look at others?
02:17 “Do you have the tendency to view what they say or do
02:20 “as either black or white,
02:23 as if no other colors or shades existed?”
02:28 “Having that viewpoint
02:29 “would be like a photographer who ignores the large variety
02:34 “of brilliant hues and shades in an autumn landscape,
02:37 as if only black and white images existed.”
02:47 Maybe I’ve been viewing the congregation as “black and white.”
02:53 The article then turned my attention to Jesus’ example.
02:59 “The spirit, of course, is eager,
03:03 but the flesh is weak.”
03:09 Why was Jesus able to say such kind words
03:12 to his disciples?
03:24 Insight is the ability to put yourself
03:27 in the other’s place.
03:28 Jesus did that with his disciples.
03:31 OK, I need to do the same.
03:35 She always looks after the children at home.
03:38 She also needs time to be refreshed
03:40 by association with friends at the Kingdom Hall.
03:43 She probably didn’t mean to be rude.
03:47 Since we looked like we were having an enjoyable conversation,
03:50 she may have just wanted to join us.
03:55 The elders are so busy caring for the needs
03:57 of the congregation.
03:59 I know they’re doing the best they can.
04:01 I want to do what I can to make their job easier.
04:31 Miki,
04:32 you are such a beautiful Christian.
04:35 We’re so glad to have you  in our congregation.
04:45 “The insight of a man certainly
04:47 “slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part
04:52 to overlook an offense.”

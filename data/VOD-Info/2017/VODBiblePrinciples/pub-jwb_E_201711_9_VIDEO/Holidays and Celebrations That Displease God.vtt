00:10.531 --> 00:11.365
Hey, Buddy!

00:11.365 --> 00:12.783
How was school?

00:16.495 --> 00:18.497
That’s my Dad, Grayson,

00:18.497 --> 00:20.916
and my older brother, Dylan.

00:22.918 --> 00:23.752
Hey, Bro!

00:23.752 --> 00:25.004
We’re going to play ball. 
You want to come?

00:25.004 --> 00:26.338
No thanks.

00:28.173 --> 00:29.800
Is he OK?

00:29.800 --> 00:32.303
He normally loves to talk about school.

00:32.303 --> 00:34.388
He didn’t want to talk about school today.

00:37.057 --> 00:41.520
It wasn’t my worst day at school
—but pretty close.

00:42.897 --> 00:46.150
It all started first thing this morning.

00:47.109 --> 00:51.196
Everyone was signing a birthday card 
for one of our classmates, Lucas.

00:51.196 --> 00:53.032
Do you want to sign 
the birthday card for Lucas?

00:53.032 --> 00:55.868
He just got home from being 
at the hospital for cancer treatments.

00:55.868 --> 00:56.827
No thanks.

00:56.827 --> 00:59.747
I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, 
and I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:59.747 --> 01:00.623
What?

01:00.623 --> 01:01.415
Hum?

01:01.415 --> 01:02.207
That’s rude.

01:02.207 --> 01:04.627
Come on, sign it!

01:06.253 --> 01:09.173
You guys, you guys, Aiden—

01:09.173 --> 01:13.886
My teacher said that Lucas 
may not come back to school for a long time.

01:13.886 --> 01:15.888
I felt so bad he was sick.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.943
Aiden, Aiden, can you think about it?

01:34.406 --> 01:37.785
The thing is, I did want to sign the card.

01:40.829 --> 01:44.041
Lucas was one of the nicest people 
in my class.

01:45.668 --> 01:48.087
Maybe I can just sign it.

01:49.463 --> 01:53.092
I mean, it’s not like I’m going
to a birthday party.

01:58.389 --> 02:00.474
Hey, little man. 
How are you doing?

02:01.850 --> 02:02.685
Yeah?

02:02.685 --> 02:04.603
Mom said you had a rough day today.

02:04.603 --> 02:08.232
When Dad came in, 
I told him everything that happened.

02:09.858 --> 02:14.613
I know from the Bible 
that it’s wrong to celebrate birthdays.

02:14.613 --> 02:17.449
But is signing the card really a big deal?

02:19.243 --> 02:21.453
Dad said my question was a good one.

02:22.913 --> 02:24.707
Then he showed me a scripture.

02:24.707 --> 02:25.916
Do you want to get your Bible for me?

02:25.916 --> 02:27.543
Let’s look in Ephesians 5.

02:27.543 --> 02:29.628
Ephesians 5:10:

02:29.628 --> 02:34.633
“Keep on making sure 
of what is acceptable to the Lord.”

02:35.467 --> 02:38.012
He said, 
“We all have to keep making sure

02:38.012 --> 02:40.723
“of what’s acceptable to Jehovah

02:40.723 --> 02:45.394
because Satan is a master at tricking us.”

02:45.394 --> 02:47.646
Then he used the example of Aaron.

02:52.735 --> 02:56.071
The Israelites asked Aaron 
to make them a god.

03:00.701 --> 03:03.287
So Aaron made a golden calf,

03:03.287 --> 03:06.790
thinking that it could represent Jehovah.

03:06.790 --> 03:08.917
He told the people:

03:08.917 --> 03:13.380
“There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.”

03:13.380 --> 03:17.718
But true worship 
was being mixed with false worship,

03:17.718 --> 03:21.180
and Jehovah was not happy.

03:21.180 --> 03:24.183
And many were punished.

03:26.101 --> 03:28.854
That example helped me a lot.

03:30.898 --> 03:34.151
I know birthdays are wrong 
because the Bible teaches

03:34.151 --> 03:36.570
that they are not approved by Jehovah.

03:38.405 --> 03:40.991
But we don’t want to be confused like Aaron

03:40.991 --> 03:43.994
and try to mix true and false worship.

03:43.994 --> 03:45.996
All right, let’s go talk to Mom.

03:45.996 --> 03:48.207
We want to make Jehovah happy.

03:51.126 --> 03:54.213
So Dad said, 
“It’s always good to ask,

03:55.297 --> 03:57.966
How would Jehovah feel if I did this?”

03:57.966 --> 04:01.678
I still didn’t sign the card, 
but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.

04:24.076 --> 04:26.078
Can I go see Lucas?

04:26.078 --> 04:26.954
Yeah. 
Go ahead, Buddy.

04:26.954 --> 04:27.830
He’s right over there.

04:38.257 --> 04:40.050
How have you been feeling?

04:40.050 --> 04:42.052
A little better.

04:42.845 --> 04:45.556
And then I realized something:

04:45.556 --> 04:48.267
Instead of celebrating one day,

04:48.267 --> 04:50.644
I could share with Lucas our hope

04:50.644 --> 04:54.356
of living forever 
on a beautiful paradise earth.

04:54.356 --> 04:57.526
So there will be no sickness ever again.

04:59.111 --> 05:07.726
They will build houses and have food.

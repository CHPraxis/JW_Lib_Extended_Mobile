00:11 Mom, something’s burning.
00:13 Got it!
00:15 Did you brush your teeth yet?
00:16 Ah, Mom.
00:17 No “ah, Mom.”  We’re running late.
00:19 Come on,  go brush your teeth.
00:20 Aiden,  are you dressed?
00:22 Come here, Baby.
00:23 Your shirt is inside out,  Aiden.
00:25 OK.
00:26 Madison, we have to be  out the door in five minutes.
00:34 And your other arm.
00:36 Are we good?
00:37 Uh-huh.
00:38 Let’s go!
00:40 OK.
00:41 Now, one more time,  what did we learn
00:43 from what we read today  in the daily text?
00:45 It was about Asaph,  right?
00:46 Very good.  And?
00:48 We don’t want to envy people  that don’t love Jehovah.
00:51 Very good.
00:52 So question,  when kids at school do things
00:56 that look like fun but we know  that Jehovah doesn’t like,
00:59 what should we do?
01:01 Pray.
01:02 Perfect.  You’re so smart!
01:03 OK, come on.  Let’s go to the train.
01:10 There are  five more rooms to clean.
01:11 The ones that are circled.
01:12 Oh, OK.  All right, thanks.
01:14 Sure.
01:36 Hey, Heather.
01:37 Hey, Simmone, I just made some tea.  Would you like some?
01:39 Yes, thank you.
01:41 Sure.
01:44 How’s your day going?
01:45 Good.
01:46 Good.
01:46 Did you see Laura’s pictures?
01:47 No.  Pictures of what?
01:49 Her vacation.  It looks so nice!
01:51 That’s great.
01:52 Oh, did I tell you?  I’m going away too.
01:54 Where are you going?
01:55 My boyfriend bought me  an all-inclusive vacation package.
01:57 An island retreat sounds  really great right now.
02:00 Yeah. Are you going anywhere,  taking any trips?
02:02 No, you know, with the kids,  I can’t really afford to do much.
02:05 Sorry, just excuse me.
02:06 Yeah, sure.
02:10 Sometimes,  I just feel so trapped.
02:14 I know I need  to keep my life simple
02:16 and stay focused  on spiritual things,
02:20 but it just seems like
02:22 I’m constantly seeing others around me
02:25 being rewarded with nice things,
02:28 and I just feel forgotten.
02:31 Hmm,
02:33 when we discussed  the text this morning on envy,
02:36 I never thought  I’d be applying it to myself.
02:39 “For I became envious
02:42 . . . when I would see  the peace of the wicked.”
02:46 What did Aiden say Asaph did
02:49 to overcome his envy?
02:51 “But as for me,  drawing near to God is good for me.
02:56 I have made  the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge.”
03:00 That’s right.
03:02 He prayed.
03:03 And that’s exactly  what I need to do.
03:20 “Since even the most loyal  and devoted Christians are imperfect,
03:24 “when an appointed servant  makes a mistake,
03:26 “let us continue to do  ‘all things free from murmurings.’
03:29 (Philippians 2:14)”
03:31 Due to unforeseen  track maintenance,
03:32 there will be delays  on trains 5, 6, and 7.
03:35 All uptown stops can expect
30- to 35-minute delays.
03:38 Does that mean  we’re going to be late?
03:40 Yes.  Yes, we are.
03:42 Finish that.
03:51 I really appreciate
03:53 the scripture  because it helps us to guard
03:55 against the spirit of the world.
03:57 And how might  these scriptures help us
04:00 in choosing our entertainment?
04:03 Sister Edwards?
04:09 Vampires,  werewolves, witches
04:12 are all associated  with the spirit world,
04:15 so if our entertainment  involves any of these,
04:18 we might meditate  on Psalm 97:10 and ask ourselves,
04:22 ‘Do I really hate what Jehovah hates?’
04:28 Sister Thorne.
04:31 And let’s hear  from young Sister Winkler.
04:35 Any other thoughts  before we move on?
04:38 Ah, Sister Perez.
04:43 Excuse me.
04:45 Hey, Simmone,  how are you doing?
04:46 Good.  How are you, Mattias?
04:47 Good.
04:48 You know, we have  the congregation cleaning tonight.
04:50 Any chance you might be able  to take care of the bathrooms?
04:52 Uh.
04:54 Sure, Mattias,  there’s nothing I’d love to do more.
04:58 It’s not like I don’t do enough  of this all day, every day.
05:02 Oh, and did I mention  how much I appreciate
05:04 all the brothers  not calling on me tonight?
05:07 Oh, Honey. I’m so sorry.
05:10 Mommy didn’t mean that.
05:12 It’s OK, Mom.
05:13 I know you’re tired.
05:14 That’s no excuse.
05:16 Here, let’s go sit together.
05:21 I was just frustrated;  I never should have said that.
05:25 You know, on the train,  I was actually listening
05:28 to an article about not murmuring  against the elders,
05:30 even if they make mistakes.
05:32 I guess I should’ve meditated  on that a little more.
05:36 Hmm.
05:37 Madison,  I want you to know
05:40 that our elders  work very, very hard.
05:43 Do you remember last week
05:44 when they came  for that shepherding visit?
05:46 Yeah, Mattias and his wife  brought groceries the next day.
05:50 That’s right,  they brought us groceries.
05:53 The elders care about us so much,
05:56 and they truly deserve our respect.
05:58 I never should have said that.
06:00 You understand?
06:02 I understand.
06:03 OK, good girl.
06:04 All right,  you know what,
06:05 why don’t we finish up  the mirrors together?
06:07 Sound good?
06:08 All right.
06:09 OK.
06:12 I’ll get it for you.
06:35 Love you, Baby.  Have a good night.
06:37 Good night.
06:40 See you in the morning.
07:06 There’s nothing on.
07:09 Wait!
07:10 This is the show everyone  at work has been talking about.
07:14 It’s supposed to be great,
07:20 but it looks really spiritistic.
07:25 Vampires,  werewolves, witches
07:28 are all associated  with the spirit world,
07:30 so if our entertainment  involves any of these,
07:34 we might meditate  on Psalm 97:10 and ask ourselves,
07:38 ‘Do I really hate what Jehovah hates?’
07:41 Hmm.
07:43 It doesn’t look that bad,
07:46 but I know Jehovah  hates spiritism,
07:49 and I want to hate  what Jehovah hates.
07:52 That verse also says,
07:54 ‘Jehovah will guard his loyal ones.’
07:57 I want to show him that I’m
08:00 one of “his loyal ones.”

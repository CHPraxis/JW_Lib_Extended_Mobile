00:02 Darren,  could you read Psalm 116:12?
00:07 It says:  “With what will I repay Jehovah
00:10 for all the good  he has done for me?”
00:12 How can Psalm 116:12
00:15 give us courage right now?
00:19 Elaine.
00:21 Well, Jehovah has always  done well for us in the past,
00:24 so we can trust he’ll do the same  for us now and in the future.
00:28 Thank you.
00:30 Josh.
00:32 That’s so true
00:34 that he has always done  good things for us.
00:37 But from what I’ve seen,  what really makes a difference
00:40 is how we respond  to that goodness.
00:43 For some  in the congregation,
00:45 those good things  became a test of their loyalty.
00:49 . . . continue with our meeting.
00:51 We have a letter to read.
00:53 “To all congregations  of Jehovah’s Witnesses:
00:56 “Dear Brothers and Sisters,
00:58 If we are to have Jehovah’s favor  and blessing as individuals, . . . ”
01:01 They found fault
01:03 with what the organization  was doing or not doing.
01:07 “. . .  as we work together  with you shoulder to shoulder.
01:09 Your brothers,  The Christian . . . ”
01:17 Now, paragraph 12  gives more detail
01:19 on our adjusted understanding  of this exciting account.
01:22 Let’s read it.
01:23 Brother Perez,  please read paragraph 12 for us.
01:26 “Soon . . . ”
01:27 They criticized any teaching  or arrangement they didn’t agree with.
01:31 And whether  they realized it or not,
01:34 their critical attitude
01:36 was eroding their own loyalty,
01:39 and it was affecting others.
01:42 Now, before we ask the question  for that paragraph,
01:45 who would like to read  Psalm 116:12?
01:49 Kyle, please.
01:51 Eventually,
01:54 some were  no longer our brothers.
01:57 But the more grateful  our family was
01:59 for what Jehovah gave us,
02:01 the stronger our attachment  to him became.
02:16 So I’ve learned  to have appreciation for everything,
02:21 everything Jehovah  has done for us
02:24 and for his organization.
02:28 It’s helped us all  make it to this point,
02:30 and I’m sure  it will help us stay loyal
02:32 through the rest  of the great tribulation.
02:46 I know that look.
02:48 You have an experience,  don’t you?
02:52 I do,  but it’s. . .
02:54 It can’t be anything  I don’t already know!
02:56 Well, it’s not exactly  on my list of things
02:59 to share  with my little brother.
03:01 There’s no pressure,  Elaine.
03:03 Only tell it if you want to.
03:06 It’s OK.
03:09 For me,
03:12 I struggled  with negative thinking.
03:14 No way!
03:16 Yeah.
03:19 But I had  a good friend
03:21 who always helped  and listened
03:24 and helped me  learn how to fight it,
03:26 and I’ll always  be grateful.
03:29 I would pray,
03:31 but at times the feelings  were so strong,
03:35 I didn’t know what to do.
03:40 I know.  I know.
03:42 That must be  so hard for you.
03:45 Will I ever stop  feeling like this?
03:47 Don’t worry  about if it’s going to stop.
03:50 Let’s talk about ways  you can take control
03:53 when it happens.
03:54 Take control?
03:56 Uh-huh.
03:57 You know, the Scriptures  tell us as Christians
04:00 that we pray  for self-control in our actions.
04:04 But do you know, we need  that same self-control
04:07 for our thoughts?
04:08 I never thought about it  that way before.
04:10 Uh-huh.
04:12 The Scriptures tell us how.
04:14 Can we read one together?
04:15 Yeah.  I’d really like that.
04:17 It’s in 2 Corinthians chapter 10,
04:20 in verse number 5.
04:23 You’re going  to like this scripture,
04:25 chapter 10 and verse 5.
04:27 Do you feel like reading it?
04:29 OK.
04:31 “For we are overturning
04:34 “reasonings  and every lofty thing
04:39 “raised up  against the knowledge of God,
04:43 “and we are bringing  every thought into captivity
04:46 to make it  obedient to the Christ.”
04:49 Karen showed me  what it meant
04:51 to bring my negative thoughts  into captivity
04:54 and then make them  obedient to the Christ.
04:57 I had to know  what my negative thoughts were,
04:59 all of them,  and write them down.
05:03 And for each one,
05:05 find what Jehovah thinks,
05:07 and then find scriptures
05:09 that I could remember each time  that negative thought returned.
05:13 I kept that list with me  at all times.
05:17 It was a slow process,
05:20 but with Jehovah’s help,  and with Karen’s,
05:24 I’ve learned how to fight  the battle against negative thoughts.
05:28 Elaine, that was  so brave of you to share.
05:32 Well, just listening  to everyone else’s stories about loyalty,
05:37 it made me think  about what I needed to do to stay loyal.
05:42 Now, Elaine,  if you don’t mind me asking,
05:44 how did you see  that as a test of loyalty?
05:46 Well,  one scripture I memorized,
05:49 1 Corinthians 9:25, says:
05:51 “Now everyone  competing in a contest
05:54 exercises self-control  in all things.”
05:57 So if Jehovah is telling me
05:59 I need to exercise self-control  in all things,
06:02 even my thinking,
06:04 then I’m loyal  to Jehovah when I try.
06:06 Elaine, you are to be commended  for what you did
06:10 and for seeing the need. . .
06:24 Hey.
06:25 Shelly!
06:27 Hey.
06:31 Shelly!
06:32 Hey.
06:37 I’m so glad  you guys made it safely.
06:40 It’s getting bad  out there now.
06:42 Chris, were you able  to check on all of the other groups?
06:45 Yes, Brother Brown.
06:46 I took a count of each group.
06:49 Thank you.
06:53 So you’ve been visiting  each group,
06:55 even with all  that’s going on out there?
06:57 Yes, but there have been  some scary moments.
07:00 Still, we’re going to shepherd
07:01 all the groups  for as long as we still can.
07:06 The brothers really appreciate  you making the sacrifice to do this,
07:10 and you too, Shelly,  for supporting Chris.
07:18 Is everybody OK?
07:20 Everyone’s fine.
07:21 They’re getting used  to doing without,
07:24 some for the first time.
07:25 You and Shelly set a good example  for keeping your life simple.
07:29 Thanks, but honestly,
07:32 that wasn’t always the case.
07:34 What do you mean?
07:36 Well, one day,
07:39 we were watching  the video We Live a Simple Life,
07:43 and it really helped us  to take a good look at our lives.
07:48 We were both pioneering  but still living a comfortable life.
08:00 And we started wondering.
08:02 Our love for Jehovah  moved us to pioneer,
08:06 but could it move us  to take the next step?
08:11 After meditating  and praying about it,
08:14 the answer  became obvious.
08:16 We sold our house,
08:18 found a little apartment  in the territory,
08:21 took some time to adjust,
08:24 but what it did  for our relationship with Jehovah
08:28 was so worth it.
08:31 With nothing to tie us down,
08:33 we were blessed to go  to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
08:37 and then  that’s when you all met us.
08:42 I remember  when you guys moved here,
08:44 everything you owned  fit into your car and trailer.
08:47 Yeah.
08:53 How much longer  will this keep up?
08:56 Chris, please say  another prayer for us.
08:58 Then I think we should look  at some more scriptures
09:00 that will help us.
09:14 Do you see anything?
09:16 Do you see any Witnesses?
09:19 Where are they?
09:22 Psalm 27  is really going to help us:
09:28 “Jehovah is my light  and my salvation.
09:30 “Whom should I fear?
09:32 “Jehovah is the stronghold  of my life.
09:36 “Whom should I dread?
09:37 “When evil men attacked me  to devour my flesh,
09:40 “my adversaries and my enemies
09:42 “were the ones  who stumbled and fell.
09:45 “Though an army  should set up camp against me,
09:48 “my heart will not fear.
09:50 “Though war  should break out against me,
09:53 “even then  I will remain confident.
09:57 “One thing I have asked  from Jehovah . . .
09:59 “Where would I be  if I did not have faith
10:02 “that I would see Jehovah’s goodness  in the land of the living?
10:05 “Hope in Jehovah;
10:07 “be courageous and strong of heart.
10:10 “Yes,
10:11 hope in Jehovah.”
10:13 Thank you,  Brother Brown.
10:15 That psalm is  very faith-strengthening.
10:17 It is, Chris.
10:19 Especially the question  at verse 13:
10:21 “Where would I be  if I did not have faith?”
10:25 I think all of us can identify  with that question.
10:28 Absolutely!
10:30 Without faith,  none of us would be here.
10:32 All of us here
10:34 and all of our brothers everywhere
10:37 at this hour,
10:40 we can all feel good  that we’ve worked hard
10:42 to build faith  in Jehovah’s promises.
10:46 We’ve all resisted temptations
10:50 to serve God halfheartedly,
10:53 with a date in mind  or for some selfish reason.
10:59 Instead of just going  through the motions
11:02 of being a disciple,
11:04 our faith is real.
11:06 It’s genuine.
11:08 Paul called that faith,  “faith without hypocrisy.”
11:13 And to have seen you build  that kind of faith
11:19 just warms my heart.
11:21 You studied God’s Word
11:25 to better understand his ways
11:27 and his promises.
11:30 That has made your faith strong today.
11:33 You reasoned
11:35 on Jehovah’s past dealings with you,
11:38 and that has given you strength
11:40 to remain loyal under test.
11:44 And your faith
11:46 has led you here
11:48 as loyal servants of Jehovah,
11:52 confident that Psalm 97:10
11:56 applies to you personally:
11:59 “[Jehovah] is guarding  the lives of his loyal ones.”
12:14 Where are they?
12:18 Check the basement!
12:25 Check that door!

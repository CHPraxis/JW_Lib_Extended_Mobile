00:01.855 --> 00:05.025
Seriously? 
You’re going?


00:05.025 --> 00:07.193
Come on, Nadia. 
It’s just a party. 


00:07.193 --> 00:08.611
It’ll be fun!


00:08.612 --> 00:10.655
I don’t know, Phoebe.


00:10.655 --> 00:12.825
Look, I’ve been 
at Jessica’s parties before. 


00:12.825 --> 00:14.535
It was totally fine.


00:14.535 --> 00:16.703
Shh!


00:16.703 --> 00:18.955
Wait, you’ve been 
to her house before?


00:18.955 --> 00:21.792
Yeah, for another party. 
It was great. 


00:21.792 --> 00:23.835
Nothing bad happened. 


00:23.835 --> 00:27.172
And guess who’s going 
to be there?


00:27.172 --> 00:27.965
Who?


00:27.965 --> 00:29.048
Hey, Nadia.


00:29.048 --> 00:30.675
Hey, Jonah.


00:30.675 --> 00:31.635
Hmm, 


00:31.635 --> 00:33.887
come for a little bit, 
and if you feel uncomfortable, 


00:33.887 --> 00:35.000
you can leave.


00:36.015 --> 00:38.017
Even if I said yes, 


00:38.017 --> 00:40.185
my parents 
would never go for it.


00:40.185 --> 00:42.228
They don’t have to know. 
Just sneak out. 


00:42.228 --> 00:44.315
That’s what I do. 
So how about it? 


00:44.315 --> 00:46.817
Have a little fun!


00:46.817 --> 00:50.000
. . . how 1 Timothy 2:14 
describes Adam: 


00:52.322 --> 00:56.494
“Also, Adam was not deceived, 


00:56.493 --> 01:00.746
“but the woman 
was thoroughly deceived 


01:00.747 --> 01:03.000
and became a transgressor.”


01:05.002 --> 01:07.755
Adam just accepted Eve’s offer. 


01:07.755 --> 01:10.715
He didn’t think it through.


01:10.715 --> 01:13.000
If I go to this party, what could happen?


01:19.223 --> 01:22.101
Hey, Nadia.


01:22.102 --> 01:24.855
I can’t go to this party. 


01:24.855 --> 01:28.483
The scripture says 
that Adam wasn’t deceived, 


01:28.483 --> 01:31.278
but Eve was. 


01:31.278 --> 01:35.281
Adam didn’t even try 
to help readjust Eve’s thinking.


01:35.282 --> 01:37.702
So excited!


01:37.702 --> 01:40.662
It’s not enough for me to not go. 


01:40.662 --> 01:42.665
I need to talk to Phoebe 


01:42.665 --> 01:46.000
and help her see 
why she shouldn’t go either.


01:50.880 --> 01:53.217
I know you’re disappointed. 


01:53.217 --> 01:55.260
I’m sure the elders 
must have their reasons.


01:55.260 --> 01:57.512
I’m sure they do.


01:57.512 --> 01:59.515
What does that mean?


01:59.515 --> 02:01.000
Nothing. 
Just forget it, OK?


02:08.023 --> 02:09.231
Carl? 


02:09.232 --> 02:12.820
Why would the elders 
decide that about your case? 


02:12.820 --> 02:15.322
It doesn’t make any sense! 


02:15.322 --> 02:18.000
Not that I’m surprised. 


02:21.703 --> 02:24.205
Uh, sure, I’ll see you tomorrow, 


02:24.205 --> 02:27.877
and we’ll sort this thing out together. 


02:27.877 --> 02:30.000
Don’t worry. 
I’ll help you fix this.


02:35.592 --> 02:39.000
If I were an elder, 
I would never treat people like this. 


02:44.308 --> 02:47.000
What were they thinking?


02:48.105 --> 02:51.400
“. . . and 50 men to run before him.”


02:51.400 --> 02:54.000
What was Absalom thinking? 


02:55.112 --> 02:58.000
Wait. 
What am I thinking? 


03:00.783 --> 03:03.953
Absalom turned people away from the king, 


03:03.953 --> 03:06.123
telling them he was more just, 


03:06.123 --> 03:09.166
more understanding. 


03:09.167 --> 03:12.964
If I take sides with Carl tomorrow, 
what could happen?


03:12.963 --> 03:15.965
They don’t even belong! 
They call themselves Christians and elders?


03:15.965 --> 03:17.175
And they want to control everybody!


03:17.175 --> 03:18.177
. . . what’s wrong with the elders too.


03:18.177 --> 03:19.010
They need to be out.


03:19.010 --> 03:19.553
Really?


03:19.553 --> 03:20.386
...because they’re always being judgemental.


03:20.387 --> 03:22.347
Why would they do that? 
Why?


03:22.347 --> 03:25.017
Oh, my goodness!


03:25.017 --> 03:27.102
I don’t know all the facts. 


03:27.102 --> 03:30.605
And even if I did, it doesn’t matter. 


03:30.605 --> 03:32.607
I can’t let my pride 


03:32.607 --> 03:35.735
get in the way of my loyalty to Jehovah. 


03:35.735 --> 03:38.738
Absalom could have avoided 
all those bad things 


03:38.738 --> 03:41.075
if he only stayed content. 


03:41.075 --> 03:43.743
I need to ask Jehovah’s help 


03:43.743 --> 03:46.496
to root out those bad things in my heart 


03:46.497 --> 03:49.000
so I can stay content.


03:52.377 --> 03:56.047
Brother Elliott, my ex-husband 
won’t stop calling me. 


03:56.047 --> 03:58.967
And every time he does call, 


03:58.967 --> 04:01.000
he just brings up 
all of these emotions . . .


04:02.387 --> 04:04.389
You got a text message, Honey.


04:04.388 --> 04:06.141
Oh, can you see who it’s from?


04:06.142 --> 04:08.644
Yeah. 
It’s Kaitlin. 


04:08.643 --> 04:11.563
She’s just thanking you 
for listening to her today. 


04:11.563 --> 04:13.731
She seems to be talking 
with you a lot lately. 


04:13.732 --> 04:14.984
Is everything OK?


04:14.983 --> 04:17.068
Oh, yeah. 
She’s just going through some issues. 


04:17.068 --> 04:21.240
Being newly baptized and all, 
she likes to bounce things off the elders.


04:21.240 --> 04:24.535
But does it 
always have to be with you?


04:24.535 --> 04:26.620
Of course not, 


04:26.620 --> 04:29.000
for some reason she 
feels comfortable talking to me.


04:32.375 --> 04:35.170
Have I ever given you any reason 
to be concerned over the way 


04:35.170 --> 04:37.088
I shepherd sisters?


04:37.088 --> 04:38.840
No, never.


04:38.840 --> 04:40.217
So don’t worry. 


04:40.217 --> 04:44.805
I’m just giving her time to get familiar 
with the other elders on the body.


04:44.805 --> 04:45.888
OK, 


04:45.888 --> 04:47.473
I’m going to get ready for bed.


04:47.473 --> 04:49.726
OK, I’m going to stay up for a bit 
and work on my talk.


04:49.727 --> 04:50.000
OK.


04:52.437 --> 04:55.982
Avoiding the trap of overconfidence. 


04:55.982 --> 04:58.902
Solomon had served Jehovah his whole life, 


04:58.902 --> 05:02.447
but with time, 
he started relying on his own thinking. 


05:02.447 --> 05:05.284
It’s Kaitlin again. 


05:05.283 --> 05:07.285
“Can you talk?” 


05:07.285 --> 05:09.287
Sure I can. 


05:09.287 --> 05:10.789
Wait a minute. 


05:10.788 --> 05:14.000
I do want to help Kaitlin, 
but if I’m not careful . . .


05:23.052 --> 05:25.345
How did I not see this? 


05:25.345 --> 05:27.513
I guess I just thought . . .


05:27.513 --> 05:30.100
and that’s the problem: 


05:30.100 --> 05:33.000
relying on my own thinking.


05:39.067 --> 05:41.069
Hey, Mike, it’s Terrance. 


05:41.068 --> 05:45.948
Sorry to call you so late, 
but Kaitlin just texted. 


05:45.948 --> 05:47.283
Yeah. 


05:47.283 --> 05:49.786
She’s been having a rough time lately. 


05:49.787 --> 05:52.747
Do you think you and I 
can have a conference call with her 


05:52.747 --> 05:55.834
and plan a shepherding visit? 


05:55.833 --> 05:58.000
Great. 
Thanks a lot.


06:01.840 --> 06:03.758
Sweet!


06:03.758 --> 06:05.760
Yeah, it’s fresh, ain’t it? 


06:05.760 --> 06:08.347
I can make calls. 
I can send texts. 


06:08.347 --> 06:11.099
I can do anything, all from right here.


06:11.098 --> 06:14.101
Whoa! Cool! 
But how did you get the money? 


06:14.102 --> 06:17.397
You know, last time I checked, 
you didn’t have a job.


06:17.397 --> 06:19.650
There are other ways 
of making money, Son.


06:19.650 --> 06:20.817
Like what?


06:20.817 --> 06:22.235
Like online betting.


06:22.235 --> 06:24.278
What? 
You serious?


06:24.278 --> 06:26.281
Yeah, I’m serious. 


06:26.282 --> 06:28.284
I bet on sports teams. 


06:28.283 --> 06:30.535
It’s easy. 
It’s instant money, 


06:30.535 --> 06:32.828
but best of all—private. 


06:32.828 --> 06:35.000
No one ever has to know.


06:44.883 --> 06:46.000
Here’s the link.


06:47.093 --> 06:49.345
I wasn’t even thinking about this stuff 


06:49.345 --> 06:51.682
until I saw Julian’s new watch. 


06:51.682 --> 06:54.000
Now it’s all I think about. 


06:55.560 --> 06:58.000
Let me check something first.


06:59.690 --> 07:01.858
Gambling. 


07:01.858 --> 07:04.151
Gambling is a form of greed? 


07:04.152 --> 07:05.654
Whoa! 


07:05.653 --> 07:07.000
Judas Iscariot? 


07:08.782 --> 07:11.952
Started off good, gave in to greed, 


07:11.952 --> 07:13.954
consumed him, 


07:13.953 --> 07:16.623
betrayed Jesus. 


07:16.623 --> 07:20.000
If I sign up for online gambling, 
what could happen?


07:22.753 --> 07:24.000
Yes!


07:26.925 --> 07:28.760
“Flee from these things. 


07:28.760 --> 07:31.000
But pursue righteousness, 
godly devotion . . .”


07:37.477 --> 07:39.479
If I sign up for this, 


07:39.478 --> 07:41.773
I could lose a lot of money, 


07:41.773 --> 07:43.858
or worse yet, 


07:43.858 --> 07:46.276
I could win, and the love of money 


07:46.277 --> 07:48.322
could easily consume me, 


07:48.322 --> 07:50.324
like it did Judas. 


07:50.323 --> 07:52.616
I could fall right out of the truth! 


07:52.617 --> 07:55.745
Judas could have sought help from others. 


07:55.745 --> 08:05.318
I’m going to talk to my parents 
about this whole thing.

00:07.443 --> 00:10.821
But John, there’s still plenty 


00:10.822 --> 00:12.825
you can do 
in the congregation. 


00:12.825 --> 00:15.870
Sure, that sounds good. 


00:15.870 --> 00:18.997
But I’m no longer 
a ministerial servant. 


00:18.997 --> 00:23.544
Why did I let my zeal 
for the ministry cool off? 


00:23.543 --> 00:26.000
I know what the brothers 
must think of me now.


00:29.550 --> 00:31.968
Hello?


00:31.968 --> 00:33.636
Oh, good morning. 
My name is Jane. 


00:33.637 --> 00:34.639
How are you?


00:34.638 --> 00:36.015
Not bad, thanks.


00:36.015 --> 00:38.600
I know you may not be interested, 


00:38.600 --> 00:40.810
but I have this tract 
I’d like to leave with you . . .


00:40.810 --> 00:42.563
“You may not be interested?” 


00:42.563 --> 00:44.000
Where did that come from? 


00:46.358 --> 00:49.068
Not my best presentation, 


00:49.068 --> 00:54.408
but it didn’t seem like she wanted 
to talk more anyway.


00:54.408 --> 00:57.995
Well, what does that mean?


00:57.995 --> 00:59.330
It may be manageable, 


00:59.330 --> 01:01.832
but long term, 
given your other conditions, 


01:01.832 --> 01:02.834
you’re looking at possibly 
some further tests . . .


01:02.833 --> 01:04.293
Manageable? 


01:04.293 --> 01:06.295
Long term? 


01:06.295 --> 01:10.000
Oh, Jehovah, 
how can I do this by myself?


01:29.067 --> 01:31.987
Of course Jehovah values you. 


01:31.987 --> 01:34.615
Try to think of someone in the Bible 


01:34.615 --> 01:38.327
who may have felt like you do, 
like Jonah.


01:38.327 --> 01:40.329
Jonah? 


01:40.328 --> 01:44.000
Felt like I do?


01:51.673 --> 01:55.385
“What comes to your mind
when you think of Jonah?


01:55.385 --> 02:00.000
Do you think of him 
as a disobedient prophet?”


02:10.733 --> 02:13.570
“Reluctant to obey Jehovah’s command, 


02:13.570 --> 02:17.115
“Jonah boarded a ship that carried him 


02:17.115 --> 02:21.000
farther and farther away 
from his assignment.”


02:31.630 --> 02:33.715
“Did Jonah’s recent actions 


02:33.715 --> 02:37.720
“disqualify him 
from ever again serving God 


02:37.720 --> 02:40.000
in an official capacity?” 


02:43.683 --> 02:46.311
He sure could have thought so. 


02:46.312 --> 02:49.000
I know I do.


02:50.815 --> 02:52.233
“No, 


02:52.233 --> 02:54.945
“Jehovah mercifully and lovingly 


02:54.945 --> 02:57.000
renewed the prophet’s commission.”


03:13.463 --> 03:17.216
So if Jehovah didn’t see Jonah 
as a total failure, 


03:17.217 --> 03:21.000
then what must he think of me? 


03:23.557 --> 03:26.977
First Samuel 16:7: 


03:26.977 --> 03:29.689
“For the way man sees 


03:29.688 --> 03:32.000
is not the way God sees.”


03:33.483 --> 03:38.000
“Jonah did not see Nineveh 
as Jehovah did.”


04:01.762 --> 04:03.514
Well,


04:03.513 --> 04:04.931
with all that they were doing, 


04:04.932 --> 04:06.000
how could he view them any differently? 


04:08.685 --> 04:10.312
But the account says: 


04:10.312 --> 04:13.524
‘When God saw they had turned back 
from their evil ways, 


04:13.523 --> 04:15.775
‘he reconsidered the calamity, 


04:15.775 --> 04:18.000
and he did not bring it.’ 


04:19.403 --> 04:21.990
“Despite the people’s badness, 


04:21.990 --> 04:24.325
“Jehovah cared about them. 


04:24.325 --> 04:26.745
“He values human life 


04:26.745 --> 04:29.540
“and the potential 
that each individual has 


04:29.540 --> 04:33.000
for repenting and learning 
to do what is right.”


04:34.462 --> 04:37.297
Well, of course that’s true. 


04:37.297 --> 04:40.000
Why didn’t Jonah see that? 


04:42.135 --> 04:46.000
But am I seeing people
the way Jehovah does?


04:47.348 --> 04:49.560
Am I assuming they won’t listen 


04:49.560 --> 04:51.000
and then not giving my best? 


04:53.355 --> 04:56.000
How can I know 
how a person will respond? 


04:58.985 --> 05:02.405
‘Jonah learned to be merciful. 


05:02.405 --> 05:05.000
Will we?’


05:09.203 --> 05:12.206
Matthew 5:7 says: 


05:12.207 --> 05:14.544
“Happy are the merciful, 


05:14.543 --> 05:18.000
since they will be shown mercy.”


05:20.798 --> 05:23.968
“Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God 


05:23.968 --> 05:26.000
“from the belly of the fish, and he said: 


05:28.182 --> 05:30.225
“‘Out of my distress 


05:30.225 --> 05:32.268
“‘I called out to Jehovah, 


05:32.268 --> 05:34.478
“‘and he answered me. 


05:34.478 --> 05:38.608
“‘Out of the depths of the Grave 
I cried for help. 


05:38.608 --> 05:42.000
You heard my voice.’”


05:44.532 --> 05:48.000
God heard Jonah and delivered him. 


05:49.118 --> 05:52.000
But I can’t expect a miracle.


05:56.502 --> 06:00.000
“Then my prayer came in to you, 
into your holy temple.” 


06:02.257 --> 06:04.594
“My prayer.”


06:04.593 --> 06:07.000
“My prayer came in to you.” 


06:08.388 --> 06:10.390
Jonah didn’t know 


06:10.390 --> 06:12.433
if Jehovah would rescue him, 


06:12.433 --> 06:15.000
but he prayed in faith 
that Jehovah cared.


06:17.022 --> 06:19.024
“But as for me, 


06:19.023 --> 06:21.066
“with the voice of thanksgiving 


06:21.067 --> 06:23.904
“I will sacrifice to you. 


06:23.903 --> 06:27.198
“What I have vowed, I will pay. 


06:27.198 --> 06:31.000
Salvation is from Jehovah.”


06:37.250 --> 06:40.212
As long as I still can, 


06:40.212 --> 06:43.000
I’ll keep sacrificing to God. 


06:47.052 --> 07:03.715
Salvation is from Jehovah!

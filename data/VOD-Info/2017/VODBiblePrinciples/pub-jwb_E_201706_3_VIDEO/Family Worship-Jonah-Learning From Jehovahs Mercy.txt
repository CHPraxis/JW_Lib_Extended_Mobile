00:07 But John, there’s still plenty
00:10 you can do  in the congregation.
00:12 Sure, that sounds good.
00:15 But I’m no longer  a ministerial servant.
00:18 Why did I let my zeal  for the ministry cool off?
00:23 I know what the brothers  must think of me now.
00:29 Hello?
00:31 Oh, good morning.  My name is Jane.
00:33 How are you?
00:34 Not bad, thanks.
00:36 I know you may not be interested,
00:38 but I have this tract  I’d like to leave with you . . .
00:40 “You may not be interested?”
00:42 Where did that come from?
00:46 Not my best presentation,
00:49 but it didn’t seem like she wanted  to talk more anyway.
00:54 Well, what does that mean?
00:57 It may be manageable,
00:59 but long term,  given your other conditions,
01:01 you’re looking at possibly  some further tests . . .
01:02 Manageable?
01:04 Long term?
01:06 Oh, Jehovah,  how can I do this by myself?
01:29 Of course Jehovah values you.
01:31 Try to think of someone in the Bible
01:34 who may have felt like you do,  like Jonah.
01:38 Jonah?
01:40 Felt like I do?
01:51 “What comes to your mind when you think of Jonah?
01:55 Do you think of him  as a disobedient prophet?”
02:10 “Reluctant to obey Jehovah’s command,
02:13 “Jonah boarded a ship that carried him
02:17 farther and farther away  from his assignment.”
02:31 “Did Jonah’s recent actions
02:33 “disqualify him  from ever again serving God
02:37 in an official capacity?”
02:43 He sure could have thought so.
02:46 I know I do.
02:50 “No,
02:52 “Jehovah mercifully and lovingly
02:54 renewed the prophet’s commission.”
03:13 So if Jehovah didn’t see Jonah  as a total failure,
03:17 then what must he think of me?
03:23 First Samuel 16:7:
03:26 “For the way man sees
03:29 is not the way God sees.”
03:33 “Jonah did not see Nineveh  as Jehovah did.”
04:01 Well,
04:03 with all that they were doing,
04:04 how could he view them any differently?
04:08 But the account says:
04:10 ‘When God saw they had turned back  from their evil ways,
04:13 ‘he reconsidered the calamity,
04:15 and he did not bring it.’
04:19 “Despite the people’s badness,
04:21 “Jehovah cared about them.
04:24 “He values human life
04:26 “and the potential  that each individual has
04:29 for repenting and learning  to do what is right.”
04:34 Well, of course that’s true.
04:37 Why didn’t Jonah see that?
04:42 But am I seeing people the way Jehovah does?
04:47 Am I assuming they won’t listen
04:49 and then not giving my best?
04:53 How can I know  how a person will respond?
04:58 ‘Jonah learned to be merciful.
05:02 Will we?’
05:09 Matthew 5:7 says:
05:12 “Happy are the merciful,
05:14 since they will be shown mercy.”
05:20 “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God
05:23 “from the belly of the fish, and he said:
05:28 “‘Out of my distress
05:30 “‘I called out to Jehovah,
05:32 “‘and he answered me.
05:34 “‘Out of the depths of the Grave  I cried for help.
05:38 You heard my voice.’”
05:44 God heard Jonah and delivered him.
05:49 But I can’t expect a miracle.
05:56 “Then my prayer came in to you,  into your holy temple.”
06:02 “My prayer.”
06:04 “My prayer came in to you.”
06:08 Jonah didn’t know
06:10 if Jehovah would rescue him,
06:12 but he prayed in faith  that Jehovah cared.
06:17 “But as for me,
06:19 “with the voice of thanksgiving
06:21 “I will sacrifice to you.
06:23 “What I have vowed, I will pay.
06:27 Salvation is from Jehovah.”
06:37 As long as I still can,
06:40 I’ll keep sacrificing to God.
06:47 Salvation is from Jehovah!

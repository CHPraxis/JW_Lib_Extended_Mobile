00:01 What an experience!
00:03 That’s why loyalty to Jehovah  has been so important.
00:06 That is so true, Brother Brown.  How about you?
00:09 Has your loyalty ever been tested?
00:12 Oh, yeah, I remember.
00:14 It was years ago,
00:16 and an elder came to give me counsel  after a talk,
00:19 and let’s just say  I was not expecting  . . .
00:22 You were really quiet the whole way home.
00:24 Is everything all right?
00:26 Yeah, I’m fine.
00:27 What is on your mind?
00:29 I can’t believe the nerve that Ben has.
00:31 Ben?
00:32 Yeah, Ben.
00:33 He gave me counsel about that talk  that I gave last week.
00:37 Really?  What did he say?
00:38 I don’t know.
00:39 Something like
00:41 I didn’t use enough scriptures.
00:44 Whatever.
00:45 I mean, it was hard to listen to.
00:49 You know, I’ve been an elder  longer than he has,
00:53 and he comes up to me  and gives me counsel
00:55 about my teaching!
00:57 Please tell me you didn’t argue with him.
00:59 No, of course not.
01:03 But it wasn’t easy.
01:05 I thanked him and said something like,
01:09 ‘I’ll give it careful thought,
01:11 and apply what you said.’
01:14 So you did the right thing.
01:20 Yes, but did I really?
01:23 I took the counsel,  but I don’t like my attitude.
01:27 I let pride get in the way  of another elder giving me counsel
01:31 just because I’ve been an elder longer.
01:33 So, what are you going to do about it?
01:40 Pray, I mean, that’s what I should do.
01:42 And then
01:44 go to Ben and ask him to explain
01:48 what I didn’t give him a chance to explain.
01:51 Wow!
01:52 Brother Brown, I can’t picture  you reacting that way to counsel.
01:56 Let alone getting counsel!
01:57 That was the problem; neither could I.
02:01 If I was going to remain loyal to Jehovah,
02:04 I needed an attitude adjustment.
02:06 So, what did you do?
02:08 I prayed,
02:11 and I asked if I could really conduct myself  as a lesser one.
02:15 I went back to Ben
02:17 and asked him to give me the counsel  that he had prepared for me.
02:21 I volunteered for assignments  that I hadn’t done for a while.
02:24 You know, things that we do  that go unnoticed.
02:27 And little by little,
02:29 my attitude improved.
02:32 After that, I felt closer to Jehovah.
02:35 Seeing the need for more humility,
02:38 well, was humbling.
02:41 I never realized, but it seems like everyone  has had lessons to learn along the way.
02:45 Believe me, I am still learning.
02:48 If I hadn’t changed back then  with Jehovah’s help,
02:51 oh, things would be so different today.
02:56 If I hadn’t changed back then  with Jehovah’s help,
02:59 oh, things would be so different today.
03:03 I think I’m going to get  some more water.
03:06 I guess I’m not the only one  whose loyalty was tested.
03:11 But for me, it was a little more subtle.
03:16 My phone was a door to just about everything.
03:21 But that door opened to some places
03:24 I shouldn’t have gone.
03:26 At first I thought,
03:29 ‘It’s not pornography, so it’s OK.’
03:32 But still
03:34 what I was seeing filled my mind
03:37 with immoral thoughts,
03:40 and I couldn’t stop.
03:44 Galatians 6:7, 8 reads:
03:47 “Do not be misled:  God is not one to be mocked.
03:51 “For whatever a person is sowing,
03:54 this he will also reap.”
03:57 Reap what you sow.
04:01 Reap what you sow.
04:04 I was sowing unclean desires
04:09 and reaping a double heart,
04:11 desensitized to things Jehovah hates.
04:20 “Turn my eyes away
04:22 from looking at what is worthless.”
04:26 It wasn’t just whether an image  is considered pornography.
04:30 Anything that stirs up unclean thoughts
04:33 is worthless, and I should turn my eyes away.
04:38 But I had to do more.
04:45 Those weren’t just the psalmist’s words;
04:51 they had to be my words.
04:54 Words I’ve had to act on ever since
04:57 to stay loyal to Jehovah.
05:03 Ahh.  Thanks, Karen.
05:05 All right.
05:13 You know, we’ve been talking about times
05:15 when our loyalty has been put to the test
05:18 and not to put you on the spot,
05:22 but didn’t you have an experience?
05:23 Mhm.
05:25 I did, and I don’t mind sharing.
05:31 It was when I was  at that office job in the city.
05:35 It was just coffee as usual.
05:37 Karen, we’re making some coffee.  Did you want some?
05:40 Oh, I’d love it.
05:41 The good stuff, right?
05:42 Oh, yes!
05:43 Thanks.  Boy, I can smell it.
05:47 And somebody brought treats.
05:49 It’s wonderful, thank you.
05:51 Yeah.
05:52 So how are things going for you?
05:53 But this time she started telling me  about her problems at home.
05:56 So John, he got a text message  from his ex-girlfriend.
05:58 No!  That must be very hard for you.
06:00 Yeah, it is.
06:02 You know, there are  some things in the Bible
06:04 that have helped me in my marriage  that I would love to show you.
06:07 I was excited about the chance  to give a witness.
06:10 Hey, good morning.
06:11 Is that for me?
06:12 I know how you like it.
06:13 Oh, thank you.
06:14 From time to time, we talked;
06:16 we kept the conversations brief.
06:19 And that was it.
06:21 Hey!
06:22 But over time, the conversations grew.
06:26 And husbands and family  were often the hot topic.
06:30 And everyone had a viewpoint.
06:32 You know, if I may,
06:34 there are some things  in the Scriptures that I think  . . .
06:36 I still thought  I could give a witness
06:38 and actually teach them  something about Jehovah.
06:41 Oh, no, um, honey,  it doesn’t work like that.
06:45 Pff.
06:48 Sorry, Karen.  Too much information, right?
06:51 You know, with a husband like that . . .
06:53 But in reality, I was the one being taught.
06:56 ...Tell me about it.
06:57 You have all three.
06:57 I have all three...
06:58 And I was a quick learner.
07:00 ...I only have one,  and that’s all I can handle.
07:01 That’s enough.
07:01 I was sure their thinking  wasn’t rubbing off on me
07:05 until one day when Robert called.
07:09 The girls knew that Robert and I had had  a small disagreement that morning.
07:13 And he was calling to apologize,
07:16 although some of it was my fault.
07:18 Karen, did you want to get a little coffee?
07:20 Oh, it’s him.
07:23 If you don’t want  to talk to him now, then don’t.
07:26 Besides, it sounds like he could use  a little silent treatment.
07:36 I couldn’t believe the effect the association
07:39 was having on my attitude and my marriage.
07:43 But what could you do?
07:45 You worked with them every day,
07:47 and you were able  to give a witness sometimes.
07:51 But I had let it turn into regular,  unnecessary association
07:55 that was spoiling my useful habits.
07:57 And that had to change.
08:03 I started keeping things  friendly but professional.
08:06 I was more cautious,
08:08 as I would be if they had invited me out
08:11 or if a male coworker had invited me  to join him for a break.
08:17 Hmm.  So did that work?
08:19 It did, and I was so relieved.
08:22 And so was I.
08:25 Jehovah gave us the good morals  and habits that we have.
08:30 Exposing myself to bad association
08:33 was being disloyal to him.
08:37 When I think how far  we are now into the  . . .
09:01 Oh, thank Jehovah.
09:02 How is it out there?
09:04 It’s not good.
09:06 It won’t be long—maybe an hour.
09:09 Is-is Kevin with you?
09:13 He said that he’s not coming;
09:15 that he doesn’t want to have anything  to do with us anymore.
09:19 How sad.
09:22 Now, this far into the great tribulation.
09:40 I just don’t get it.
09:41 Kevin knows we’re in the great tribulation.
09:44 Why would he say he doesn’t want  anything to do with us anymore?
09:48 Darren, I thought you had heard by now.
09:52 Heard what?
09:53 When our message changed  from good news to judgment,
09:57 he was telling everyone that it  would make problems for us
09:59 and that he was done.
10:04 I can’t believe it!
10:08 Darren, think about it,
10:10 we have all tried to help Kevin.
10:12 Yeah, I remember.
10:14 Think back to Sunday afternoons
10:17 when we preached to the Northern Estates,
10:19 we asked if he wanted to go.
10:21 What did they give us today?
10:23 Well, we’ll go to the Northern Estates,  and then . . .
10:25 OK.
10:26 Hey! Hey, Kevin!  Did you want to join us?
10:28 We’re going up to the Northern Estates.
10:29 Yeah, he said that he  had the weekend shift, again.
10:32 And that the people there  have their paradise,
10:34 and they don’t listen anyway.
10:37 Your car is over here.
10:40 And when we’d do public witnessing. . .
10:42 Hey, Kevin, we’ve been having  great experiences out there at Turner Street.
10:46 Yeah, that sounds nice.
10:48 Yeah, that’s by your job.
10:49 Do you get to talk  to your coworkers about it?
10:53 He said that it wasn’t a good idea  to make waves at the store.
10:59 For as much as we’ve all tried to help Kevin,
11:02 he let his fear of man go unresolved.
11:06 Proverbs says: “Trembling at men is a snare.”
11:10 If Kevin couldn’t preach  with boldness during favorable times,
11:14 imagine how much harder it was for him
11:16 to loyally rely on Jehovah  during this difficult time.
11:20 Yeah, now during the great tribulation.
11:28 Open up!
11:51 What is going on out there?
11:53 They’re just north of town,  searching every house.
11:58 Every house?
11:59 Yeah.  The neighborhood is in a panic.
12:02 Let’s stay calm
12:04 and lean on Jehovah.
12:07 At some point, we can expect  the final attack on God’s people.
12:12 But Jehovah is going to give us  the courage we need.
12:16 So let’s pray together,
12:19 we’ll read the Scriptures,
12:21 and we’ll keep sharing  what’s helped us remain loyal to God.

00:01.397 --> 00:03.399
What an experience! 


00:03.398 --> 00:06.943
That’s why loyalty to Jehovah 
has been so important.


00:06.943 --> 00:09.946
That is so true, Brother Brown. 
How about you? 


00:09.947 --> 00:12.324
Has your loyalty ever been tested?


00:12.323 --> 00:14.285
Oh, yeah, I remember. 


00:14.285 --> 00:16.287
It was years ago, 


00:16.287 --> 00:19.665
and an elder came to give me counsel 
after a talk,  


00:19.665 --> 00:21.000
and let’s just say 
I was not expecting  . . .


00:22.417 --> 00:24.420
You were really quiet the whole way home. 


00:24.420 --> 00:26.088
Is everything all right?


00:26.088 --> 00:27.338
Yeah, I’m fine.


00:27.338 --> 00:29.173
What is on your mind?


00:29.173 --> 00:31.676
I can’t believe the nerve that Ben has.


00:31.677 --> 00:32.595
Ben?


00:32.595 --> 00:33.762
Yeah, Ben. 


00:33.762 --> 00:37.140
He gave me counsel about that talk 
that I gave last week.


00:37.140 --> 00:38.975
Really? 
What did he say?


00:38.975 --> 00:39.977
I don’t know. 


00:39.977 --> 00:41.979
Something like 


00:41.978 --> 00:44.105
I didn’t use enough scriptures. 


00:44.105 --> 00:45.857
Whatever. 


00:45.857 --> 00:48.000
I mean, it was hard to listen to. 


00:49.820 --> 00:52.000
You know, I’ve been an elder 
longer than he has, 


00:53.032 --> 00:55.825
and he comes up to me 
and gives me counsel 


00:55.825 --> 00:57.828
about my teaching!


00:57.828 --> 00:59.830
Please tell me you didn’t argue with him.


00:59.830 --> 01:02.000
No, of course not. 


01:03.125 --> 01:05.127
But it wasn’t easy. 


01:05.127 --> 01:09.590
I thanked him and said something like, 


01:09.590 --> 01:11.592
‘I’ll give it careful thought, 


01:11.592 --> 01:14.595
and apply what you said.’


01:14.595 --> 01:17.000
So you did the right thing.


01:20.433 --> 01:23.478
Yes, but did I really? 


01:23.478 --> 01:27.481
I took the counsel, 
but I don’t like my attitude. 


01:27.482 --> 01:31.445
I let pride get in the way 
of another elder giving me counsel 


01:31.445 --> 01:33.947
just because I’ve been an elder longer.


01:33.947 --> 01:36.000
So, what are you going to do about it?


01:40.955 --> 01:42.998
Pray, I mean, that’s what I should do. 


01:42.998 --> 01:44.708
And then 


01:44.708 --> 01:48.253
go to Ben and ask him to explain 


01:48.253 --> 01:51.840
what I didn’t give him a chance to explain.


01:51.840 --> 01:52.590
Wow! 


01:52.590 --> 01:56.137
Brother Brown, I can’t picture 
you reacting that way to counsel. 


01:56.137 --> 01:57.805
Let alone getting counsel!


01:57.805 --> 02:01.600
That was the problem; neither could I. 


02:01.600 --> 02:04.060
If I was going to remain loyal to Jehovah, 


02:04.060 --> 02:06.938
I needed an attitude adjustment.


02:06.938 --> 02:08.481
So, what did you do?


02:08.482 --> 02:10.000
I prayed, 


02:11.068 --> 02:15.405
and I asked if I could really conduct myself 
as a lesser one.


02:15.405 --> 02:17.323
I went back to Ben 


02:17.323 --> 02:21.453
and asked him to give me the counsel 
that he had prepared for me.


02:21.453 --> 02:24.498
I volunteered for assignments 
that I hadn’t done for a while. 


02:24.498 --> 02:27.333
You know, things that we do 
that go unnoticed. 


02:27.333 --> 02:29.503
And little by little, 


02:29.503 --> 02:32.588
my attitude improved.


02:32.588 --> 02:35.675
After that, I felt closer to Jehovah. 


02:35.675 --> 02:38.678
Seeing the need for more humility, 


02:38.678 --> 02:41.931
well, was humbling.


02:41.932 --> 02:45.685
I never realized, but it seems like everyone 
has had lessons to learn along the way.


02:45.685 --> 02:48.605
Believe me, I am still learning. 


02:48.605 --> 02:51.817
If I hadn’t changed back then 
with Jehovah’s help, 


02:51.817 --> 02:54.000
oh, things would be so different today.


02:56.738 --> 02:59.700
If I hadn’t changed back then 
with Jehovah’s help, 


02:59.700 --> 03:02.000
oh, things would be so different today.


03:03.078 --> 03:06.790
I think I’m going to get 
some more water.


03:06.790 --> 03:11.212
I guess I’m not the only one 
whose loyalty was tested. 


03:11.212 --> 03:15.000
But for me, it was a little more subtle.


03:16.842 --> 03:20.000
My phone was a door to just about everything. 


03:21.472 --> 03:24.307
But that door opened to some places 


03:24.307 --> 03:26.685
I shouldn’t have gone.


03:26.685 --> 03:29.103
At first I thought, 


03:29.103 --> 03:32.523
‘It’s not pornography, so it’s OK.’ 


03:32.523 --> 03:34.108
But still 


03:34.108 --> 03:37.445
what I was seeing filled my mind 


03:37.445 --> 03:40.365
with immoral thoughts, 


03:40.365 --> 03:43.000
and I couldn’t stop.


03:44.118 --> 03:47.413
Galatians 6:7, 8 reads: 


03:47.413 --> 03:51.668
“Do not be misled: 
God is not one to be mocked. 


03:51.668 --> 03:54.170
“For whatever a person is sowing, 


03:54.170 --> 03:57.423
this he will also reap.”


03:57.423 --> 04:00.000
Reap what you sow. 


04:01.010 --> 04:04.765
Reap what you sow. 


04:04.765 --> 04:07.000
I was sowing unclean desires 


04:09.102 --> 04:11.980
and reaping a double heart, 


04:11.980 --> 04:15.000
desensitized to things Jehovah hates.


04:20.488 --> 04:22.825
“Turn my eyes away 


04:22.825 --> 04:25.000
from looking at what is worthless.” 


04:26.578 --> 04:30.331
It wasn’t just whether an image 
is considered pornography. 


04:30.332 --> 04:33.752
Anything that stirs up unclean thoughts 


04:33.752 --> 04:37.000
is worthless, and I should turn my eyes away. 


04:38.882 --> 04:41.000
But I had to do more.


04:45.763 --> 04:49.000
Those weren’t just the psalmist’s words; 


04:51.145 --> 04:54.397
they had to be my words. 


04:54.397 --> 04:57.484
Words I’ve had to act on ever since 


04:57.483 --> 05:00.000
to stay loyal to Jehovah.


05:03.990 --> 05:05.992
Ahh. 
Thanks, Karen. 


05:05.992 --> 05:07.000
All right.


05:13.667 --> 05:15.710
You know, we’ve been talking about times 


05:15.710 --> 05:18.713
when our loyalty has been put to the test 


05:18.713 --> 05:22.341
and not to put you on the spot, 


05:22.342 --> 05:23.635
but didn’t you have an experience?


05:23.635 --> 05:25.720
Mhm. 


05:25.720 --> 05:28.000
I did, and I don’t mind sharing.


05:31.185 --> 05:34.000
It was when I was 
at that office job in the city. 


05:35.022 --> 05:37.732
It was just coffee as usual.


05:37.732 --> 05:40.860
Karen, we’re making some coffee. 
Did you want some?


05:40.860 --> 05:41.903
Oh, I’d love it. 


05:41.903 --> 05:42.905
The good stuff, right?


05:42.905 --> 05:43.905
Oh, yes!


05:43.905 --> 05:46.000
Thanks. 
Boy, I can smell it.


05:47.825 --> 05:49.578
And somebody brought treats.


05:49.578 --> 05:51.371
It’s wonderful, thank you.


05:51.372 --> 05:52.372
Yeah.


05:52.372 --> 05:53.457
So how are things going for you?


05:53.457 --> 05:56.042
But this time she started telling me 
about her problems at home.


05:56.042 --> 05:58.670
So John, he got a text message 
from his ex-girlfriend.


05:58.670 --> 06:00.922
No! 
That must be very hard for you.


06:00.922 --> 06:02.174
Yeah, it is.


06:02.173 --> 06:04.593
You know, there are 
some things in the Bible 


06:04.593 --> 06:07.261
that have helped me in my marriage 
that I would love to show you. 


06:07.262 --> 06:10.015
I was excited about the chance 
to give a witness.


06:10.015 --> 06:10.932
Hey, good morning.


06:10.932 --> 06:11.850
Hey, good morning.


06:11.850 --> 06:12.850
Is that for me?


06:12.850 --> 06:13.852
I know how you like it.


06:13.852 --> 06:14.854
Oh, thank you.


06:14.853 --> 06:16.855
From time to time, we talked; 


06:16.855 --> 06:19.567
we kept the conversations brief.


06:19.567 --> 06:21.109
And that was it. 


06:21.108 --> 06:22.526
Hey!


06:22.527 --> 06:25.000
But over time, the conversations grew. 


06:26.532 --> 06:29.000
And husbands and family 
were often the hot topic. 


06:30.202 --> 06:32.204
And everyone had a viewpoint.


06:32.203 --> 06:34.413
You know, if I may, 


06:34.413 --> 06:36.666
there are some things 
in the Scriptures that I think  . . .


06:36.667 --> 06:38.835
I still thought 
I could give a witness 


06:38.835 --> 06:41.755
and actually teach them 
something about Jehovah.


06:41.755 --> 06:45.467
Oh, no, um, honey, 
it doesn’t work like that.


06:45.467 --> 06:47.000
Pff.


06:48.887 --> 06:51.265
Sorry, Karen. 
Too much information, right?


06:51.265 --> 06:53.100
You know, with a husband like that . . .


06:53.100 --> 06:56.102
But in reality, I was the one being taught.


06:56.102 --> 06:57.020
...Tell me about it.


06:57.020 --> 06:57.853
You have all three.


06:57.853 --> 06:58.688
I have all three...


06:58.688 --> 07:00.190
And I was a quick learner.


07:00.190 --> 07:01.190
...I only have one, 
and that’s all I can handle.


07:01.190 --> 07:01.775
That’s enough.


07:01.775 --> 07:05.778
I was sure their thinking 
wasn’t rubbing off on me 


07:05.778 --> 07:08.000
until one day when Robert called. 


07:09.658 --> 07:13.911
The girls knew that Robert and I had had 
a small disagreement that morning. 


07:13.912 --> 07:16.247
And he was calling to apologize, 


07:16.247 --> 07:18.542
although some of it was my fault.


07:18.542 --> 07:20.544
Karen, did you want to get a little coffee?


07:20.543 --> 07:23.630
Oh, it’s him. 


07:23.630 --> 07:26.592
If you don’t want 
to talk to him now, then don’t. 


07:26.592 --> 07:30.000
Besides, it sounds like he could use 
a little silent treatment.


07:36.810 --> 07:39.562
I couldn’t believe the effect the association 


07:39.562 --> 07:43.692
was having on my attitude and my marriage.


07:43.692 --> 07:45.694
But what could you do? 


07:45.693 --> 07:47.778
You worked with them every day, 


07:47.778 --> 07:50.000
and you were able 
to give a witness sometimes.


07:51.742 --> 07:55.579
But I had let it turn into regular, 
unnecessary association 


07:55.578 --> 07:57.830
that was spoiling my useful habits. 


07:57.830 --> 07:59.000
And that had to change.


08:03.045 --> 08:06.172
I started keeping things 
friendly but professional. 


08:06.172 --> 08:08.217
I was more cautious, 


08:08.217 --> 08:11.052
as I would be if they had invited me out 


08:11.052 --> 08:15.000
or if a male coworker had invited me 
to join him for a break.


08:17.017 --> 08:19.227
Hmm. 
So did that work?


08:19.227 --> 08:22.522
It did, and I was so relieved.


08:22.522 --> 08:24.000
And so was I.


08:25.108 --> 08:29.000
Jehovah gave us the good morals 
and habits that we have. 


08:30.447 --> 08:33.659
Exposing myself to bad association 


08:33.658 --> 08:36.000
was being disloyal to him. 


08:37.578 --> 08:41.000
When I think how far 
we are now into the  . . .


09:01.018 --> 09:02.520
Oh, thank Jehovah.


09:02.520 --> 09:04.815
How is it out there?


09:04.815 --> 09:06.315
It’s not good. 


09:06.315 --> 09:09.693
It won’t be long—maybe an hour.


09:09.693 --> 09:12.000
Is-is Kevin with you?


09:13.115 --> 09:15.117
He said that he’s not coming; 


09:15.117 --> 09:18.000
that he doesn’t want to have anything 
to do with us anymore.


09:19.788 --> 09:21.000
How sad. 


09:22.207 --> 09:26.000
Now, this far into the great tribulation.


09:40.350 --> 09:41.768
I just don’t get it. 


09:41.768 --> 09:43.000
Kevin knows we’re in the great tribulation. 


09:44.437 --> 09:47.000
Why would he say he doesn’t want 
anything to do with us anymore?


09:48.150 --> 09:51.000
Darren, I thought you had heard by now.


09:52.070 --> 09:53.488
Heard what?


09:53.488 --> 09:56.000
When our message changed 
from good news to judgment, 


09:57.367 --> 09:59.954
he was telling everyone that it 
would make problems for us 


09:59.953 --> 10:02.000
and that he was done.


10:04.165 --> 10:07.000
I can’t believe it!


10:08.587 --> 10:10.589
Darren, think about it, 


10:10.588 --> 10:12.798
we have all tried to help Kevin.


10:12.798 --> 10:14.383
Yeah, I remember.


10:14.383 --> 10:17.261
Think back to Sunday afternoons 


10:17.262 --> 10:19.472
when we preached to the Northern Estates, 


10:19.472 --> 10:21.475
we asked if he wanted to go.


10:21.475 --> 10:23.058
What did they give us today?


10:23.058 --> 10:25.895
Well, we’ll go to the Northern Estates, 
and then . . .


10:25.895 --> 10:26.730
OK.


10:26.730 --> 10:28.148
Hey! Hey, Kevin! 
Did you want to join us? 


10:28.148 --> 10:29.106
We’re going up to the Northern Estates.


10:29.107 --> 10:32.194
Yeah, he said that he 
had the weekend shift, again. 


10:32.193 --> 10:34.195
And that the people there 
have their paradise, 


10:34.195 --> 10:36.000
and they don’t listen anyway.


10:37.407 --> 10:39.000
Your car is over here.


10:40.410 --> 10:42.412
And when we’d do public witnessing. . .


10:42.412 --> 10:46.290
Hey, Kevin, we’ve been having 
great experiences out there at Turner Street.


10:46.290 --> 10:48.042
Yeah, that sounds nice.


10:48.042 --> 10:49.837
Yeah, that’s by your job. 


10:49.837 --> 10:52.000
Do you get to talk 
to your coworkers about it?


10:53.465 --> 10:56.000
He said that it wasn’t a good idea 
to make waves at the store.


10:59.720 --> 11:02.473
For as much as we’ve all tried to help Kevin, 


11:02.473 --> 11:05.000
he let his fear of man go unresolved.


11:06.435 --> 11:10.398
Proverbs says: “Trembling at men is a snare.” 


11:10.398 --> 11:14.110
If Kevin couldn’t preach 
with boldness during favorable times, 


11:14.110 --> 11:16.278
imagine how much harder it was for him 


11:16.278 --> 11:20.158
to loyally rely on Jehovah 
during this difficult time.


11:20.158 --> 11:24.000
Yeah, now during the great tribulation.


11:28.250 --> 11:30.000
Open up!


11:51.940 --> 11:53.983
What is going on out there?


11:53.983 --> 11:57.000
They’re just north of town, 
searching every house.


11:58.322 --> 11:59.614
Every house?


11:59.613 --> 12:02.491
Yeah. 
The neighborhood is in a panic.


12:02.492 --> 12:04.660
Let’s stay calm 


12:04.660 --> 12:06.000
and lean on Jehovah. 


12:07.622 --> 12:11.000
At some point, we can expect 
the final attack on God’s people. 


12:12.627 --> 12:15.000
But Jehovah is going to give us 
the courage we need. 


12:16.505 --> 12:18.000
So let’s pray together, 


12:19.342 --> 12:21.302
we’ll read the Scriptures, 


12:21.302 --> 12:37.965
and we’ll keep sharing 
what’s helped us remain loyal to God.

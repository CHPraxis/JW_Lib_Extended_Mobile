00:14.827 --> 00:17.000
Today started out well.


00:24.168 --> 00:26.046
But after the meeting tonight, 


00:26.047 --> 00:29.000
my feelings were hurt.


00:37.515 --> 00:40.727
Earlier in the week, we invited 
some friends over to watch a movie.


00:40.727 --> 00:42.814
And apparently, 


00:42.813 --> 00:45.000
this new young elder heard about it, 


00:46.108 --> 00:48.818
so he counseled me about it 
after the meeting, 


00:48.818 --> 00:51.238
saying that I should give 
my movie choices 


00:51.238 --> 00:53.656
some thought.


00:53.657 --> 00:56.660
I just didn’t like 
the way he gave the counsel. 


00:56.660 --> 00:58.703
He’s only 27. 


00:58.703 --> 01:01.000
That’s too young.


01:05.585 --> 01:09.005
The next day, 
we had plans to go out in the ministry 


01:09.005 --> 01:12.927
with Brother Kang and his wife.


01:12.927 --> 01:14.345
But the motivation 


01:14.345 --> 01:17.000
just wasn’t there.


01:28.358 --> 01:31.361
I asked to speak 
with Brother Kang alone. 


01:31.362 --> 01:33.364
I told him what happened 


01:33.363 --> 01:37.200
and how we didn’t feel 
the counsel applied to us.


01:37.200 --> 01:39.703
I can understand 
how you might feel. 


01:39.703 --> 01:41.121
But, Byong Soo, 


01:41.122 --> 01:43.499
be absolutely honest with me. 


01:43.498 --> 01:48.295
Do you feel there is no valid reason 
for that counsel?


01:48.295 --> 01:51.000
Mm. 


01:57.345 --> 01:59.682
Well, maybe there were some scenes 


01:59.682 --> 02:01.975
that could have been less violent. 


02:01.975 --> 02:04.143
But the way he gave the counsel


02:04.143 --> 02:06.355
—he didn’t even ask how we felt.


02:06.355 --> 02:09.273
Byong Soo, what is the only way 


02:09.273 --> 02:11.485
for us to receive perfect counsel?


02:11.485 --> 02:13.778
From a perfect man.


02:13.778 --> 02:15.655
That’s right. 


02:15.655 --> 02:19.910
And is Jesus here on the earth today?


02:19.910 --> 02:22.245
He was right. 


02:22.245 --> 02:24.790
Counsel can only be perfect 


02:24.790 --> 02:27.000
if it’s given from a perfect person.


02:28.460 --> 02:32.338
Still, this counsel 
about our movie choices 


02:32.338 --> 02:34.591
would have been so much easier 


02:34.592 --> 02:38.512
if it came from someone older 
and more experienced, 


02:38.512 --> 02:41.000
like Brother Kang.


02:42.515 --> 02:45.977
Well, he must have sensed 
what I was thinking 


02:45.977 --> 02:48.230
because he helped me to remember 


02:48.230 --> 02:51.000
something from the Bible.


02:52.693 --> 02:55.361
When Job underwent severe trials, 


02:55.362 --> 02:58.532
it was the younger Elihu who helped Job 


02:58.532 --> 03:01.000
adjust his thinking correctly.


03:02.787 --> 03:05.914
It required humility on Job’s part 


03:05.913 --> 03:10.000
to listen to someone younger 
and less experienced.


03:12.003 --> 03:14.923
He then read Proverbs 19:20: 


03:14.923 --> 03:19.176
“Listen to counsel and accept discipline, 


03:19.177 --> 03:24.600
in order to become wise in your future.”


03:24.600 --> 03:26.602
The point was clear: 


03:26.602 --> 03:29.647
Keep our focus on the counsel, 


03:29.647 --> 03:32.000
not the counselor.


03:45.328 --> 03:49.000
I later shared 
Brother Kang’s comments with my wife. 


03:50.333 --> 03:53.003
We both realized that we should welcome 


03:53.003 --> 03:55.713
all counsel from Jehovah. 


03:55.713 --> 03:57.000
It’s for our good.


04:18.195 --> 04:20.697
I’m sure it took courage 


04:20.697 --> 04:24.000
for that young elder 
to approach me about the matter. 


04:25.118 --> 04:28.455
But I’m so glad he did because, 


04:28.455 --> 04:30.623
in the end, his counsel 


04:30.623 --> 04:33.418
was just another example 


04:33.418 --> 04:49.371
of God’s love.

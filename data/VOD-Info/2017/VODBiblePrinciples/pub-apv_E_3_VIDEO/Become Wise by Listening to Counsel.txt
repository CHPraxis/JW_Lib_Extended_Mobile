00:14 Today started out well.
00:24 But after the meeting tonight,
00:26 my feelings were hurt.
00:37 Earlier in the week, we invited  some friends over to watch a movie.
00:40 And apparently,
00:42 this new young elder heard about it,
00:46 so he counseled me about it  after the meeting,
00:48 saying that I should give  my movie choices
00:51 some thought.
00:53 I just didn’t like  the way he gave the counsel.
00:56 He’s only 27.
00:58 That’s too young.
01:05 The next day,  we had plans to go out in the ministry
01:09 with Brother Kang and his wife.
01:12 But the motivation
01:14 just wasn’t there.
01:28 I asked to speak  with Brother Kang alone.
01:31 I told him what happened
01:33 and how we didn’t feel  the counsel applied to us.
01:37 I can understand  how you might feel.
01:39 But, Byong Soo,
01:41 be absolutely honest with me.
01:43 Do you feel there is no valid reason  for that counsel?
01:48 Mm.
01:57 Well, maybe there were some scenes
01:59 that could have been less violent.
02:01 But the way he gave the counsel
02:04 —he didn’t even ask how we felt.
02:06 Byong Soo, what is the only way
02:09 for us to receive perfect counsel?
02:11 From a perfect man.
02:13 That’s right.
02:15 And is Jesus here on the earth today?
02:19 He was right.
02:22 Counsel can only be perfect
02:24 if it’s given from a perfect person.
02:28 Still, this counsel  about our movie choices
02:32 would have been so much easier
02:34 if it came from someone older  and more experienced,
02:38 like Brother Kang.
02:42 Well, he must have sensed  what I was thinking
02:45 because he helped me to remember
02:48 something from the Bible.
02:52 When Job underwent severe trials,
02:55 it was the younger Elihu who helped Job
02:58 adjust his thinking correctly.
03:02 It required humility on Job’s part
03:05 to listen to someone younger  and less experienced.
03:12 He then read Proverbs 19:20:
03:14 “Listen to counsel and accept discipline,
03:19 in order to become wise in your future.”
03:24 The point was clear:
03:26 Keep our focus on the counsel,
03:29 not the counselor.
03:45 I later shared  Brother Kang’s comments with my wife.
03:50 We both realized that we should welcome
03:53 all counsel from Jehovah.
03:55 It’s for our good.
04:18 I’m sure it took courage
04:20 for that young elder  to approach me about the matter.
04:25 But I’m so glad he did because,
04:28 in the end, his counsel
04:30 was just another example
04:33 of God’s love.

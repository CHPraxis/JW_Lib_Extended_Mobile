00:12.075 --> 00:14.227
When I started learning sign language, 


00:14.227 --> 00:17.000
it just seemed to come natural for me.


00:24.837 --> 00:26.714
After I transferred to the congregation, 


00:26.713 --> 00:29.000
I remember feeling so happy.


00:39.852 --> 00:42.980
I was pioneering and really enjoying 


00:42.980 --> 00:45.000
this new way of communicating.


00:48.402 --> 00:52.405
It’s funny how 
the thing you love can also be 


00:52.405 --> 00:56.000
the thing that tests you.


00:57.198 --> 01:00.998
Soon, I took the test 
for a sign-language interpreter. 


01:00.998 --> 01:05.000
I couldn’t believe I passed!


01:06.340 --> 01:09.000
I loved my new job.


01:11.883 --> 01:15.095
My hope was 
that it would support my pioneering 


01:15.095 --> 01:17.097
and maybe 


01:17.097 --> 01:19.224
allow me to travel one day to a country 


01:19.223 --> 01:23.565
and preach where there was 
a need for sign language.


01:23.565 --> 01:26.818
My boss was very happy with my work, 


01:26.818 --> 01:29.000
so much so that he began to give me more.


01:34.465 --> 01:38.827
Everyone seemed appreciative, 


01:38.827 --> 01:42.000
and the extra money didn’t hurt.


01:56.220 --> 02:00.115
I was handling it all fine. 


02:00.115 --> 02:06.000
Ahh, OK, for a while.


02:46.562 --> 02:48.564
My boss asked me to work full-time 


02:48.563 --> 02:51.000
for a few months 
to get some extra training. 


02:53.707 --> 02:55.737
The raise could help me 


02:55.737 --> 02:59.000
with planning my trip abroad.


03:03.495 --> 03:05.497
I knew my parents would be concerned. 


03:05.497 --> 03:10.085
I knew because I felt it too. 


03:10.085 --> 03:13.922
I was already dragging physically. 


03:13.922 --> 03:17.342
But then again, 
it would only be for a few months. 


03:17.342 --> 03:20.262
I was really torn.


03:20.262 --> 03:22.264
Dad kindly commended me 


03:22.263 --> 03:25.933
for having good goals 
and trying my best to work toward them. 


03:25.933 --> 03:30.105
Then he showed me 
a scripture that really helped me, 


03:30.105 --> 03:33.900
1 Timothy 4:16: 


03:33.900 --> 03:37.528
“Pay constant attention 
to yourself and to your teaching. 


03:37.528 --> 03:40.031
“Persevere in these things, 


03:40.032 --> 03:42.994
“for by doing this 
you will save both yourself 


03:42.993 --> 03:45.495
and those who listen to you.”


03:45.495 --> 03:47.497
He helped me 


03:47.497 --> 03:51.000
to see that Timothy set spiritual goals 
for himself while growing up. 


03:52.982 --> 03:55.484
But Paul was now telling him, 


03:55.483 --> 03:58.000
“Don’t stop!”


03:59.300 --> 04:02.262
Even though Timothy 
was a grown spiritual man, 


04:02.262 --> 04:06.684
Paul encouraged him 
to continue setting new spiritual goals, 


04:06.683 --> 04:10.000
in fact, to ‘persevere in them.’ 


04:11.563 --> 04:14.000
What was I persevering in?


04:25.868 --> 04:28.705
I kindly turned down the offer 


04:28.705 --> 04:31.542
and explained to my boss 
that I’d like to keep my hours 


04:31.542 --> 04:34.000
to a minimum 


04:39.633 --> 04:42.000
so I could support 
my number one job.


04:44.972 --> 04:48.684
It might take me longer to save my money, 


04:48.683 --> 04:51.520
but I’ll make that trip one day 


04:51.520 --> 04:54.438
with Jehovah’s help 


04:54.438 --> 05:07.808
and a little perseverance.

00:10.990 --> 00:13.000
We’re very happy for Daniel. 


00:14.743 --> 00:18.000
He’s going to be a blessing 
in his new assignment. 


00:23.252 --> 00:26.214
But we are going to miss him 


00:26.213 --> 00:29.216
and everything he was doing 
for the congregation. 


00:29.217 --> 00:32.000
This will change things for us.


00:40.685 --> 00:43.105
We really want to be there 


00:43.105 --> 00:46.000
for our brothers and sisters.


01:13.927 --> 01:15.930
And it’s true: 


01:15.930 --> 01:20.340
Having plenty to do 
in the Lord’s work is good. 


01:20.340 --> 01:24.000
But where will we get more help?


01:30.277 --> 01:33.280
We do have good ministerial servants 


01:33.280 --> 01:36.000
like Richie. 


01:40.997 --> 01:45.750
But after Daniel left, 
our elder body is one fewer now. 


01:45.750 --> 01:48.503
That prompted a good question: 


01:48.503 --> 01:53.000
Are we doing all we can 
to train our brothers?


01:59.598 --> 02:01.948
Richie, do you have some time for me? 


02:01.948 --> 02:04.018
I have some calls you can help me with.


02:04.018 --> 02:07.000
Sure, I’d like that.


02:12.152 --> 02:14.405
I realized it had been 
a while since we talked 


02:14.405 --> 02:16.407
about him qualifying to do more. 


02:16.407 --> 02:19.242
He explained that he wanted to help 


02:19.242 --> 02:21.287
but didn’t want to appear presumptuous. 


02:21.287 --> 02:23.289
He’d been praying about it, 


02:23.288 --> 02:27.125
and he wanted to know what else 
he could do to keep reaching out.


02:27.125 --> 02:31.000
Talking to Richie 
made me think of Jesus’ example. 


02:32.255 --> 02:36.885
His disciples offered themselves willingly, 
and he trained them. 


02:36.885 --> 02:39.972
They were eager but needed his direction. 


02:39.972 --> 02:43.000
Jesus’ training gave them confidence 
to do the assignments he gave them. 


02:46.895 --> 02:49.230
They were happy, 


02:49.230 --> 02:51.233
not just to follow Jesus, 


02:51.233 --> 02:54.068
but to work alongside him. 


02:54.068 --> 02:57.698
And Jesus was happy to share his work.


02:57.698 --> 03:00.075
Up to his final evening with them, 


03:00.075 --> 03:02.995
he prepared them for the work ahead. 


03:02.995 --> 03:05.122
“Most truly I say to you, 


03:05.122 --> 03:09.627
“whoever exercises faith in me 
will also do the works that I do; 


03:09.627 --> 03:11.712
“and he will do works greater than these, 


03:11.712 --> 03:15.000
because I am going my way to the Father.”


03:17.633 --> 03:22.000
I now remember how much training 
I had received from the brothers.


03:29.730 --> 03:32.942
It was easy to forget 
that I didn’t always get 


03:32.942 --> 03:36.000
things right at first. 


03:42.932 --> 03:46.000
Soon, 
Richie was taking on more responsibility. 


03:47.705 --> 03:51.000
And he told me something 
that I too once felt. 


03:52.382 --> 03:55.635
He just didn’t realize how much work 


03:55.635 --> 03:58.000
went into caring for Jehovah’s sheep. 


03:59.982 --> 04:21.679
But once he knew, 
he was glad he offered himself willingly.

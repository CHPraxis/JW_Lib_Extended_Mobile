00:10 We’re very happy for Daniel.
00:14 He’s going to be a blessing  in his new assignment.
00:23 But we are going to miss him
00:26 and everything he was doing  for the congregation.
00:29 This will change things for us.
00:40 We really want to be there
00:43 for our brothers and sisters.
01:13 And it’s true:
01:15 Having plenty to do  in the Lord’s work is good.
01:20 But where will we get more help?
01:30 We do have good ministerial servants
01:33 like Richie.
01:40 But after Daniel left,  our elder body is one fewer now.
01:45 That prompted a good question:
01:48 Are we doing all we can  to train our brothers?
01:59 Richie, do you have some time for me?
02:01 I have some calls you can help me with.
02:04 Sure, I’d like that.
02:12 I realized it had been  a while since we talked
02:14 about him qualifying to do more.
02:16 He explained that he wanted to help
02:19 but didn’t want to appear presumptuous.
02:21 He’d been praying about it,
02:23 and he wanted to know what else  he could do to keep reaching out.
02:27 Talking to Richie  made me think of Jesus’ example.
02:32 His disciples offered themselves willingly,  and he trained them.
02:36 They were eager but needed his direction.
02:39 Jesus’ training gave them confidence  to do the assignments he gave them.
02:46 They were happy,
02:49 not just to follow Jesus,
02:51 but to work alongside him.
02:54 And Jesus was happy to share his work.
02:57 Up to his final evening with them,
03:00 he prepared them for the work ahead.
03:02 “Most truly I say to you,
03:05 “whoever exercises faith in me  will also do the works that I do;
03:09 “and he will do works greater than these,
03:11 because I am going my way to the Father.”
03:17 I now remember how much training  I had received from the brothers.
03:29 It was easy to forget  that I didn’t always get
03:32 things right at first.
03:42 Soon,  Richie was taking on more responsibility.
03:47 And he told me something  that I too once felt.
03:52 He just didn’t realize how much work
03:55 went into caring for Jehovah’s sheep.
03:59 But once he knew,  he was glad he offered himself willingly.

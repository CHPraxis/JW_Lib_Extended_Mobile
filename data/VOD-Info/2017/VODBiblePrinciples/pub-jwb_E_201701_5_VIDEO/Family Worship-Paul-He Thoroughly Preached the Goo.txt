00:00:01 ‎While very few of us have taken part  ‎in the translation of the Bible,
00:00:06 ‎all of us can share it  ‎with our neighbors
00:00:09 ‎and help them to gain  ‎accurate knowledge of Jehovah.
00:00:13 ‎In the following dramatization,
00:00:15 ‎note some of the theocratic activities  ‎that this family enjoys
00:00:20 ‎and what they had to do  ‎to become so zealous.
00:00:55 ‎OK, OK.
00:00:57 ‎We already know  ‎how this story is going to end.
00:01:00 ‎No real surprises there.
00:01:07 ‎So the real question is,
00:01:09 ‎How did we get here?
00:01:15 ‎For the record,
00:01:17 ‎I never thought our ministry  ‎really needed help.
00:01:25 ‎My wife and daughter  ‎were both regular pioneers.
00:01:29 ‎My son was a solid publisher.
00:01:35 ‎And while my schedule  ‎didn’t let me pioneer yet,
00:01:38 ‎I was trying to do  ‎all I could to support them.
00:01:45 ‎I always assumed
00:01:48 ‎the best support I could provide  ‎was just being out with them
00:01:51 ‎as much as possible,
00:01:55 ‎but I quickly realized more was needed.
00:02:01 ‎Our Field Service Group Overseer
00:02:03 ‎had been making a real effort
00:02:06 ‎to work in the ministry with us  ‎regularly the last few weeks,
00:02:10 ‎and he kindly mentioned  ‎he’d noticed a few challenges.
00:02:15 ‎While our service time was great,
00:02:18 ‎he pointed out that our return visits  ‎were slowly dwindling.
00:02:23 ‎And other than the studies  ‎I had with the children,
00:02:26 ‎no one in the family  ‎was conducting a Bible study.
00:02:30 ‎I asked him  ‎what we could do to try
00:02:33 ‎and improve  ‎the quality of our ministry.
00:02:38 ‎He showed me Romans 15:19,  ‎highlighting Paul’s words:
00:02:44 ‎“I have thoroughly preached  ‎the good news about the Christ.”
00:02:49 ‎He suggested  ‎on our next Family Worship night
00:02:53 ‎studying Paul’s ministry and seeing  ‎what we could learn from his example.
00:03:11 ‎As we looked at Paul’s ministry,  ‎we realized
00:03:15 ‎to be more productive  ‎we needed boldness.
00:03:19 ‎Ephesians 6:19 says:
00:03:23 ‎“Pray also for me,
00:03:25 ‎“that the words may be given to me  ‎when I open my mouth,
00:03:28 ‎“so that I may be able to speak boldly
00:03:31 ‎in making known  ‎the sacred secret of the good news.”
00:03:40 ‎Rina also noticed how Paul
00:03:43 ‎reasoned persuasively with people.
00:03:53 ‎And Keiko liked how he found  ‎common ground with those he talked to
00:03:59 ‎—even referring to a pagan altar  ‎to an unknown god
00:04:03 ‎as a way to direct  ‎the conversation to Jehovah.
00:04:08 ‎Finally, Haruto noted how 2 Timothy said
00:04:12 ‎Paul was  ‎“a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,
00:04:16 ‎handling the word of the truth aright.”
00:04:19 ‎So he was skilled in using the Scriptures  ‎with those he witnessed to.
00:04:30 ‎See, I told you.
00:04:33 ‎You already knew  ‎how this was going to end.
00:04:40 ‎I started auxiliary pioneering.
00:04:53 ‎We now have a number of return visits
00:04:56 ‎and a few progressive Bible studies.
00:05:04 ‎But how did we get here?
00:05:06 ‎We learned from the example of Paul
00:05:10 ‎and how he  ‎“thoroughly preached the good news.”

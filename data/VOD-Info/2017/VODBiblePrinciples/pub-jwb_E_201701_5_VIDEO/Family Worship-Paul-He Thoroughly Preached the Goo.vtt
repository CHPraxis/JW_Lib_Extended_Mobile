‎While very few of us have taken part 
‎in the translation of the Bible, 

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎all of us can share it 
‎with our neighbors 

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and help them to gain 
‎accurate knowledge of Jehovah. 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:15.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In the following dramatization, 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎note some of the theocratic activities 
‎that this family enjoys 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and what they had to do 
‎to become so zealous.

00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎OK, OK. 

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We already know 
‎how this story is going to end. 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎No real surprises there.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So the real question is, 

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎How did we get here?

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎For the record, 

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I never thought our ministry 
‎really needed help.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:29.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎My wife and daughter 
‎were both regular pioneers. 

00:01:29.572 --> 00:01:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎My son was a solid publisher.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And while my schedule 
‎didn’t let me pioneer yet, 

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I was trying to do 
‎all I could to support them.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I always assumed 

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the best support I could provide 
‎was just being out with them 

00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as much as possible, 

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:59.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but I quickly realized more was needed.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Our Field Service Group Overseer 

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎had been making a real effort 

00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to work in the ministry with us 
‎regularly the last few weeks, 

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and he kindly mentioned 
‎he’d noticed a few challenges.

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎While our service time was great, 

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎he pointed out that our return visits 
‎were slowly dwindling.

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And other than the studies 
‎I had with the children, 

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:30.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎no one in the family 
‎was conducting a Bible study.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I asked him 
‎what we could do to try 

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and improve 
‎the quality of our ministry. 

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:43.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He showed me Romans 15:19, 
‎highlighting Paul’s words: 

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“I have thoroughly preached 
‎the good news about the Christ.”

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎He suggested 
‎on our next Family Worship night 

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:57.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎studying Paul’s ministry and seeing 
‎what we could learn from his example.

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:15.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎As we looked at Paul’s ministry, 
‎we realized 

00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:18.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to be more productive 
‎we needed boldness.

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:23.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Ephesians 6:19 says: 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“Pray also for me, 

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“that the words may be given to me 
‎when I open my mouth, 

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎“so that I may be able to speak boldly 

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in making known 
‎the sacred secret of the good news.”

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Rina also noticed how Paul 

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎reasoned persuasively with people.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And Keiko liked how he found 
‎common ground with those he talked to

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:03.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎—even referring to a pagan altar 
‎to an unknown god 

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:08.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as a way to direct 
‎the conversation to Jehovah.

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Finally, Haruto noted how 2 Timothy said 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Paul was 
‎“a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎handling the word of the truth aright.” 

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:24.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So he was skilled in using the Scriptures 
‎with those he witnessed to.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎See, I told you. 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎You already knew 
‎how this was going to end.

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We now have a number of return visits 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and a few progressive Bible studies.

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎But how did we get here? 

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We learned from the example of Paul 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and how he 
‎“thoroughly preached the good news.”

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah warned that “in the last days,”

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:09.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
there would be
“critical times hard to deal with.”

00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:13.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
There would be “food shortages,”
“pestilences,”

00:00:13.327 --> 00:00:16.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“earthquakes in one place after another,”

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other “fearful sights.”

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:22.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also contend with wildfires,

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:27.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
volcanic eruptions, destructive storms,
and man-made disasters,

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:32.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as an increase of lawlessness,
civil unrest, and war.

00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:38.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter where we live, we will
likely be affected by some form of disaster,

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:41.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether natural or man-made.

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:43.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we be prepared?

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:48.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we can prepare spiritually.

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:50.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 30:15 says:

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:54.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength will be in keeping calm
and showing trust.”

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:59.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need to build and maintain
a close relationship with Jehovah

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:03.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn to trust in him now.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not expect divine intervention.

00:01:05.512 --> 00:01:08.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we pray during times of distress,

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
his powerful holy spirit

00:01:11.144 --> 00:01:13.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
can bring Bible passages back to mind

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep us calm and give us wisdom
to make good decisions.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we can prepare physically

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
by maintaining a go bag.

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:30.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our go bag could include items
such as first-aid supplies,

00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:33.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
bottled water, nonperishable food,

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bible, and other necessary items.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
If possible, each household should also have

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
a reasonable reserve

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
of basic supplies at home

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.018 line:10% position:50% align:center
in case it is necessary to shelter in place

00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:49.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
for an extended period of time.

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:51.398 line:10% position:50% align:center
Check what government authorities

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:53.484 line:10% position:50% align:center
recommend for your community.

00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:58.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, we shouldn’t forget
to update the elders

00:01:58.114 --> 00:02:00.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our latest contact information.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we don’t do so,
valuable time could be lost in a disaster.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, during family worship,

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
our family could review
the types of disasters that could happen.

00:02:14.508 --> 00:02:18.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, emergencies
like terrorist attacks and unrest

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
can occur anywhere and without warning.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
So consider what could be done
in each situation,

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:28.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as where to meet
and how to contact the elders.

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:34.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, we can prepare to help others

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they’re experiencing a disaster.

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we expect
if a disaster occurs locally?

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
If advance warning of a disaster is given,

00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:47.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
field service group overseers will make sure

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:51.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everyone in their group
is in a safe location.

00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately after a disaster occurs,

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:58.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
each field service group overseer
will contact everyone in his group

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn of their needs.

00:03:01.938 --> 00:03:05.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could take time
to organize relief assistance,

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:08.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially if supplies are limited.

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:12.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s vital that each of us
takes steps to prepare,

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:14.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
follows government warnings,

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:17.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keeps the elders informed
of our circumstances.

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 2:4 states:

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:25.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look out . . . for the interests of others.”

00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are prepared,
more attention can be given

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those with the most critical needs

00:03:31.054 --> 00:03:35.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we may be able to help others
in our own congregation and nearby,

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:37.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’re affected.

00:03:37.812 --> 00:03:40.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in some circumstances,

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers may need
a place to stay temporarily.

00:03:43.318 --> 00:03:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could open our home
and help them.

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or they might need food or basic supplies.

00:03:49.993 --> 00:03:52.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could share what we have.

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:56.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other situations,
our brothers may need help cleaning

00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
or repairing their home
when it’s safe to do so.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if a disaster occurs
in another area?

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we travel there to help?

00:04:09.474 --> 00:04:12.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
If help is needed,
the branch office will assign brothers

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:16.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
to coordinate and assist with relief efforts.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the best time to make yourself available
is now,

00:04:21.112 --> 00:04:24.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
before a disaster occurs.

00:04:24.032 --> 00:04:27.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask your local elders for an application.

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:30.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then when there is a need,
the branch office will know

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:32.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re willing to assist.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:35.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do not forget the power of prayer.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
By offering prayers in their behalf,

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:42.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
by volunteering to assist
with disaster relief efforts,

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by contributing donations
to the worldwide work,

00:04:45.932 --> 00:04:48.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can assist our brothers.

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:53.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we can’t avoid all disasters,

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether natural or man-made.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we follow the direction
from Jehovah’s Word and organization,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
our obedience glorifies Jehovah.

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:06.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we prepare spiritually

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and physically

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prepare to help others,

00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can take comfort in knowing
that Jehovah will bless our efforts

00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:18.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be prepared for a disaster.

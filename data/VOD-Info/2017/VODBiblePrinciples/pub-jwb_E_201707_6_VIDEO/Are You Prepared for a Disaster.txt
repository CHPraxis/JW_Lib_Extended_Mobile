00:00:03 Jehovah warned that “in the last days,”
00:00:06 there would be “critical times hard to deal with.”
00:00:09 There would be “food shortages,” “pestilences,”
00:00:13 “earthquakes in one place after another,”
00:00:16 and other “fearful sights.”
00:00:19 We also contend with wildfires,
00:00:22 volcanic eruptions, destructive storms, and man-made disasters,
00:00:27 as well as an increase of lawlessness, civil unrest, and war.
00:00:33 No matter where we live, we will likely be affected by some form of disaster,
00:00:38 whether natural or man-made.
00:00:41 How can we be prepared?
00:00:44 First, we can prepare spiritually.
00:00:48 Isaiah 30:15 says:
00:00:50 “Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.”
00:00:54 So we need to build and maintain a close relationship with Jehovah
00:00:59 and learn to trust in him now.
00:01:03 We do not expect divine intervention.
00:01:05 But when we pray during times of distress,
00:01:08 his powerful holy spirit
00:01:11 can bring Bible passages back to mind
00:01:13 to keep us calm and give us wisdom to make good decisions.
00:01:20 Second, we can prepare physically
00:01:23 by maintaining a go bag.
00:01:25 Our go bag could include items such as first-aid supplies,
00:01:30 bottled water, nonperishable food,
00:01:33 a Bible, and other necessary items.
00:01:38 If possible, each household should also have
00:01:41 a reasonable reserve
00:01:42 of basic supplies at home
00:01:44 in case it is necessary to shelter in place
00:01:47 for an extended period of time.
00:01:49 Check what government authorities
00:01:51 recommend for your community.
00:01:55 Also, we shouldn’t forget to update the elders
00:01:58 with our latest contact information.
00:02:01 If we don’t do so, valuable time could be lost in a disaster.
00:02:07 Additionally, during family worship,
00:02:10 our family could review the types of disasters that could happen.
00:02:14 Remember, emergencies like terrorist attacks and unrest
00:02:18 can occur anywhere and without warning.
00:02:21 So consider what could be done in each situation,
00:02:24 such as where to meet and how to contact the elders.
00:02:31 And third, we can prepare to help others
00:02:34 when they’re experiencing a disaster.
00:02:37 So, what can we expect if a disaster occurs locally?
00:02:41 If advance warning of a disaster is given,
00:02:44 field service group overseers will make sure
00:02:47 that everyone in their group is in a safe location.
00:02:51 Immediately after a disaster occurs,
00:02:54 each field service group overseer will contact everyone in his group
00:02:58 to learn of their needs.
00:03:01 It could take time to organize relief assistance,
00:03:05 especially if supplies are limited.
00:03:08 So it’s vital that each of us takes steps to prepare,
00:03:12 follows government warnings,
00:03:14 and keeps the elders informed of our circumstances.
00:03:19 Philippians 2:4 states:
00:03:22 “Look out . . . for the interests of others.”
00:03:25 When we are prepared, more attention can be given
00:03:28 to those with the most critical needs
00:03:31 and we may be able to help others in our own congregation and nearby,
00:03:35 even if we’re affected.
00:03:37 For example, in some circumstances,
00:03:40 brothers may need a place to stay temporarily.
00:03:43 Perhaps we could open our home and help them.
00:03:46 Or they might need food or basic supplies.
00:03:49 We could share what we have.
00:03:52 In other situations, our brothers may need help cleaning
00:03:56 or repairing their home when it’s safe to do so.
00:04:02 But what if a disaster occurs in another area?
00:04:05 Should we travel there to help?
00:04:09 If help is needed, the branch office will assign brothers
00:04:12 to coordinate and assist with relief efforts.
00:04:17 So the best time to make yourself available is now,
00:04:21 before a disaster occurs.
00:04:24 Ask your local elders for an application.
00:04:27 Then when there is a need, the branch office will know
00:04:30 you’re willing to assist.
00:04:32 And do not forget the power of prayer.
00:04:35 By offering prayers in their behalf,
00:04:38 by volunteering to assist with disaster relief efforts,
00:04:42 and by contributing donations to the worldwide work,
00:04:45 we can assist our brothers.
00:04:50 No, we can’t avoid all disasters,
00:04:53 whether natural or man-made.
00:04:55 But when we follow the direction from Jehovah’s Word and organization,
00:05:00 our obedience glorifies Jehovah.
00:05:04 If we prepare spiritually
00:05:06 and physically
00:05:08 and prepare to help others,
00:05:11 we can take comfort in knowing that Jehovah will bless our efforts
00:05:15 to be prepared for a disaster.

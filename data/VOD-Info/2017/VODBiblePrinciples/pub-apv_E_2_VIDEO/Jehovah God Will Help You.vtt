00:07.903 --> 00:10.000
When is your turn, Dad?


00:15.618 --> 00:18.413
Our family was contacted 
by Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:18.413 --> 00:20.290
a few years ago.


00:20.290 --> 00:22.543
Rachel started studying first.


00:22.543 --> 00:24.711
Soon, we all joined in.


00:24.712 --> 00:27.840
For the first time, we were all learning 


00:27.840 --> 00:29.883
what the Bible really teaches.


00:29.883 --> 00:31.885
It wasn’t long 


00:31.885 --> 00:35.472
before we were sharing 
the truth with others.


00:35.472 --> 00:38.000
Well, most of us were.


00:39.352 --> 00:41.437
I knew it was the truth, 


00:41.437 --> 00:43.522
but I didn’t know if I could live up to 


00:43.522 --> 00:46.000
everything Jehovah asks.


00:48.818 --> 00:51.000
Get away.


00:52.488 --> 00:55.000
What if I let everyone down?


00:56.660 --> 01:00.000
What if I let Jehovah down?


01:14.303 --> 01:16.096
You know, 
can you just give me one second?


01:16.097 --> 01:17.097
Yeah, no problem. 


01:17.097 --> 01:19.725
All right. 
Yeah.


01:19.725 --> 01:23.145
A kind elder named Ben 
noticed I was struggling.


01:23.145 --> 01:25.438
You OK?


01:25.438 --> 01:27.481
He took the initiative to help.


01:27.482 --> 01:30.194
He asked, 
“What drew you to Jehovah 


01:30.193 --> 01:33.530
in the first place?”


01:33.530 --> 01:37.492
I guess it was learning 
that Jehovah isn’t harsh and demanding, 


01:37.492 --> 01:40.162
but that he’s a loving Father.


01:40.162 --> 01:42.497
Ben agreed and said, 


01:42.497 --> 01:45.000
“When we do our best to serve Jehovah, 


01:45.000 --> 01:47.210
he does the rest.” 


01:47.210 --> 01:49.880
He explained that Jehovah 
knows our limitations 


01:49.880 --> 01:51.923
and doesn’t expect perfection. 


01:51.923 --> 01:53.925
And he’s always there to help 


01:53.925 --> 01:56.000
because he wants us to succeed.


01:57.722 --> 02:01.017
Then he read Isaiah 41:10: 


02:01.017 --> 02:03.019
“Do not be afraid, 


02:03.018 --> 02:05.061
“for I am with you. 


02:05.062 --> 02:07.064
“Do not be anxious, 


02:07.063 --> 02:10.000
“for I am your God. 


02:14.195 --> 02:17.658
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,” 


02:17.658 --> 02:18.450
Help!


02:18.450 --> 02:20.577
“I will really hold on to you 


02:20.577 --> 02:24.000
with my right hand of righteousness.”


02:28.502 --> 02:31.714
I don’t need to be perfect to serve Jehovah. 


02:31.713 --> 02:36.218
I just need to love him and trust him. 


02:36.218 --> 02:50.211
And he’ll do the rest.

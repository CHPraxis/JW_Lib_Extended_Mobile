00:07 When is your turn, Dad?
00:15 Our family was contacted  by Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:18 a few years ago.
00:20 Rachel started studying first.
00:22 Soon, we all joined in.
00:24 For the first time, we were all learning
00:27 what the Bible really teaches.
00:29 It wasn’t long
00:31 before we were sharing  the truth with others.
00:35 Well, most of us were.
00:39 I knew it was the truth,
00:41 but I didn’t know if I could live up to
00:43 everything Jehovah asks.
00:48 Get away.
00:52 What if I let everyone down?
00:56 What if I let Jehovah down?
01:14 You know,  can you just give me one second?
01:16 Yeah, no problem.
01:17 All right.  Yeah.
01:19 A kind elder named Ben  noticed I was struggling.
01:23 You OK?
01:25 He took the initiative to help.
01:27 He asked,  “What drew you to Jehovah
01:30 in the first place?”
01:33 I guess it was learning  that Jehovah isn’t harsh and demanding,
01:37 but that he’s a loving Father.
01:40 Ben agreed and said,
01:42 “When we do our best to serve Jehovah,
01:45 he does the rest.”
01:47 He explained that Jehovah  knows our limitations
01:49 and doesn’t expect perfection.
01:51 And he’s always there to help
01:53 because he wants us to succeed.
01:57 Then he read Isaiah 41:10:
02:01 “Do not be afraid,
02:03 “for I am with you.
02:05 “Do not be anxious,
02:07 “for I am your God.
02:14 I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,”
02:17 Help!
02:18 “I will really hold on to you
02:20 with my right hand of righteousness.”
02:28 I don’t need to be perfect to serve Jehovah.
02:31 I just need to love him and trust him.
02:36 And he’ll do the rest.

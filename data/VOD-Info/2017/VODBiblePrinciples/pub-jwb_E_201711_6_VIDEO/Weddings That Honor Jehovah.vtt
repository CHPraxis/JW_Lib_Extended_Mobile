WEBVTT

00:05.150 --> 00:09.780
Juliana and I have been friends 
for a few years, 


00:09.780 --> 00:13.700
and we have been getting to know 
each other better for several months.


00:13.700 --> 00:17.495
Things were going really well between us. 


00:17.495 --> 00:20.707
I must say, when Nick asked me 
to join some friends 


00:20.707 --> 00:22.710
for a little get-together at the park, 


00:22.710 --> 00:24.920
I was getting suspicious 


00:24.920 --> 00:27.000
when both our families were there. 


00:28.090 --> 00:31.000
I said, “Yes!”


00:33.553 --> 00:36.000
I couldn’t believe she didn’t see it coming. 


00:37.307 --> 00:41.000
We were both so excited, 
and word spread fast!


00:42.312 --> 00:46.317
At the meeting the next day, 
everyone was congratulating us


00:46.317 --> 00:48.652
—my friend Natalie especially. 


00:48.652 --> 00:51.000
She was full of ideas.


00:52.530 --> 00:55.000
I couldn’t wait to start making plans.


00:56.993 --> 00:59.000
I never realized 
how much goes into a wedding. 


01:00.330 --> 01:03.375
And everyone had 
their own ideas of what we needed


01:03.375 --> 01:05.377
—even Dad! 


01:05.377 --> 01:07.880
We had to think about who we would invite, 


01:07.880 --> 01:10.632
pick out flowers, decorations, 


01:10.632 --> 01:14.679
a suit for Nick and, of course, a dress! 


01:14.678 --> 01:16.680
This was going to be 


01:16.680 --> 01:20.000
so much fun
—or so I thought.


01:21.643 --> 01:26.273
I soon found out there’s 
a whole wedding-related industry out there. 


01:26.273 --> 01:30.945
They were trying to be helpful but, 
at the same time, 


01:30.945 --> 01:33.280
this is how they make money. 


01:33.280 --> 01:37.283
It seemed like nothing they had was modest. 


01:37.283 --> 01:41.788
And the cost for something 
I would only wear for one day


01:41.788 --> 01:44.123
—I couldn’t afford that! 


01:44.123 --> 01:46.668
Everyone was so happy for me, 


01:46.668 --> 01:50.000
but inside I was really starting 
to feel the pressure.


01:52.590 --> 01:54.802
When we met back at Juliana’s home, 


01:54.802 --> 01:57.345
I was pretty confused. 


01:57.345 --> 02:00.057
She had been so happy a few days ago, 


02:00.057 --> 02:02.685
but now she was so stressed out. 


02:02.685 --> 02:06.313
It was like nobody 
was listening to what we wanted. 


02:06.313 --> 02:08.315
But to be honest, 


02:08.315 --> 02:11.000
I’m not sure we knew
what we wanted either. 


02:12.235 --> 02:15.613
I thought it would be good 
if maybe we could just take some time 


02:15.613 --> 02:19.000
and think about what a Christian wedding 
should really be like.


02:21.537 --> 02:24.499
We had a meeting with Brother Grey 
and Brother Sharp the next day 


02:24.498 --> 02:27.083
to discuss using the Kingdom Hall 
for our wedding. 


02:27.083 --> 02:28.960
They gave us some helpful reminders, 


02:28.960 --> 02:31.672
and I’m so glad they did. 


02:31.672 --> 02:34.592
First Corinthians 10:31 says: 


02:34.592 --> 02:38.929
“Whether you are eating 
or drinking or doing anything else, 


02:38.928 --> 02:41.000
do all things for God’s glory.” 


02:42.265 --> 02:46.437
Brother Sharp helped us to see 
that a wedding is a spiritual occasion, 


02:46.437 --> 02:48.522
and we need to keep 
Jehovah’s standards in mind 


02:48.522 --> 02:52.000
when we plan for what we will 
or won’t choose to include.


02:53.443 --> 02:58.031
Brother Grey showed us 1 John 2:15, 16: 


02:58.032 --> 03:02.244
“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world.


03:02.243 --> 03:04.996
“. . . Because everything in the world


03:04.997 --> 03:08.750
“—the desire of the flesh
and the desire of the eyes


03:08.750 --> 03:11.545
“and the showy display
of one’s means of life—


03:11.545 --> 03:14.338
. . . originates with the world.”


03:14.338 --> 03:18.051
He reminded us that what
the world views as normal


03:18.052 --> 03:21.139
is far different from Christian standards 


03:21.138 --> 03:24.015
and that we can be a good example 


03:24.015 --> 03:27.477
by making sure our choices please Jehovah.


03:27.477 --> 03:31.982
They even gave us a few articles 
about wedding arrangements to review. 


03:31.982 --> 03:35.000
They wanted to make sure we would have 
a happy occasion with nothing to regret. 


03:37.528 --> 03:41.031
I asked Brother Sharp 
if he would be our director of the feast 


03:41.032 --> 03:43.035
to help keep things coordinated, 


03:43.035 --> 03:47.000
and he suggested that we talk 
about it over dinner that night.


03:48.165 --> 03:52.460
On the way there, 
we passed by a photography studio. 


03:52.460 --> 03:56.340
I couldn’t believe how lavish 
and showy some weddings are. 


03:56.340 --> 03:59.133
It looked more like an excuse to party 


03:59.133 --> 04:02.846
instead of something 
that’s supposed to honor God.


04:02.847 --> 04:04.849
It reminded me of the book of Galatians: 


04:04.848 --> 04:07.308
“Now the works of the flesh are . . .


04:07.308 --> 04:11.061
drunkenness, wild parties, 
and things like these.” 


04:11.062 --> 04:14.650
We didn’t want to do anything like that. 


04:14.650 --> 04:17.527
We each took the time
to prayerfully consider


04:17.527 --> 04:20.572
the material the brothers gave us.


04:20.572 --> 04:24.117
We saw that Scriptural principles 
can even help us plan a wedding 


04:24.117 --> 04:27.662
that’s affordable, 
enjoyable for everyone, 


04:27.662 --> 04:30.000
and a day that honors Jehovah. 


04:32.292 --> 04:35.170
It looked like we needed 
to make some adjustments. 


04:35.170 --> 04:38.507
We couldn’t include 
everything we originally thought


04:38.507 --> 04:41.000
—some things were just too expensive.


04:42.010 --> 04:44.220
And we wanted to make sure 
that none of our choices 


04:44.220 --> 04:47.000
reflected the spirit of the world.


04:49.308 --> 04:52.145
So we decided to start over 


04:52.145 --> 04:55.398
and make sure we
were doing things Jehovah’s way.


04:55.398 --> 04:59.570
First Timothy 2:9 says that a Christian 


04:59.570 --> 05:04.198
“should adorn themselves 
in appropriate [or “respectable”] dress, 


05:04.198 --> 05:06.910
with modesty and soundness of mind.” 


05:06.910 --> 05:08.912
It took some work, 


05:08.912 --> 05:12.790
but we were able 
to find something affordable, 


05:12.790 --> 05:15.543
appropriate, 


05:15.543 --> 05:18.000
and beautiful.


05:20.423 --> 05:23.176
I was able to find a nice suit


05:23.177 --> 05:26.430
—something I could even wear later. 


05:26.430 --> 05:28.807
And of course, the girls came by 


05:28.807 --> 05:31.000
to make sure that everything matched.


05:32.768 --> 05:34.000
Time went by so fast. 


05:36.315 --> 05:38.567
I called Brother Sharp 
so he could help us follow through 


05:38.567 --> 05:41.000
on the day of the wedding.


05:42.988 --> 05:45.823
Before we knew it, 
we were sending out invitations 


05:45.823 --> 05:48.000
and finalizing all the details.


05:51.622 --> 05:54.834
When my dad walked me 
down the aisle that day, 


05:54.833 --> 05:56.960
I was so excited.


05:56.960 --> 05:59.000
Juliana was so beautiful! 


06:01.590 --> 06:06.000
And the ceremony was just perfect. 


06:09.723 --> 06:13.000
After all that planning we did, 
we were sure to make it legal.


06:15.812 --> 06:18.232
When looking back at our photos, 


06:18.232 --> 06:21.192
it brings back so many good memories.


06:21.192 --> 06:24.000
I was so happy 
with how nice everything turned out. 


06:25.738 --> 06:28.325
And when we saw 
what a great job our friends had done 


06:28.325 --> 06:32.328
decorating the reception, 
I couldn’t believe my eyes.


06:32.328 --> 06:35.123
It was perfect
—simple, 


06:35.123 --> 06:37.791
dignified. 


06:37.792 --> 06:42.422
Our friends all told us that it was 
one of the nicest weddings they’ve been to. 


06:42.422 --> 06:45.550
Everything that day
was just what we wanted. 


06:45.550 --> 06:48.970
It even stayed on budget.


06:48.970 --> 06:52.598
And most importantly, 
we got our marriage off to a good start 


06:52.598 --> 06:55.976
with Jehovah’s help.


06:55.977 --> 06:58.355
I’m so happy we found each other.


06:58.355 --> 07:01.900
I’m so happy I found you too, Love. 


07:01.900 --> 07:14.475
And I know we’ll stay happy 
if we keep Jehovah first.

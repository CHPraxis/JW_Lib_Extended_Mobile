00:27 As we enter Kyrgyzstan,
00:29 one of the seven countries  on the Eurasian continent
00:32 with “stan” at the end of its name,
00:34 you will find many hospitable
00:37 and openhearted local residents.
00:40 Many people raise livestock,
00:43 and so they well understand  the words of David
00:47 that are recorded in the 23rd Psalm.
00:51 The truth about the caring Shepherd, Jehovah,
00:55 reached this region in the 1950’s.
00:58 More than 20 years ago,
01:01 Jehovah’s Witnesses gave literature
01:03 in the Russian language  to one Kirghiz woman.
01:08 Her small daughter, who stood nearby,
01:11 said, “Mommy,
01:12 “please teach me Russian,
01:14 since God talks to people in Russian.”
01:19 Today, Bible-based publications  are also translated
01:22 into the Kirghiz language,
01:24 and the Great Shepherd,  Jehovah, leads many
01:27 to “grassy pastures.”
01:36 Jehovah uses the branch office
01:38 in Bishkek,  the capital of Kyrgyzstan,
01:41 to refresh his people  throughout the whole country
01:43 and lead them  “in the paths of righteousness.”
01:47 Fellow believers arrived  from different countries
01:50 to help the local brothers  with the reconstruction of the branch.
01:54 All worked hand in hand
01:56 to accomplish a tremendous amount of work.
02:00 The brothers and sisters  who wholeheartedly supported the project
02:04 were strengthened  and encouraged very much.
02:09 We were apprehensive of coming at first,
02:12 but we have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly
02:15 on construction.
02:17 I thought that this is such  a great privilege for us
02:21 to give all of our strength —everything—to Jehovah
02:25 and to feel  that you didn’t waste your youth,
02:27 and this is so important.
02:31 I was touched by the fact  that brothers that came
02:35 from different countries  and were of different nationalities
02:38 worked together in unity.
02:40 It’s yet another proof  that this is Jehovah’s organization.
02:44 This project really strengthened
02:46 my faith.
02:48 Jehovah always gives us more  than we could ever need or ever want.
02:55 For me, those days  were the best time in my life.
03:00 I would never trade those days for anything.
03:05 Participation in the reconstruction  was a real gift from Jehovah.
03:08 And Jehovah really knows  how to give good gifts.
03:12 I am grateful to him for this.
03:14 While construction work  was coming to its conclusion,
03:18 preparation for the branch dedication began.
03:22 It was to take place on October 24, 2015.
03:27 Brothers built a yurt on the branch property
03:30 several days before the dedication program.
03:38 Finally, the long-awaited day arrived.
03:43 The many guests  that came from faraway countries
03:46 were invited into the yurt  and could try the local cuisine.
03:51 In one of the talks on the program,
03:53 the speaker compared  the branch office to a yurt.
03:58 Shepherds caring for their flocks  in the mountains live in yurts nearby.
04:02 They are able to hear the sound  of their flock from inside the yurt.
04:09 If something happens,
04:10 the shepherd can immediately step in  to help the sheep.
04:19 Similarly, the branch office listens  to the sheep in the field
04:23 and renders needed assistance.
04:25 Therefore, the publishers
04:27 “fear no harm.”
04:33 Brother Stephen Lett,  a member of the Governing Body,
04:36 came for the special dedication program.
04:39 This program and another special meeting  held the following day
04:43 were streamed to meeting places  throughout the whole country,
04:47 with a total attendance of over 6,000.
04:50 Many listeners were touched,
04:53 and their eyes were filled with tears of joy.
05:00 Now there are
05:01 more than 5,000 active Witnesses  in Kyrgyzstan,
05:05 a country with a population  of over six million.
05:08 They continue to search  for honesthearted people
05:11 that are thirsty for the truth.
05:14 Yes, our Great Shepherd, Jehovah,  prepares a rich table
05:18 and fills the cup  until it “is well-filled.”
05:25 The prophet David sang:
05:27 “Surely goodness and loyal love
05:30 “will pursue me all the days of my life,
05:33 “and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah
05:37 for all my days.”
05:39 Jehovah’s servants in Kyrgyzstan  want to serve Jehovah together
05:43 with their brothers and sisters earth wide
05:46 now and forever.

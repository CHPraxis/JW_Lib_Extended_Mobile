00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
As we enter Kyrgyzstan, 


00:29.500 --> 00:32.940
one of the seven countries 
on the Eurasian continent 


00:32.940 --> 00:34.940
with “stan” at the end of its name, 


00:34.940 --> 00:37.100
you will find many hospitable 


00:37.100 --> 00:39.000
and openhearted local residents. 


00:40.420 --> 00:43.460
Many people raise livestock, 


00:43.460 --> 00:47.060
and so they well understand 
the words of David 


00:47.060 --> 00:50.000
that are recorded in the 23rd Psalm.


00:51.658 --> 00:55.140
The truth about the caring Shepherd, Jehovah, 


00:55.140 --> 00:58.980
reached this region in the 1950’s. 


00:58.980 --> 01:01.300
More than 20 years ago, 


01:01.300 --> 01:03.620
Jehovah’s Witnesses gave literature 


01:03.620 --> 01:06.000
in the Russian language 
to one Kirghiz woman. 


01:08.300 --> 01:11.140
Her small daughter, who stood nearby, 


01:11.140 --> 01:12.660
said, “Mommy, 


01:12.660 --> 01:14.340
“please teach me Russian, 


01:14.340 --> 01:18.000
since God talks to people in Russian.” 


01:19.260 --> 01:22.780
Today, Bible-based publications 
are also translated 


01:22.780 --> 01:24.538
into the Kirghiz language, 


01:24.538 --> 01:27.860
and the Great Shepherd, 
Jehovah, leads many 


01:27.860 --> 01:30.000
to “grassy pastures.”


01:36.140 --> 01:38.458
Jehovah uses the branch office 


01:38.458 --> 01:41.180
in Bishkek, 
the capital of Kyrgyzstan, 


01:41.180 --> 01:43.900
to refresh his people 
throughout the whole country 


01:43.900 --> 01:47.900
and lead them 
“in the paths of righteousness.” 


01:47.900 --> 01:50.900
Fellow believers arrived 
from different countries 


01:50.900 --> 01:54.740
to help the local brothers 
with the reconstruction of the branch. 


01:54.740 --> 01:56.660
All worked hand in hand 


01:56.660 --> 02:00.500
to accomplish a tremendous amount of work. 


02:00.500 --> 02:04.660
The brothers and sisters 
who wholeheartedly supported the project 


02:04.660 --> 02:08.000
were strengthened 
and encouraged very much.


02:09.660 --> 02:12.220
We were apprehensive of coming at first, 


02:12.220 --> 02:15.138
but we have enjoyed ourselves thoroughly 


02:15.138 --> 02:17.380
on construction.


02:17.380 --> 02:21.418
I thought that this is such 
a great privilege for us 


02:21.418 --> 02:25.138
to give all of our strength
—everything—to Jehovah 


02:25.138 --> 02:27.740
and to feel 
that you didn’t waste your youth, 


02:27.740 --> 02:30.000
and this is so important.


02:31.540 --> 02:35.180
I was touched by the fact 
that brothers that came 


02:35.180 --> 02:38.780
from different countries 
and were of different nationalities 


02:38.780 --> 02:40.780
worked together in unity. 


02:40.780 --> 02:44.340
It’s yet another proof 
that this is Jehovah’s organization. 


02:44.340 --> 02:46.418
This project really strengthened 


02:46.418 --> 02:48.418
my faith.


02:48.418 --> 02:54.000
Jehovah always gives us more 
than we could ever need or ever want.


02:55.020 --> 02:59.000
For me, those days 
were the best time in my life.


03:00.900 --> 03:03.000
I would never trade those days for anything.


03:05.300 --> 03:08.900
Participation in the reconstruction 
was a real gift from Jehovah. 


03:08.900 --> 03:12.418
And Jehovah really knows 
how to give good gifts. 


03:12.418 --> 03:14.700
I am grateful to him for this.


03:14.700 --> 03:18.820
While construction work 
was coming to its conclusion, 


03:18.820 --> 03:21.000
preparation for the branch dedication began. 


03:22.578 --> 03:27.540
It was to take place on October 24, 2015. 


03:27.540 --> 03:30.660
Brothers built a yurt on the branch property 


03:30.660 --> 03:34.000
several days before the dedication program.


03:38.060 --> 03:43.460
Finally, the long-awaited day arrived. 


03:43.460 --> 03:46.540
The many guests 
that came from faraway countries 


03:46.540 --> 03:50.000
were invited into the yurt 
and could try the local cuisine.


03:51.700 --> 03:53.740
In one of the talks on the program, 


03:53.740 --> 03:58.060
the speaker compared 
the branch office to a yurt. 


03:58.060 --> 04:02.900
Shepherds caring for their flocks 
in the mountains live in yurts nearby. 


04:02.900 --> 04:07.000
They are able to hear the sound 
of their flock from inside the yurt. 


04:09.140 --> 04:10.820
If something happens, 


04:10.820 --> 04:14.000
the shepherd can immediately step in 
to help the sheep.


04:19.020 --> 04:23.380
Similarly, the branch office listens 
to the sheep in the field 


04:23.380 --> 04:25.380
and renders needed assistance. 


04:25.380 --> 04:27.140
Therefore, the publishers 


04:27.140 --> 04:30.000
“fear no harm.”


04:33.300 --> 04:36.500
Brother Stephen Lett, 
a member of the Governing Body, 


04:36.500 --> 04:39.420
came for the special dedication program. 


04:39.420 --> 04:43.658
This program and another special meeting 
held the following day 


04:43.658 --> 04:47.500
were streamed to meeting places 
throughout the whole country, 


04:47.500 --> 04:50.940
with a total attendance of over 6,000. 


04:50.940 --> 04:53.658
Many listeners were touched, 


04:53.658 --> 04:57.000
and their eyes were filled with tears of joy.


05:00.100 --> 05:01.500
Now there are 


05:01.500 --> 05:05.180
more than 5,000 active Witnesses 
in Kyrgyzstan, 


05:05.180 --> 05:08.140
a country with a population 
of over six million. 


05:08.140 --> 05:11.620
They continue to search 
for honesthearted people 


05:11.620 --> 05:14.180
that are thirsty for the truth. 


05:14.180 --> 05:18.180
Yes, our Great Shepherd, Jehovah, 
prepares a rich table 


05:18.180 --> 05:22.000
and fills the cup 
until it “is well-filled.”


05:25.660 --> 05:27.778
The prophet David sang: 


05:27.778 --> 05:30.820
“Surely goodness and loyal love 


05:30.820 --> 05:33.980
“will pursue me all the days of my life, 


05:33.980 --> 05:37.100
“and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah 


05:37.100 --> 05:39.580
for all my days.” 


05:39.580 --> 05:43.820
Jehovah’s servants in Kyrgyzstan 
want to serve Jehovah together 


05:43.820 --> 05:46.380
with their brothers and sisters earth wide 


05:46.380 --> 05:59.600
now and forever.

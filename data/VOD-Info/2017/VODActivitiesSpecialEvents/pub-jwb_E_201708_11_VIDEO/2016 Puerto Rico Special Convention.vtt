00:08.625 --> 00:11.360
I think that when most 
think of Puerto Rico, 


00:11.360 --> 00:14.197
they think of sun, beach, 


00:14.197 --> 00:17.300
mofongo, good food, 


00:17.300 --> 00:19.835
and just a beautiful, loving, 
and joyful people. 


00:19.835 --> 00:23.305
But they don’t realize 
there’s a lot of spiritual activity 


00:23.305 --> 00:26.408
that’s been taking place 
on this island for decades. 


00:26.408 --> 00:28.978
And our goal is to make sure 
everybody on the island 


00:28.978 --> 00:31.213
knows about this beautiful work 
taking place.


00:31.213 --> 00:33.950
Jesus said that we would be 


00:33.950 --> 00:35.718
“one flock, one shepherd.” 


00:35.718 --> 00:37.753
And sometimes 
if you live on an island 


00:37.753 --> 00:41.523
in the middle of the ocean, 
you may feel a little bit isolated. 


00:41.523 --> 00:45.461
But when the whole world 
comes to town and you get to experience it 


00:45.462 --> 00:48.832
on your own soil, 
it is just a tremendous experience. 


00:48.832 --> 00:50.834
And that’s what we’ve seen 
here in Puerto Rico. 


00:50.833 --> 00:54.536
The brothers have just been 
so excited about the program.


00:54.537 --> 00:57.940
You can see Jehovah has really blessed 
the brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico. 


00:57.940 --> 01:01.210
Having delegates coming 
from the different countries


01:01.210 --> 01:05.882
—from Cuba, Brazil, 
Guyana, the United States—


01:05.882 --> 01:08.250
it’s drawn them together in love.


01:08.250 --> 01:10.687
It’s just been like a big hug 


01:10.687 --> 01:12.555
for the whole branch territory.


01:12.555 --> 01:14.390
Welcome, brothers. 


01:14.390 --> 01:16.458
We hope you will enjoy this spiritual food. 


01:16.458 --> 01:19.261
We love you very much!


01:19.262 --> 01:22.265
Well, we heard about the convention here, 


01:22.265 --> 01:26.602
and so we applied immediately 
because we had been here 50 years before


01:26.602 --> 01:29.039
—to the first international convention here. 


01:29.038 --> 01:31.040
Brother Knorr encouraged 
us to go into Spanish, 


01:31.040 --> 01:33.543
so we did
—50 years ago. 


01:33.543 --> 01:35.578
We wanted to come back.


01:35.578 --> 01:39.081
Well, I think of the work 
the brothers and sisters 


01:39.082 --> 01:42.619
have put into preparing 
for this convention. 


01:42.618 --> 01:45.688
We think of the negotiations 
that were taking place 


01:45.688 --> 01:48.000
over a year ago 
and then the preparation for the delegates 


01:49.192 --> 01:52.062
and all the work with the audio and video. 


01:52.062 --> 01:55.632
It really shows what these brothers 
have done and all the crews 


01:55.632 --> 01:57.000
and their families 
in making this happen. 


01:58.133 --> 02:00.336
And that just— 
That’s all out of love.


02:00.337 --> 02:02.772
The brothers have gone above and beyond. 


02:02.772 --> 02:05.007
Nothing has stood in their way.


02:05.007 --> 02:06.944
Well, as soon as I came through the door 


02:06.943 --> 02:08.545
from the baggage claim area, 


02:08.545 --> 02:10.747
there was a huge group 
of brothers and sisters 


02:10.747 --> 02:12.982
and everyone applauding. 


02:12.982 --> 02:15.385
It just made us feel like one big family.


02:15.385 --> 02:20.190
Besides the overwhelming heat 
was the overwhelming love.


02:20.190 --> 02:22.792
I feel like it’s been 
a lesson in hospitality, 


02:22.792 --> 02:26.495
you know, because the friends 
have been just so welcoming. 


02:26.495 --> 02:28.732
And I feel like it’s just made 
an imprint on my heart.


02:28.732 --> 02:32.002
Well, I think the Puerto Rican 
and really the Caribbean spirit 


02:32.002 --> 02:36.472
has a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of hugging, 
a lot of kissing, a lot of love. 


02:36.472 --> 02:41.000
When there are two Puerto Ricans together, 
they sound like ten.


02:42.912 --> 02:45.982
I already cried so much. 


02:45.982 --> 02:48.317
You have made me cry again. 


02:48.317 --> 02:52.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you!


02:57.527 --> 03:00.330
When I’m on stage signing, 


03:00.330 --> 03:03.065
I see brothers crying and I realize 


03:03.065 --> 03:07.403
that I’m doing this 
for Jehovah and the brothers.


03:07.403 --> 03:09.471
The highlight for me 
is always going out in the ministry 


03:09.472 --> 03:11.474
in the countries that we visit. 


03:11.473 --> 03:13.876
That’s a memory that I’ll take home with me 


03:13.877 --> 03:16.345
because when we unite together 


03:16.345 --> 03:18.347
in doing our preaching work, 


03:18.347 --> 03:21.550
that’s like the best form 
of unity that we can have.


03:21.550 --> 03:25.455
We knocked on the door, 
and there came a lady, 


03:25.455 --> 03:29.325
and we invited her to the convention. 


03:29.325 --> 03:30.827
And she said, 


03:30.827 --> 03:35.000
“Oh, I think I can make it on Friday.”


03:36.132 --> 03:41.170
I came because of an invitation 
that I received, which is this one.


03:41.170 --> 03:46.342
Actually, she called me 
this morning at 6:30 a.m. 


03:46.342 --> 03:50.347
I was not going to answer the phone, 
but I did. 


03:50.347 --> 03:51.347
And it was her. 


03:51.347 --> 03:55.385
She was telling me that she was coming.


03:55.385 --> 04:00.623
I liked the theme 
of the resurrection very much because, 


04:00.623 --> 04:05.126
well, it’s been two years 
since I lost my father 


04:05.127 --> 04:08.000
and I haven’t been able 
to get over that. 


04:09.565 --> 04:12.235
It helped me think more about God, 


04:12.235 --> 04:16.000
and it gives me comfort 
to know that my dad is OK.


04:17.507 --> 04:20.175
This convention is so beautiful. 


04:20.175 --> 04:23.000
It moves you to the core.


04:24.647 --> 04:26.649
You know, at this convention 


04:26.648 --> 04:28.651
we learned about loyalty, 


04:28.652 --> 04:32.000
and we learned that loyalty 
is really an aspect of love. 


04:33.155 --> 04:37.093
And so we had 
an opportunity to show our love 


04:37.093 --> 04:39.461
for our brothers 
and our love for Jehovah. 


04:39.462 --> 04:44.034
And it helped us to understand 
loyalty in just a whole different way. 


04:44.033 --> 04:47.036
And I think that when the brothers go home, 


04:47.037 --> 04:50.740
that picture of their desire 
to be loyal to Jehovah 


04:50.740 --> 04:53.542
and to be loyal to our brotherhood 


04:53.542 --> 04:55.144
is going to be fixed in their mind. 


04:55.143 --> 05:10.743
It’s going to be something unforgettable.

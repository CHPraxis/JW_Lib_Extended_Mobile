00:08 I think that when most  think of Puerto Rico,
00:11 they think of sun, beach,
00:14 mofongo, good food,
00:17 and just a beautiful, loving,  and joyful people.
00:19 But they don’t realize  there’s a lot of spiritual activity
00:23 that’s been taking place  on this island for decades.
00:26 And our goal is to make sure  everybody on the island
00:28 knows about this beautiful work  taking place.
00:31 Jesus said that we would be
00:33 “one flock, one shepherd.”
00:35 And sometimes  if you live on an island
00:37 in the middle of the ocean,  you may feel a little bit isolated.
00:41 But when the whole world  comes to town and you get to experience it
00:45 on your own soil,  it is just a tremendous experience.
00:48 And that’s what we’ve seen  here in Puerto Rico.
00:50 The brothers have just been  so excited about the program.
00:54 You can see Jehovah has really blessed  the brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico.
00:57 Having delegates coming  from the different countries
01:01 —from Cuba, Brazil,  Guyana, the United States—
01:05 it’s drawn them together in love.
01:08 It’s just been like a big hug
01:10 for the whole branch territory.
01:12 Welcome, brothers.
01:14 We hope you will enjoy this spiritual food.
01:16 We love you very much!
01:19 Well, we heard about the convention here,
01:22 and so we applied immediately  because we had been here 50 years before
01:26 —to the first international convention here.
01:29 Brother Knorr encouraged  us to go into Spanish,
01:31 so we did —50 years ago.
01:33 We wanted to come back.
01:35 Well, I think of the work  the brothers and sisters
01:39 have put into preparing  for this convention.
01:42 We think of the negotiations  that were taking place
01:45 over a year ago  and then the preparation for the delegates
01:49 and all the work with the audio and video.
01:52 It really shows what these brothers  have done and all the crews
01:55 and their families  in making this happen.
01:58 And that just—  That’s all out of love.
02:00 The brothers have gone above and beyond.
02:02 Nothing has stood in their way.
02:05 Well, as soon as I came through the door
02:06 from the baggage claim area,
02:08 there was a huge group  of brothers and sisters
02:10 and everyone applauding.
02:12 It just made us feel like one big family.
02:15 Besides the overwhelming heat  was the overwhelming love.
02:20 I feel like it’s been  a lesson in hospitality,
02:22 you know, because the friends  have been just so welcoming.
02:26 And I feel like it’s just made  an imprint on my heart.
02:28 Well, I think the Puerto Rican  and really the Caribbean spirit
02:32 has a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of hugging,  a lot of kissing, a lot of love.
02:36 When there are two Puerto Ricans together,  they sound like ten.
02:42 I already cried so much.
02:45 You have made me cry again.
02:48 Thank you, thank you, thank you!
02:57 When I’m on stage signing,
03:00 I see brothers crying and I realize
03:03 that I’m doing this  for Jehovah and the brothers.
03:07 The highlight for me  is always going out in the ministry
03:09 in the countries that we visit.
03:11 That’s a memory that I’ll take home with me
03:13 because when we unite together
03:16 in doing our preaching work,
03:18 that’s like the best form  of unity that we can have.
03:21 We knocked on the door,  and there came a lady,
03:25 and we invited her to the convention.
03:29 And she said,
03:30 “Oh, I think I can make it on Friday.”
03:36 I came because of an invitation  that I received, which is this one.
03:41 Actually, she called me  this morning at 6:30 a.m.
03:46 I was not going to answer the phone,  but I did.
03:50 And it was her.
03:51 She was telling me that she was coming.
03:55 I liked the theme  of the resurrection very much because,
04:00 well, it’s been two years  since I lost my father
04:05 and I haven’t been able  to get over that.
04:09 It helped me think more about God,
04:12 and it gives me comfort  to know that my dad is OK.
04:17 This convention is so beautiful.
04:20 It moves you to the core.
04:24 You know, at this convention
04:26 we learned about loyalty,
04:28 and we learned that loyalty  is really an aspect of love.
04:33 And so we had  an opportunity to show our love
04:37 for our brothers  and our love for Jehovah.
04:39 And it helped us to understand  loyalty in just a whole different way.
04:44 And I think that when the brothers go home,
04:47 that picture of their desire  to be loyal to Jehovah
04:50 and to be loyal to our brotherhood
04:53 is going to be fixed in their mind.
04:55 It’s going to be something unforgettable.

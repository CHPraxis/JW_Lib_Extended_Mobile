00:02 We would like to welcome all of you
00:05 to this update on the situation facing
00:09 our brothers in Russia.
00:11 As you know, on April 20th,
00:15 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation
00:20 ruled against Jehovah’s Witnesses  and decided to liquidate
00:26 the Administrative Center  of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia
00:30 and all of our Local Religious Organizations.
00:35 We appealed this decision,
00:37 and the hearing for the appeal
00:40 took place in Moscow on July 17th.
00:45 Sadly, the three-judge panel upheld
00:50 this unjust decision against us,
00:54 which effectively bans
00:57 our religious activity in Russia.
01:02 In a few moments,  we will be speaking
01:05 with Brother Mark Sanderson  of the Governing Body,
01:10 who was with our brothers  during the appeal hearing in Moscow.
01:14 But before we talk  to Brother Sanderson,
01:18 let’s first visit with the delegation
01:21 that accompanied him
01:24 in attending  the Supreme Court hearing.
01:27 The delegation’s resolve  to help our brothers in Russia
01:32 reassures us of the unity
01:37 of our organization and the need for all of us
01:42 to face challenges with courage.
01:48 We are en route to Heathrow Airport.
01:50 I’m flying to Frankfurt  to meet up with some brothers
01:54 who are heading off to Moscow together
01:56 to go to the Supreme Court hearing
01:58 on July the 17th.
02:00 Our delegation is made up of 20 brothers from 18 different lands.
02:05 I truly love the brothers in Russia.
02:07 I’ve had association with them  for many years.
02:10 I was in a Russian congregation,
02:12 and so my heart is right  with the brothers and sisters in Russia.
02:17 I worked in the Russian-language field  for 13 years before I came to Bethel.
02:21 So I feel like  the Russian brothers and sisters
02:24 are really my family.
02:26 Everywhere I go,  the brothers are always asking,
02:28 “How are the friends in Russia?”
02:31 And they want me to reassure them  that they have been praying for them,
02:35 and that’s not just mature brothers  in the congregation
02:38 —young children ask the question as well  because they have been taught to pray
02:41 for their brothers in Russia.
02:43 I could have filled up my luggage
02:45 with many drawings  from the children in Belgium
02:49 for the brothers —their little brothers in Russia.
02:52 And we also have heard of some cases  of inactive brothers and sisters
02:58 who have been deeply moved
03:00 by the determination  of our brothers in Russia.
03:03 The brothers in Sweden
03:06 were so impressed
03:08 by their fine attitude,
03:10 especially when the police  were raiding the Kingdom Halls.
03:14 Sometimes they were threatened,
03:17 but they were sitting there quiet and calm,
03:21 and they were not insulting in return.
03:24 Do I fear going to Russia  where our work is under ban?
03:27 Not at all.
03:29 There is no reason to be afraid.
03:32 I am ready to join my brothers  and stand by their side
03:35 in this historic moment.
03:38 I’m not afraid to go to Russia,
03:40 not because I feel I’m so strong,
03:43 but because I feel  that Jehovah is going to be with us
03:47 and he’s the one  who is going to be supporting us.
03:51 Our intent is to try to meet
03:54 with as many of the high officials
03:56 from the various embassies  in Moscow as possible.
04:00 We have done those meetings
04:02 in the spirit of 1 Peter 3:15
04:06 where it says that we should defend  our faith and our hope,
04:10 but do it “with a mild temper  and deep respect.”
04:15 And that’s what we have done.
04:17 We don’t demand  anything from the officials,
04:19 but we tell them  what’s the situation with our brothers.
05:26 The court case  against our brothers in Russia
05:30 in some aspects
05:32 resembles the court case  against Jesus Christ.
05:36 In Luke 22:67,
05:39 when asked if he was the Christ,
05:43 Jesus said to the Sanhedrin:
05:46 “Even if I told you,
05:49 you would not believe it at all.”
05:52 Similarly, our brothers
05:55 have been able to show striking evidence
05:57 to prove that the charges against us
06:00 are completely unfounded.
06:03 But despite such evidence,
06:06 which is clear even to non-Witnesses,
06:10 it is as if we have said nothing.
06:14 Such treatment of God’s people, though,
06:18 is to be expected in these last days.
06:24 But now, we have
06:26 Brother Mark Sanderson  of the Governing Body
06:28 tied in with us.
06:29 And first we’d like to say, Mark,
06:31 thank you very much  for joining us for this interview.
06:35 And especially,  thank you very much
06:39 for being with the brothers  there in Russia.
06:43 Well, thank you so much, Steve.
06:45 It really was a joy and really an honor
06:48 to be with our brothers  in the courtroom in Russia.
06:52 But now,  let me ask you this:
06:54 What impact will this decision
06:58 have on our brothers and sisters in Russia?
07:05 Well, perhaps it’s too early  to know exactly
07:08 what will take place.
07:10 But certainly,  when we met with various officials
07:13 at the embassies in Moscow,
07:15 their feeling is that this is going  to give open license
07:20 for individuals who are prejudiced
07:23 to really just take out their feelings  on all of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
07:28 Already we’ve seen incidences  of Witnesses having their homes burned;
07:33 we’ve had Kingdom Halls  be vandalized;
07:36 we’ve had children harassed  at school by their teachers;
07:40 we’ve had brothers threatened  with loss of employment,
07:43 so we can expect
07:46 that we will see   greater persecution in that land.
07:52 Well, we’re sorry to hear that,  but we know that’s reality.
07:56 But let me ask you,
07:58 Are there options for appeal  available at this point?
08:04 Well,  within the country of Russia,
08:06 we’ve exhausted  all of the available appeals.
08:09 But of course,  we are going to take this matter
08:12 to the European Court  of Human Rights.
08:15 In fact,  within the next day or two,
08:17 we will be applying  for what is called “interim measures,”
08:22 where the European Court,  if they choose,
08:25 can step in  and even attempt to block
08:29 the carrying out  of a major decision.
08:33 Of course, really it’s very uncertain  as to whether Russia
08:38 will actually respect  the actions of the European Court.
08:42 We’ll have to wait and see.
08:45 Mark,  do you see any Scriptural parallels
08:48 to the events you witnessed  at the Supreme Court?
08:54 You know, Steve,  I couldn’t help but continually think
08:57 of what Jesus had said
08:59 in Matthew 5:11
09:02 when he said  that they would “lyingly say
09:06 every sort  of wicked thing against you.”
09:10 And that is just exactly  what we heard again
09:13 this time  during the appeal hearing.
09:15 These officials  were just repeating
09:18 these ridiculous accusations  against Jehovah’s Witnesses,
09:22 attempting to even equate us  with terrorist groups.
09:27 Now,  already the authorities of the world
09:31 are speaking out about this.
09:33 The United States Commission  on International Religious Freedom,
09:37 on Monday,  already issued a statement.
09:40 And maybe I can just read you  the first paragraph
09:42 of this statement that was released.
09:45 They said: “The U.S. Commission  on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)
09:49 “denounces the Russian Supreme Court  ruling on Monday
09:53 “rejecting an appeal  by the Jehovah’s Witnesses
09:56 “against an April decision  declaring them as extremist.
10:00 “USCIRF Chairman  Daniel Mark commented
10:05 “that ‘The Supreme Court’s decision  sadly reflects the government’s
10:11 “‘continued equating  of peaceful religious freedom practice
10:15 “‘to extremism.
10:17 “‘The Witnesses  are not an extremist group,
10:21 “‘and should be able  to practice their faith openly
10:24 and freely and  without government repression.’”
10:29 So these government officials of the world
10:32 —they recognize the truth.
10:34 They understand that these charges
10:37 that have been laid against us  are truly ridiculous and absurd.
10:42 What a powerful statement  you read there!
10:45 Now, we learned in the segment  we just watched
10:49 that the brothers in the delegation
10:52 had an opportunity to speak
10:54 to embassy representatives in Moscow.
10:58 Let me ask you, Mark,
11:00 What were the results of those meetings?
11:04 Well, just to begin, Steve,  I’d like to just comment
11:07 about the courage of these men
11:10 who accepted  this assignment to go to Moscow.
11:12 You know, when they were invited  to come on this assignment,
11:17 not one of these men  even for a moment asked a question like:
11:22 “Is this safe?”
11:25 “Will I be in danger  in going on this assignment?”
11:28 Immediately they said yes  and began making their plans.
11:32 And then once in Moscow,
11:34 we divided into five different groups
11:38 so that we could visit the embassies
11:41 of the countries that we belonged to.
11:44 And so, myself,  I was assigned to go
11:47 with the group that met  with four different embassies.
11:50 We visited the United States,  the United Kingdom,
11:54 the European Union,  and Canada.
11:57 And at each of these four embassies,
12:00 we were given a beautiful reception.
12:02 In one case,  we met with an ambassador;
12:05 in two cases,  we met with deputy ambassadors;
12:08 and in the final one,  we met with one of the secretaries.
12:11 But I have to say,
12:13 as these people listened  to what we had to say,
12:17 of course they’re already  very informed about our issue,
12:19 the question that kept coming  over and over again was:
12:23 “Why Jehovah’s Witnesses?
12:25 “Why is it that Jehovah’s Witnesses  are receiving
12:28 this kind of attention  from the government?”
12:31 Well, we were able  to give a very, very fine witness
12:35 and include many Scriptural thoughts.
12:37 And particularly to one ambassador  who’s a real gentleman
12:41 and really listened to us patiently,
12:43 we were able to say  that Jehovah’s Witnesses have come
12:48 through the concentration camps  in the Nazi times,
12:51 we’ve survived being exiled to Siberia,
12:54 we survived the work camps in the Gulag,
12:57 and all of this because  of the protection of our God, Jehovah.
13:02 That’s why we’re still here,
13:04 and we continue to look  to our God, Jehovah, for his protection.
13:08 And so the reason that we had come  to see these officials
13:12 was because  we are reasonable people,
13:15 and we wanted to talk  to other reasonable people
13:18 to see what might be done  to help our brothers and sisters.
13:22 And these officials  were so extremely receptive
13:26 to this type of approach.
13:28 And what an honor  it was to be able
13:30 to praise the name  of Jehovah before them!
13:33 Very encouraging, Mark.
13:36 How did the brothers,  though, react
13:39 when they heard the negative decision?
13:44 Well, you know, Steve,
13:47 there’s always been  a joyful presence in the courtroom
13:51 on these different occasions  when I’ve been present in Russia,
13:54 but this time  with the reading of this decision,
13:57 there is certainly  a soberness among our brothers,
14:00 and they recognize  the seriousness of this matter.
14:04 But I have to say,  I think the apostle Paul
14:08 really sums up the way  our brothers feel in Russia.
14:12 In 2 Corinthians 4:8,  where he said:
14:17 “We are hard-pressed  in every way,
14:20 “but not cramped  beyond movement;
14:22 “we are perplexed,
14:24 “but not absolutely  with no way out;
14:27 “we are persecuted, but not abandoned;
14:31 we are knocked down,  but not destroyed.”
14:35 And I think just even in a small way,  you know where it says
14:39 that “we are persecuted,  but not abandoned,”
14:42 I think that to have
14:45 this international delegation  in the courtroom;
14:48 to see that brothers  were willing to come,
14:51 risking their own safety  to support the brothers;
14:54 to be there with them  in the courtroom at this difficult time
14:57 was just a reassurance  that Jehovah himself was with them
15:01 and that these representatives,
15:03 in some small way,
15:06 represented to them  Jehovah’s love, Jehovah’s care,
15:10 and that certainly  we were not going to abandon
15:14 our dear brothers in Russia,  no matter what situation may come.
15:19 I like that thought too, Mark,
15:21 that we’re knocked down
15:24 but we’re not destroyed.
15:27 We could say we’re knocked down  but not knocked out.
15:30 That’s right.
15:32 With Jehovah’s help,  we get back up again.
15:34 But now, how have our brothers  and sisters in Russia been faring
15:38 since the first Supreme Court  ruling in April?
15:43 Well, you know, Steve,  as I mentioned earlier,
15:46 there have been many incidents
15:49 across the country of vandalism,  of attacks, of course.
15:53 We’ve been reporting on jw.org
15:57 about our dear  Brother Dennis Christensen
15:59 who was arrested  and has been held now
16:02 for two months, basically,  in the prison there in Russia.
16:07 He has not been allowed to communicate  with his wife during this time.
16:12 And now we learned,  when we were present in Russia,
16:15 that the officials only allow him  to shower twice a week.
16:19 Can you imagine?
16:20 Treating him as though  he was a very, very serious criminal
16:24 when all he did  was attend a meeting
16:27 to read God’s Word  and worship Jehovah.
16:31 What a horrible thing!
16:32 And of course, the officials  from all the countries of the world
16:36 recognize the terrible, terrible injustice  that’s being done here.
16:40 But having said that,
16:42 in spite of these attacks  that we have seen across the country,
16:46 what we also see is  that our brothers and sisters
16:50 are continuing  in their worship for Jehovah.
16:52 They’re continuing  to have their meetings.
16:56 One of the brothers  commented to me, he said:
16:59 “Some who used to  never comment at the meetings,
17:01 “now they love to come  and comment and express themselves.
17:05 “Some who have been inactive
17:07 have begun  to attend the meetings again.”
17:09 And one brother told me
17:10 that when they held  a small mini-convention,
17:15 you know, watching some of the replays  that have been made available,
17:19 that just in their small group,  they had five baptized.
17:23 Can you imagine?
17:25 So we can say with confidence
17:27 that all of these efforts
17:29 that are being made  to try to stop our worship of Jehovah,
17:33 to wipe it out,  are not going to have any success.
17:37 It really reminds me,  would it be OK
17:39 if I just shared  this Scriptural thought?
17:41 Absolutely!  Please.
17:44 It just makes me think  of this thought in Psalm 124.
17:50 And this really has to be  the confidence of our brothers in Russia,
17:53 but it needs to be the confidence, really,  of God’s people all around the world.
17:56 We have to put  our faith in these words.
17:59 It says:  “If Jehovah had not been with us,”
18:03 this is verse 2:  “If Jehovah had not been with us
18:06 “when men  rose up to attack us,
18:09 “then they  would have swallowed us up alive
18:12 “when their anger  was burning against us.
18:15 “Then the waters  would have washed us away,
18:19 “the torrent  would have swept over us.
18:21 “The raging waters  would have overwhelmed us.
18:24 “May Jehovah be praised,
18:27 “for he has not given us  as prey to their teeth.
18:30 “We are like a bird that escaped  from the hunter’s trap;
18:34 “the trap was broken,  and we escaped.
18:38 “Our help is  in the name of Jehovah,
18:41 the Maker of heaven and earth.”
18:43 Well, you know,  so many times,
18:46 our enemies have thought  that they had us locked in that trap
18:50 and that there  was no way to escape,
18:52 but how Jehovah  has proven them wrong,
18:55 and how he has come  to the aid of his people!
18:58 And that is the same confidence  that we have today,
19:01 and it’s the same confidence  our brothers will have.
19:03 It’s the same confidence we’ll have  no matter where we are in the world
19:07 as the scene of this world  continues to change.
19:11 We wholeheartedly agree with you,
19:14 and it definitely warms our heart
19:17 to hear these strengthening comments.
19:20 Thank you very much, Mark,
19:22 and thank you again, too,
19:24 and the rest of the delegation,
19:26 for traveling to Russia
19:29 to be with our dear brothers and sisters.
19:32 And we’re confident  that your presence assured them
19:36 of Jehovah’s love
19:38 and Jehovah’s care for them.
19:40 Thank you so much, Steve.
19:42 As I said, it was a great,  great honor and privilege.
19:45 I truly love our dear brothers in Russia.
19:50 Although the appeal decision  was not in our favor,
19:55 we are not disheartened.
19:59 As our regional convention theme  for this year emphasizes,
20:03 we do not give up!
20:08 Brothers and sisters in Russia,
20:11 we encourage you
20:13 to stay close  to Jehovah and his organization.
20:17 Continue to pray to Jehovah for strength
20:20 to face this persecution with boldness,
20:24 knowing he will provide you
20:28 with the strength needed
20:30 along with the guidance  and wisdom that you need.
20:34 And please know
20:37 that you are excellent examples
20:40 for the rest of us to follow
20:43 when we face persecution.
20:46 We wholeheartedly agree
20:48 with the Bible writer’s expressions
20:50 in Habakkuk 3:18.
20:54 He said:
20:56 “Yet, as for me,
21:00 “I will exult in Jehovah;
21:04 “I will be joyful
21:06 in the God of my salvation.”
21:09 Yes,  whatever the world does to us,
21:13 we maintain our faith  in Jehovah’s saving power
21:17 and will do our utmost to remain
21:22 in Jehovah’s protective care.
21:25 This is JW Broadcasting
21:30 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

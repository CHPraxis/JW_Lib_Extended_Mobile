00:01 Thank you for joining us for this update
00:04 on the legal situation in Russia.
00:06 Our report will discuss the latest developments
00:09 after an important court decision on January 16, 2017.
00:30 For some time,
00:31 the Russian government has claimed
00:33 that Jehovah’s Witnesses are “extremists.”
00:36 Last year, the Prosecutor General
00:38 issued a warning for extremist activity
00:41 against the Administrative Center of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia,
00:44 which is our branch office.
00:46 We appealed that warning,
00:48 as we have not been engaged in any extremist activity.
00:52 But on January 16 of this year,
00:55 the Moscow City Court dismissed that appeal.
00:58 The three-judge panel rejected  all arguments filed by our attorneys
01:03 and rendered its decision after a ten-minute recess.
01:05 Now, we don’t know
01:07 what the implications  of the decision will be.
01:10 But we do know that in the past
01:12 when warnings have been issued in Russia against some of our local entities,
01:16 our property has later been seized.
01:20 Despite the outcome, the January 16 court hearing
01:23 provided a great witness.
01:26 Our representatives were given the opportunity
01:29 to present evidence showing that certain Russian officials
01:33 have been running a campaign
01:35 of painting us as  an “extremist” organization.
01:39 Additionally,  our brothers highlighted the peace
01:42 that exists among Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:44 We now have Brother Sergey Cherepanov with us
01:48 live from the Administrative  Center in Russia.
01:51 Now, Sergey,  what does this recent
01:54 court decision really mean?
01:58 What the government chooses to do now, we don’t know.
02:02 But what we do know is that our brothers will continue worshipping Jehovah.
02:06 They will go to the meetings;
02:08 they will go in the field ministry
02:10 and keep up with their spiritual routine.
02:13 Whatever the future may bring,
02:16 we know that worshipping Jehovah will continue in Russia.
02:20 And, of course,  we have done everything possible,
02:22 and we will continue doing so
02:25 —that is, to legally defend our right
02:29 to worship Jehovah freely in Russia.
02:31 But we have to understand that we cannot expect
02:35 perfect justice in this world of injustice.
02:39 Well, considering  the groundless accusations
02:42 that are being made against Jehovah’s people in Russia,
02:45 how did the brothers and sisters react?
02:47 Are they bitter?
02:49 No, not at all.
02:51 While our brothers continue to be in subjection to the authorities,
02:55 we respect the authorities and we understand
02:58 that not all of them are against us.
03:00 But just like Paul admonished
03:03 in his first letter to Timothy 2:1, 2,
03:07 we pray for them so that they will
03:10 understand the nature of our work
03:12 and we would be able to continue our
03:15 “calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion.”
03:19 That’s a wonderful attitude to have.
03:22 What is the message that the brothers and sisters in Russia
03:26 would like to convey  to our worldwide brotherhood?
03:29 Well, brothers, you don’t need to be  overly worried about us,
03:33 but please keep us in your prayers.
03:36 We certainly will, Sergey,  and please convey our love
03:40 to all the brothers and sisters  there in Russia.
03:43 We will.  Thank you very much.
03:46 Although the legal case is currently focused
03:49 on the Administrative Center in Russia,
03:51 how did we get to where we are today?
03:53 To understand the background,
03:55 we need to go back to 2015
03:58 when a city court ruled on allegations against Jehovah’s Witnesses
04:02 in the city of Taganrog, Russia.
04:17 On November 30, 2015,
04:19 the Taganrog City Court  convicted 16 Jehovah’s Witnesses,
04:23 and in March of the next year,
04:26 the Rostov Regional Court  confirmed this decision.
04:30 I was hoping that the arguments
04:32 by the defense and statements of the accused
04:34 would be heard by the Judicial Chamber
04:36 and we would be excused,
04:38 but neither were heard at that time.
04:40 So, on what are the charges of extremism based?
04:43 The first step taken by the authorities was to get several publications
04:46 of Jehovah’s Witnesses added  to the Federal List of Extremist Materials.
04:52 It means that importing these publications into the country,
04:54 storing them in their places of worship,
04:56 and distributing them was prohibited.
04:58 The basic reasons to ban these publications
05:01 were based on statements which alleged
05:03 that they incite religious discord  by pointing out the superiority
05:07 of Jehovah’s Witnesses over all other religions.
05:10 Following that logic,  the courts have pronounced as extremist
05:13 over 80 publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses
05:15 and their official website.
05:17 Not surprisingly, many specialists in the field of human rights
05:20 consider the court decisions erroneous.
05:24 If I say that my faith is the right one,
05:28 it is the only true religion,
05:30 what would that mean?
05:32 Is it advocating exclusivity?
05:34 or inferiority? or supremacy?
05:37 No, of course not!
05:39 Jehovah’s Witnesses  stopped using these publications
05:42 and removed them  from their places of worship.
05:44 Despite this, the authorities moved on
05:46 to the second stage of their persecution.
05:50 For several years,  law enforcement officers
05:53 have repeatedly used  the following scenario:
05:55 A third party plants banned literature
05:58 at the place of worship  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
06:00 A few minutes later,  police officers and prosecutors show up
06:04 to inspect and search the building and,
06:06 as if by chance, find planted publications.
06:10 And all this is done just to accuse believers
06:12 of extremism and to ban their activity.
06:15 As a result of such literature plantings,
06:17 the authorities have succeeded  in liquidating seven local entities
06:21 of Jehovah’s Witnesses  in different cities of Russia.
06:24 This was the third step  of the persecution.
06:26 It is important to understand
06:28 that a Local Religious Organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses, or LRO,
06:32 is not the same thing as a congregation  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
06:35 An LRO includes 10-15 believers and has certain rights,
06:39 such as to own and maintain  a religious building.
06:41 The actual activities  relating to their worship
06:44 is carried out by the believers,  independently of the LRO.
06:47 And at last the authorities  moved on to their main goal.
06:50 With reference to the fact  that local entities had been banned,
06:54 the prosecutor’s office  now expressed its readiness
06:56 to ban the headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia.
06:59 Prior to this,  the prosecutor’s office had already
07:02 initiated several inspections.
07:04 Then, in 2013,  a team of approximately 60 officials
07:07 turned up at the Administrative Center  to inspect it.
07:10 However, despite all their efforts,
07:12 nothing unlawful was found.
07:14 Such events remind  many human rights advocates
07:17 of the days of religious repression  in the past.
07:22 I’ve known about Jehovah’s Witnesses
07:24 for many years.
07:26 During Soviet times,
07:28 they were persecuted for their faith
07:31 and received long sentences
07:35 in prison camps.
07:38 They would go to prison for their faith.
07:42 Such sincere feelings call for respect.
07:46 Heartfelt faith excludes extremism.
07:52 Although Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia
07:55 are going through certain difficulties,
07:57 today our brothers and sisters
07:58 continue to serve Jehovah  with great joy and zeal.
08:02 We are also receiving words of support
08:04 from our brothers and sisters  all around the world.
08:10 During this difficult time of persecution,
08:12 I have received a lot of help  from our brothers and sisters.
08:17 Recently, one brother from New Zealand
08:20 wrote that his 6-year-old son is praying for me every night.
08:24 It was a great encouragement.
08:28 And, of course, we remember one family
08:30 who sent us greetings from France
08:33 —nine people,  seven of them were children.
08:36 That’s something!
08:39 My relationship with Jehovah  is only getting stronger through all of this.
08:42 During any trial,
08:44 I try to get to know him better —understand him—
08:48 and it strengthens our relationship.
08:58 Brothers, endure difficulties,  stand firm in the faith,
09:01 and blessings from Jehovah will come!
09:05 Our brothers in Russia have gone  through a lot in the past few years.
09:08 King Hezekiah experienced  something similar,
09:11 as you may remember from last year’s regional convention drama.
09:15 Jehovah said at Isaiah 30:15:
09:19 “Your strength will be in keeping calm
09:23 and showing trust.”
09:25 Now, Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah,
09:28 and Jehovah proved to be with him.
09:30 But how can we remain calm
09:34 when negative things take place  around us?
09:37 Well, first, we trust that Jehovah
09:40 will care for us  no matter what happens.
09:43 We know that he’s pleased  by our faith and courage.
09:47 Second,  we know that all that we are asking for
09:51 is to be able to worship Jehovah  in love and peace.
09:54 Our neutral, peace-loving stand
09:57 is known around the world.
09:59 And third,  our worldwide brotherhood stands with us.
10:05 Brothers and sisters in Russia,
10:07 your trust in Jehovah is a great example
10:10 for all of us to imitate.
10:12 Please know that we are praying  in your behalf
10:15 because we love you very much.
10:17 There’s no doubt that Jehovah  is on your side,
10:21 and he will continue to guide  and protect you.

00:00:06 Our world is filled with breathtaking beauty.
00:00:10 Why did God create the earth in such a special way?
00:00:16 Even from space, it stands alone as wonderfully unique.
00:00:24 God created the earth with an abundance of water.
00:00:30 He placed it
00:00:32 at just the right distance from the sun
00:00:38 and set its rotation at just the right speed.
00:00:46 He gave it a moon to stabilize the earth’s tilt,
00:00:49 contributing to consistent seasons.
00:00:56 And he created an amazing variety
00:00:59 of living creatures to share the earth with.
00:01:03 Why did God put forth so much effort to create this beautiful earth?
00:01:10 Because he wanted to give the first human couple,
00:01:13 Adam and Eve, a wonderful home.
00:01:16 As long as they obeyed God,
00:01:19 they and their children would live forever
00:01:21 and expand the Paradise garden to cover the entire globe.
00:01:27 This was God’s purpose for the earth.
00:01:32 So, what happened?
00:01:34 Why isn’t the earth a paradise?
00:01:38 Sadly, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God.
00:01:43 They eventually grew old and died.
00:01:46 Paradise was lost.
00:01:49 But did this mean that God’s original purpose for the earth had changed?
00:01:55 Imagine that a father decides
00:01:58 to build a beautiful home for his son.
00:02:07 He gives it to him as a gift.
00:02:10 But instead of being thankful,
00:02:13 the son neglects his father’s gift
00:02:16 and the house falls into disrepair.
00:02:21 What would a loving father do?
00:02:23 Would he destroy the house and all his hard work?
00:02:30 No, he would patiently save it
00:02:33 for a family member who would appreciate it.
00:02:45 In a similar way, although Adam rejected the gift,
00:02:49 the Bible tells us that God didn’t change
00:02:52 his purpose for the earth.
00:02:55 His purpose still stands.
00:02:58 He wants to give this gift,
00:03:00 an earth-wide paradise,
00:03:03 to you to enjoy
00:03:05 in happiness and health forever!
00:03:09 You may wonder: ‘How will Paradise be restored?
00:03:14 How can you live forever on earth?’

Throughout Jesus’ ministry,

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.780 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he taught about God’s Kingdom

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more than any other subject.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For centuries,

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his followers have prayed

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for that Kingdom to come.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is the Kingdom?

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A kingdom is a type of government.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A government includes a ruler,

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a seat of government,

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a territory that is ruled over,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
laws,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and citizens.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly,

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:48.569 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
many human governments

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.322 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fail to meet the needs of their people,

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:55.159 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
advancing their own interests instead.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, God’s Kingdom
has the perfect Ruler

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus—

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone God himself chose to be King.

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God also selects others

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be associate rulers with Jesus.

00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This Kingdom rules from heaven.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It receives its power and authority from God.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Its domain will include the whole earth,

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:25.773 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
eliminating problems caused by nationalism.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.985 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And anyone who obeys its laws

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:31.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
can be a citizen.

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will the Kingdom benefit its citizens?

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:40.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When on earth,
Jesus showed through his miracles

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what God’s Kingdom would do.

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:46.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus calmed a storm,

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:48.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he showed that as King

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:52.049 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he will control earth’s natural forces,

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
solving environmental problems.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.890 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
By miraculously feeding thousands,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.184 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he demonstrated that the Kingdom

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:04.645 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will eliminate world hunger.

00:02:06.522 --> 00:02:08.482 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus healed the sick,

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:11.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
lame, deaf, and blind,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.406 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he gave us a preview of the perfect health

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:18.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that all will enjoy under his rule.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.414 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And by resurrecting people,

00:02:23.414 --> 00:02:26.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he showed that through the Kingdom,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.712 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he will reverse death itself.

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may wonder,
‘When will God’s Kingdom rule the earth?

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you support God’s Kingdom now?’

00:00:08 The way of the truth  is the best way of living,
00:00:14 But no one can live  your life for you.
00:00:21 So take the advice  that Jehovah is giving;
00:00:28 Believe what he  tells you is true.
00:00:35 Make the truth your own.
00:00:41 Make it live,  yes, make it real.
00:00:47 And then feel the joy Jehovah gives you
00:00:55 When you make the truth your own.
00:01:05 The effort you make  and the time you are spending
00:01:12 In service to God  and his Kingdom
00:01:18 Will yield rich results  and a life that’s unending,
00:01:26 A life full  of good things to come.
00:01:32 Make the truth your own.
00:01:38 Make it live,  yes, make it real.
00:01:45 And then feel the joy Jehovah gives you
00:01:52 When you make the truth your own.
00:02:03 Compared with our God,  we are all little children
00:02:10 And need his direction  and counsel.
00:02:16 So walk ev’ry day  with our Father in heaven;
00:02:23 Receive his rich blessing  in full.
00:02:30 Make the truth your own.
00:02:36 Make it live,  yes, make it real.
00:02:43 And then feel the joy Jehovah gives you
00:02:50 When you make the truth your own.

00:01.480 --> 00:07.110
There is a way of peace,
The way you’ve come to know.


00:07.110 --> 00:12.240
It is the way you learned,
The way of long ago,


00:12.240 --> 00:18.247
The way that Jesus taught you
When his voice you heard.


00:18.247 --> 00:23.835
This is the way of peace,
Found in Jehovah’s Word.


00:23.835 --> 00:28.007
This is the way to life; This is the way.


00:28.007 --> 00:33.429
Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!


00:33.428 --> 00:38.100
God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;


00:38.100 --> 00:43.000
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’


00:46.983 --> 00:52.238
There is a way of love,
No need to look around.


00:52.238 --> 00:57.368
God’s voice has shown the way
He lets himself be found.


00:57.368 --> 01:02.875
His love is full and good;
His love is warm and true.


01:02.875 --> 01:07.000
This is the way of love;
It touches all we do.


01:09.005 --> 01:13.593
This is the way to life; This is the way.


01:13.593 --> 01:18.848
Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!


01:18.848 --> 01:23.811
God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;


01:23.812 --> 01:32.947
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’


01:32.947 --> 01:37.575
There is a way of life,
No need to look behind.


01:37.575 --> 01:42.707
Our God has promised us:
No better way we’ll find,


01:42.707 --> 01:48.212
No higher way to peace,
No finer way to love.


01:48.212 --> 01:54.635
This is the way to life,
Thanks to our God above.


01:54.635 --> 01:59.390
This is the way to life; This is the way.


01:59.390 --> 02:04.060
Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!


02:04.060 --> 02:09.483
God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;


02:09.483 --> 02:24.143
Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’

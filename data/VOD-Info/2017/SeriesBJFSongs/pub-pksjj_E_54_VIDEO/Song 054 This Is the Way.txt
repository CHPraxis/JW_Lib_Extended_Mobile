00:01 There is a way of peace, The way you’ve come to know.
00:07 It is the way you learned, The way of long ago,
00:12 The way that Jesus taught you When his voice you heard.
00:18 This is the way of peace, Found in Jehovah’s Word.
00:23 This is the way to life; This is the way.
00:28 Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!
00:33 God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;
00:38 Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’
00:46 There is a way of love, No need to look around.
00:52 God’s voice has shown the way He lets himself be found.
00:57 His love is full and good; His love is warm and true.
01:02 This is the way of love; It touches all we do.
01:09 This is the way to life; This is the way.
01:13 Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!
01:18 God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;
01:23 Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’
01:32 There is a way of life, No need to look behind.
01:37 Our God has promised us: No better way we’ll find,
01:42 No higher way to peace, No finer way to love.
01:48 This is the way to life, Thanks to our God above.
01:54 This is the way to life; This is the way.
01:59 Don’t look aside; Not for a moment stray!
02:04 God’s voice is calling: ‘This is the way;
02:09 Do not look back, for yes, this is the way.’

00:01.250 --> 00:03.587
We wanted to share a portrayal of life 


00:03.587 --> 00:06.522
as a Witness back in the early 1900’s. 


00:06.522 --> 00:09.159
This unique dramatization 


00:09.158 --> 00:12.061
about the endurance needed 
as a Kingdom proclaimer 


00:12.062 --> 00:16.532
was previously shown to delegates 
at some international conventions 


00:16.532 --> 00:19.502
held in one city in 2014. 


00:19.502 --> 00:21.839
This is a gift video that we received. 


00:21.838 --> 00:24.000
The title is 
Knock! Knock!


06:35.243 --> 06:37.280
Where are the dead? 


06:37.280 --> 06:41.083
Would you wish that question 
answered according to man’s theory 


06:41.083 --> 06:44.153
or to have the answer 
as pointed out in the Bible? 


06:44.153 --> 06:47.890
You will say that man’s answer 
would be only a guess. 


06:47.890 --> 06:51.760
And yet there is no truth 
more clearly taught in the Bible 


06:51.760 --> 06:54.697
than that of the resurrection of the dead.


06:54.697 --> 06:57.400
If the dead are to live again, 


06:57.400 --> 06:59.435
then they must be resurrected, 


06:59.435 --> 07:02.905
and God has provided 
that there shall be a resurrection.


07:02.905 --> 07:06.275
The resurrection of Jesus Christ 
is a guarantee 


07:06.275 --> 07:09.845
that all who have died 
must be awakened out of death 


07:09.845 --> 07:12.000
and given a knowledge of the truth.


07:13.115 --> 07:15.952
All mankind were born in sin, 


07:15.952 --> 07:18.054
and the death of the perfect man Jesus 


07:18.053 --> 07:21.056
provided the purchase price 
for the right of man to live again, 


07:21.057 --> 07:25.862
and in due time Jesus 
will awaken them out of death. 


07:25.862 --> 07:30.000
All of the dead in God’s due time 
shall be awakened out of death.


07:31.367 --> 07:33.837
“And God shall wipe away 
all tears from their eyes; 


07:33.837 --> 07:35.805
“and there shall be no more death, 


07:35.805 --> 07:38.740
“neither sorrow, nor crying, 
neither shall there be any more pain: 


07:38.740 --> 07:42.878
for the former things are passed away.”


07:42.878 --> 07:46.215
The resurrection 
will bring boundless joy to those  


07:46.215 --> 07:48.750
who obey God under Christ’s Kingdom. 


07:48.750 --> 07:52.087
The obedient ones on earth 
during the reign of Christ 


07:52.087 --> 07:57.000
will be given everlasting life on the earth 
in complete happiness and joy. 


07:58.493 --> 08:01.596
Jehovah’s way is always right and true. 


08:01.597 --> 08:04.000
Learn that way and live.


08:09.038 --> 08:13.008
The word “resurrection” 
means “a standing up again” to life. 


08:13.008 --> 08:15.310
If, as claimed by the clergy, 


08:15.310 --> 08:18.647
the dead are alive in purgatory 
or some other place, 


08:18.647 --> 08:21.450
then it follows 
that there could be no resurrection; 


08:21.450 --> 09:14.955
and yet there is no truth more clearly taught 
in the Bible than that of the . . .

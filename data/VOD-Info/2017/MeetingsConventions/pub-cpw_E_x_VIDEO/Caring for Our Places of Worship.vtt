From ancient times,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people have had
established places of worship.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That pattern has continued down to our time.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we meet in Kingdom Halls

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here that we receive
spiritual refreshment

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and direction through Jehovah’s organization.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s here that we enjoy
encouraging association

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:36.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our Kingdom Halls do something else.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are centers for pure worship
in the local communities.

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Indonesia, where I live,

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our congregation invited
local government officials and neighbors

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an open house of our Kingdom Hall
prior to the dedication.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mayor attended, and he was impressed

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the quality of the building,
its functionality,

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:01.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its beautiful garden.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said,

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The cleanliness of this hall
reflects your true faith.”

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That comment made us feel so proud

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be serving our God, Jehovah.

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experiences like these remind us

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never to take our places of worship
for granted.

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we personally

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show Jehovah our gratitude
for our Kingdom Halls?

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our Kingdom Halls
are kept clean and tidy,

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it reflects the qualities and personality
of the God we worship

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a God of order.

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:45.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regular cleaning
also helps protect the health

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all those attending.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:52.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, regular maintenance
helps prolong

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the existence of the building itself.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While congregations are
primarily responsible for maintenance,

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
LDC representatives can assist where needed

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:08.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and train others to care
for inspections and repairs safely.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, one should never do

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any risky work at the Kingdom Hall alone.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And always follow safety instructions.

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When problems are identified early,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can be corrected
with less time and money.

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor Jehovah
when we use donated resources wisely,

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much as we do
when making donations in the first place.

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times, when funds were needed
to renovate the house of Jehovah,

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many happily responded.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether they had little or much,

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they donated generously.

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Kingdom Halls are
more than just buildings;

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are places of worship
dedicated to Jehovah.

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by caring for them
in the best way we can,

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show love for our brothers, new ones,
and most of all,

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the one who lovingly provides his people

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with beautiful places of worship.

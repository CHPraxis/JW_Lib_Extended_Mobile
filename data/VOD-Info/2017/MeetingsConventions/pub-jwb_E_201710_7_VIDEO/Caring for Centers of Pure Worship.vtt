00:04.023 --> 00:06.651
The Assembly Hall is an educational center. 


00:06.652 --> 00:11.000
This is a center of pure worship 
for all the congregations that come. 


00:13.450 --> 00:15.243
Taking care of Jehovah’s house 


00:15.243 --> 00:17.120
is part of sacred service. 


00:17.120 --> 00:19.873
Even going back to the temple, 


00:19.873 --> 00:21.875
everyone had an assignment. 


00:21.875 --> 00:24.002
They had someone to open the doors. 


00:24.002 --> 00:28.000
So, of course, they also had 
somebody maintaining things.


00:29.342 --> 00:32.052
As of December 2016, 


00:32.052 --> 00:35.805
there are 773 Assembly Halls worldwide. 


00:35.805 --> 00:37.975
There are so many details 
at an Assembly Hall; 


00:37.975 --> 00:39.852
you can’t do it all yourself. 


00:39.852 --> 00:41.000
To be overseer of an Assembly Hall— 


00:42.563 --> 00:47.000
We were excited to do it, 
but it seemed real heavy at the time.


00:51.098 --> 00:52.781
It does take, 


00:52.782 --> 00:54.992
in our particular case, a couple of hundred. 


00:54.992 --> 00:57.662
There are about 200 or so volunteers 


00:57.662 --> 01:00.205
each and every week 


01:00.205 --> 01:02.833
that really are necessary 


01:02.833 --> 01:05.335
to care for the Assembly Hall
—the grounds, 


01:05.335 --> 01:07.880
the accounting, the purchasing, 


01:07.880 --> 01:09.673
the maintenance,


01:09.673 --> 01:11.341
and the cleaning. 


01:11.342 --> 01:14.345
Each and every one of these chairs
—the seating—


01:14.345 --> 01:17.848
all have moving parts 
and have to be maintained. 


01:17.848 --> 01:21.310
And with 4,050 seats in here, 


01:21.310 --> 01:26.000
we can say that every single one 
of them has been maintained.


01:28.275 --> 01:32.487
John 2:17 says: 
“The zeal for your house will consume me.” 


01:32.487 --> 01:35.782
And I think we have 
an opportunity to show Jehovah that


01:35.782 --> 01:40.245
—that we have zeal, 
we have an eagerness, a fire for his house, 


01:40.245 --> 01:42.623
and for caring for it. 


01:42.623 --> 01:45.000
So we appreciate all those 
who want to work at the Assembly Hall.


01:46.543 --> 01:49.713
So many of the dear friends, 
after they just spent a whole day 


01:49.713 --> 01:54.216
doing some terribly dirty job, 
they thank you for the privilege. 


01:54.217 --> 01:56.845
Well, that’s zeal for Jehovah’s house. 


01:56.845 --> 01:58.847
Nowhere else does that happen. 


01:58.847 --> 02:01.517
And if we tried to do it ourselves 
or if we hired somebody, 


02:01.517 --> 02:05.000
it wouldn’t be as good as the work 
that the friends do when they come in.


02:06.397 --> 02:08.482
When the friends come on the weekend, 


02:08.482 --> 02:10.484
this is an educational facility. 


02:10.483 --> 02:11.485
So they come here 


02:11.485 --> 02:13.695
to be educated about Jehovah. 


02:13.695 --> 02:15.822
And new ones come, 


02:15.822 --> 02:17.950
and it needs to be dignified 


02:17.950 --> 02:21.578
and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. 


02:21.578 --> 02:25.665
So the cleaning that goes on 
and the maintenance that goes on


02:25.665 --> 02:28.000
—that’s what the purpose is.


02:30.253 --> 02:33.631
At lunchtime, we do a spiritual program. 


02:33.632 --> 02:37.344
It could be a talk; 
it could be a discussion. 


02:37.343 --> 02:41.306
And we, really, 
generally try to cover a topic 


02:41.307 --> 02:43.767
that helps the volunteers 
see the connection 


02:43.767 --> 02:46.812
between their work 
at the Assembly Hall 


02:46.812 --> 02:49.147
and the Kingdom preaching work.


02:49.147 --> 02:50.149
We are preachers. 


02:50.148 --> 02:53.360
That’s number one
—to spread the good news. 


02:53.360 --> 02:56.363
And we see the results of that here. 


02:56.363 --> 02:59.000
We’re filling this place up.


03:07.582 --> 03:09.585
It’s a real privilege. 


03:09.585 --> 03:13.963
You learn so much 
from the sacrifices that the friends make 


03:13.963 --> 03:16.425
in order to serve Jehovah 


03:16.425 --> 03:19.887
that it makes us feel very small, 
and we realize 


03:19.887 --> 03:24.392
what a blessing it is for us to be 
in that environment all the time.


03:24.392 --> 03:26.519
The goal of any work in Jehovah’s service 


03:26.518 --> 03:28.645
is to help as many people as you can 


03:28.645 --> 03:29.647
to come to know him 


03:29.647 --> 03:31.899
and to take care of his interests


03:31.898 --> 03:32.900
here on the earth. 


03:32.900 --> 03:34.652
And we all have the same goal


03:34.652 --> 03:37.000
—trying to please him 
and doing what we can.


03:41.367 --> 03:45.579
Our goal, really, as Assembly Hall servants 


03:45.578 --> 03:50.208
is to take care of the place in such a way


03:50.208 --> 03:53.295
—take care of the Assembly Hall 
in such a way—


03:53.295 --> 03:56.715
that not only saves and makes wise use 


03:56.715 --> 03:59.510
of dedicated funds and resources 


03:59.510 --> 04:02.387
but also makes things ready 
in such a way 


04:02.387 --> 04:05.057
that on Saturday morning 
when the brothers and sisters walk in 


04:05.057 --> 04:07.142
and the attendants and the sound 


04:07.142 --> 04:09.269
and the stage brothers are getting ready, 


04:09.268 --> 04:12.773
all they really have to do 
is come on in and flip the switches


04:12.773 --> 04:15.275
—lights come on, air conditioning, heat. 


04:15.275 --> 04:16.818
Everything is functioning. 


04:16.818 --> 04:19.696
All they have to do 
is just focus on the program 


04:19.697 --> 04:22.449
and listen and take in instruction. 


04:22.448 --> 04:25.826
That’s what we’re asked to do
—listen and take in instruction. 


04:25.827 --> 04:28.830
And we can do that when we’re 
not distracted by anything else. 


04:28.830 --> 04:30.665
So if everything 


04:30.665 --> 04:32.835
works well on an assembly day, 


04:32.835 --> 04:47.120
we know we’ve done our job.

00:03.398 --> 00:07.736
Resting quietly between the Bay of Bengal 
and the Andaman Sea 


00:07.737 --> 00:11.032
are the hundreds 
of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 


00:11.032 --> 00:14.327
Around 30,000 people speak Nicobarese, 


00:14.327 --> 00:17.287
a language unique to these islands. 


00:17.287 --> 00:19.624
Some of our literature was translated 


00:19.623 --> 00:22.585
into Nicobarese in the early 2000’s, 


00:22.585 --> 00:24.545
but the time came for them 


00:24.545 --> 00:27.088
to have their own translation team. 


00:27.088 --> 00:29.758
So in 2007, the India branch 


00:29.758 --> 00:31.926
sent two brothers to organize it. 


00:31.927 --> 00:34.305
The brothers soon found many obstacles 


00:34.305 --> 00:37.307
to overcome 
before the translation work could begin.


00:37.307 --> 00:40.560
After searching for a while, 
we found potential candidates 


00:40.560 --> 00:44.398
who could read, write, 
and speak Nicobarese fluently 


00:44.398 --> 00:47.985
and we encouraged them 
to use their skills for translation. 


00:47.985 --> 00:51.000
They really prepared their hearts 
to benefit from the training given.


00:56.035 --> 00:58.037
I was excited 


00:58.037 --> 01:00.705
and at the same time frightened. 


01:00.705 --> 01:03.125
I know the seriousness 
of the responsibility


01:03.125 --> 01:08.000
as translation is done for those 
who do not understand another language.


01:10.590 --> 01:13.552
The brother who came 
to give training always told us, 


01:13.552 --> 01:16.014
“If you make yourself available, 


01:16.013 --> 01:18.473
Jehovah will make you capable.”


01:18.473 --> 01:22.018
The best location for work 
would have been on the Nicobar Islands 


01:22.018 --> 01:24.396
where the Nicobarese-speaking people live. 


01:24.397 --> 01:29.319
But it was restricted 
after the devastating tsunami in 2004. 


01:29.318 --> 01:32.905
The brothers couldn’t leave 
their jobs and go to the branch 


01:32.905 --> 01:35.407
because it’s 
over 1,000 miles away (1,600 km). 


01:35.407 --> 01:37.409
So the capital of the islands,


01:37.408 --> 01:40.703
Port Blair, 
was the best place to work. 


01:40.703 --> 01:43.956
Some had to travel 24 hours by ship


01:43.957 --> 01:47.000
from different islands to get there.


01:50.255 --> 01:52.842
Our language has a limited vocabulary. 


01:52.842 --> 01:55.135
That is a challenge for us,


01:55.135 --> 01:58.097
but as a team, we try to resolve it. 


01:58.097 --> 02:01.642
During the preparation, 
if we find something 


02:01.642 --> 02:03.560
which is difficult to translate, 


02:03.560 --> 02:05.812
the three of us give our suggestions 


02:05.812 --> 02:09.525
and we try to find 
a simpler way of translating 


02:09.525 --> 02:13.000
so the target audience gets the point.


02:16.782 --> 02:18.992
In December 2004, 


02:18.992 --> 02:21.704
a tsunami devastated the islands 


02:21.703 --> 02:25.000
leaving many in search of comfort.


02:27.710 --> 02:29.503
During the tsunami’s period, 


02:29.503 --> 02:32.255
those who never wanted
to hear the good news


02:32.255 --> 02:34.215
wanted to come in the small room 


02:34.215 --> 02:36.385
where we used to conduct our meetings. 


02:36.385 --> 02:38.428
So I told them 


02:38.428 --> 02:41.098
the meeting can be conducted 
in the open ground 


02:41.098 --> 02:44.601
where all the tsunami victims 
were gathering. 


02:44.602 --> 02:49.732
They agreed because they 
were eager to hear the truth.


02:49.732 --> 02:53.277
Soon afterward, 
the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? 


02:53.277 --> 02:55.570
was translated into Nicobarese. 


02:55.570 --> 02:58.000
It immediately had a positive effect.


02:59.367 --> 03:02.660
When people saw the tract in their language, 


03:02.660 --> 03:04.913
they were very happy. 


03:04.913 --> 03:06.915
On one island, 


03:06.915 --> 03:09.208
more than 20 people read the tract. 


03:09.208 --> 03:11.211
Most of them 


03:11.212 --> 03:15.757
have now dedicated themselves 
to serve Jehovah.


03:15.757 --> 03:17.802
Among them 


03:17.802 --> 03:21.000
were Boniface Joseph 
and his wife, Polina Lucas.


03:24.140 --> 03:26.268
The last question affected us: 


03:26.268 --> 03:28.645
“How can I find happiness in life?” 


03:28.645 --> 03:31.107
We were happy because the way it answered 


03:31.107 --> 03:33.859
was very simple and easy to understand. 


03:33.858 --> 03:36.820
We were moved to learn 
more about the truth. 


03:36.820 --> 03:39.657
There were other questions 
we never knew before 


03:39.657 --> 03:42.785
such as “What happens to us when we die?” 


03:42.785 --> 03:45.537
and “Will . . . suffering ever end?”


03:45.537 --> 03:48.040
Even though the tsunami 
almost snatched away 


03:48.040 --> 03:50.417
everything some of these brothers had, 


03:50.417 --> 03:52.962
they are now even more determined 


03:52.962 --> 03:56.005
to use their abilities in Jehovah’s service.


03:56.005 --> 03:58.050
In the field ministry,


03:58.050 --> 04:01.000
I met a lady and gave her one of our tracts. 


04:02.720 --> 04:05.682
She was happy to see it in her own language 


04:05.682 --> 04:08.602
because it is totally a new thing to them 


04:08.602 --> 04:12.147
as we don’t have any secular magazines 
in our own language.


04:12.147 --> 04:16.902
People in the congregation benefit from it. 


04:16.902 --> 04:20.322
Even new Bible students 
have benefited who did not read well, 


04:20.322 --> 04:23.242
but now they can understand 
what they’re reading 


04:23.242 --> 04:25.119
because it’s in their language. 


04:25.118 --> 04:28.000
It reaches their heart.


04:29.582 --> 04:33.044
Nicobari literature has helped me 
to keep my faith strong 


04:33.043 --> 04:34.795
because now when I read, 


04:34.795 --> 04:36.922
I can fully understand the meaning 


04:36.922 --> 04:38.000
and meditate on what I’m reading.


04:40.300 --> 04:43.678
I feel God uses translation as a tool 


04:43.678 --> 04:46.055
to help people 
to know more about him 


04:46.055 --> 04:49.810
and attract them to the truth 
and save their lives.


04:49.810 --> 04:51.978
With Jehovah’s blessing, 


04:51.978 --> 04:54.898
the challenging work of translating 


04:54.898 --> 04:57.316
the good news of his Kingdom 
into Nicobarese 


04:57.317 --> 05:01.697
is contributing to the words 
of Isaiah 42:12: 


05:01.697 --> 05:04.407
“Let them attribute glory to Jehovah 


05:04.407 --> 05:20.487
and declare his praise in the islands.”

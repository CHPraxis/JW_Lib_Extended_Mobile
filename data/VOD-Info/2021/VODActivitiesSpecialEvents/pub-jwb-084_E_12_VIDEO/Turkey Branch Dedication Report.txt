00:00:07 The preaching work in Turkey has experienced
00:00:09 a period of exciting growth.
00:00:12 The old branch facilities in Istanbul became too small for the increasing needs.
00:00:17 So our brothers found two floors in an office tower
00:00:20 that would provide suitable work space
00:00:22 for Bethel departments.
00:00:26 A nearby residential building provides accommodations for the Bethel family.
00:00:31 To celebrate the dedication of the new branch facilities,
00:00:34 delegates from all over the world came to Istanbul.
00:00:38 Special events and activities were organized to welcome them,
00:00:43 and on May 12, 2018, Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body
00:00:48 gave an encouraging branch dedication talk.
00:00:51 Is it your wish
00:00:53 that we should dedicate these facilities
00:00:56 to the worship and to the praise
00:00:58 of our magnificent God, Jehovah?
00:01:08 In the first century, the apostle Paul wrote about this part of the world
00:01:12 that the good news was “bearing fruit and increasing.”
00:01:15 The same is true today.
00:01:18 The need for Kingdom proclaimers here is great,
00:01:21 and with a new branch dedicated to supporting the preaching work,
00:01:25 our zealous brothers in Turkey are sure that Paul’s words
00:01:27 will continue to prove true.

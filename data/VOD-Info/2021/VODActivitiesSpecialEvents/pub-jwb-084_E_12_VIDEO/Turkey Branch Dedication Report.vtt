The preaching work in Turkey has experienced

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a period of exciting growth.

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The old branch facilities in Istanbul
became too small for the increasing needs.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our brothers found
two floors in an office tower

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would provide suitable work space

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bethel departments.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A nearby residential building provides
accommodations for the Bethel family.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To celebrate the dedication
of the new branch facilities,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delegates from all over the world
came to Istanbul.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Special events and activities
were organized to welcome them,

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on May 12, 2018,
Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave an encouraging branch dedication talk.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your wish

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:56.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should dedicate these facilities

00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worship and to the praise

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our magnificent God, Jehovah?

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, the apostle Paul
wrote about this part of the world

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news
was “bearing fruit and increasing.”

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true today.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The need for Kingdom proclaimers here
is great,

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a new branch dedicated
to supporting the preaching work,

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our zealous brothers in Turkey are sure
that Paul’s words

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue to prove true.

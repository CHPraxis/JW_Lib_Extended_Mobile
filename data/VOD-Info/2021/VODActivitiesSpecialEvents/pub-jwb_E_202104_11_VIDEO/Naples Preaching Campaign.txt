00:00:05 The city of Naples was chosen
00:00:07 as the host city
00:00:08 for the 30th edition of a sports event
00:00:10 known as the Universiade.
00:00:14 The event took place from July 3 to 14, 2019,
00:00:18 and the participants were university athletes from all over the world.
00:00:23 Public witnessing carts were organized in areas of the city
00:00:27 where the majority of visitors and athletes would visit.
00:00:29 One thousand two hundred and twenty-five brothers and sisters in all
00:00:33 took part in this initiative.
00:00:35 The enthusiasm of our brothers and sisters,
00:00:38 along with Jehovah’s blessing,
00:00:40 yielded excellent results.
00:00:42 About 15 Chinese athletes approached us
00:00:45 as soon as they recognized
00:00:46 the logo of our website.
00:00:48 One of them even said, “Ah, this is Jehovah!”
00:00:50 And that allowed for a nice conversation.
00:00:52 The brothers spent a total of 6,000 hours witnessing,
00:00:56 had 1,640 Bible-based conversations,
00:01:00 and placed 1,456 publications.
00:01:05 The brothers in Naples continue
00:01:07 “without letup teaching and declaring the good news”
00:01:10 at every opportunity.

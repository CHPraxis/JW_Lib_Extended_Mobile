00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:11.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible in 1993.

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I was 43 years old.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was married for 19 years,
and I had two children.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I didn’t know if I would become

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.085 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or not.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I accepted a Bible study.

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:31.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At my husband’s request, I started
studying the Bible at the same time,

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I only studied for about a year.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I decided, ‘I’m going to stop.’

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him to stop studying too.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him: “Let’s stop studying.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not for us.

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t understand it.”

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in a very diplomatic and calm way,

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said he would continue.

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I realized
he would continue studying, I said to myself:

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:58.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, all right then.

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just you wait and see.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you really want to continue,
I will somehow make you stop studying

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(in a subtle way), but I will do it.’

00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just seeing him get ready to go
in field service annoyed me so much.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:15.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started burying him with household chores,

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking him to help me
more and more around the house.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But calmly and gently every time,

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would ask me
if he could prepare for meetings.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one time when he asked me
if he could prepare for the meeting,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet again I got irritated and said:

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re not going to prepare now.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to clean
the whole apartment thoroughly.”

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we were finally finished at midnight,

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:47.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he asked me very calmly

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was anything else
he could help me with.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy for him
to deal with my efforts

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to force him to stop studying.

00:01:57.012 --> 00:01:59.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after he got baptized,

00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried even harder.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he never retaliated;
he stayed calm and endured it.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:12.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this period, I was trying
to understand her reactions.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t easy for me.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hearing her criticisms, those harsh replies,
I thought sometimes:

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I think I’ll just give up.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes no sense to go on like this.’

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to the brother who was studying
with me about this,

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to stop.”

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he encouraged me.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “No, no, no, don’t stop.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t quit.

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue, continue.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably your wife will follow you.”

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These conversations always encouraged me,

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we finished our study,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would see things
from a different perspective.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always loved my wife,

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted her to be by my side.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this period, he often told me
how much he loved me

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many times, yes, very often.

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes he would ask me
if I loved him too.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were times when I would answer him,

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:23.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were times
when I just smiled and said nothing.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:29.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I even thought, ‘Hey, this guy
really cares about me.’

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was impressed by his kindness.

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very impressed.

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times, I was musing:
‘Well, as a man, he could hit me.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could be demanding,
“You will sit down,”’ you know.

00:03:42.826 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, he never did that.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never raised his voice,
never spoke a mean word

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:54.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she saw that I did not retaliate

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—as in I would not reply harshly
and I would not talk badly to her—

00:03:57.758 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then eventually

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would calm down.

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his calm and mild way,
he began inviting me to the meetings.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept on inviting me,
and sometimes I was willing to accept.

00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Slowly, I started to attend the meetings.

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:20.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very happy when she said
she wanted to resume her study.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In August 2006,

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started studying the Bible again.

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in March 2007,
I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in July 2007, I decided to get baptized.

00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served in the Baptism Department,

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:47.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had the privilege

00:04:48.642 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to personally baptize my dear wife.

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:11.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 13:4 says

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:14.626 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that “love is patient and kind.”

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:16.670 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Patience means,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all, being patient for months,

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
years, or maybe even decades.

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never give up.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never consider someone as a lost cause.

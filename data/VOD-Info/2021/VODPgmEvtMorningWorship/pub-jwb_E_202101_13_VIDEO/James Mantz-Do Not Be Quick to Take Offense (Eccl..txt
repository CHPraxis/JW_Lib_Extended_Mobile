00:00:01 Which is worse?
00:00:03 To stumble others or to be stumbled?
00:00:06 From Jehovah’s viewpoint,
00:00:08 both are serious matters
00:00:10 that can affect our lives
00:00:13 and also the lives of others.
00:00:15 But today, we’re going to focus on the matter of being stumbled
00:00:18 because our text urges us: “Do not be quick to take offense.”
00:00:24 James 3:2 warns us
00:00:27 that “we all stumble many times.”
00:00:30 We don’t want to misunderstand these words
00:00:32 and say that it’s OK to be stumbled.
00:00:35 It’s not providing an excuse.
00:00:37 Rather, James simply stated a reality
00:00:40 of our imperfect lives.
00:00:43 The important thing, then, is,
00:00:45 What do we do when we run into a potential stumbling block?
00:00:50 Proverbs 24:16 tells us:
00:00:54 “The righteous one may fall even seven times,
00:00:58 and he will certainly get up.”
00:01:01 Let’s consider what might cause us to stumble
00:01:04 and how we can avoid being stumbled.
00:01:08 Some causes of stumbling are injustices
00:01:10 on the part of our fellow believers.
00:01:12 It could be persecution, tribulation,
00:01:15 or it may be the imperfections of others.
00:01:19 Any one of these obstacles could cause us
00:01:22 to trip, to stumble, or even to fall down.
00:01:26 How can we prevent these stumbling blocks
00:01:29 from turning into roadblocks that stop our forward movement
00:01:34 in Jehovah’s service?
00:01:36 Please open your Bibles to Psalm 119.
00:01:39 We’ll read verse 165.
00:01:43 This scripture provides a simple answer to that question,
00:01:46 and it also assures us that we can avoid being stumbled
00:01:51 —Psalm 119:165:
00:01:56 “Abundant peace belongs to those who love your law;
00:02:00 nothing can make them stumble.”
00:02:04 Why not?
00:02:06 Because if we love Jehovah’s law,
00:02:08 Jehovah will not allow us to be stumbled.
00:02:12 Our deep love for him and for his law
00:02:15 will prevent that from happening.
00:02:18 Some of the most common stumbling blocks
00:02:21 result from the imperfections of others.
00:02:23 I’d like to reflect on two experiences
00:02:26 that illustrate how we can avoid letting such problems
00:02:29 become a permanent stumbling block.
00:02:31 The first experience is
00:02:33 of Sister Goldie Romocean.
00:02:36 She was born in Romania in 1903.
00:02:39 She was baptized in 1918.
00:02:42 In 1921, she immigrated to the United States,
00:02:45 and that same year she married a Romanian brother from her hometown.
00:02:49 They settled in Akron, Ohio, and had four daughters.
00:02:53 In the mid-1930’s, Goldie and her husband were stumbled.
00:02:58 Listen to Goldie as she explains why they were stumbled
00:03:03 and what helped them to regain their balance.
00:03:06 She related:
00:03:08 ‘I became angry with Brother Rutherford.
00:03:11 ‘A new Witness felt that Brother Rutherford
00:03:13 ‘had dealt unjustly with him, not hearing him out.
00:03:16 ‘I felt that Brother Rutherford was wrong.
00:03:19 ‘Well, one Sunday my sister Mary and her husband, Dan, came to visit us.
00:03:23 ‘After dinner Dan said: “Let’s get ready to go to the meeting.”
00:03:28 ‘“We don’t go to the meetings anymore,” I said.
00:03:30 ‘“We’re mad at Brother Rutherford.”
00:03:33 ‘Dan asked: “Did you know Brother Rutherford when you got baptized?”
00:03:37 ‘“Of course not,” I replied.
00:03:38 ‘“You know I got baptized in Romania.”
00:03:41 ‘“Well, why did you get baptized?” he asked.
00:03:44 ‘“Because I learned that Jehovah is the true God,
00:03:47 ‘and I wanted to dedicate my life to serve him,” I answered.
00:03:51 ‘“Never forget that! ” Dan replied.
00:03:54 ‘“What if Brother Rutherford left the truth, would you leave too?”
00:03:57 ‘“Never, never!” I said.
00:04:00 ‘That brought me to my senses, and I said:
00:04:04 ‘“Everybody get ready for the meeting.”
00:04:06 And we haven’t stopped since.’
00:04:09 Jehovah continued to bless Goldie and her family.
00:04:12 For example, her daughter Beth graduated from the 14th class of Gilead.
00:04:17 The moving account of Goldie’s life story
00:04:19 can be found in the April 1, 1997,
00:04:23 issue of The Watchtower.
00:04:25 By all means, go back and read it.
00:04:27 You will not only be encouraged
00:04:30 but you’ll also learn how she got the name Goldie.
00:04:33 Is there a lesson here for us?
00:04:35 Yes.
00:04:36 Goldie and her family avoided permanent stumbling
00:04:40 by staying focused on the big picture
00:04:43 —that is, Jehovah’s sovereignty
00:04:46 and their personal relationship with him.
00:04:49 Now let’s consider a second experience.
00:04:52 When I read the text for today,
00:04:54 I immediately thought of Brother Adolf Weber.
00:04:58 I first read his experience 38 years ago
00:05:02 in the 1980 Yearbook.
00:05:04 Obviously, his experience made a lasting impression
00:05:08 on my mind and heart.
00:05:11 Adolf Weber was a Swiss woodcutter.
00:05:13 His job was cutting down trees.
00:05:15 In the mid-1890’s, he traveled to the United States.
00:05:19 He worked as a part-time gardener for Brother Russell,
00:05:21 and that’s how he came to learn the deep truths of God’s Word.
00:05:26 Brother Weber was fluent in English, German, and French.
00:05:29 He volunteered to return to Europe
00:05:31 to cultivate the French-speaking field, and Brother Russell agreed.
00:05:35 Brother Weber went to his hometown in Switzerland,
00:05:38 and there he placed ads in French religious newspapers
00:05:42 and found an excellent response to those ads.
00:05:45 Then in 1903,
00:05:46 Brother Russell visited Europe and arranged with Brother Weber
00:05:50 to publish an eight-page French edition of the Watch Tower.
00:05:54 And like a zealous regular pioneer,
00:05:57 in the summer, Brother Weber worked as a woodcutter and a gardener in Switzerland
00:06:01 and then he would travel to France and to Belgium
00:06:03 to follow up on interested ones
00:06:05 who had responded to his newspaper ads.
00:06:09 He traveled extensively and gave general oversight to the work
00:06:13 in this French-speaking field in Europe
00:06:15 for over 12 years.
00:06:18 Then in 1912, Brother Russell visited Europe again
00:06:23 and he appointed a new brother who was better educated than Brother Weber
00:06:28 to be in charge of the work.
00:06:30 Do you see a potential stumbling block?
00:06:33 Absolutely.
00:06:35 But Brother Weber didn’t even flinch.
00:06:38 He humbly stepped down and was happy to do whatever he could
00:06:41 to advance Kingdom interests.
00:06:43 Interestingly, that better-educated brother
00:06:46 who replaced Brother Weber eventually left the truth
00:06:50 and so did four others who succeeded him.
00:06:53 But through all of this,
00:06:55 Brother Weber humbly kept on doing what he had done for years
00:06:59 —spreading seeds of truth to honesthearted ones in the field.
00:07:04 Is there a lesson here for us?
00:07:06 Certainly.
00:07:07 Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 23,
00:07:10 and we’ll read verse 12.
00:07:13 This scripture identifies an outstanding quality of Brother Weber.
00:07:18 Notice the results of showing this quality
00:07:22 —Matthew 23:12:
00:07:26 “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
00:07:29 and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”
00:07:35 How true this proved to be in Brother Weber’s case!
00:07:39 Brother Weber was never looking for recognition,
00:07:43 and yet his experience appears in the Proclaimers  book,
00:07:46 the 1980 Yearbook, the 1984 Yearbook,
00:07:49 and the 1987 Yearbook  because of all that good work he did in Europe.
00:07:53 The 1987 Yearbook  gave this meaningful summary
00:07:57 of Brother Weber’s life.
00:07:59 It said: “Though some had allowed feelings
00:08:02 “of self-importance to overreach them,
00:08:05 “Brother Weber had continued to serve Jehovah loyally and humbly. . . .
00:08:10 “His modesty, strong faith, and zealous service
00:08:13 “left a deep impression on all who knew him.
00:08:16 “Finally, at the age of 85,
00:08:19 he finished his earthly course in February 1948.”
00:08:24 What a fitting tribute to this humble servant of Jehovah
00:08:29 who was not quick to take offense!
00:08:33 So may we be like Brother Weber and Sister Romocean.
00:08:37 Let’s maintain a humble, modest view of ourselves
00:08:41 and stay focused on building
00:08:44 a close relationship with Jehovah.
00:08:47 If we do this, we will not be quick to take offense
00:08:51 and nothing will make us stumble.

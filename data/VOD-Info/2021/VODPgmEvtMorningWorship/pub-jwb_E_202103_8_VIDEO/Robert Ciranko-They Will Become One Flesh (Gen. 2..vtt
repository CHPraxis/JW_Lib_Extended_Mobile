Genesis 2:24 says of a man and a woman

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:06.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who marry that they are

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:08.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “become one flesh.”

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:10.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, that raises some questions:

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.929 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Whose words are those?

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What do they mean?

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we show that we believe them?

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And is there a good example
in the Bible of a couple who did?

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with looking at the context.

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d open your Bibles,
please, to Genesis chapter 2,

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:31.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll start with verse 18—Genesis 2.

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reports: “Then Jehovah God said:

00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is not good for the man
to continue to be alone.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:41.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am going to make a helper for him,
as a complement of him.’”

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continuing in verse 21:

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:48.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah God caused the man to fall
into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping,

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he took one of his ribs
and then closed up the flesh over its place.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah God built the rib
that he had taken from the man into a woman,

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he brought her to the man.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the man said:

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is at last bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh.

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This one will be called Woman,
because from man she was taken.’

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why a man will leave
his father and his mother

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will stick to his wife,
and they will become one flesh.”

00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first question is,
Whose words are these?

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam’s?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only words attributed to Adam
are when he waxed poetic in verse 23.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can see that from the opening
and closing quotation marks in that verse.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, then it must have been
Moses’ words because,

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after all,
he wrote the Bible book of Genesis.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:40.283 --> 00:01:43.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not present
at the time of the first marriage.

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not start writing
until some 2,500 years later,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even then,
he was writing what he was inspired to write.

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:56.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three Bible writers
use this expression, “one flesh”

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:59.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew, Mark, and Paul.

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s Matthew who gives us
the clue as to whose words they are.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s turn to Matthew chapter 19,

00:02:05.742 --> 00:02:07.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 19

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning with verse 4.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Matthew writes and quotes Jesus; 

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “In reply he [Jesus] said:

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Have you not read
that the one who created them

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘from the beginning made
them male and female and said:

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:34.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“For this reason a man
will leave his father and his mother

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and will stick to his wife,
and the two will be one flesh”?

00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:41.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘So that they are no longer two,
but one flesh.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, what God has yoked together,
let no man put apart.’”

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:50.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Matthew makes it clear
that Jehovah said those words.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shouldn’t that elevate in everyone’s mind

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sanctity of the marital union?

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus said, ‘God created male and female’
—two complementary genders—

00:03:01.664 --> 00:03:05.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he ‘yoked them together
in marriage as one flesh.’

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:08.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting what
<i>The Bible Exposition Commentary</i> 

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says about this:
“God established marriage,

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:15.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and therefore only God
can control its character . . .

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is a union between one man and one woman.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:22.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God did not create two men and one woman,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two women and one man,
two men, or two women.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Group marriages,’ ‘gay marriages,’

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and other variations
are contrary to the will of God, 

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what
some psychologists and jurists may say.”

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No court of law can change
what God has established.”

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those are comments we can agree with.

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:47.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our second question is, What do these
words mean: “They will become one flesh”?

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, the one-flesh relationship
certainly involves sexual union,

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it goes beyond that
because it includes a husband and wife

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have achieved mental,
emotional, and spiritual harmony.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are to have a oneness
in their purpose and desires.

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Bible translator William Barclay
renders it at Matthew 19:5:

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The husband
will be joined inseparably to his wife.”

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in marriage, a man and a woman

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to become each other’s
closest partner in life.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being “one flesh” means that they must always

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be thinking more
of each other than of themselves,

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they must consider
each other in everything they do.

00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when single people marry,
they need to shift

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their thinking from mine to ours,

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from me to we.

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:42.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they must stop being single at heart

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and come to be married at heart,
not just on paper.

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:47.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our third question is,

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we show
that we believe these words?

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:52.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sad to say, many people these days

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take a very casual attitude toward marriage,

00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:57.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when the relationship becomes strained,

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they just give up and walk out on their mate.

00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not the Christian way.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriage is to be a lifelong relationship.

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few verses later on at Matthew 19:9,

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:13.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus taught that the only Scriptural ground
for dissolving marriage

00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when an innocent mate

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses not to forgive an adulterous partner.

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is because sexual relations
outside the marriage bond

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a gross perversion
of the one-flesh union.

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:29.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s read Paul’s words about this

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians chapter 6

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Corinthians 6:16;

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Do you not know
that anyone who is joined to a prostitute

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is one body with her?

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:48.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For ‘the two,’ says he,
‘will be one flesh.’”

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:51.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the adulterer pulls away
from his marriage mate

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes himself
one flesh with a third person.

00:05:55.638 --> 00:05:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That, then,
is the only Scriptural basis for divorce.

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But divorce is a very painful experience.

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:06.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one sociologist put it,
“Divorce is drastic surgery.”

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To sever the one-flesh bond
between husband and wife

00:06:10.586 --> 00:06:13.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be like sawing oneself asunder.

00:06:14.424 --> 00:06:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, if no adultery
has been committed?

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if, for some reason,
two people who are married to each other

00:06:19.695 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just don’t like each other any longer?

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Divorce is not an option.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, they need to remind themselves
of what attracted them to each other

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work at rekindling those feelings,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time
looking to Jehovah for help 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in not only strengthening their marriage

00:06:36.245 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also their spirituality.

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our fourth question is,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Scriptural example
is there of a married couple

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who believed this one-flesh idea?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Romans 16:3, please,

00:06:51.961 --> 00:06:56.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 16:3; here Paul writes: 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give my greetings
to Prisca [or Priscilla] and Aquila,

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.”

00:07:03.706 --> 00:07:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Aquila and Priscilla
—what a model of a close and united couple

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:11.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living up to what Jehovah meant
when he said that a husband or wife

00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should become one flesh!

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Paul, who worked closely with them,

00:07:16.285 --> 00:07:18.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not think of that dear brother

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:22.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without recalling
the faithful cooperation of his wife.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:25.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a fine example
for Christian couples today.

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:28.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in every one
of the six references to this couple

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
we find them working together, 

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cooperating without competition or strife.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And never is one mentioned without the other.

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They constantly worked together
in their home,

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their secular work, in the ministry.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And surely it was the time
spent together in Christian activities

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that kept their marriage
on a high spiritual plane,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working side by side
to further the Kingdom work.

Now, you and your marriage mate may be apart

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for much of the day
due to different work and responsibilities.

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you find time each day
to eat meals together,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do household chores together,
to take walks together,

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be together to get caught up

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:14.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what has gone on
in your lives during the day?

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aquila and Priscilla proved that being united

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in activities related to true worship

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can keep a couple’s thinking
and goals aligned,

00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that does strengthen a marriage.

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, studying together,

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating
in congregation meetings together,

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing in the ministry together,
praying together,

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing all of that,

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a person’s interests, priorities, and habits

00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will harmonize with those
of one’s spouse until,

00:08:44.907 --> 00:08:47.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Aquila and Priscilla,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we increasingly think, feel,

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act as one flesh.

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:54.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we know who said the words.

00:08:54.717 --> 00:08:56.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah.

00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We understand what they mean
—achieving harmony

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:01.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one’s relationship with one’s mate.

00:09:01.824 --> 00:09:05.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can certainly prove
that we believe these words

00:09:05.328 --> 00:09:10.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by staying close to our mate
and maintaining our marriage bond.

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:14.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we have that excellent example
of Aquila and Priscilla to abide by.

00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus mean

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when he said: “I give you my peace”?

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What was the peace

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus gave to his disciples?

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.366 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower </i>

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2009, October 15, page 9,

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a very, very nice definition.

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:27.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what it said:
“The peace that Christ leaves

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:31.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with his disciples is the inner calm

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:36.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they experience
when they feel that they are loved

00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and approved by Jehovah God

00:00:40.223 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his beloved Son.”

00:00:43.393 --> 00:00:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did you get that definition?

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The inner calm [that] they experience

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when they feel that they
are loved and approved

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah God and his beloved Son.”

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful definition!

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even more so, what a beautiful gift

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the peace that Jesus gives

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all of those who are his true disciples!

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we begin to feel

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re losing our inner peace?

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to get it back

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to maintain it?

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are important questions.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk in our discussion this morning

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about three things that could cause us

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin to lose that feeling of inner peace.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the first one:

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubting that Jehovah

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really loves and approves us.

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:43.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when we go
through periods of discouragement

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps periods of increased anxiety,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may begin to feel
that no one really loves us,

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:53.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no one appreciates us.

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that can even extend to Jehovah.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin to feel, ‘Well, I don’t even think
Jehovah loves me anymore.’

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, that’s just exactly

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Satan the Devil wants us to think.

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if we convince ourselves that Jehovah

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t love us and he doesn’t approve us,

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, then we’re going to give up

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we’re not going
to continue on in our race for life.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can we fight back against this?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have to reassure ourselves

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah really does love us.

00:02:31.134 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to sense how precious we are to God.

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s just think
about one simple thought

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might encourage us along this way.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go in our Bibles.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at 1 Chronicles

00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:48.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 28 and verse 9.

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ll notice

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about midway down the verse

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:02.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah searches through all hearts,

00:03:02.165 --> 00:03:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he discerns

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every inclination of the thoughts.”

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about that.

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as Jehovah is searching

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through all the hearts
that are on this planet,

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you imagine
the horrible things that Jehovah sees?

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about when Jehovah

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes to a heart like yours?

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he sees a heart that has love for him,

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:32.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in fear of him,

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, can you imagine how joyful

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is to see a heart like that?

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:42.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might say to yourself:
‘I’m not important.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m not special.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I don’t do anything that’s noteworthy.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would Jehovah take notice of me?’

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, let’s look at another
simple thought that might encourage you;

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:57.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s Malachi chapter 3

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 16.

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:03.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just notice what it says here:

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that time those who fear Jehovah

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“spoke with one another,

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one with his companion,

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Jehovah kept paying attention
and listening.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And a book of remembrance
was written before him

00:04:20.743 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for those fearing Jehovah

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for those meditating on his name.”

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, when we read this verse,

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you notice that these ones
that Jehovah noticed

00:04:32.822 --> 00:04:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were doing anything major
or profound or outstanding?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the verse just says that “those who

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[were in fear of] Jehovah
spoke with one another.”

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what we do all day long,
isn’t it?

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s via <i>Zoom,</i>

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re constantly speaking
with one another

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our love for God.

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah pays attention,
and what does he do?

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the verse goes on to say
that he writes the names

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of “those [who are] fearing” him,
“those meditating on his name.”

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He writes them in his “book of remembrance,”
his “book of life.”

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wonderful!

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How amazing that Jehovah
would take care to notice us!

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, you don’t have to do anything
major, profound, outstanding.

00:05:23.206 --> 00:05:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you fear God, if you love him,
Jehovah loves you.

00:05:27.744 --> 00:05:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He views you as someone precious.

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So accept Jehovah’s love.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t fight it.

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t think of all the reasons
why you can’t be loved by God.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept it.

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when those anxious thoughts
flood into your mind

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:47.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you begin to doubt your value
and you begin to feel:

00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m just not worth— I’m worthless,

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or I don’t have any value with Jehovah,’

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:56.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, follow the advice here
in Philippians chapter 4.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a well-known scripture,
but we need to keep reading it

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this is a recipe for success,

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 4:6;

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:11.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Do not be anxious over anything,

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplication along with thanksgiving,

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:21.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your petitions be made known to God.”

00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the point?

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:28.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, brothers,
during these times of pandemic

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there are so many trials
going on in our lives,

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:34.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may feel an increased amount of anxiety.

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to pour out our heart to Jehovah.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:42.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just a matter of saying,
“Jehovah, I’m feeling anxious”

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we need to linger in prayer

00:06:44.921 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really talk to Jehovah

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how we’re feeling
and really express all the fears,

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the concerns, that we have.

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, do you notice
that other detail in verse 6?

00:06:56.732 --> 00:06:59.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “along with thanksgiving.”

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to take time
to thank Jehovah for all our blessings.

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, if you start
in prayer to thank Jehovah

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all the blessings you have in your life,

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to take you some time because,
really, we have so many blessings

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we just take time
to ponder them and thank Jehovah.

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we do that, what happens?

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to verse 7,
we experience that “peace of God,”

00:07:23.493 --> 00:07:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that inner peace,
that calms those anxious feelings.

00:07:27.597 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the second thing
that can rob us of our inner peace?

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s comparing ourselves with others.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, this really can be
another form of questioning

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:41.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s love for us.

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, it can be like saying:

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:47.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think Jehovah loves
that brother more than me.

00:07:47.817 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I see that brother, that sister;
they have privileges I don’t have,

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so maybe Jehovah doesn’t love me
as much as he loves them.”

00:07:56.893 --> 00:08:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s another recipe for disaster,
isn’t it?

00:08:00.763 --> 00:08:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we grew up in a situation
where we were always compared with others.

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:07.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did your parents say to you things like:

00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why can’t you be like your brother?

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t you be like Brother Elder’s son?”

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we listened to that all the time
we were growing up,

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe we have that tendency now

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compare ourselves with others.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:23.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what is the principle

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Galatians 6:4?

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us that we should
“examine [our] own actions,

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then [we’ll have] cause for rejoicing

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:39.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in regard to [ourselves] alone,
and not in comparison

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:41.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the other person.”

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:47.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to set our own personal goals.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:51.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to get joy and satisfaction
from reaching those goals

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the gifts that Jehovah has given us

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then use those gifts

00:08:57.053 --> 00:09:00.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen and encourage
and build up others.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:05.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that way, you see,
we stop comparing ourselves with others,

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:09.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we find joy in seeing what we have

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:14.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we can give to Jehovah
and to our brothers and sisters.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us to maintain our inner peace.

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then here’s the last one:

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filling our minds

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with negative information.

00:09:25.581 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we always want to “keep on the watch”
—that’s true—

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a steady diet
of the sad, divisive, angry,

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hate-filled information

00:09:36.525 --> 00:09:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just is flooding the news media today

00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:41.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can begin to wear us down,

00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can begin to feel
our inner peace going away

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of all of this negative information.

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:51.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we need to do?

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we might have to turn it off.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:57.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might have to put a limit
on how much we watch.

00:09:57.413 --> 00:09:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the same time,

00:09:59.448 --> 00:10:03.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to fill our minds
with positive, encouraging ideas.

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:06.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Psalm 94:19,

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you remember what Jehovah promised here?

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Psalm 94

00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:14.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 19.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

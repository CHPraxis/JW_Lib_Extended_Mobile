00:00:01 Well, I think we would agree
00:00:03 that it’s very heart-warming to know
00:00:05 that we serve a God of comfort,
00:00:08 and he provides us with so many reminders
00:00:10 that highlight the need for us to encourage,
00:00:13 strengthen, and comfort one another.
00:00:16 Especially now in the times in which we live,
00:00:19 because none of us know the full weight
00:00:22 of what our brothers here in the Bethel family
00:00:25 and our congregations might be facing or dealing with.
00:00:28 So having and showing empathy
00:00:32 and fellow feeling toward one another is so important.
00:00:37 Perhaps a good example of how not to show comfort and fellow feeling
00:00:42 is described for us by Job’s three comforters.
00:00:46 You might recall that they were so busy judging him
00:00:49 and giving Job speeches
00:00:51 that they failed to take the time to understand him
00:00:55 and to show fellow feeling.
00:00:57 In fact, in all the talking they did,
00:01:00 not once do we read that they even addressed Job by name.
00:01:05 The Watchtower  made a statement regarding these comforters.
00:01:09 It said: “Evidently they viewed [Job]
00:01:12 more as a problem than as a person.”
00:01:17 Now, how do you think that treatment made Job feel?
00:01:20 Turn with me in your Bibles to Job chapter 19,
00:01:27 and we’ll listen to Job’s words
00:01:30 —Job 19:2.
00:01:37 He says:  “How long will you keep irritating my soul,
00:01:42 crushing me with words?”
00:01:46 How sad!
00:01:48 Instead of providing encouragement and comfort,
00:01:52 those companions only made Job feel irritated,
00:01:56 crushed, and frustrated.
00:02:00 Well, doesn’t this highlight that if we don’t give thoughts
00:02:03 to our words and actions,
00:02:06 if we view our brother more as a problem than as a person,
00:02:11 then we’re not going to be able to provide them
00:02:13 with the comfort and support they may need?
00:02:17 Perhaps we might work with or we’re in the congregation
00:02:21 with someone that has faults or traits that bother us,
00:02:25 and it may be that these faults
00:02:28 are actually legitimate causes of concern.
00:02:31 But in our dealings with them,
00:02:34 if those faults are the only things that we can see,
00:02:37 if that’s the only thing we focus on,
00:02:40 then it’s going to be very difficult
00:02:42 for us to see them as a faithful fellow worker of Jehovah.
00:02:47 More than likely, all that we’re going to see
00:02:49 is someone who is an obstacle or impediment to our work,
00:02:54 someone who is affecting or impacting our production and joy.
00:02:59 And certainly, we’re not going to feel good
00:03:03 because now we’ve developed negative feelings about our brother,
00:03:06 and our brother is likely going to feel the spirit that we give off.
00:03:11 How is that going to affect them?
00:03:14 Well, like Job, likely they’re going to be frustrated and irritated,
00:03:19 and we’ve only added to their anxiety.
00:03:22 Well, obviously, none of us want to have that sort of effect on our brothers,
00:03:26 and that’s why Paul’s words to the Thessalonians
00:03:31 are a good example worthy of imitation.
00:03:34 When we look at this congregation
00:03:36 —practically from the beginning,
00:03:38 the congregation that was established in Thessalonica—
00:03:41 those brothers and sisters experienced persecution.
00:03:45 In Acts chapter 17,
00:03:47 it mentions that fanatical Jews stirred up mob violence,
00:03:50 prompting the brothers to send Paul and Silas away
00:03:52 for their personal safety.
00:03:55 Another issue that was affecting the congregation
00:03:57 was that they seemingly expressed great sorrow
00:04:01 over losing ones of their number in death.
00:04:05 So now think about that. You have the full picture.
00:04:07 Here you have a brand new congregation,
00:04:09 and they’re feeling the heat and pressure
00:04:11 of intense persecution from the outside,
00:04:15 and then on the inside,
00:04:18 they’re feeling the pain of losing loved ones in death.
00:04:23 Is that congregation in need of comfort and encouragement?
00:04:28 Without question.
00:04:30 But interestingly, in the midst of all of this persecution and sadness,
00:04:35 it was also discovered that those Christians
00:04:37 were dealing and struggling with some personal weaknesses.
00:04:41 When you look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4,
00:04:44 there they were counseled to abstain from fornication,
00:04:47 to love one another in fuller measure,
00:04:50 to mind their own business, to work with their hands.
00:04:53 Then in chapter 5, to stay awake spiritually
00:04:56 and to abstain from every form of wickedness
00:04:59 and a number of other matters that needed attention.
00:05:03 Now, each of those matters
00:05:05 were all legitimate causes of concern.
00:05:09 In fact, Paul felt this was so urgent
00:05:12 that he sent them a second letter which closely followed his first.
00:05:18 But what was Paul going to focus on?
00:05:21 Would he focus on the problem
00:05:24 or the people?
00:05:26 Turn with me, please, to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.
00:05:29 Let’s note how Paul begins this chapter.
00:05:32 Second Thessalonians chapter 1,
00:05:37 and we’ll read his words beginning in verse 3.
00:05:43 He says: “We are obligated always to give thanks to God for you, brothers.
00:05:48 “This is fitting,  because your faith is growing exceedingly
00:05:53 “and the love of each and every one of you is increasing toward one another.
00:05:58 “As a result we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God
00:06:02 “because of your endurance and faith in all your persecutions
00:06:06 and the hardships that you are suffering.”
00:06:10 How beautiful!
00:06:11 Did you note that Paul starts with specific commendation?
00:06:14 Yes, there were problems that needed to be addressed,
00:06:17 but he starts with their good qualities
00:06:21 —what they were doing right.
00:06:23 Can you and I do the same in our dealings with our brothers?
00:06:28 Instead of first thinking about what they’re doing wrong,
00:06:31 what do they do right?
00:06:33 What do we appreciate about them?
00:06:35 Isn’t it so much better to focus on their good traits?
00:06:40 The benefits of doing this is that it helps us to develop
00:06:44 genuine personal interest in our brothers.
00:06:48 Because if our brothers can sense that we truly care about them,
00:06:52 then it actually puts us in a better position
00:06:54 to assist them with any matters that may need adjustment.
00:06:58 And what we’ll find is that this personal interest
00:07:01 can start with something as simple as acknowledgement.
00:07:05 You’ll recall that Job’s false comforters didn’t even address Job by name.
00:07:10 But with the young man Elihu,
00:07:12 when he was given the opportunity to speak
00:07:15 (when addressing Job),
00:07:17 he respectfully addressed him by name.
00:07:21 At Job 33:1,
00:07:23 Elihu begins his words by saying:
00:07:25 “Job, please hear my words.”
00:07:30 And there were many other verses
00:07:32 where he used Job’s personal name as well.
00:07:36 I think we’d agree that sometimes it can be so easy
00:07:38 (especially for us as brothers),
00:07:40 to get into work mode, business mode
00:07:43 —where we’re just so focused on getting information,
00:07:46 whether it’s here at Bethel or in the congregation—
00:07:49 that we could completely forget to acknowledge
00:07:52 or even greet the brother in front of us.
00:07:56 So what a beautiful reminder we learn from Elihu!
00:08:01 Now, if we go back to Paul,
00:08:03 after his commendation in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1,
00:08:07 he starts chapter 2 of 2 Thessalonians with the word
00:08:11 “however.”
00:08:13 So now there’s a contrast; there’s a shift in wording,
00:08:16 and he begins to address the problem that some had developed
00:08:19 regarding a wrong view of Christ’s presence.
00:08:22 So we learn from this that Paul did not sugarcoat or overlook
00:08:27 issues that needed to be addressed.
00:08:30 He handled them.
00:08:32 But he did it in such a way
00:08:34 that the brothers were still able to feel
00:08:36 his loving care and concern.
00:08:39 In fact, if you look in verse 13,
00:08:42 you’ll notice he uses the word “however” again.
00:08:46 So another shift,
00:08:48 but this time shifting back to words of empathy, love,
00:08:52 and exhortation for his brothers.
00:08:55 Paul was convinced, he had a positive conviction,
00:08:59 that his brothers would do the right thing.
00:09:02 So in review,
00:09:04 if we want to be a source of comfort and encouragement to our brothers,
00:09:09 how important it is that we see them
00:09:12 not as a problem,
00:09:14 not as an impediment to our work,
00:09:16 but as our fellow worker.
00:09:19 And instead of judging, we commend
00:09:22 —showing genuine personal interest and acknowledgement.
00:09:25 And if there is a legitimate issue of concern,
00:09:29 well, we can lovingly address what needs to be addressed.
00:09:33 But let’s always be remembered more for our encouragement than our counsel.
00:09:38 And if we’re able to do this, then our brothers are going to love us
00:09:42 for the way that we deal with them.
00:09:44 But more important, our Heavenly Father,
00:09:47 our God of comfort will love us as well.

00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:03.186 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, I think we would agree

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s very heart-warming to know

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:08.425 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we serve a God of comfort,

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he provides us with so many reminders

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:13.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that highlight the need for us to encourage,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
strengthen, and comfort one another.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Especially now in the times in which we live,

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because none of us know the full weight

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what our brothers
here in the Bethel family

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our congregations
might be facing or dealing with.

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having and showing empathy

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fellow feeling
toward one another is so important.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps a good example of how not to show
comfort and fellow feeling

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:46.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described for us
by Job’s three comforters.

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might recall
that they were so busy judging him

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving Job speeches

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they failed to take the time
to understand him

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to show fellow feeling.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in all the talking they did,

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:04.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not once do we read
that they even addressed Job by name.

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:09.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made a statement
regarding these comforters.

00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:12.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Evidently they viewed [Job]

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more as a problem than as a person.”

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:20.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how do you think
that treatment made Job feel?

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles
to Job chapter 19,

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll listen to Job’s words

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Job 19:2.

00:01:37.647 --> 00:01:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: 
“How long will you keep irritating my soul,

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crushing me with words?”

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad!

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of providing
encouragement and comfort,

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those companions
only made Job feel irritated,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crushed, and frustrated.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, doesn’t this highlight
that if we don’t give thoughts

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our words and actions,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:11.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we view our brother
more as a problem than as a person,

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:13.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re not going
to be able to provide them

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the comfort
and support they may need?

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:21.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we might work with
or we’re in the congregation

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:25.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with someone that has faults
or traits that bother us,

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may be that these faults

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:31.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actually legitimate causes of concern.

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:34.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in our dealings with them,

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if those faults
are the only things that we can see,

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that’s the only thing we focus on,

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:42.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it’s going to be very difficult

00:02:42.278 --> 00:02:47.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to see them
as a faithful fellow worker of Jehovah.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than likely,
all that we’re going to see

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is someone who is an obstacle
or impediment to our work,

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:59.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone who is affecting
or impacting our production and joy.

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly,
we’re not going to feel good

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now we’ve developed
negative feelings about our brother,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brother is likely going
to feel the spirit that we give off.

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that going to affect them?

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:19.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Job, likely they’re going
to be frustrated and irritated,

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:21.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve only added to their anxiety.

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, obviously, none of us want to have
that sort of effect on our brothers,

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why Paul’s words
to the Thessalonians

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are a good example worthy of imitation.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look at this congregation

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—practically from the beginning,

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation
that was established in Thessalonica—

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those brothers and sisters
experienced persecution.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Acts chapter 17,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it mentions that fanatical Jews
stirred up mob violence,

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prompting the brothers
to send Paul and Silas away

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their personal safety.

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another issue
that was affecting the congregation

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that they
seemingly expressed great sorrow

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over losing ones of their number in death.

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now think about that.
You have the full picture.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you have a brand new congregation,

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re feeling the heat and pressure

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:15.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense persecution from the outside,

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then on the inside,

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re feeling the pain
of losing loved ones in death.

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that congregation in need
of comfort and encouragement?

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without question.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But interestingly, in the midst
of all of this persecution and sadness,

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was also discovered that those Christians

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were dealing and struggling
with some personal weaknesses.

00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:44.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4,

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:47.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there they were counseled
to abstain from fornication,

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love one another in fuller measure,

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:53.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mind their own business,
to work with their hands.

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in chapter 5,
to stay awake spiritually

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:59.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to abstain from every form of wickedness

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a number of other matters
that needed attention.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, each of those matters

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were all legitimate causes of concern.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Paul felt this was so urgent

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:16.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he sent them a second letter
which closely followed his first.

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was Paul going to focus on?

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he focus on the problem

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:26.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the people?

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:29.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me, please,
to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1.

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s note how Paul begins this chapter.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read his words
beginning in verse 3.

00:05:43.493 --> 00:05:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We are obligated always
to give thanks to God for you, brothers.

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is fitting, 
because your faith is growing exceedingly

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love of each and every one of you
is increasing toward one another.

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a result we ourselves take pride in you
among the congregations of God

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of your endurance
and faith in all your persecutions

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the hardships that you are suffering.”

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:11.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautiful!

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note that Paul starts
with specific commendation?

00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there were problems
that needed to be addressed,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he starts with their good qualities

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they were doing right.

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you and I do the same
in our dealings with our brothers?

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:31.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of first thinking
about what they’re doing wrong,

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do they do right?

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we appreciate about them?

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it so much better
to focus on their good traits?

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The benefits of doing this
is that it helps us to develop

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
genuine personal interest in our brothers.

00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:52.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if our brothers
can sense that we truly care about them,

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it actually puts us in a better position

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:58.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist them with any matters
that may need adjustment.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what we’ll find
is that this personal interest

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:04.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can start with something
as simple as acknowledgement.

00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recall that Job’s false comforters
didn’t even address Job by name.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with the young man Elihu,

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was given the opportunity to speak

00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(when addressing Job),

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he respectfully addressed him by name.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 33:1,

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elihu begins his words by saying:

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Job, please hear my words.”

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were many other verses

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:35.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he used Job’s personal name as well.

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:38.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think we’d agree
that sometimes it can be so easy

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(especially for us as brothers),

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get into work mode, business mode

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:46.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—where we’re just so focused
on getting information,

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s here at Bethel
or in the congregation—

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:52.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could completely forget
to acknowledge

00:07:52.955 --> 00:07:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even greet
the brother in front of us.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what a beautiful reminder
we learn from Elihu!

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we go back to Paul,

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after his commendation
in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:11.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he starts chapter 2
of 2 Thessalonians with the word

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“however.”

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now there’s a contrast;
there’s a shift in wording,

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he begins to address
the problem that some had developed

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:22.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding a wrong view of Christ’s presence.

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we learn from this
that Paul did not sugarcoat or overlook

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
issues that needed to be addressed.

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He handled them.

00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did it in such a way

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the brothers were still able to feel

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:39.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his loving care and concern.

00:08:39.835 --> 00:08:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if you look in verse 13,

00:08:42.905 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice he uses
the word “however” again.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:48.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So another shift,

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time shifting back
to words of empathy, love,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exhortation for his brothers.

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:59.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was convinced,
he had a positive conviction,

00:08:59.488 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his brothers would do the right thing.

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review,

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:09.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we want to be a source
of comfort and encouragement to our brothers,

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how important it is that we see them

00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as a problem,

00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:16.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as an impediment to our work,

00:09:16.672 --> 00:09:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as our fellow worker.

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of judging, we commend

00:09:22.211 --> 00:09:25.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—showing genuine personal interest
and acknowledgement.

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if there is
a legitimate issue of concern,

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:33.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we can lovingly address
what needs to be addressed.

00:09:33.122 --> 00:09:38.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s always be remembered more
for our encouragement than our counsel.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re able to do this,
then our brothers are going to love us

00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way that we deal with them.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more important, our Heavenly Father,

00:09:47.737 --> 00:09:51.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God of comfort will love us as well.

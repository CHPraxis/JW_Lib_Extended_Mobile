00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:03.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, the theme of my discussion is

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.890 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Despite Changing Circumstances,

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Always See the Big Picture.”

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression,

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.498 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“He can’t see the forest for the trees.”

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is referring to a person

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is too involved
in the details of a problem

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the situation as a whole.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a dangerous problem for anyone,

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but especially one of Jehovah’s people.

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what the circumstances,

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:33.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to always see the “big picture.”

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first sentence
in today’s <i>Watchtower</i>  comments says this:

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Philip the evangelizer

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“provides a fine example

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of one who stayed focused on [the] ministry

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite changing circumstances.”

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for us, just like Philip,

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the big picture is always Jehovah’s thinking

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see Jehovah’s view of the situation.

00:00:58.374 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s thinking, or Jehovah’s viewpoint,

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so lofty—isn’t it?—so elevated.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:06.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to Isaiah, please,

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chapter 55,

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice
what is said here about the altitude

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:13.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s thinking.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says in verse 9:

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For as the heavens
are higher than the earth,

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:22.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so my ways are higher than your ways

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:25.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my thoughts than your thoughts.”

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, viewpoint
really does make a difference, doesn’t it?

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes a huge difference.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if you walk up
to the World Trade Center building

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the sidewalk and look up,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s overwhelming—intimidating.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, if you fly over
the World Trade Center building 

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an airplane and look out the window at it,

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it looks like a matchstick
stuck in the ground.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, viewpoint makes a difference.

00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another illustration:

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:54.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you’re lost in a complex maze.

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, overhead, though,

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:01.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a trusted friend in a helicopter.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that friend could easily direct you
to safety, is that not true?

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:08.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in this illustration,
our trusted friend

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the elevated view is,
of course, Jehovah.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
while you’re still looking at this picture,

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let me read to you, please, Jehovah’s words

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 30:21—his promise.

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “And your own ears
will hear a word behind you saying,

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the way.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Walk in it,’ in case you
should go to the right

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we make
Jehovah’s thinking our thinking,

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah will safely guide us
through any situation.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what makes it challenging
to always see the big picture?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we touched on
—changing circumstances.

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 7:31:

00:02:53.056 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The scene of this world is changing.”

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, we could say the scene
of our lives is constantly changing.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s talk
about some changing circumstances

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could come our way
before the end of this system

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we want
to always see the big picture.

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one is a change of residence.

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:16.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we touched on, that happened to Philip.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was forced out of Jerusalem
because of intense persecution.

00:03:21.317 --> 00:03:24.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He ended up in Samaria,
but he saw the big picture there.

00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew he didn’t have to be
in Jerusalem to preach.

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have to be
in Jerusalem to serve Jehovah.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could do it in Samaria,
and he did so—powerfully.

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably the most outstanding example

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a change of residence is Jesus.

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:43.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He left his heavenly abode
of billions of years

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live on this little tiny earth.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But obviously, he always saw the big picture

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making Jehovah’s thinking his thinking.

00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:55.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and Sarah
were another excellent example

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a drastic change in residence.

00:03:57.854 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that may happen to us.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have a change of residence,

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either by no choice of our own or by choice.

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may choose to move
and serve where the need is greater.

00:04:08.898 --> 00:04:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have to move
to care for family responsibilities.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know of a Bethel couple
who served at Bethel almost 25 years.

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to leave to care
for a father who had dementia,

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they continue to see the big picture.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew that you can preach,
you can go to meetings,

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can read God’s Word,
and you can serve Jehovah wherever you live.

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:34.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another changing circumstance:

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You develop chronic health problems,

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps problems that will only
be corrected by Jehovah’s new world.

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in this vein,
think for a moment about Job.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was struck with cancerous boils

00:04:48.404 --> 00:04:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the crown of his head
to the soles of his feet

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:55.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—brought to within one inch of death.

00:04:55.578 --> 00:04:57.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wished that he was dead.

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, he saw the big picture, didn’t he?

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve got to keep my integrity
to Jehovah no matter what.’

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:07.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even said at Job 27:5:

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Until I die,
I will not renounce my integrity.”

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he had no idea
that he would be restored to good health.

00:05:15.465 --> 00:05:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he knew that if he kept his integrity,
he would be resurrected.

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would call him,
and he would answer from the grave.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the same with us.

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may develop chronic health problems.

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:31.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may even die
before the end of this system.

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:33.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we keep our integrity,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such an individual will take a quick nap

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:38.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, from his perspective,

00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:41.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instantaneously open his eyes
in the new world

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—if he keeps his integrity, like Job.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:46.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about this:

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:49.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how long
we have to suffer some illness,

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s momentary

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to the permanency
of perfect health in Jehovah’s new world.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what 2 Corinthians 4:17 says:

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:02.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[yet] it works out for us a glory
that is . . . everlasting.”

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we keep our eyes on the big picture

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maintain integrity—
we can trade a moment of pain

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an eternity of perfect health.

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say, “An ounce of suffering

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for gigatons of pleasure.”

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of that: A gigaton

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a billion tons compared to an ounce.

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:31.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another changing circumstance:

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:36.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encounter perceived injustice
in the congregation.

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you notice we said “perceived,”

00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because often things are not the way
we see them to be.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t read hearts.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have all the facts.

00:06:46.756 --> 00:06:50.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often our view is like trying
to look into a large house

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the front door
that’s cracked open one inch (2.5 cm).

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a very limited view.

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So seeing the big picture,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll recognize
that we don’t have all the facts.

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing the big picture,

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:04.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll recognize who
does have all the facts—Jehovah.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is “naked
and openly exposed” to him.

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus—Revelation 2:1 refers to him 

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as having “the seven stars
[the elders] in his right hand

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and [walking about]
among the seven golden lampstands.”

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus, the head of the congregation,
has the facts.

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:26.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once we’ve done what’s in our jurisdiction

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps reporting the matter—

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing the big picture,
we’ll leave it in the hands

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who have all the facts,

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that they
will take care of this matter.

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it truly is an injustice,

00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will take care of it
in their time and their way.

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another changing circumstance:

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:47.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We come face-to-face with some temptation.

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:51.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in a case like this,
we want to be nothing like Eve.

00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:54.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She obviously didn’t see the big picture,
did she?

00:07:54.757 --> 00:07:57.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If she had, she would have realized,

00:07:57.527 --> 00:08:00.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This serpent has done nothing for me.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah has done everything for me.

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:06.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘In a contradictory situation,
who, obviously,

00:08:06.335 --> 00:08:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be telling me the truth?’

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we want to be like Jesus.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was tempted by the Devil,

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:14.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw the big picture
—didn’t he?—

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the issue of universal sovereignty.

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’re tempted to look at pornography,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listen to apostate ideas,

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flirt with someone who’s not our mate
(just a few examples),

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s pause, elevate our thinking,

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make Jehovah’s thinking our thinking,

00:08:32.662 --> 00:08:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s see the big picture.

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:39.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the big picture is that Satan
is trying to get the thin edge of a wedge

00:08:39.068 --> 00:08:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into our suit of armor.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:44.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anything this world has to offer

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot begin to equal the value
of our relationship with Jehovah

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:50.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our place in his new world.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll also be able to fast-forward
if we see the big picture

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the horrible consequences

00:08:56.719 --> 00:08:59.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving in to temptation.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s one more changing circumstance:
We’re persecuted.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this can go from ridicule

00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being threatened with execution
or even being executed.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of David for just a moment.

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:18.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was ridiculed,
and he was threatened with death by Goliath.

00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:21.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even though David saw how big he was,

00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David saw the big picture, didn’t he?

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw how puny, how wimpy

00:09:26.682 --> 00:09:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Goliath was compared
to Jehovah, the Almighty.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the big picture has to always include

00:09:32.888 --> 00:09:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the almighty God, Jehovah.

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, we’ll be able to fast-forward
to see the horrible consequences

00:09:39.128 --> 00:09:42.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of compromising if we’re persecuted.

00:09:42.198 --> 00:09:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
we’ll see the wonderful blessings

00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:47.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep our integrity.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not compromise.

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:53.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, even if we’re threatened with death
or we’re executed,

00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:57.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we see the big picture, we’ll realize

00:09:57.213 --> 00:10:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan has just handed us
a validated passport

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right into the new world.

00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that is the big picture.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ve talked
about seeing the big picture

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:09.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you have a change of residence,

00:10:09.725 --> 00:10:12.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your health deteriorates,

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you encounter a perceived injustice,

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:17.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you come face-to-face with temptation,

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:19.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you are persecuted.

00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these are just a few examples.

00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may not always be easy

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the big picture
in challenging circumstances.

00:10:27.476 --> 00:10:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the key is to make
Jehovah’s thinking our thinking

00:10:31.847 --> 00:10:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pause, elevate our thinking,
view it from Jehovah’s standpoint.

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:41.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result will be protection
and blessings coming our way 

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise going Jehovah’s way.

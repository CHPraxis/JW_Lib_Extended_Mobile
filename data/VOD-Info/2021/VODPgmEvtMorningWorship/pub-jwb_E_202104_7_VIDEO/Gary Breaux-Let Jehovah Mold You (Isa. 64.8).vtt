00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:04.788 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our scripture here, Isaiah 64:8,

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
clearly establishes

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:09.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God is the Potter

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:10.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the Great Potter, in fact—

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.929 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we are the clay.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, in what way is he molding us?

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:20.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way is through adjusting

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian personality.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does he do that?

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:30.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he uses his Word
—the Bible—

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his holy spirit,

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Christian congregation.

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we’re going to do is talk

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:42.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how Jehovah helps
to mold our personality.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the process that’s used?

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to talk about two aspects
of the Christian personality

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—humility and kindness.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we said one way Jehovah uses

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold our personality
is his Word, the Bible.

00:01:00.443 --> 00:01:03.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 4:12 says

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Word has tremendous power.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we take individual scriptures
as we are reading it;

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look at our own personality:

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does it say about me?

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I improve?’

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example: humility.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are going to go to Philippians chapter 2,

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3 and 4.

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see how this is a powerful aid to us.

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what we should do,

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2:3, 4:

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:42.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with humility

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:47.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“consider others superior to you,

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as you look not only for your own interests,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:55.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we read this scripture,
we look at ourselves and say:

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:02.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, how am I doing with this?

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I see that I have made progress,

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:08.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘especially if this has been
an issue in the past?

00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is Jehovah somehow nudging me,
adjusting me,

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:16.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
molding me by means
of this powerful scripture?’

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:19.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself about humility:

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:23.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I the person that always seems
to be in charge?

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I give that attitude across to others?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, as it says here,
Do I view others as superior?’

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe even we’re saying,

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I admit that that sister
has more patience than I have,”

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “That brother is really
a better teacher than I am.”

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see, by means
of individual scriptures,

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:50.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God can help to mold our thinking.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:53.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in addition to the individual scripture,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible also provides examples

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that quality in action.

00:03:01.564 --> 00:03:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the <i>Watchtower</i>  comment for today

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses Christ Jesus as an example of humility.

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:12.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s open to that scripture
(it’s referred to)

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Luke chapter 22.

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:17.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read the account,

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think: ‘What can I learn?

00:03:19.382 --> 00:03:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How did he handle it?

00:03:21.084 --> 00:03:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I apply it?’

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Luke 22:24

00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:28.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this took place
the evening before his death.

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “However, there also arose
a heated dispute among them

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:34.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over which one of them
was considered to be the greatest.”

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, automatically we see
there’s a problem of humility here.

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so, let’s move down now

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to verses 26 and 27.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “You, though,
are not to be that way.

00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let the one
who is the greatest among you

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become as the youngest,

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:58.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the one taking the lead
as the one ministering.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For which one is greater,

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one dining or the one serving?

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it not the one dining?

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I am among you as the one serving.”

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were not just words,
because the apostles had seen

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three and a half years of a beautiful example

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:23.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus serving others
—truly a humble man.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And through our Bible reading too,

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:29.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have seen this example of humility
that we can apply.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good for us to ask ourselves:

00:04:32.555 --> 00:04:35.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I a proud person?

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I give off that impression to others?

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I view myself as “one dining”

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as “one serving”?’

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, another way that Jehovah uses

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold our Christian personality

00:04:53.843 --> 00:04:55.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the holy spirit.

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:57.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does that work?

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:02.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at Galatians 5:19,

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talks about “the works of the flesh.”

00:05:05.955 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 22,

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it refers to “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“works of the flesh,”
“fruitage of the spirit.”

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:17.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, work

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a result of what one does.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:24.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the product of your actions.

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the apostle Paul lists,
as you see there, under “works of the flesh,”

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
various results that come

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of a conscious effort
on an individual’s part

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or possibly because of human imperfection.

00:05:40.723 --> 00:05:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, on the other hand, Paul talks
about “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not work, but the fruitage it results in.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is implying

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that qualities that are listed there
as fruitage of the spirit

00:05:54.837 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not the result of some sort
of program we get into

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to adjust our character,

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:05.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s the operation of God’s spirit

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon the individual.

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s this tremendous force
and power from Jehovah God

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that moves us in certain ways.

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be to recognize scripture
or to listen to counsel.

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to pray for his holy spirit

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:27.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can develop
those Christian qualities that Paul mentions.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you look at verse 22,
one of those qualities is kindness.

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is that
for the Christian personality?

00:06:36.846 --> 00:06:40.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the Great Potter looks at us,

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does he see a need for adjustments

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way we display kindness to others?

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, are we praying to Jehovah God,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, Jehovah, help me develop

00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:54.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this fruitage of the spirit”?

00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, again, the Bible gives examples

00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of individuals who had kindness.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:05.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the quality in action, so to speak.

00:07:05.908 --> 00:07:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this case, Jehovah God, of course,
is the greatest example.

00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it is.

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 3,
it describes in verse 7

00:07:14.283 --> 00:07:18.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that after Adam and Eve ate the fruit,
then they recognized their nakedness.

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:19.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what did they do?

00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:22.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They sewed fig leaves together” as clothing.

00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:25.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, in verse 21,

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before putting them out of the garden of Eden

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the thorns and thistles,
what did Jehovah do?

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it says he ‘made long garments

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of skins to clothe them.’

00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the ultimate kindness.

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we want to allow these examples
to touch us in ways

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:50.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that move us to be kind to others.

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one benefit of kindness is

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:56.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people are drawn to that kind of person.

00:07:56.993 --> 00:08:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 11:17 says this:

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A kind man benefits himself.”

00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s enjoyable being
around a kind person, isn’t it?

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A kind person easily finds

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeps good friends.

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the <i>Ministry School </i> textbook says

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:23.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “one who is kind and mild-tempered

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is gentle in his way of doing things.”

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:33.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, under the chapter “Voice Quality,”
here’s what it says:

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:35.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People are greatly influenced

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only by what is said

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also by how it is said.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a person speaking to you has a voice

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is pleasant, warm, friendly, and kind,

00:08:48.878 --> 00:08:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it not true that you
are more inclined to listen favorably?”

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most certainly it is.

00:08:55.318 --> 00:08:57.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I might say
that the November study edition

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower</i>  we just received

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:03.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a beautiful article in it entitled

00:09:03.593 --> 00:09:08.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Kindness—A Quality Expressed
in Word and Action.”

00:09:09.565 --> 00:09:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to our Christian personality

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially involving humility and kindness,
as we’ve talked about today—

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us respond
to the molding of Jehovah God.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He uses his Word
—the Bible—

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he uses his holy spirit.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we also said
Jehovah uses the congregation.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we all be responsive to counsel

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive either from the platform

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe individual counsel

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve in these areas.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we respond correctly,

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can say

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Isaiah 64:8:

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:56.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now, O Jehovah, you are our Father.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:10:01.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are the clay, and you are our Potter;

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all the work of your hand.”

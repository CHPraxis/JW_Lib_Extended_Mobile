00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.987 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So when reading today’s text,

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
maybe two questions came to your mind.

00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One is, What are these

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
body members on the earth?

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:12.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the other one is,

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How do we deaden

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:16.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our body members?

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our text reminds us
of the words of Jesus, when he said,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It is better to cut off your hand,
your foot, throw your eye away

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than being destroyed.’

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible language,

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hand, the foot, the eye 

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often are used to illustrate

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we do with our life.

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:43.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hand represents things we do,
or make, with our hands.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The foot represents walking or running

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.334 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—often connecting it
with where we go in life.

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The eye represents our viewpoint, our opinion

00:00:56.206 --> 00:01:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how we look at things,
whether we like them or not.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do the body members mean?

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They do not refer
to literal parts of our body

00:01:08.418 --> 00:01:11.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the hand, the foot, or the eye.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It illustrates our tendencies

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:16.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as imperfect people.

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our text for today at Colossians 3:5,

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul lists some of these tendencies.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said they are “immorality, uncleanness,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“uncontrolled . . . passion, hurtful desire, 

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Some translations say “evil desires.”)
and greediness.”

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:38.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The bad inclinations we have within us

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have from birth.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed and bad desires

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come quite easily to most of us.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you put a ball

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a table that is not perfectly level,

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ball will roll down to the lower end.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All humans

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are born with that inclination to go down.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we deaden,

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stop, our inclination

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward evil desires and greed?

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:15.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply put, remove them from our life.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:18.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is not so easy to do

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that inclination is very strong.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we stop our inclinations

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from starting to roll?

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll discuss five things

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can do

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep that ball
of wicked inclinations in place.

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:43.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one: Control our mind.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us this wonderful tool,

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
powerful tool
—our mind—

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:53.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can keep
our inclinations under control.

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:55.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how do we do that?

00:02:55.358 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Colossians 3:2

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Keep your minds fixed

00:03:02.632 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the things above.”

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:08.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the mind
wants to go where it should not,

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
immediately bring it under control.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop it from going where it is bad.

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a choice in what we think about.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:19.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow that ball

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of wicked reasoning to start rolling.

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:24.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t even think about it.

00:03:24.854 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more time spent thinking about something

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that it is much more likely
that we will do it.

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:35.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the second one:

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Control our emotions.

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, don’t let our emotions control us.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See our imperfect inclinations
for what they really are.

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are imperfect and they are selfish

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:55.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like naughty little children.

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we don’t get our way,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our emotions can become
like a screaming child.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:05.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wants something.
It wants it now.

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does not understand reason,

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the good mother
refuses to give in to the child.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we’re not careful,
our emotions will take over,

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
screaming blue murder,

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demanding that we get it now.

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read here 1 Corinthians 6:12,

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read the second part of verse 12:

00:04:34.791 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful for me,

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I will not let myself

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be controlled by anything.”

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(to control our inclinations,
to keep that ball from rolling):

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recognize the danger of greed.

00:04:56.145 --> 00:05:00.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last part of our text today
at Colossians 3:5 says: 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . and greediness,
which is idolatry.”

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we fall prey to greed,

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our desires become our master, our god,

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:14.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we surrender our will,

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we actually become idolaters
—self-worshippers.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that does not mean
that all desires are bad.

00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah opens his hand

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and satisfies the desire
of every living thing.’

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The difference
between normal desire and greed

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:36.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might be likened to the difference
between the small campfire 

00:05:36.285 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cooks food and the blazing inferno

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that consumes a forest.

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number four (to control our inclinations):

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be naive.

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us read here Proverbs 14:15, 16

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 14:15, 16:

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The naive person believes every word,

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:06.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wise one is cautious
and turns away from evil,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the stupid one
is reckless and overconfident.”

00:06:17.226 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not for a moment think,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, this is not going to happen to me.’

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be fooled by your own desires.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed can never be satisfied.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It never says, “Enough!”

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother who was addicted

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:41.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said this about every time that he gave in;

00:06:41.617 --> 00:06:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, “I was drawn by a force so powerful

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I did not turn back
until it was too late.”

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once that ball starts rolling,
very little can stop it.

00:06:56.265 --> 00:07:00.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number five (to stop that inclination):

00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:03.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be honest with yourself.

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us read here Romans 7:22, 23

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 7:22, 23.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “I really delight in the law of God

00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the man I am within,

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I see in my body another law

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“warring against the law of my mind

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leading me captive
to sin’s law that is in my body.”

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it speaks there about a war.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is war!

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:39.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was in this war; we are in this war,

00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there will be painful injuries.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A soldier, for example,

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:49.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may damage a limb badly during battle,

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has to be amputated.

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At some point, he has to accept the fact

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is going to lose a limb

00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:01.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and agree for it to be cut off.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:05.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re not talking
about literally cutting off members.

00:08:05.368 --> 00:08:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at some point,

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to face the facts.

00:08:11.874 --> 00:08:15.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must agree in our heart

00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will give up a habit or a custom

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we feel is as precious

00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a hand or a foot or an eye.

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not a game.

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:28.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life depends on this.

00:08:28.858 --> 00:08:31.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two things: Admit that we have a problem.

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And number two:

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:38.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do whatever it takes
to root it out of our life.

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in summary,

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, obey the command

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:46.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “deaden . . . your body members.”

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The battleground is our own heart.

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we discover an inclination that is bad,

00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:56.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stop it immediately.

00:08:56.485 --> 00:08:59.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cut it off.
Throw it away.

00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No harm will come to us.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do this, we really begin to live.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is exactly as the psalmist says

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:10.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 63:

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your loyal love is better than life.”

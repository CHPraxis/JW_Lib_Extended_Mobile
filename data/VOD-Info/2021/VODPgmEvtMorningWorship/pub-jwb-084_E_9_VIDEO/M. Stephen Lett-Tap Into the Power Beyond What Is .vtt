Now, my theme is

00:00:02.686 --> 00:00:07.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Tap Into ‘the Power Beyond What Is Normal.’”

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:11.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God is the original Source

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:15.165 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of all the power that exists in the universe.

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:17.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:26 speaks

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s “vast dynamic energy

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and . . . awe-inspiring power.”

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that aeons ago,
he used this tremendous power

00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create his only-begotten Son,

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:33.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who became
a tremendous source of power himself.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then using him as “a master worker,”

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah brought into existence
numerous other sources of power

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both animate and inanimate.

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we humans were made in God’s image.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so one of our main qualities,
just like Jehovah, is power.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can use that power in a good way

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a bad way.

00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah tells us:
‘If you want to use it in a good way,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will help you.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You can tap into me,

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the most powerful Source of help
in the universe,

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I will help you
use your power for good.

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will give you
“power beyond what is normal.”’

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:7.

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, if you think
about that scripture, today’s scripture,

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t it indicate

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to expend
the power that is normal?

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:30.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives the power beyond normal.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does Jehovah not give all the power?

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:38.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you think about it,
if he gave us all the power

00:01:38.148 --> 00:01:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we needed to keep our integrity,

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would that prove the Devil a liar?

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would that prove <i>we</i>  are integrity keepers?

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it would just prove
that Jehovah has a lot of power.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan would claim

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is unfairly using his power

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give us a free ride
through our test and trials.

00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we do our part,

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do what is within our human limitations,

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:09.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then Jehovah steps in
and supplies the power beyond that.

00:02:09.946 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Satan can rightfully say nothing.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s another question,

00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we need
“the power beyond what is normal”

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah offers to us?

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s because of the tremendous power
of our three great enemies

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 John 5:19:

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The whole world is lying

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the power of the wicked one.”

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you think of a power
that is capable of controlling

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 7.6 billion people on earth today.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that’s some power of Satan.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 13:22 speaks
about “the deceptive power of riches.”

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s just one of the powers
the world promotes.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 3:13 talks
about “the deceptive power of sin,”

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identifying the power of our imperfect flesh

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to pull us into wrong conduct.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve got to have
this “power beyond what is normal”

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to resist these tremendous power sources
that are against us.

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:15.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think about this:
Just because a power source exists

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not mean you automatically benefit.

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:19.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to tap into it.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:22.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the wind has power;

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a windmill taps into it.

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Running water has tremendous power;

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:31.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hydroelectric power plant taps into it.

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sun has tremendous power;

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
solar panels tap into it.

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have to tap into Jehovah.

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And interestingly,
Jehovah provides guidelines

00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to how we can tap into his power.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:48.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also gives warnings as to what can impede

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:51.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you can even say block—
receiving power from him.

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:54.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with that being said, let’s identify

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four contrasting examples

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we’re going to call
power-from-Jehovah blockers

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and power-from-Jehovah receivers.

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our first example, doubt and faith

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—open up to James chapter 1
and notice what Jehovah tells us about doubt—

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:6:

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let him keep asking in faith,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not doubting at all,

00:04:23.112 --> 00:04:26.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the who doubts is like a wave of the sea

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:28.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“driven by the wind and blown about.

00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, that man should not expect

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive anything from Jehovah,”

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that “anything” includes power.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, at Matthew 17:20, Jesus said:

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith
the size of a mustard grain,

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:46.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will say to this mountain,

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Move from here to there,’

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it will move,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will be impossible for you.”

00:04:54.677 --> 00:04:57.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with faith,
Jehovah gives us tremendous power

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:00.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish amazing things,

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have no valid reason, really,

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:06.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to doubt Jehovah or his organization.

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:09.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s get our second example

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:11.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a power blocker and a power receiver

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:16.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—discouragement and hoping in Jehovah.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:18.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 24:10 says:

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you become discouraged
in the day of distress,

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:26.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your strength [or power] will be meager.”

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:29.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So being overly discouraged can interfere

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our ability
to receive power from Jehovah.

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:36.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we prayerfully throw
our burden on Jehovah,

00:05:36.853 --> 00:05:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we rise above that situation,

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we put complete hope in Jehovah
that he is going to help us

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and any problems we have
sooner or later will be eliminated,

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can receive power.

00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:51.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to Isaiah 40,

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s a scripture in this vein,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:31:

00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But those hoping in Jehovah

00:06:01.244 --> 00:06:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will regain power.

00:06:03.913 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will run and not grow weary;

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will walk and not tire out.”

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s move to our third example:

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being double or halfhearted
and being wholehearted.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Figuratively, Psalms 12:2 and 119:113

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk about a “halfhearted”

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a doublehearted person.

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah hates them
according to the Bible:

00:06:32.575 --> 00:06:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doublehearted by trying
to serve two masters,

00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying, for example,
to use the world to the full

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also be a servant of Jehovah.

00:06:41.217 --> 00:06:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A halfhearted person
lacks enthusiasm and zeal.

00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s lukewarm in his service.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah indicates that such individuals

00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive no power from him.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you remember
what 2 Chronicles 16:9 says?

00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:01.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the eyes of Jehovah
are roving about through all the earth

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to show his strength [or power]

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in behalf of those whose heart

00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is complete toward him.”

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s get our last example:

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bad conduct and sacred service.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 4:25-29

00:07:21.724 --> 00:07:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourages us
not to steal, not to be deceptive,

00:07:26.662 --> 00:07:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to let ‘a rotten saying
come out of our mouth,’ and so forth.

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then interestingly,
the next verse, verse 30, says:

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be grieving God’s holy spirit.”

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So clearly, Jehovah is making it obvious

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that any of that kind of conduct
grieves, restricts, limits

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our ability to receive holy spirit,

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is one of the main ways
Jehovah provides power to us.

00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, Hebrews 4:12 says:

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of God is alive and exerts power.”

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we read it and meditate on it,
we get power.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts talks about how

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the disciples supplicated,

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they received holy spirit.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It talks about how
they were all gathered together,

00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:15.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were “filled with holy spirit.”

00:08:15.678 --> 00:08:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “You will receive power
when the holy spirit comes upon you,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will be witnesses of me . . .
to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:29.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we pray, we supplicate,

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read and meditate on God’s Word,

00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we meet together,
we witness about the Kingdom,

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:39.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we receive power by means of the holy spirit.

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So summing up our discussion,

00:08:42.338 --> 00:08:47.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we (1) maintain strong faith
not doubting at all,

00:08:47.376 --> 00:08:52.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) resist discouragement
by hoping in Jehovah,

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:55.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(3) refuse to develop a half or double heart

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but keep a complete heart in serving Jehovah,

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (4) really work hard to avoid bad conduct

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:06.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and zealously pursue sacred service,

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we will continue

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tap into Jehovah’s limitless power
beyond what is normal.

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:17.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite the power of our great enemies,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will triumph over them.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:24.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you dear brothers and sisters
will make it into the new world

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either by means of the overland passageway

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the great tribulation
—never die at all—

00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by means of the underground tunnel,

00:09:34.857 --> 00:09:37.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrection provision.

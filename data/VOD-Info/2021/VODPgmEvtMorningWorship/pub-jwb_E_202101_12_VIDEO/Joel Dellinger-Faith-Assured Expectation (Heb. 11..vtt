Our focus today is

00:00:02.285 --> 00:00:04.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on two beautiful Christian qualities

00:00:04.854 --> 00:00:06.856 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that are married to each other

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:08.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—that go hand in hand—

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:10.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
faith and hope.

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.929 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why is it so important for you and me

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen our faith in what we hope for?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bible with me
to Hebrews chapter 12,

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:24.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d like you to focus on verse 1.

00:00:24.507 --> 00:00:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we know in the context
in the previous chapter, Hebrews chapter 11,

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:31.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the apostle has just defined faith,

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he went on to recount
many examples of men and women

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who exercised strong faith
and kept their focus on their future hope.

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they did so
throughout the course of their entire life,

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to death.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now notice the exhortation
that the apostle builds on,

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as found at Hebrews 12:1,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll also read
the first part of verse 2:

00:00:55.605 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, then, because we have such a great cloud
of witnesses surrounding us,

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us also throw off every weight

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the sin that easily entangles us,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let us run with endurance
the race that is set before us,

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:13.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as we look intently at the Chief Agent

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:17.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in verse 1, Paul mentions

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:23.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sin that easily entangles us.”

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we visualize?

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that Greek expression
could help us to picture

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:33.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a runner in a race
who has too many clothes on.

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:38.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m picturing a man who has on,
instead of shorts,

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oversized sweatpants

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:45.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tennis shoes with his shoes unlaced.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How easy it would be for him

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trip and fall, to be entangled

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:56.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his own clothing and attire!

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s the word picture
that the apostle Paul used

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to describe a danger that faces all of us,

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:06.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including experienced Christians
who have a record of faith.

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sin is a lack of faith.

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a newer Christian, it could be

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not developing the faith

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had at the beginning after baptism.

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for an experienced Christian,

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lack of faith could be
a loss of once strong faith

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had in the past.

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To that latter point,
you might notice in verse 1

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:37.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a pillar in the congregation,
a man of faith—

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:41.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes himself in the exhortation.

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Let us also
throw off every weight . . .

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us run with endurance.”

00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By including himself,
Paul was likely admitting

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own inclination
—his propensity—

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get easily entangled

00:02:55.992 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in episodes of a momentary weakness of faith.

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:02.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a powerful lesson
for all of us, isn’t it?

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:07.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us need
to keep strengthening our faith.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:09.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is more, the Bible makes it clear

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if we get entangled
in a momentary loss of faith,

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can recover
—and we can recover quickly.

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:21.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this in an experience
that the apostle Peter had.

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, with me
to Matthew chapter 14,

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:30.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cast your eyes to verse 24.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, visualize the scene:

00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:36.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s early in the morning before dawn.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter and some of the disciples
are struggling to row their boat

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Sea of Galilee during a storm.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:46.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, they see Jesus walking on the sea.

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 26, when they catch sight of him,

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:54.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible tells us
“they cried out in their fear.”

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter and those disciples
—hardy fishermen, manly men—

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“cried out in their fear.”

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 27, Jesus tells them:
“Take courage!

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is I; do not be afraid.”

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, what did Peter do?

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 28: “Lord, if it is you,

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:18.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
command me to come to you over the waters.”

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:20.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when Jesus told Peter to come,
what did Peter do?

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got out of the boat,
and he started walking on the water

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:25.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward Jesus.

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:27.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that take faith?

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:28.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed!

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:30.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon after, we know,

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:33.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the account goes on to say,
Peter began to sink.

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the opening of verse 30:

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But looking at the windstorm,

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he became afraid.”

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:47.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Peter lost his focus on Jesus,
his faith wavered.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a momentary period of weak faith.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same can happen to any of us,
including experienced Christians.

00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:59.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A loss of focus can lead to a loss of faith.

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:02.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you gone through
or are you going through

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:04.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some storms in your life?

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The wind and the waves

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were surrounding Peter
as he walked on the water

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:12.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be compared to the trials
and the temptations that we face

00:05:12.428 --> 00:05:15.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our dedicated service to Jehovah.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to our faith,
you and I are doing something

00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for the majority seems impossible

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:23.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—serving Jehovah
and having a clean standing

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a dedicated relationship

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last days
of this difficult system of things.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But winds and waves are coming our way.

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps it’s an unexpected illness

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:38.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us or for a close family member
or friend.

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:42.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s the fear that comes
from the economic pressures

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are upon many
of our brothers and sisters

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just in Venezuela, not just in Africa,

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in all parts of the earth

00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there’s crisis in economies.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe it’s the waves of persecution

00:05:57.573 --> 00:05:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come upon our brothers in all places

00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just in Russia
but perhaps right within the family.

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about adjustments
that might affect our privileges of service?

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, a new work assignment
here at Bethel

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the field or in the congregation

00:06:13.756 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a change of assignment

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that takes us out of the comfort zone
of special full-time service

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could prove to be a storm for us

00:06:23.533 --> 00:06:26.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that causes us to be afraid.

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother who had his heart set
on being a missionary

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found that after many years
in missionary service,

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and his wife had to go home.

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the first time in my life,” he says,

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I lost all sense of direction.

00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I had no goals.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing seemed important anymore.”

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A temporary, momentary weakness of faith.

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s dwell further
on Peter’s experience

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:59.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you look back at verse 30.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it specifically
that caused Peter to sink?

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it a big gust or a big wave?

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his looking at the windstorm

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that caused him to become afraid.

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was his change in focus.

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, if we lose our focus

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dwell too much on our storms

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:29.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—circumstances in our day-to-day living
in this system of things—

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look at how powerful those storms are,

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could begin doubting
that Jehovah will support us.

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now notice what happens next in verse 30.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:43.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says: “And when he started to sink,

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cried out: ‘Lord, save me!’”

00:07:47.617 --> 00:07:52.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Peter did next,
after his momentary loss of faith,

00:07:52.255 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really a powerful lesson for all of us.

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter quickly recovered.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know from what the Bible tells us
that Peter was a capable swimmer.

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His natural inclination could have been

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to swim back to the boat
because he was sinking,

00:08:07.036 --> 00:08:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t do that.

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t depend on himself.

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:14.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He refocused on Jesus,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he took Jesus’ outstretched hand.

00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:20.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s the lesson for all of us?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we sense that our faith is ever weakening

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we’re starting to give way to fear,
we need to imitate Peter’s example.

00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can recover quickly.

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might look back at Hebrews 12:2

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 12:2,

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice how the apostle Paul,

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in encouraging us

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:46.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to get entangled in a lack of faith,

00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that we need
to “look intently at . . . Jesus”

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:51.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 3: “Consider closely

00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:55.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one who has endured
such hostile speech from sinners . . . ,

00:08:55.952 --> 00:09:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you may not get tired and give up.”

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:03.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Looking intently’ and ‘considering closely’

00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remind us that we need to refocus on Jesus.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it that gave Jesus
unbreakable faith?

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong hope.

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that same account tells us

00:09:15.171 --> 00:09:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he looked ahead
at “the joy that was set before him.”

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:22.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to focus on our future blessings.

00:09:22.044 --> 00:09:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our <i>Watchtower </i> articles said this:

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put yourself in the picture
by writing down or making a drawing

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of what you hope to do once God has removed
this . . . system [of things].

00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make a list of people whom you look forward
to meeting when they are resurrected

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and what you would like
to discuss with them.

00:09:38.794 --> 00:09:42.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“See these as God’s promises
not just to mankind in general

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to you personally.”

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, we know, was convinced
that the Bible is God’s Word.

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:55.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He diligently meditated on God’s words
—His precious promises.

00:09:55.611 --> 00:09:58.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to do the same as well.

00:09:58.347 --> 00:10:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus taught us to pray for holy spirit.

00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:05.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can ask Jehovah for more faith.

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will readily respond to such prayers.

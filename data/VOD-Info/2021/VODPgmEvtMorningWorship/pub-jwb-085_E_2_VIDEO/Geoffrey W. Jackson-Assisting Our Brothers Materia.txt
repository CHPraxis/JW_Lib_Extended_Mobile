00:00:01 Let’s start by asking a question:
00:00:03 Should the Governing Body
00:00:06 and the brothers who are taking the lead
00:00:07 in our organization just mainly focus
00:00:10 on spiritual matters and not be concerned
00:00:14 about financial matters?
00:00:17 Well, some may answer,
00:00:19 “Yes, that’s what they should be doing.”
00:00:21 And perhaps these ones may even feel a little embarrassed
00:00:24 if money matters are mentioned
00:00:26 at meetings or on JW Broadcasting®.
00:00:30 Perhaps they may feel that there’s a precedent
00:00:33 back in Acts chapter 6,
00:00:36 where it speaks about the days after Pentecost
00:00:39 when the daily food distribution was taking place.
00:00:42 We remember there that the apostles
00:00:45 decided that they would delegate that work
00:00:48 —the work of giving food at the tables— to a group of men.
00:00:52 And remember, they said that they would then focus
00:00:55 on the spiritual aspects—prayer and so on.
00:00:59 So is this the basis, then, for us to say
00:01:02 that we should just focus on spiritual matters?
00:01:05 Well, even looking at that account, we realize
00:01:08 that the apostles were very much involved with the arrangement, weren’t they?
00:01:12 They set the arrangement in place.
00:01:14 They made sure the food distribution took place,
00:01:17 even though they personally didn’t go to the tables and hand out the food.
00:01:22 But when we look at the Scriptures, we see very clearly
00:01:26 that although we have a spiritual responsibility
00:01:30 (a spiritual work) that we need to do,
00:01:33 there is also a physical side to “the relief ministry”
00:01:38 and many other aspects that we need to be concerned about.
00:01:41 Let’s take for example the apostle Paul.
00:01:44 If you’d like to take your Bibles,
00:01:46 turn with me to Galatians chapter 2.
00:01:50 The time setting is about the year 49 C.E.,
00:01:55 and Paul and Barnabas are in Jerusalem,
00:01:58 and here, basically, they get the approval
00:02:01 from the governing body to go out to the nations.
00:02:04 So let’s look at Galatians 2:9, 10:
00:02:10 “And when they recognized the undeserved kindness
00:02:13 “that was given me, James and Cephas and John,
00:02:16 “the ones who seemed to be pillars,
00:02:18 “gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship,
00:02:22 “[or in other words, they gave approval to them and support]
00:02:25 “so that we should go to the nations
00:02:27 but they to those who are circumcised.”
00:02:30 So here the assignment was given,
00:02:33 but then in verse 10, notice:
00:02:35 “They asked only that we keep the poor in mind,
00:02:40 [and notice, Paul says] and this I have also earnestly endeavored to do.”
00:02:45 So obviously,
00:02:47 this relief ministry involving financial matters
00:02:52 was something of concern to Paul (of interest to him).
00:02:56 So when we think about that,
00:02:58 we see how the apostle Paul did apply this admonition
00:03:02 in his ministry
00:03:04 —his third missionary tour,
00:03:07 which took place between the years 52-56 C.E.
00:03:11 He was involved with collecting contributions and donations
00:03:16 from the brothers to take back for the poor brothers in Judea
00:03:20 who had a very hard time at that particular period of time.
00:03:24 Let’s look at an example of what Paul said
00:03:27 in 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
00:03:31 At 1 Corinthians 16:1-4,
00:03:37 here he’s speaking to the Corinthians and says:
00:03:41 “Now concerning the collection for the holy ones,
00:03:45 “you may follow the directions I gave to the congregations of Galatia.
00:03:50 “On the first day of every week,
00:03:53 “each of you should set something aside according to his own means,
00:03:57 “so that collections will not take place when I arrive.
00:04:01 “But when I get there, I will send the men you approve of in your letters
00:04:06 to take your kind gift to Jerusalem.”
00:04:09 But now notice what Paul says in verse 4:
00:04:13 “However, if it seems advisable for me to go there also,
00:04:17 they will go there with me.”
00:04:20 So Paul while in the midst of his third missionary tour,
00:04:24 which of course had a great spiritual theme
00:04:27 —helping people, preaching the good news—
00:04:29 was still interested in the collection of funds
00:04:33 that would help the brothers back in Jerusalem.
00:04:36 And notice there in verse 4 that he even raises the possibility
00:04:40 of stopping his missionary work
00:04:43 and actually traveling back to Jerusalem.
00:04:45 Well, that’s exactly what happened.
00:04:47 If you turn across to Romans,
00:04:50 Romans chapter 15,
00:04:53 we’ll see what eventuated.
00:04:55 Did it seem advisable for him to go back?
00:04:58 Well, at Romans 15:25, 26, we’re told:
00:05:03 “But now I am about to travel to Jerusalem
00:05:07 to minister to the holy ones.”
00:05:09 Now, publications have made the point
00:05:11 that this return to Jerusalem —the main purpose—
00:05:15 was to take this money back to the brothers there in Judea.
00:05:20 And then he goes on to say:
00:05:22 “For those in Macedonia and Achaia
00:05:24 “have been pleased to share their things
00:05:26 “by a contribution to the poor
00:05:28 among the holy ones in Jerusalem.”
00:05:31 So was the financial aspect
00:05:34 —the taking of contributions and donations— important to Paul?
00:05:38 Yes.
00:05:40 He viewed it important enough to actually put on hold his missionary work
00:05:44 and make that journey back.
00:05:46 And when we look at the background there, we see that perhaps
00:05:49 there were nine brothers that traveled together
00:05:52 and these brothers then took these funds
00:05:55 (probably a substantial amount)
00:05:57 back to Jerusalem.
00:05:59 And we have made the comment that this perhaps helped
00:06:02 with the safety element and also credibility
00:06:05 to make sure that nobody could question Paul
00:06:08 with the funds that he was taking back.
00:06:11 This also included Titus
00:06:13 and men who were trustworthy and well-known
00:06:16 and approved of by the brothers there
00:06:19 in the various parts of Europe and Asia.
00:06:22 But were these gifts that they were taking
00:06:25 just a matter of charity, giving out freely to others?
00:06:30 Well, let’s look again in the Scriptures,
00:06:32 this time to 2 Corinthians chapter 8.
00:06:36 At 2 Corinthians 8:13-15,
00:06:41 this gives us a reason, we could say, for the policy, or the viewpoint,
00:06:46 that the Governing Body has with regard to helping others.
00:06:50 So 2 Corinthians 8:13-15 says:
00:06:54 “For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you;
00:06:58 “but that by means of an equalizing,
00:07:01 “your surplus at the present time might offset their need,
00:07:06 “so that their surplus might also offset your deficiency,
00:07:11 “that there may be an equalizing.
00:07:13 “Just as it is written:
00:07:15 “‘The person with much did not have too much,
00:07:19 and the person with little did not have too little.’”
00:07:23 What’s the principle here?
00:07:25 The principle is that even though these contributions
00:07:28 were being given to poor brothers and sisters,
00:07:32 everyone had to do something.
00:07:34 It wasn’t just a charity where you gave money to the poor,
00:07:38 but rather, there was an expectation that each person
00:07:41 —whether they were poor or they had more—
00:07:44 would do something toward the situation.
00:07:47 And that’s exactly the view the Governing Body takes today.
00:07:50 Yes, Bibles and Bible literature
00:07:54 are provided free of charge (without cost)
00:07:56 to our brothers in all parts of the earth,
00:07:59 and the brothers then donate according to their means.
00:08:03 Kingdom Halls are being built in many countries
00:08:07 that can’t afford to build Kingdom Halls,
00:08:10 and yet again the Governing Body allows the opportunity for the brothers
00:08:14 in those countries to also donate toward the construction of Kingdom Halls.
00:08:19 Why?
00:08:21 Christendom would probably say:
00:08:23 “Well, these are poor people. Let’s just make it a charity.”
00:08:26 But you see, Jesus didn’t stop the widow from putting the two coins in, did he?
00:08:30 He didn’t say: “Look. Hold on.
00:08:32 “You need that; you’re poor.
00:08:34 Let the rich people put money in.”
00:08:37 No, Jesus allowed her to make that donation.
00:08:40 Why?
00:08:41 Because that was her gift to Jehovah and Jehovah would bless her for doing that.
00:08:45 So when we think about what’s happening
00:08:48 with regard to our organization
00:08:51 —not only the printing of Bibles, literature, building of Kingdom Halls
00:08:56 but also this huge disaster relief that continues on—
00:09:00 what can we be happy with?
00:09:02 We can be happy with the viewpoint of the Governing Body,
00:09:04 and we can be very happy
00:09:06 that the Publishing Committee of the Governing Body
00:09:09 does look after our limited means.
00:09:12 Yes, they care for the money so that when the Governing Body makes decisions
00:09:16 about what needs to be done, they don’t say,
00:09:20 “There’s no money for it.”
00:09:22 No, they make sure that our limited funds are available for the important work
00:09:26 —to spiritually feed people and help them in a physical sense too.

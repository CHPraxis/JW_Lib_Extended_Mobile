00:00:01 Now, our text for today
00:00:03 introduces a number of qualifications
00:00:05 for an overseer in the congregation.
00:00:08 However, by extension,
00:00:10 the encouragement to reach out
00:00:12 or to set our heart
00:00:14 on making spiritual progress
00:00:16 applies to all of us.
00:00:18 The Watchtower  comment at the end says this:
00:00:22 “In like manner, brothers and sisters
00:00:26 “who desire to serve as pioneers, as Bethelites,
00:00:29 “or as Kingdom Hall construction volunteers
00:00:31 do well to stretch forward to attain their goals.”
00:00:37 We all know that the apostle Paul here
00:00:40 did not encourage anyone to ambitiously strive
00:00:42 for a certain office or a certain status.
00:00:46 It is not about the appointments
00:00:49 or the office as a ministerial servant or an elder.
00:00:52 And it’s not about the appointment as a pioneer,
00:00:56 Bethelite, Assembly Hall servant, or Kingdom Hall construction volunteer.
00:01:01 Paul here encouraged all to reach out in an effort
00:01:06 to qualify for responsible work in Jehovah’s organization.
00:01:11 Today, we want to talk about the “why.”
00:01:15 Why would brothers want to work hard (as The Watchtower  comment says)
00:01:19 to qualify for assignments in the congregation?
00:01:23 And sisters now have more spiritual goals than ever
00:01:26 that they can reach out for, such as SKE, Gilead,
00:01:30 and other spiritual goals.
00:01:32 Why would we all, regardless of whether we are brothers or sisters,
00:01:36 stretch forward to attain spiritual goals?
00:01:41 We’d like to highlight three main reasons.
00:01:46 Let us open, first of all, to Matthew chapter 5.
00:01:50 Here at Matthew 5:14, 15,
00:01:54 Jesus uses the illustration of a lamp that gives light.
00:01:59 Now let’s look at verse 16, as we want to see his conclusion:
00:02:05 “Likewise, let your light shine before men,
00:02:09 “so that they may see your fine works
00:02:12 and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”
00:02:18 So the most important reason
00:02:20 for working hard to make spiritual progress
00:02:23 is our desire to glorify or praise Jehovah.
00:02:27 Is not the way Jehovah administers his sovereignty and love
00:02:31 a great motivating force to reach out?
00:02:35 Additionally, consider Jehovah’s mercy
00:02:39 with us imperfect humans,
00:02:41 his patience in helping us,
00:02:44 and his promise to protect us in these troublesome times.
00:02:48 So Jesus had good reasons to tell us:
00:02:51 “My Father is glorified in this,
00:02:55 “that you keep bearing much fruit
00:02:58 and prove yourselves my disciples,”
00:03:01 according to John 15:8.
00:03:04 So in this sense,
00:03:08 who of us can rightfully say it’s enough,
00:03:12 it’s time to relax, let’s just maintain the status quo?
00:03:16 The contrary is the case.
00:03:18 We work hard, for example, cultivating “the fruitage of the spirit”
00:03:21 in order to reflect Jehovah’s wonderful personality.
00:03:25 And, in fact, the apostle Paul uses the illustration
00:03:28 of a ‘mirror reflecting Jehovah’s glory,’
00:03:32 according to 2 Corinthians 3:18.
00:03:35 So making spiritual progress
00:03:38 is like polishing our mirror
00:03:42 in order to praise Jehovah better.
00:03:46 Can we see the smile of approval from Jehovah as he watches us
00:03:50 and as he sees the efforts of each one of us?
00:03:54 Now, what is reason number two
00:03:56 for our efforts in attaining spiritual goals
00:03:59 for reaching out to improve our qualifications?
00:04:03 Let us please turn to 1 Timothy chapter 4.
00:04:07 The young Timothy
00:04:10 must have displayed a maturity beyond his years.
00:04:13 According to chapter 4, verse 14,
00:04:17 Paul reminded Timothy that he had been appointed
00:04:19 to carry responsibilities in the congregation.
00:04:22 Why would Timothy need to continue making spiritual progress?
00:04:28 Let us read chapter 4, verse 15:
00:04:33 “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them,
00:04:37 “so that your advancement may be plainly seen
00:04:41 by all people.”
00:04:43 So Timothy’s advancements in connection with his spiritual qualities
00:04:48 would be “seen by all people.”
00:04:50 So the second reason for reaching out, or forward,
00:04:54 to attain our spiritual goals is that others benefit.
00:04:58 For example, if we reach our goals in the ministry
00:05:02 when it comes to the amount of time that we spend there
00:05:04 or the quality of our conversations,
00:05:07 then others will benefit
00:05:09 —the people in the territory and our brothers—
00:05:13 brothers who are working on their spiritual qualities
00:05:16 so that one day they can serve as a ministerial servant or an elder.
00:05:21 All of this can be seen by others, and they benefit from their efforts.
00:05:26 Others will benefit from ones serving at an Assembly Hall
00:05:30 or working in Kingdom Hall construction or on a renovation project.
00:05:36 Our brothers and sisters need every help
00:05:40 and every word of encouragement from each one of us.
00:05:44 Therefore, we all work hard to continue making spiritual progress.
00:05:49 Since we have not stopped doing exactly this,
00:05:52 we might say that we have been able to inspire others to do the very same.
00:05:56 It is contagious, and we all continue to grow.
00:06:01 Now let’s look at the third reason
00:06:04 for our earnest efforts in attaining spiritual goals.
00:06:07 Reason number three is that we ourselves benefit from it.
00:06:12 Now, this seems to be a contradiction
00:06:14 because we are encouraged to reach out, to work hard.
00:06:18 How can we, ourselves, benefit from it?
00:06:22 Now let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 5
00:06:24 in order to find out in what way we benefit ourselves.
00:06:29 Paul here describes this process of making spiritual progress.
00:06:33 And here in chapter 5, verses 11 to 13,
00:06:36 he describes the brothers as little children
00:06:40 —small children constantly needing help
00:06:44 and guidance even in very basic things.
00:06:47 Otherwise, they are confused and helpless and frustrated.
00:06:52 But now let’s see what Paul describes here
00:06:55 about mature people in verse 14,
00:06:58 and we’ll continue reading until chapter 6, verse 1.
00:07:02 He says here: “But solid food belongs to mature people,
00:07:06 “to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained
00:07:11 “to distinguish both right and wrong.
00:07:14 “Therefore, now that we have moved
00:07:16 “beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ,
00:07:19 “let us press on to maturity,
00:07:22 not laying a foundation again,” and so on.
00:07:25 So Paul here tells us
00:07:28 to make spiritual progress.
00:07:31 This is something that does not happen automatically.
00:07:34 He says, “press on” —go forward.
00:07:38 So, what is the benefit for us?
00:07:41 As Paul here describes,
00:07:43 it will allow us “to distinguish both right and wrong.”
00:07:47 In other words, we can make good decisions.
00:07:50 And there is another benefit in this connection
00:07:53 —making spiritual advancement brings contentment.
00:07:57 It makes us happy.
00:07:59 As long as we work hard to attain our spiritual goals,
00:08:03 we will see progress —sometimes just baby steps—
00:08:07 sometimes two steps ahead,
00:08:09 and then sometimes one step back.
00:08:12 But anyway,
00:08:14 by doing this we ensure that we are
00:08:17 content and happy servants of Jehovah.
00:08:20 Now, in summary, each one of us
00:08:22 —whether we are a brother or sister—
00:08:25 needs to continue reaching out
00:08:27 and stretching forward to attain spiritual goals.
00:08:31 Why?
00:08:33 Because Jehovah deserves it,
00:08:36 and because others will benefit from it.
00:08:40 But, then, also, it’s a key for us to succeed
00:08:43 as a mature, content, and happy servant of Jehovah.

Now, our text for today

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.989 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
introduces a number of qualifications

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for an overseer in the congregation.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:10.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, by extension,

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the encouragement to reach out

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:14.330 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or to set our heart

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on making spiritual progress

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to all of us.

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:22.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  comment
at the end says this:

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In like manner,
brothers and sisters

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who desire to serve
as pioneers, as Bethelites,

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or as Kingdom Hall construction volunteers

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:36.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do well to stretch forward
to attain their goals.”

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that the apostle Paul here

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not encourage anyone
to ambitiously strive

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:46.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a certain office or a certain status.

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not about the appointments

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the office
as a ministerial servant or an elder.

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not about the appointment
as a pioneer,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethelite, Assembly Hall servant,
or Kingdom Hall construction volunteer.

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul here encouraged all
to reach out in an effort

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to qualify for responsible work
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we want to talk about the “why.”

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would brothers want to work hard
(as <i>The Watchtower</i>  comment says)

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to qualify for assignments
in the congregation?

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sisters now have
more spiritual goals than ever

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they can reach out for,
such as SKE, Gilead,

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other spiritual goals.

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would we all, regardless
of whether we are brothers or sisters,

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stretch forward to attain spiritual goals?

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to highlight three main reasons.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us open, first of all,
to Matthew chapter 5.

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Matthew 5:14, 15,

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus uses the illustration
of a lamp that gives light.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at verse 16,
as we want to see his conclusion:

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:09.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Likewise, let your light shine before men,

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the most important reason

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:23.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for working hard to make spiritual progress

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:27.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our desire to glorify or praise Jehovah.

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:31.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is not the way Jehovah administers
his sovereignty and love

00:02:31.968 --> 00:02:34.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great motivating force to reach out?

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, consider Jehovah’s mercy

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with us imperfect humans,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:44.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his patience in helping us,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his promise to protect us
in these troublesome times.

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:51.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus had good reasons to tell us:

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My Father is glorified in this,

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you keep bearing much fruit

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prove yourselves my disciples,”

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to John 15:8.

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this sense,

00:03:08.504 --> 00:03:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who of us can rightfully say it’s enough,

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:16.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s time to relax,
let’s just maintain the status quo?

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The contrary is the case.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work hard, for example,
cultivating “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to reflect
Jehovah’s wonderful personality.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in fact,
the apostle Paul uses the illustration

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:32.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a ‘mirror reflecting Jehovah’s glory,’

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:35.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to 2 Corinthians 3:18.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So making spiritual progress

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:42.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is like polishing our mirror

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to praise Jehovah better.

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we see the smile of approval
from Jehovah as he watches us

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as he sees
the efforts of each one of us?

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:56.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is reason number two

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:59.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our efforts in attaining spiritual goals

00:03:59.255 --> 00:04:03.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for reaching out
to improve our qualifications?

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:07.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us please turn to 1 Timothy chapter 4.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young Timothy

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have displayed
a maturity beyond his years.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to chapter 4, verse 14,

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul reminded Timothy
that he had been appointed

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry responsibilities
in the congregation.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would Timothy need
to continue making spiritual progress?

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:33.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us read chapter 4, verse 15:

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:37.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ponder over these things;
be absorbed in them,

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your advancement
may be plainly seen

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by all people.”

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:48.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Timothy’s advancements
in connection with his spiritual qualities

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “seen by all people.”

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the second reason
for reaching out, or forward,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attain our spiritual goals
is that others benefit.

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:02.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
if we reach our goals in the ministry

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes
to the amount of time that we spend there

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the quality of our conversations,

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then others will benefit

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:13.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the people in the territory
and our brothers—

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers who are working
on their spiritual qualities

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that one day they can serve
as a ministerial servant or an elder.

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:25.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this can be seen by others,
and they benefit from their efforts.

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will benefit from ones
serving at an Assembly Hall

00:05:30.546 --> 00:05:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or working in Kingdom Hall construction
or on a renovation project.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters need every help

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:44.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and every word of encouragement
from each one of us.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we all work hard
to continue making spiritual progress.

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:52.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we have not stopped doing exactly this,

00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might say that we have been able
to inspire others to do the very same.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is contagious,
and we all continue to grow.

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:04.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at the third reason

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our earnest efforts
in attaining spiritual goals.

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:12.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reason number three
is that we ourselves benefit from it.

00:06:12.555 --> 00:06:14.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this seems to be a contradiction

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:18.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are encouraged
to reach out, to work hard.

00:06:18.728 --> 00:06:22.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we, ourselves, benefit from it?

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 5

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to find out
in what way we benefit ourselves.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul here describes
this process of making spiritual progress.

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here in chapter 5, verses 11 to 13,

00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:40.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he describes the brothers as little children

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—small children constantly needing help

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guidance even in very basic things.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, they are confused
and helpless and frustrated.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s see what Paul describes here

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about mature people in verse 14,

00:06:58.601 --> 00:07:02.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll continue reading
until chapter 6, verse 1.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says here:
“But solid food belongs to mature people,

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who through use
have their powers of discernment trained

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,
now that we have moved

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beyond the primary doctrine
about the Christ,

00:07:19.355 --> 00:07:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let us press on to maturity,

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not laying a foundation again,”
and so on.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul here tells us

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:31.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make spiritual progress.

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is something
that does not happen automatically.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says, “press on”
—go forward.

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is the benefit for us?

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Paul here describes,

00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will allow us
“to distinguish both right and wrong.”

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
we can make good decisions.

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is another benefit
in this connection

00:07:53.422 --> 00:07:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—making spiritual advancement
brings contentment.

00:07:57.793 --> 00:07:59.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It makes us happy.

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:03.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as we work hard
to attain our spiritual goals,

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will see progress
—sometimes just baby steps—

00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes two steps ahead,

00:08:09.772 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then sometimes one step back.

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But anyway,

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing this we ensure that we are

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
content and happy servants of Jehovah.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in summary,
each one of us

00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:25.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether we are a brother or sister—

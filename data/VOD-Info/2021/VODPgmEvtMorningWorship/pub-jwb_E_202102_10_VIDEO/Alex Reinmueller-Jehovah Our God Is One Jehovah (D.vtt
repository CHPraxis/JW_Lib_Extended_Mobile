A newspaper in Japan

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
once quoted a Catholic priest.

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He said, ‘The God of the Old Testament,

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Yahweh,

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:10.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘is a God of anger,

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:12.529 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I can’t feel close to him.’

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then he added,

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘But he developed and transformed

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘into what is the God of the New Testament,

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, the God of love whom Jesus taught.’

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever heard that?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of people still think like this,

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if God has a split personality.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are uncomfortable
when they read in the Bible

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God gets angry sometimes.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it may be for one of two reasons.

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there are outspoken critics
in this world

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who constantly try to discredit Jehovah.

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A prominent biologist, for example,
made headlines a few years ago.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said in his book:
“The God of the Old Testament

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is arguably the most unpleasant character
in all fiction.”

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:59.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped the quote there
because it gets much worse.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How blasphemous a viewpoint that is!

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more often people hear
statements like this,

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more they tend to believe them.

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:14.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a second reason, though,
why some struggle with God’s anger.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have suffered in abusive relationships,

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now they’re sensitive
to any perceived abuse.

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take Carolyn for example, she said:

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When my drunken father
used to explode in anger,

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“his appearance changed.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became like a wolf
baring its teeth before attacking.”

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:38.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “I lived this nightmare every day.”

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, abuse like this can scar people
for a long time.

00:01:42.552 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we help sincere persons

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get past their fears about God’s anger

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw closer to Jehovah?

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s address the critics first

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then see how we can reassure those
who may be feeling insecure.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s make one thing clear:

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not have multiple personalities.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus was on earth, he advocated

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:10.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the powerful truth that Jehovah is one.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a Jewish scribe asked him

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was the greatest of all commandments,
what did he say?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Mark 12:29, 30

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what his reply was in his own words.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He answered by quoting today’s text

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark 12:29, 30.

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus answered: ‘The first is,

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Hear, O Israel, Jehovah our God
is one Jehovah,

00:02:39.142 --> 00:02:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“and you must love Jehovah your God

00:02:41.377 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with your whole mind
and with your whole strength.”’”

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for Jesus, loving Jehovah for who he is

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(not for who we want him to be),

00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is really the most important decision
any of us could make.

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the pagan nations had all sorts of gods
for different purposes.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they would worship different aspects

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of even the same God in different localities,

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the god Baal, for example.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And something similar happened
in other religions.

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say, for example, the Catholic Church

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:23.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with its different manifestations
of the worship of Mary.

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But things were very different in Israel.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned that there was
only one God, Jehovah,

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was responsible for everything.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:36.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each time they read Deuteronomy 6:4,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were reminded
that God had one personality.

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:46.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why does a God of love
get angry sometimes?

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is quite simple.

00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When rebels challenged Jehovah’s sovereignty,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to defend his name and standards.

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebellion did make him angry and rightly so,

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah’s anger is always under control

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and guided by right principles.

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a Father, he had to protect his household.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Respect for his own name
and his love for his children

00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:16.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compelled him to act.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is “slow to anger

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and abundant in loving-kindness.”

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His fundamental mood is not anger, but joy.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus said that “God loved
the world so much

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave his only-begotten Son.”

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been, is, and always will be

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a God of unchangeable love.

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 4:8 says: “God is love.”

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It identifies who he is.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus also said that God gave his Son

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order that “everyone
exercising faith in him

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“might not be destroyed

00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but have everlasting life.”

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:04.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Jesus said

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those not exercising faith will be destroyed?

00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah’s personality didn’t mellow
over the years,

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if it needed mellowing.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:19.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t transform
from one personality to another.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His severity today against the wicked
is no less

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor his love any greater
than it was in the past.

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:31.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not change.

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can illustrate it like this, perhaps:

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Criminals may know that a police officer

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an arm of the law.

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His children may see him

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a loving father that he is.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his close friends may value him

00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:51.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his good sense of humor.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the police officer,
the father, and the friend

00:05:54.837 --> 00:05:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are all the same person.

00:05:56.973 --> 00:06:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In each situation, a different aspect
of his personality stands out.

00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:05.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s the same with Jehovah.

00:06:05.314 --> 00:06:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with his name,

00:06:07.917 --> 00:06:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become”

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:14.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or becomes whatever he needs to
in every situation

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to fulfill his purpose,

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially his purpose
toward those who love him.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we want to get closer to Jehovah,

00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to accept the full range

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his beautiful, multifaceted,

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:33.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unchanging personality.

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who love God,
we don’t fear his anger.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:43.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn to trust him
because he’s always kind

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:45.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tender toward us.

00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:47.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say that?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles with me

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jeremiah 29:11,

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice why we can be sure

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah always wants the best for us

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he did for his servants in the past.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his own words:

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you,’

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah loves us,

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is always
in full control of himself

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and circumstances around him,

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:35.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because Jesus
has already died for our sins,

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:39.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can always feel safe with Jehovah.

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not ever need to fear approaching him.

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:48.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very soon now, as Zechariah 14:9 predicts,

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must become “King over all the earth.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In that day [the prophet said]

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:57.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah will [prove to] be one,

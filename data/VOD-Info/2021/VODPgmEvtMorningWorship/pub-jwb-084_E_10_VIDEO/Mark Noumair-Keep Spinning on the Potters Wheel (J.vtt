Have you ever felt that a change of oversight

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:05.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or organizational arrangement

00:00:05.488 --> 00:00:07.190 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was hard to accept?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe you even felt hurt

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in some way personally by the change.

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:14.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, why do these changes occur?

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the best way for us
to respond to them,

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:23.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if the change seems to be
to our personal disadvantage?

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:26.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to Numbers chapter 27

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and examine an account
that may help answer these questions.

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:36.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account relates to when Jehovah
notified Moses

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his approaching death

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the need for a man
to take over Moses’ responsibilities.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:47.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Numbers chapter 27,
let’s begin at verse 15:

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:50.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Moses said to Jehovah:

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let Jehovah,
the God of the spirit of all people,

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘appoint over the assembly a man

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:02.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who will go out and come in before them

00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and who will lead them out
and bring them in,

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so that Jehovah’s assembly may not become

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like sheep that have no shepherd.’”

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:15.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would Moses call Jehovah, describe him

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:19.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as, “the God of the spirit of all people”?

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because all people
are dependent on Jehovah for life.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses knew that.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Moses knows that when one servant dies,

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, the God
of the spirit of all people,”

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will raise up another living servant

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve within the theocratic structure,

00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:44.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Jehovah sees fit.

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does Jehovah now do?

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at verse 18:

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah said to Moses:

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Take Joshua the son of Nun,
a man in whom there is spirit,

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lay your hand on him.’”

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now Jehovah picks Joshua.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua was a spiritual man.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He proved his loyalty
and obedience for years.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Joshua was not to be

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Moses junior.

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:19.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The arrangement was changing,

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it would not be a one-man show.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua would now fit

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a new organizational role.

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that be?

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at verses 19 and 20:

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then stand him [Joshua]

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before Eleazar the priest
and before all the assembly,

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:46.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you must commission him
before their eyes.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are to confer
some of your authority on him

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[notice, not all the authority, but some],

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that all the assembly of the Israelites
may listen to him.”

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here we see the difference in this role
becoming clear.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua was not to be like Moses

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in knowing Jehovah face-to-face.

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not all of Moses’ authority
was to transfer over to Joshua,

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only what was needed

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Joshua to have the respect of the nation.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now notice verse 21:

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will stand before Eleazar the priest,

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who will inquire in his behalf

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:34.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah.”

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we see the difference?

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:40.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua was now to work with the high priest

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ascertain the divine will.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Joshua was capable,

00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was more than capable
and God-fearing.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua was a modest man and a humble man,

00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:54.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he accepted this new arrangement.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Joshua had already been molded

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:01.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Great Potter’s wheel

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some forty years
of wilderness wandering

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—discipline that he personally
did not deserve.

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in accepting this new arrangement,

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this molding process would continue.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would it continue?

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we see Jehovah
now using two imperfect men

00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:26.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an administrator and a high priest—

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:29.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to balance each other out and to make sure

00:04:29.152 --> 00:04:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s perfect will took place.

00:04:31.988 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, two imperfect people

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making sure that Jehovah’s perfect will
moved forward

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this would be the arrangement.

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, during the time period
of the kings,

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:49.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when King Uzziah circumvented
the theocratic arrangement,

00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:51.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was high priest Azariah

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who reproved him for this unlawful act.

00:04:56.412 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or when high priest Abiathar proved disloyal,

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was King Solomon who dismissed him
from the priesthood.

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see the balance of two imperfect men.

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:10.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When one was weak, the other proved strong.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn?

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re learning that Jehovah

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:19.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, “the God
of the spirit of all people”—

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not dependent on just one person,

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:27.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor is he dependent in our case at Bethel
on just one department.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is why we work together;

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is why we foster warm feelings

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in relationships between departments.

00:05:36.386 --> 00:05:38.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we need each other.

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:42.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each of us needs to be humble enough

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:44.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask for help when needed

00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:47.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet unselfish enough to provide resources

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that others can get Jehovah’s work done.

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see evidence.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see evidence today
of how Jehovah is getting his work done.

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what he is accomplishing.

00:06:01.878 --> 00:06:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is continuing to raise up
qualified servants

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, to shepherd and lead his people
as he sees fit.

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes
to world headquarters departments’ oversight

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:20.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or branch committee members,
department overseers, construction overseers,

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:24.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these individuals are like Joshua,

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are willing to work together

00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:32.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to stay on the Potter’s wheel
and be molded by Jehovah.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:33.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that we do not become, as verse 17 says,

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:40.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as sheep that have no shepherd.”

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, all of us,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we are
in positions of oversight or not,

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
want Jehovah, the Great Potter,

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold us—keep molding us.

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, frankly, it can be challenging

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—challenging at times to stay
on the Potter’s wheel

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not allow the imperfections of others

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:05.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to push us off

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the organizational changes that take place

00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to knock us down.

00:07:10.646 --> 00:07:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, as Jehovah continues

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refine his organization,
adjustments are made.

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps in the process,
our assignment is changed,

00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our feelings get hurt by the change.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps our feelings get hurt
by the way that change was implemented.

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you feel that you’ve been caught
in a pinch-point

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:40.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the moving parts of the organization

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, more specifically, when you feel
pressure being applied upon you

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:50.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you spin on the wheel of the Great Potter,

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:52.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is when we beg Jehovah

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beg Jehovah to help us remain moist;

00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beg Jehovah to help us remain pliable

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this molding process.

00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And tell Jehovah, “Jehovah, it’s not easy.”

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell him how you feel:
“Please help me Jehovah.

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be molded by you.”

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we’re patient.

00:08:13.676 --> 00:08:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be patient and try to see the big picture.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the big picture?

00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The big picture is
that Jehovah is using imperfect people

00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with imperfect people
—that’s all he has at present—

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:29.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah is teaching us.

00:08:29.825 --> 00:08:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is teaching us how to make peace

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:35.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with imperfection.

00:08:35.398 --> 00:08:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The big picture is
how much Jehovah is accomplishing

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:40.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with so little.

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:45.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we meditate on that,
we can see the value of working together.

00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:48.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we work together,
that’s when Jehovah

00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:51.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accomplishes the most.

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a fact,

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:59.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the personnel in God’s visible organization
will change.

00:08:59.555 --> 00:09:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it will continue to change.

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:06.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether that be due to death
or other circumstances,

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the personnel will change.

00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, the change
does not cripple the work.

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:14.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is Jehovah’s work;
it’s not man’s.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s be confident that Jehovah

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:23.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, “Jehovah, the God

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the spirit of all people”—

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue to raise up

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:33.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humble (imperfect, yes, but humble),

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imperfect overseers to shepherd his people

00:09:37.893 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he sees fit.

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:43.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And rest assured that Jehovah will continue

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to guide and lead his organization,

00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his global organization,

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spiritual success.

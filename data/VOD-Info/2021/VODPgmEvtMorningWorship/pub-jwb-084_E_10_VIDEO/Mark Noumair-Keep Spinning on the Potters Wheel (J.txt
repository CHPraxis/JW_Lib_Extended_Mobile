00:00:01 Have you ever felt that a change of oversight
00:00:03 or organizational arrangement
00:00:05 was hard to accept?
00:00:07 Or maybe you even felt hurt
00:00:09 in some way personally by the change.
00:00:12 Well, why do these changes occur?
00:00:14 And what is the best way for us to respond to them,
00:00:18 even if the change seems to be to our personal disadvantage?
00:00:23 Well, let’s open our Bibles to Numbers chapter 27
00:00:26 and examine an account that may help answer these questions.
00:00:31 The account relates to when Jehovah notified Moses
00:00:36 of his approaching death
00:00:38 and the need for a man to take over Moses’ responsibilities.
00:00:42 At Numbers chapter 27, let’s begin at verse 15:
00:00:48 “Then Moses said to Jehovah:
00:00:50 “‘Let Jehovah, the God of the spirit of all people,
00:00:55 “‘appoint over the assembly a man
00:00:58 “‘who will go out and come in before them
00:01:02 “‘and who will lead them out and bring them in,
00:01:04 “‘so that Jehovah’s assembly may not become
00:01:07 like sheep that have no shepherd.’”
00:01:12 Why would Moses call Jehovah, describe him
00:01:15 as, “the God of the spirit of all people”?
00:01:20 Because all people are dependent on Jehovah for life.
00:01:25 Moses knew that.
00:01:27 And Moses knows that when one servant dies,
00:01:31 “Jehovah, the God of the spirit of all people,”
00:01:34 will raise up another living servant
00:01:38 to serve within the theocratic structure,
00:01:41 just as Jehovah sees fit.
00:01:44 So, what does Jehovah now do?
00:01:47 Well, let’s look at verse 18:
00:01:51 “So Jehovah said to Moses:
00:01:53 “‘Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom there is spirit,
00:01:58 and lay your hand on him.’”
00:02:01 So now Jehovah picks Joshua.
00:02:04 Joshua was a spiritual man.
00:02:06 He proved his loyalty and obedience for years.
00:02:10 However, Joshua was not to be
00:02:14 a Moses junior.
00:02:17 The arrangement was changing,
00:02:19 and it would not be a one-man show.
00:02:22 Joshua would now fit
00:02:24 into a new organizational role.
00:02:28 What would that be?
00:02:30 Well, let’s look at verses 19 and 20:
00:02:34 “Then stand him [Joshua]
00:02:37 “before Eleazar the priest and before all the assembly,
00:02:41 “and you must commission him before their eyes.
00:02:46 “You are to confer some of your authority on him
00:02:50 “[notice, not all the authority, but some],
00:02:53 so that all the assembly of the Israelites may listen to him.”
00:02:58 So here we see the difference in this role becoming clear.
00:03:03 Joshua was not to be like Moses
00:03:05 in knowing Jehovah face-to-face.
00:03:08 Not all of Moses’ authority was to transfer over to Joshua,
00:03:13 only what was needed
00:03:15 for Joshua to have the respect of the nation.
00:03:19 And now notice verse 21:
00:03:23 “He will stand before Eleazar the priest,
00:03:26 “who will inquire in his behalf
00:03:29 by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah.”
00:03:34 Do we see the difference?
00:03:36 Joshua was now to work with the high priest
00:03:40 to ascertain the divine will.
00:03:42 Yes, Joshua was capable,
00:03:44 but he was more than capable and God-fearing.
00:03:48 Joshua was a modest man and a humble man,
00:03:51 and he accepted this new arrangement.
00:03:56 Well, Joshua had already been molded
00:03:59 on the Great Potter’s wheel
00:04:01 for some forty years of wilderness wandering
00:04:06 —discipline that he personally did not deserve.
00:04:12 But now, in accepting this new arrangement,
00:04:14 this molding process would continue.
00:04:17 How would it continue?
00:04:19 Well, we see Jehovah now using two imperfect men
00:04:23 —an administrator and a high priest—
00:04:26 to balance each other out and to make sure
00:04:29 that Jehovah’s perfect will took place.
00:04:31 So, now, two imperfect people
00:04:34 making sure that Jehovah’s perfect will moved forward
00:04:38 —this would be the arrangement.
00:04:41 For example, during the time period of the kings,
00:04:45 when King Uzziah circumvented the theocratic arrangement,
00:04:49 it was high priest Azariah
00:04:51 who reproved him for this unlawful act.
00:04:56 Or when high priest Abiathar proved disloyal,
00:05:00 it was King Solomon who dismissed him from the priesthood.
00:05:04 So we see the balance of two imperfect men.
00:05:06 When one was weak, the other proved strong.
00:05:11 Well, what do we learn?
00:05:13 Well, we’re learning that Jehovah
00:05:15 —again, “the God of the spirit of all people”—
00:05:19 is not dependent on just one person,
00:05:22 nor is he dependent in our case at Bethel on just one department.
00:05:27 And that is why we work together;
00:05:30 this is why we foster warm feelings
00:05:33 in relationships between departments.
00:05:36 Because we need each other.
00:05:38 So each of us needs to be humble enough
00:05:42 to ask for help when needed
00:05:44 and yet unselfish enough to provide resources
00:05:47 so that others can get Jehovah’s work done.
00:05:53 And we see evidence.
00:05:54 We see evidence today of how Jehovah is getting his work done.
00:05:59 Look at what he is accomplishing.
00:06:01 Jehovah is continuing to raise up qualified servants
00:06:05 —again, to shepherd and lead his people as he sees fit.
00:06:11 When it comes to world headquarters departments’ oversight
00:06:15 or branch committee members, department overseers, construction overseers,
00:06:20 these individuals are like Joshua,
00:06:24 who are willing to work together
00:06:27 and to stay on the Potter’s wheel and be molded by Jehovah.
00:06:32 Why?
00:06:33 So that we do not become, as verse 17 says,
00:06:37 “as sheep that have no shepherd.”
00:06:41 But in reality, all of us,
00:06:44 whether we are in positions of oversight or not,
00:06:47 want Jehovah, the Great Potter,
00:06:49 to mold us—keep molding us.
00:06:52 And yet, frankly, it can be challenging
00:06:55 —challenging at times to stay on the Potter’s wheel
00:06:59 and not allow the imperfections of others
00:07:03 to push us off
00:07:05 or the organizational changes that take place
00:07:08 to knock us down.
00:07:10 For example, as Jehovah continues
00:07:14 to refine his organization, adjustments are made.
00:07:19 And perhaps in the process, our assignment is changed,
00:07:23 and our feelings get hurt by the change.
00:07:26 Or perhaps our feelings get hurt by the way that change was implemented.
00:07:32 So when you feel that you’ve been caught in a pinch-point
00:07:36 between the moving parts of the organization
00:07:40 or, more specifically, when you feel pressure being applied upon you
00:07:45 as you spin on the wheel of the Great Potter,
00:07:50 that is when we beg Jehovah
00:07:52 —beg Jehovah to help us remain moist;
00:07:56 beg Jehovah to help us remain pliable
00:07:59 during this molding process.
00:08:02 And tell Jehovah, “Jehovah, it’s not easy.”
00:08:05 Tell him how you feel: “Please help me Jehovah.
00:08:09 I want to be molded by you.”
00:08:12 And then we’re patient.
00:08:13 Be patient and try to see the big picture.
00:08:16 What is the big picture?
00:08:18 The big picture is that Jehovah is using imperfect people
00:08:21 to work with imperfect people —that’s all he has at present—
00:08:27 and that Jehovah is teaching us.
00:08:29 He is teaching us how to make peace
00:08:33 with imperfection.
00:08:35 The big picture is how much Jehovah is accomplishing
00:08:38 with so little.
00:08:40 When we meditate on that, we can see the value of working together.
00:08:45 And when we work together, that’s when Jehovah
00:08:48 accomplishes the most.
00:08:52 So it’s a fact,
00:08:54 the personnel in God’s visible organization will change.
00:08:59 And it will continue to change.
00:09:02 Whether that be due to death or other circumstances,
00:09:06 the personnel will change.
00:09:09 And yet, the change does not cripple the work.
00:09:12 Why?
00:09:14 Because this is Jehovah’s work; it’s not man’s.
00:09:18 So let’s be confident that Jehovah
00:09:20 —again, “Jehovah, the God
00:09:23 of the spirit of all people”—
00:09:27 will continue to raise up
00:09:29 humble (imperfect, yes, but humble),
00:09:33 imperfect overseers to shepherd his people
00:09:37 as he sees fit.
00:09:40 And rest assured that Jehovah will continue
00:09:43 to guide and lead his organization,
00:09:46 his global organization,
00:09:48 to spiritual success.

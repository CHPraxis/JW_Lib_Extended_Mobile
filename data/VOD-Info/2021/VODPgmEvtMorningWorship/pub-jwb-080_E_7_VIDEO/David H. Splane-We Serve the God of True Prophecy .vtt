00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’d just

00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:04.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take a look at today’s text,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Come and witness

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah”—witness.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:16.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to a dictionary,

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a witness is someone
who has personal knowledge of something.

00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we be Witnesses of Jehovah?

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What personal knowledge

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we have of his activities?

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:35.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,
we can testify to the fact

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he does that,
he is right 100 percent of the time.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:45.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, we know that no one can prevent

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah foresees from coming true.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of Jehovah’s prophecies come true.

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate the first point,

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:57.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider two remarkable prophecies

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem and its temple.

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know that
through the prophet Jeremiah,

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold
that Jerusalem and the temple

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed by the Babylonians.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it come true?

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely—in 607 B.C.E.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah went further.

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:25.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will rebuild the ancient ruins;

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:32.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will raise up
the desolated places of the past,

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will restore the devastated cities.”

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And true worship would also be restored.

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was quite a level of knowledge.

00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s more.

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:47.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah went further.

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also indicated

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:53.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the spiritual revival wouldn’t last.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is remarkable.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s implied by what we read
in the second part

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel 9:26.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to have a look at this.

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:06.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be reading

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two parts of this verse,

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s quite interesting

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:15.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Daniel 9:26.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:19.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, what’s our objective here?

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s to see that Jerusalem and its temple

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed a second time

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that true worship would not last.

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says in the second part of verse 26:

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:38.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the people of a leader who is coming

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when these words were written,

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
were already in ruins.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah doesn’t say,

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed
the city and its temple.’

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“The people of a leader who is coming.”

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Roman general Titus in 70 C.E.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order for that prophecy to be fulfilled,

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
would have to be rebuilt

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then destroyed a second time.

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is quite a level of knowledge
—quite a level of information.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would make this necessary?

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, when the Jews
came back to the Promised Land

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:31.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were intent
on restoring true worship,

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:33.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why would this fail?

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why would Jerusalem and the temple
be destroyed a second time?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of it is due to what we find
in the first part of verse 26:

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Messiah will be cut off.”

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah foretold, foresaw,

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when the Messiah came,

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews would reject him.

00:03:57.887 --> 00:03:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would be cut off.

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of that, partly because of that,

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:06.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple would be destroyed,

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it happens, in 70 C.E.

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think about that a minute.

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Messiah comes first
and Jerusalem and the temple

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:22.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are destroyed after that in 70 C.E.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that the Messiah
comes before 70 C.E.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we might ask our Jewish friends,

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are you still waiting for the Messiah?

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 C.E. has come and gone.

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Messiah came,
and he too proved to be a true prophet.

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a remarkable prophecy of Jesus
is found in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:52.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look at it and consider
the implications of this prophecy.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Matthew chapter 7,

00:04:59.682 --> 00:05:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 22 and 23,

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an amazing prophecy.

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine: At this point, Jesus’ teachings

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not spread beyond Israel.

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verses 22 and 23:

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many will say to me on that day:

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, Lord,
did we not prophesy in your name,

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:24.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and expel demons in your name,

00:05:24.273 --> 00:05:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and perform many powerful works
in your name?’

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And then I will declare to them:
‘I never knew you!

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get away from me,
you workers of lawlessness!’”

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:37.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, isn’t that amazing?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jesus had simply predicted

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his teachings would spread
throughout the earth,

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:43.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might say, “Well, there’s
nothing remarkable about that.”

00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:45.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus is saying something different.

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great apostasy from his teachings.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling the birth of Christendom

00:05:55.972 --> 00:06:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
300 years before the event.

00:06:00.143 --> 00:06:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus foresees that many

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to turn away from the truth.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the end of the first century,

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:12.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that apostasy was already at work, wasn’t it?

00:06:12.255 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were sects

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the sect of Nicolaus,
for example, and other sects.

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re on the cusp
of the great darkness,

00:06:22.932 --> 00:06:27.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great apostasy, that’s going to set in
from the second century on.

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with this in mind, what does Jehovah do?

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes an amazing statement

00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation 14—

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:42.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘144,00 will be on Mount Zion with the Lamb.’

00:06:42.718 --> 00:06:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were nowhere near 144,000
in the truth in the first century.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Jehovah is saying
there are going to be 144,000 in heaven

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Lamb at the end.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that, he goes further.

00:06:56.432 --> 00:06:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s going to be
a ‘great crowd that no man can number.’

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could that ever come true?

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ours is the God of true prophecy.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s prophecy.

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:10.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the second point?

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is that no one
can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled.

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil would love
to prevent that from taking place.

00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about Revelation 14.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Devil could make the number

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one short of 144,000,

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d be happy because he would show

00:07:28.297 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was inaccurate
in what he foretold.

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s one
of the reasons why the Devil

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:38.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made war on the remnant
of the seed of the woman,

00:07:38.941 --> 00:07:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if at all possible, to prevent that number

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 144,000 from coming to pass.

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, he’s going to fail.

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the prophecy in the Bible

00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that America and Britain
would become a dual world power?

00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Britain wouldn’t become a world power

00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at all if France
had anything to say about it.

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:04.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France and Britain were sworn enemies.

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for many, many, years,

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France was much richer
and much more powerful

00:08:09.872 --> 00:08:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than Britain was.

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally,
at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,

00:08:16.145 --> 00:08:19.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France had one last chance

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:22.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent Britain
from becoming a world power.

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And France should have won that battle.

00:08:24.954 --> 00:08:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was stacked against the British.

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:31.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a driving rain,

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fatal miscalculation
on the part of Napoleon,

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few other factors
that foiled their attempt.

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Britain did become a world power.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the 19th century,

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:48.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s quite true that the sun
never set on the British Empire.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:53.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, America and Britain
were supposed to become a dual world power,

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Britain wasn’t the least bit interested
in sharing its power with America.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tried to prevent America
from separating as a colony.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a long war,

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were mistakes made on both sides.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:12.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But finally, America gained
its independence from Britain.

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we find?

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:15.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years after that,

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain is sharing its power with America.

00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:22.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are a dual world power.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fighters against God will never prevail.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:30.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve “the God of true prophecy.”

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “what he foretells comes to be.”

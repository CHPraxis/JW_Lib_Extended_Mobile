00:00:02 Mary kept listening to what Jesus was saying.
00:00:05 How commendable!
00:00:07 She set the right priorities
00:00:09 and is a good example for us.
00:00:12 Martha, her sister, however,
00:00:14 received loving correction from Jesus,
00:00:16 as our printed comment puts it.
00:00:19 Now let us, today, put ourselves in the shoes of Martha for a moment.
00:00:24 She showed great interest in supporting Jesus
00:00:28 by providing him a base during his ministry
00:00:32 in the difficult area of Judea.
00:00:34 Now this time,
00:00:36 Mary and Martha were probably working together
00:00:39 to prepare things for Jesus.
00:00:42 But after Jesus arrived, Mary stopped helping as our text indicates.
00:00:47 How did Martha feel about it?
00:00:50 Now she had to care for everything herself.
00:00:54 Can we imagine the tension rising
00:00:57 within Martha’s heart?
00:00:59 The stress level is increased,
00:01:02 and her dear sister sits and listens to Jesus.
00:01:07 So she asked Jesus to correct Mary,
00:01:11 to order her back to work.
00:01:14 But to her surprise, she, Martha, received counsel from Jesus.
00:01:19 How would we feel in such a situation?
00:01:22 We are doing something well-intentioned
00:01:25 and, yet, instead of commendation, we receive counsel.
00:01:29 Maybe our eyes filled with tears.
00:01:33 We feel the pain in our chest.
00:01:35 We might think we can’t breathe anymore.
00:01:39 Did Martha think for a moment, replying to Jesus, saying:
00:01:43 “This is not fair!
00:01:45 “I am doing everything to support you, and now this.
00:01:47 “You know, from now on, I am listening too,
00:01:50 and I am curious to find out who prepares the meals for you.”
00:01:57 Of course, we don’t know what Martha thought and said.
00:02:02 But what we do know, as our printed comment puts it,
00:02:06 she took to heart Jesus’ loving correction.
00:02:10 What can help us to overcome such a painful moment
00:02:14 and to progress?
00:02:16 The term often used in this connection
00:02:18 is “resilience.”
00:02:21 People who are resilient are able to recover easily and quickly
00:02:25 from unpleasant and damaging events.
00:02:29 It is like the ability of this piece of metal
00:02:33 to tolerate pressure
00:02:35 and go back to its original form.
00:02:40 Let us, therefore, look at three factors that make us resilient
00:02:44 and different from those who easily give up and surrender.
00:02:49 Now, the first factor is facing reality
00:02:54 —facing reality.
00:02:57 Let us, please, open to Proverbs chapter 28.
00:03:00 The question we are asking ourselves in a difficult moment is this:
00:03:05 ‘Do I truly understand and accept the reality of my situation?’
00:03:11 Here, at Proverbs 28:26,
00:03:14 it starts by saying:
00:03:17 “Whoever trusts in his own heart
00:03:21 is stupid.”
00:03:24 We might tend to put on emotional blinders
00:03:28 and see only what we want to see.
00:03:30 Many people slip into denial as a coping mechanism.
00:03:35 However, the Proverb continues in the second part, saying:
00:03:40 “But the one who walks in wisdom
00:03:44 will escape.”
00:03:46 This means seeing things the way they are.
00:03:51 Facing reality
00:03:54 —really facing reality is grueling work.
00:03:57 Indeed, it can be unpleasant
00:04:00 and often emotionally wrenching.
00:04:03 The apostle Peter had this experience
00:04:06 when Jesus looked at him after Peter had denied him three times.
00:04:10 Peter faced reality, went outside,
00:04:14 broke down, and wept bitterly.
00:04:17 For sure, he was not looking for any excuses.
00:04:21 This experience, as well as other situations where he received counsel,
00:04:25 helped him to make progress and to fulfill his assignments even better.
00:04:31 Now, what is the second factor?
00:04:33 We call it “meaning-making.”
00:04:38 We might know people who under pressure threw up their hands
00:04:42 and cried and said, “Why is this happening to me?”
00:04:47 Such people see themselves as victims,
00:04:50 and living through hardship does not teach them any lessons.
00:04:55 We, however, based on our Bible knowledge,
00:04:57 understand why difficulties and challenging situations
00:05:01 are sometimes unavoidable.
00:05:03 Seeing the bigger picture adds meaning.
00:05:07 This helps us, as a resilient person,
00:05:10 not only to endure an unpleasant situation or a new circumstance
00:05:14 but also to look at seeming obstacles
00:05:17 and see an opportunity in it.
00:05:22 We all know that no one is perfect.
00:05:26 Everyone fails at something sometime.
00:05:30 So our choice is the manner in which we respond.
00:05:35 We are actively trying to make the best out of it,
00:05:39 looking ahead rather than behind,
00:05:43 setting goals —maybe new goals.
00:05:46 We might remember how Brother Harold King
00:05:49 showed this resilient disposition
00:05:52 when he was in solitary confinement.
00:05:54 How did he give meaning to his difficult situation
00:05:58 by making the best out of it?
00:06:00 He said:
00:06:02 “I arranged for a program of ‘preaching’ activity.
00:06:06 “But to whom does one preach when in solitary confinement?
00:06:11 “I decided that I would build up some appropriate Bible sermons
00:06:15 “from the things I could remember
00:06:17 and then preach to imaginary characters.”
00:06:22 So in our context, we can say
00:06:25 meaning-making is like building a bridge
00:06:28 from present day hardships to a better future.
00:06:32 By means of this bridge,
00:06:34 we make a difficult situation manageable.
00:06:37 We remove the sense that the present is overwhelming.
00:06:43 Now let’s look at the third factor:
00:06:46 a balanced view of ourselves.
00:06:50 Well, we said at the beginning that we have to face reality
00:06:54 which can go along with feelings of sadness and disappointment.
00:06:57 As resilient people,
00:06:59 we don’t take a failure
00:07:01 or a challenging situation personally.
00:07:06 Let us, please, open to Romans chapter 7,
00:07:09 because we want to demonstrate this point
00:07:11 by means of the example of the apostle Paul.
00:07:15 At times, he felt discouraged over his weaknesses.
00:07:20 Here in chapter 7,
00:07:22 he describes the pain of conscience
00:07:25 that he suffered because of feeling captive to sin.
00:07:30 But then in verse 24,
00:07:33 he cries out, saying:
00:07:35 “Miserable man that I am!”
00:07:41 Evidently, though, Paul realized
00:07:44 that his imperfection did not define him.
00:07:48 Nine years later,
00:07:51 in his second letter to his friend Timothy,
00:07:54 shortly before his death,
00:07:56 he stated his personal conclusion of the matter
00:08:00 here at 2 Timothy 4:7.
00:08:04 He said:
00:08:07 “I have fought the fine fight,
00:08:11 “I have run the race to the finish,
00:08:16 I have observed the faith.”
00:08:21 Paul’s problems and inner struggle did not miraculously disappear.
00:08:26 Still, it did not prevent him
00:08:29 from accomplishing remarkable things in Jehovah’s service.
00:08:33 So, therefore, we do not berate ourselves
00:08:36 with self-defeating language,
00:08:38 such as “I’m a failure”
00:08:40 or “I’m useless.”
00:08:43 Reflecting on positive aspects of our lives
00:08:47 and reflecting on our strengths
00:08:49 helps us to maintain a balanced view of ourselves.
00:08:54 So in conclusion,
00:08:56 the experience of Martha reminded us today
00:09:00 of the importance of building
00:09:02 and maintaining resilience
00:09:05 by facing reality,
00:09:08 meaning-making,
00:09:11 and maintaining a balanced view of ourselves.

00:00:01 We’re going to talk about money.
00:00:03 Now, the fact is,
00:00:05 we never beg for money.
00:00:07 But that’s not to say
00:00:08 that we can’t talk about money
00:00:10 in Jehovah’s organization
00:00:11 —the earthly part.
00:00:13 So it’s long standing;
00:00:16 there is a balance here.
00:00:18 Going back to The Watchtower, a long time ago, it says:
00:00:22 “We have never considered it proper to solicit money for the Lord’s cause,
00:00:27 “after the common custom [referring to Christendom]; . . .
00:00:31 “It is our judgment that money raised by the various begging devices
00:00:36 “in the name of our Lord is offensive,
00:00:38 “unacceptable to him,
00:00:41 “and does not bring his blessing
00:00:43 either upon the givers or the work accomplished.”
00:00:47 So we do not need to be coerced into giving.
00:00:52 We gladly use our money to support Kingdom activities.
00:00:56 So that stands to this day.
00:00:59 But we’d never want to come to the conclusion that we can’t talk about money.
00:01:04 Money has to be discussed in these last days in this system.
00:01:09 It “meets a response in all things.”
00:01:12 So I thought we’d take some thoughts from the Kingdom  book:
00:01:16 three reasons why we’re willing —so willing to give.
00:01:20 Some beautiful thoughts.
00:01:22 Well, the first one is connected
00:01:25 with “doing what is pleasing in [Jehovah’s] eyes.”
00:01:29 And finding
00:01:31 the Second Corinthians reference here
00:01:35 is so crucial in helping people understand
00:01:39 that we don’t beg for money.
00:01:41 But, nonetheless, we have to talk about it from time to time.
00:01:46 Here in the ninth chapter,
00:01:51 donations and such were being discussed.
00:01:54 And then this profound, inspired thought,
00:01:57 which is reflecting Jehovah’s thinking,
00:01:59 is in verse 7
00:02:02 —2 Corinthians 9:7:
00:02:04 “Let each one do just as he is resolved in his heart,
00:02:08 “not grudgingly or under compulsion,
00:02:12 for God loves a cheerful giver.”
00:02:15 So there we have it.
00:02:17 We’re happy to give to Jehovah.
00:02:20 When needs arise,
00:02:22 and the organization brings it to our attention
00:02:26 —for example, disasters and such
00:02:28 like the report we had at the annual meeting
00:02:31 about the increase in disasters—
00:02:34 millions of dollars of God’s Kingdom money
00:02:38 was used to help our brothers.
00:02:40 But when it comes to giving,
00:02:42 it’s an individual responsibility, as the verse says,
00:02:45 “resolved in his heart [or her heart], not grudgingly.”
00:02:49 And the footnote addresses the word “reluctantly.”
00:02:54 So it’s not like we embarrass people
00:02:57 or beg them, saying: “Look, you’re well-off.
00:03:00 Why aren’t you giving more?”
00:03:02 Well, that’s not their business; that’s not our business.
00:03:05 We have to resolve it in our own heart.
00:03:07 So while we discuss money,
00:03:10 we never come across like we’re putting people
00:03:14 —trying to get them
00:03:16 to even grudgingly give just so we get the money.
00:03:19 That’s not this organization.
00:03:21 Of course, Christendom, they are experts at begging for money.
00:03:26 So we love Jehovah.
00:03:28 We want to be the kind of person that he loves.
00:03:33 And notice that beautiful expression: “God loves a cheerful giver.”
00:03:36 One translation put it nicely:
00:03:38 “God loves people who love to give.”
00:03:42 And that’s true.
00:03:44 So we want Jehovah to love us.
00:03:46 So this money we might have
00:03:49 —whatever amount, depending on our own personal circumstances—
00:03:53 we’re happy to give to Kingdom interests.
00:03:56 So that’s the first one: We make these donations
00:04:00 because of our love for Jehovah.
00:04:02 Now this second one, this is interesting
00:04:04 —a heart-searching principle found back in the Mosaic Law.
00:04:08 Turn to Deuteronomy chapter 16,
00:04:11 if you would, please.
00:04:13 In Deuteronomy 16,
00:04:16 you’ll see the connection.
00:04:19 While this applied to the Jews at that time,
00:04:22 you’ll see how it applies to us in our day.
00:04:25 We’re going to read verse 16 and then verse 17 of Deuteronomy 16.
00:04:30 “Three times a year,
00:04:32 “all your males should appear before Jehovah your God
00:04:35 “in the place that he chooses:
00:04:37 “at the Festival of Unleavened Bread,
00:04:39 “the Festival of Weeks,
00:04:41 “and the Festival of Booths,
00:04:44 “[now notice,] and none of them
00:04:47 “should appear before Jehovah empty-handed.
00:04:51 “The gift that each one brings should be in proportion
00:04:55 to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you.”
00:04:58 So if you let that sink in,
00:05:01 this is what Jehovah wanted to be conveyed
00:05:05 to the Israelites who would attend these festivals—“none.”
00:05:09 Now, he didn’t say,
00:05:11 ‘If you’re well-off, if you’ve had a great year
00:05:14 (as opposed to some that were poor).’
00:05:17 They still had issues back at that time,
00:05:19 even though it was Jehovah’s nation.
00:05:22 But he said:  ‘None should appear empty-handed.’
00:05:25 So that takes in all of us,
00:05:27 whatever our circumstances are,
00:05:29 whether at Bethel or in the field.
00:05:31 Jehovah doesn’t approve of us coming empty-handed.
00:05:38 What would help us not to come empty-handed,
00:05:42 in this case, back in Israel or in our time either?
00:05:46 Notice verse 17, and this is a lot to think about:
00:05:49 “The gift that each one brings should be in proportion
00:05:53 to the blessing that Jehovah your God has given you.”
00:05:56 So there we have it.
00:05:58 You stop and reflect that they were supposed to do that,
00:06:01 and we can do the same throughout the year.
00:06:04 Reflect on the blessings that Jehovah God has given us.
00:06:08 You have to take time to do that; you have to give that consideration.
00:06:13 “The gift that each one brings should be in proportion to the blessing.”
00:06:16 So adding up these blessings,
00:06:18 then we’re happy to give out of our material possessions.
00:06:22 So a profound thought there,
00:06:24 and something to reflect on so that we don’t find ourselves
00:06:29 —when it comes to contributions on a monthly basis or whatever—
00:06:34 empty-handed, perhaps thinking, ‘Well, I’m doing so much here and there.’
00:06:37 Well, money meets a response in all things,
00:06:42 and you have to take that into account,
00:06:44 even if we’re in the poor range.
00:06:47 Now, the third one is connected with our love for Jesus.
00:06:52 Let’s turn to John chapter 14, if you would, please
00:06:56 —John chapter 14.
00:06:59 We give and have voluntary contributions
00:07:02 because we love our Lord Jesus.
00:07:06 And notice what he stated here,
00:07:09 John 14:23:
00:07:14 “In answer Jesus said to him:
00:07:17 “‘If anyone loves me, he will observe my word,
00:07:21 “‘and my Father will love him,
00:07:23 and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.’”
00:07:27 So appreciate how Jesus put it—“if.”
00:07:31 So it’s a responsibility that falls on us individually.
00:07:34 But if we say we love Jesus
00:07:37 (we’re not like Christendom
00:07:39 with this proclamation of their love for Jesus,
00:07:41 —they really don’t even know the real Jesus, frankly,
00:07:45 until they get an accurate knowledge of the truth),
00:07:47 if we’re in the truth
00:07:49 —dedicated, baptized servants of him—
00:07:52 if we really love him, we’re going to observe his word.
00:07:55 Now, that means not just carrying out the Kingdom work,
00:07:57 putting our time and energy into it,
00:08:00 it also means money.
00:08:02 We are willing to donate money to support the worldwide work.
00:08:07 We’re not ashamed to admit
00:08:10 that it takes money to have these things operate
00:08:13 —branches, supporting all of the preaching work,
00:08:18 the Kingdom work, and all these other initiatives
00:08:20 that we’ve had in recent years.
00:08:22 It takes money.
00:08:23 You can’t go to people that you buy things from and say,
00:08:27 “Well, look, this is a non-profit organization,”
00:08:29 trying to shame them, saying, “Well, can you give it to me?”
00:08:31 No.
00:08:32 They want their money and to be paid for the various things
00:08:36 that we have to use to accomplish Jehovah’s work.
00:08:40 So something to keep in mind, those three things:
00:08:43 Our love for Jehovah —we want to do what’s pleasing to him.
00:08:47 We count our blessings from Jehovah.
00:08:50 Then, we have our love for Christ Jesus.
00:08:54 And we want to do whatever we can.
00:08:56 So how you do it with the financial contributions,
00:09:00 that’s a personal decision,
00:09:02 and Jehovah dignifies us with that.
00:09:04 We never want to be shaming somebody
00:09:07 that we think should be doing thus and so.
00:09:10 That’s a personal matter.
00:09:12 But keep in mind, sometimes, if you are poor
00:09:15 —remember the widow.
00:09:18 So she didn’t come there
00:09:21 to the temple empty-handed.
00:09:24 She didn’t have much, but Jehovah loved her.
00:09:27 Jesus loved her for giving what she had.
00:09:29 So even when we’re poor,
00:09:31 we’re expected to give monetarily.
00:09:34 And it’s because we love Jehovah, we love Jesus,
00:09:37 and we appreciate all the blessings we receive
00:09:40 during the year and are grateful.

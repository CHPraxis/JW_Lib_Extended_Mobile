00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:05.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, in its entirety, Proverbs 21:5 says:

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The plans of the diligent

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:09.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“surely lead to success,

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“but all who are hasty

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:13.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
surely head for poverty.”

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is not a Bible law;

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a Bible principle.

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:23.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And before we discuss
how Proverbs 21:5 might be applied,

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s be reminded again of the difference
between a law and a principle.

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had articles on it.

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had it discussed
at our circuit assembly.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But still there are some in our congregations

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would have a hard time
making the distinction between the two.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A principle, just one principle,
can be broadly applied

00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to many different situations
and decisions in life,

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:47.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas a Bible law addresses

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just one very precise, very specific, action.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:55.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could turn to 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10

00:00:55.772 --> 00:01:00.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning some areas of life
where Jehovah has explicit commands, or laws.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here at 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10,

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it reflects some of those laws of God:

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or do you not know that unrighteous people

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:12.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will not inherit God’s Kingdom?

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“adulterers, men who submit
to homosexual acts,

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:23.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men who practice homosexuality,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and extortioners
will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”

00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These represent some laws of God.

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:37.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not commit adultery.”
That’s a law.

00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:39.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not steal.”
Do not become a drunkard.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are laws—very clear.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:43.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no interpretation necessary.

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:47.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a yes-or-no, do-or-don’t situation.

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:48.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about principles?

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:50.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they differ from laws?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a principle
is a basic truth in God’s Word

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us to make good decisions.

00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as Christians,
we all face situations in life

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for which there is
no regulation in the Bible.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:07.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to reason things out
and make a decision.

00:02:07.343 --> 00:02:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to illustrate:
Suppose you’re driving in the countryside

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:14.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s a herd of deer
running toward the road.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there’s no law
that says you should speed up

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:22.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get there before they do.

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:24.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no law that says you
should just continue

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 55 miles an hour (90 km/h)
and see what happens.

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:29.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would you likely do?

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you would slow down the car.

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:35.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how could you make
that decision without a law?

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You reasoned on the principle,

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:41.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the principle is safety,
and you made a good decision.

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:44.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or there’s a sign—55 miles an hour (90 km/h).

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is a law.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not to go over 55 (90)
on that section of the roadway.

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:52.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if there’s a blinding rainstorm?

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:56.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you insist on going 55 miles an hour
(90 km/h) because it’s allowed?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:01.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, using the very same
principle of safety,

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you would slow down and make a good decision.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there were two situations with no law.

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by applying the same principle,

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you made a good decision.

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do we have some examples
of principles that could be applied

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we make decisions
on life’s roadway?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about Romans 15:3?

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:25.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Christ did not please himself.”

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how many situations in life

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this would instantly answer our question
as to what we should do?

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or James 4:4:

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Friendship with the world
is enmity with God.”

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could be applied
to associations, to movies,

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to music, to clothing styles,
and so much more.

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when some issue or decision
is about to jump out in front of us,

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to slow down
and search for a principle.

00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:55.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Ephesians chapter 5.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:59.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has a phrase that coincides
with searching for a principle.

00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll read verse 15 first of all.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “So keep strict watch

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that how you walk
is not as unwise but as wise persons.”

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that could be
by simply obeying a Bible law.

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not commit adultery.
Do not steal.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep strict watch that you act wisely.

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:20.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now notice verse 17;
it’s worded differently.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “On this account
stop being unreasonable.”

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:27.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s alluding to the fact
that we should reason on a matter.

00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:28.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what it says:

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But keep perceiving
what the will of Jehovah is.”

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this case, there’s no law spelling out

00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what we do but we have to ‘perceive.’

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we search for
and apply a Bible principle.

00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we’re perceiving what God’s will is.

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’m not trying to complicate matters,

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:50.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes a specific law of God

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:55.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is underpinned
by a basic truth, or principle.

00:04:55.812 --> 00:05:00.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Deuteronomy 22:8 was a law.

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Israelites had to build a parapet wall

00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:05.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the flat roof of their home

00:05:05.455 --> 00:05:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent people from falling
and being injured or possibly killed.

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a law.

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was the underlying principle?

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was respect for human life.

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that principle can be applied
to so many circumstances in life now.

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Respect for human life.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there is nothing in the Bible
that talks about tobacco products.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a person coming into the truth
makes a good decision

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by applying the principle of respect for life

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his own life and the health of others.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our text at Proverbs 21:5 is a principle.

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means it can be applied
to so many different situations in our life.

00:05:40.356 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, it says:

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The plans of the diligent
surely lead to success,

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:48.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all who are hasty
surely head for poverty.”

00:05:48.297 --> 00:05:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are some situations

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:54.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our publications
have applied that principle to?

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one is commenting at meetings.

00:05:56.406 --> 00:05:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to plan ahead to have success.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe we’re in some form
of full-time service

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our parents become seriously ill.

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Proverbs 21:5 says: ‘Do not be hasty.’

00:06:10.553 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we should not hastily conclude

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to give up
our privilege of service.

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:20.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly by planning,
we could ‘surely have success.’

00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living within one’s means, financially.

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Proverbs 21:5, in this case,
the plan has a name; it’s called a budget.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:33.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we have people
making decisions on who they will marry.

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be hasty.

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:37.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe a couple is deciding on
whether to have children or not.

00:06:37.613 --> 00:06:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make a hasty decision.

00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look beyond that cute,
little, cooing baby face,

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider the pros and cons.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or brothers approaching retirement age

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Proverbs 21:5 will help them
make a good decision.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s just a sampling
of the variety of situations

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this one verse
can help us with to make good decisions.

00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so thankful to Jehovah
that he has provided specific laws

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must obey,

00:07:03.706 --> 00:07:07.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’s also given us a host of principles
that can help us make good decisions.

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by implementing
both of those in our life,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can maintain
a clean conscience before our God.

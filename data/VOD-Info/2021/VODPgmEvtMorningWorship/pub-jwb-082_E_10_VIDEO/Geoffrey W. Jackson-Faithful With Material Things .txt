00:00:01 This morning, we’re discussing
00:00:02 this illustration that Jesus gave
00:00:05 concerning the unrighteous steward.
00:00:08 Of course, it’s found at Luke 16:1-8.
00:00:13 What is the real lesson
00:00:15 behind this illustration that Jesus gave?
00:00:18 Well, it’s interesting to note that many people get distracted
00:00:22 even before they find out what the lesson is.
00:00:25 How is that so?
00:00:27 Well, when they’re reading the Scriptures and read chapter 15 of Luke,
00:00:31 they see what has been described
00:00:33 as one of the most powerful illustrations Jesus ever gave
00:00:37 —that of the so-called prodigal son, or the wasteful son.
00:00:41 And then as they read on
00:00:43 they come to this illustration which has been described
00:00:46 as one of the most puzzling illustrations Jesus gave.
00:00:50 Why are so many people concerned or puzzled by this illustration?
00:00:55 Well, some people feel
00:00:58 that Jesus is supporting and condoning
00:01:02 the dishonest use of funds.
00:01:04 But is that really the case?
00:01:07 Should we get distracted, wondering why Jesus used this illustration?
00:01:12 Well, as Bible students, it’s always good for us
00:01:14 to see what the Bible says.
00:01:16 So let’s take our Bibles and turn together to Luke chapter 16.
00:01:21 And then rather than having a preconceived idea,
00:01:24 let’s see what Jesus actually said, as recorded here in Luke 16.
00:01:30 Reading verse 1, it says:
00:01:32 “Then he also said to the disciples:
00:01:35 “‘A rich man had a steward
00:01:37 who was accused of handling his goods wastefully.’”
00:01:42 Now, here’s the first question.
00:01:44 We notice, this man—
00:01:47 Jesus doesn’t say he was found condemned
00:01:50 or he was actually doing something
00:01:52 that had been proven to be wrong,
00:01:55 but it mentions here that he was accused.
00:01:59 The Watchtower made the interesting comment
00:02:02 that this doesn’t necessarily mean to say
00:02:04 he did something wrong, but he was accused of it.
00:02:08 In fact, the Greek that was used here to record this illustration
00:02:12 allows for the fact that perhaps he could have been slandered.
00:02:17 And what was he accused of?
00:02:19 Well, notice the last words there in verse 1:
00:02:23 “of handling his goods wastefully.”
00:02:27 So he wasn’t accused of stealing
00:02:30 but using things wastefully.
00:02:34 It’s interesting to note that the word used here for “wastefully”
00:02:39 is the same word that’s used
00:02:41 in the previous illustration of the prodigal son
00:02:44 in chapter 15, verse 13,
00:02:47 where it speaks of the prodigal son squandering the inheritance.
00:02:52 Now, in that case, the prodigal, or wasteful, son
00:02:55 didn’t steal the money from his father, did he?
00:02:59 He received it in a legal way.
00:03:01 But then, the point was that he squandered it.
00:03:04 So likewise, here we see that this steward was accused
00:03:08 of wastefully using what was the master’s.
00:03:13 Well, let’s consider what he was told in verse 2:
00:03:18 “So he called him and said, ‘What is this I hear about you?
00:03:23 “‘Hand in the account of your stewardship,
00:03:27 for you can no longer manage the house.’”
00:03:31 So, what did the master say to the steward?
00:03:34 Did he say to him: ‘You’re going to prison’
00:03:38 or ‘We’re going to have a court case’?
00:03:40 No.
00:03:41 In fact, he didn’t even immediately remove him
00:03:44 from that position of authority.
00:03:46 But what did he say to him?
00:03:48 You need to “hand in the account.”
00:03:51 So in other words, the manager didn’t really know
00:03:54 what the steward was doing,
00:03:56 but he allowed him the opportunity now to hand in this account.
00:04:00 So when we look at the background
00:04:03 of what actually was said here,
00:04:06 and when we think of it from the viewpoint
00:04:08 of those who listen to Jesus,
00:04:10 it seems that what the steward had done
00:04:13 and then proceeded to do
00:04:16 was actually legitimate and legal.
00:04:19 He was concerned about his future.
00:04:21 If he knew that he had to hand in an account
00:04:24 that would result in him going to prison,
00:04:27 then certainly he probably wouldn’t have acted the way that he did.
00:04:31 But this raises some questions, doesn’t it?
00:04:35 Perhaps we might think: ‘Well, he went ahead
00:04:38 ‘and reduced the debts of various ones.
00:04:42 Wasn’t that the wrong thing to do?’
00:04:45 Well, to get the true understanding of this,
00:04:48 it’s good for us to take note
00:04:50 of the November Watchtower  of this year.
00:04:53 And in the section that says “Did You Know?,”
00:04:56 it tells us there what was involved
00:04:59 with a steward’s responsibility.
00:05:02 In Biblical times, apparently, a steward could be the manager
00:05:07 or the one who ran a household or an estate.
00:05:12 Oftentimes, the owner would just leave everything
00:05:15 completely to the steward to care for.
00:05:19 All that he was interested in was the final results.
00:05:22 Would he get a profit or not?
00:05:24 Now, it’s interesting that in this Watchtower  article,
00:05:28 it mentions the case of Joseph.
00:05:30 What do we remember from what Genesis chapter 39 tells us?
00:05:34 It says that Potiphar left everything
00:05:38 in Joseph’s control.
00:05:40 And he had no thought of anything except the food that he was receiving.
00:05:44 So here we have a situation where the steward is a manager of an estate.
00:05:49 The master really isn’t concerned with all the details of what’s happening,
00:05:54 at least up to this point, and he still has authority.
00:05:59 So those that were listening to Jesus —what may they have thought about?
00:06:04 Well, we don’t know for sure.
00:06:06 But perhaps they may have thought
00:06:08 of this steward reducing the interest rate.
00:06:13 Or perhaps he reduced his personal commission
00:06:17 that was originally put on these loans.
00:06:20 Or perhaps originally in his enthusiasm, he overcharged them,
00:06:25 and now he was reducing it down to the normal price.
00:06:29 Whatever the case, we know that a steward who is a manager,
00:06:34 like many managers today,
00:06:36 has the right to write off certain debts completely
00:06:39 and even forgive certain debts.
00:06:42 So, obviously, then, as The Watchtower  pointed out,
00:06:46 this steward still had full control
00:06:49 and had the responsibility and the authority
00:06:53 to be able to make whatever changes he saw fit.
00:06:57 So that begs the question, Was he dishonest?
00:07:02 Well, when we read a number of versions of the Bible in English,
00:07:06 they actually say the “dishonest steward”
00:07:10 and they use the term “dishonest.”
00:07:12 But let’s have a look and see again what the Bible actually says.
00:07:16 The New World Translation very accurately translates it
00:07:19 this way in verse 8:
00:07:21 “And his master commended the steward, though unrighteous.”
00:07:26 You see, it doesn’t say “dishonest.”
00:07:28 It doesn’t say he was a thief.
00:07:30 “Though unrighteous, because he acted with practical wisdom.”
00:07:36 So when we think of this,
00:07:38 this steward didn’t do the right thing.
00:07:41 That’s what “unrighteous” means.
00:07:42 It is a very broad statement.
00:07:44 And what would have been the right thing to do?
00:07:46 To do things for the master.
00:07:49 But in this case, he was doing something for himself.
00:07:52 Now, some Bible translators have tried to capture that thought.
00:07:56 Let me read you one example.
00:07:58 It says, ‘His boss acknowledged that the business manager
00:08:03 ‘who had permitted the invoices to be changed
00:08:06 had acted cleverly in his own selfish interest.’
00:08:12 Do we know exactly all the details behind what Jesus was saying?
00:08:17 No.
00:08:18 But what does this help us to see?
00:08:20 Don’t jump to conclusions.
00:08:22 Read what the scripture says, and don’t get distracted
00:08:25 by details that could take away
00:08:27 from the beautiful lesson that we should gain.
00:08:30 And what is the lesson?
00:08:31 Jesus tells us.
00:08:32 Let’s look in verse 9:
00:08:34 “Also, I say to you: Make friends for yourselves
00:08:38 “by means of the unrighteous riches,
00:08:40 “so that when such fail,
00:08:42 they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.”
00:08:46 What’s the lesson?
00:08:47 We need to use our assets, our material assets,
00:08:51 in a way that makes friends with Jehovah and Jesus.
00:08:54 That results in something good.
00:08:56 And we noticed there in verse 9 that it says: “when [these] fail.”
00:09:00 It doesn’t say “if.”
00:09:02 And we realize, as Jehovah’s servants,
00:09:04 that eventually the commercial systems of this world will fail.
00:09:09 Whatever money we have, whatever assets we have
00:09:13 —it’s just like with this steward— they don’t really belong to us,
00:09:15 and soon we’re not going to have them to use.
00:09:18 So, surely, we would want to use them
00:09:20 to Jehovah’s praise and to make friends with Jehovah.
00:09:24 So, what assets do Bethelites have?
00:09:26 Well, we have our own personal assets, few as they may be.
00:09:30 But also, we make use of the assets of the organization.
00:09:35 Remember, we may not be tempted
00:09:38 to be dishonest with those assets,
00:09:41 but could we be wasteful with those assets?
00:09:45 Well, that brings us to the final thought
00:09:47 in verse 10, where Jesus said:
00:09:50 “The person faithful in what is least
00:09:52 “[that is with regard to material things and assets]
00:09:55 “is faithful also in much,
00:09:57 “and the person unrighteous in what is least
00:10:00 is unrighteous also in much.”
00:10:03 What’s the lesson?
00:10:05 Don’t get distracted by details.
00:10:07 Step back and see what the illustration is telling us.
00:10:11 And in this case, it’s a beautiful reminder
00:10:14 that we should use whatever we have to Jehovah’s glory.

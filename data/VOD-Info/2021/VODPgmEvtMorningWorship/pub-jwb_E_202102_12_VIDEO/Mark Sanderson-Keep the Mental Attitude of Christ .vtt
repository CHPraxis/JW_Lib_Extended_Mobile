During this COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:07.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s not hard for negative feelings

00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to begin to form in our minds.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We may begin to think a lot

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about things that we were able

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do in the past.

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us at Bethel, maybe it’s thinking
about some of the speaking assignments

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had in various congregations,

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:27.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being with different brothers and sisters
and getting to meet different ones.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:32.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we even think about when
we served as Bethel representatives

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at circuit assemblies or regional conventions

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with large, large crowds
of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders in the field may think
about the work that they did

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many, many years on convention committees

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:49.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in organizing large departments,

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either at conventions or at assemblies.

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneers might be thinking
about what they did

00:00:55.872 --> 00:01:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the special metropolitan
public witnessing program

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just in public witnessing in general.

00:01:03.146 --> 00:01:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, there are all of the pioneers

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have commuted to Bethel,

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some for many years, to support our work.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, all of these
involve different assignments,

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:20.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there’s one thing
that they all have in common.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have had to hit the “pause button”

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:29.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of these assignments
that we love so much.

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:33.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes we may begin
to ask ourselves,

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Does the fact that I no longer

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘can do these assignments
that I loved so much

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘mean that somehow I’ve lost value,

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m not as precious to Jehovah anymore?’

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is where our text
can be so helpful to us.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:51.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it again.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go in our Bibles
to Philippians chapter 2,

00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read together verses 5 to 7.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read all three verses.

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Keep this mental attitude in you

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was also in Christ Jesus, 

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:12.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who, although he was existing in God’s form,

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“namely, that he should be equal to God.

00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, [but now let’s focus on this, No,]

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he emptied himself

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and took a slave’s form

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and became human.”

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, it’s just a few words there,

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can you imagine
what was involved in that last expression:

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He emptied himself

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took a slave’s form”?

00:02:45.114 --> 00:02:49.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard for us
even to begin to imagine

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the position that Jesus occupied

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:53.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the heavens before he came to earth.

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we get a little glimpse of it
if we go to our Bibles.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Colossians chapter 1,

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:06.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look at verse 15.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:08.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now speaking about Jesus, it says:

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:12.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He is the image of the invisible God,

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the firstborn of all creation;

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:17.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because by means of him

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all other things were created
in the heavens and on the earth,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the things visible and the things invisible,

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether they are thrones
or lordships or governments or authorities.

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All other things

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:36.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have been created through him and for him.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, he is before all other things,

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by means of him all other things
were made to exist.”

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, as the master worker,

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:50.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was used by his Father

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:53.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the creation of the universe

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the things in it.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 1:3 says:

00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:01.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things came into existence through him,

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and apart from him not even one thing

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:07.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came into existence.”

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:12.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing role Jesus played in heaven!

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus was willing
to give up that position in heaven

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accept the assignment

00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:23.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had for him here on the earth.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what did accepting
that assignment involve?

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s look at three different things.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might be finding the lockdown challenging,

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially after seven months.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But consider this:

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had to be in the womb of Mary

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a helpless embryo for nine months.

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine what
a change that was for him?

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:51.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second thing:

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had been the Spokesman
for Jehovah in heaven,

00:04:55.778 --> 00:05:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now Jesus would have to learn to speak

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be taught by imperfect humans.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a third one:

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In heaven, his associates had been faithful,

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:12.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
powerful, heavenly spirit creatures.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when on earth, who were his associates?

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:19.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fishermen, former prostitutes,

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the very common, simple, humble people

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom the Pharisees in John 7:49

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called “accursed.”

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do you think?

00:05:32.882 --> 00:05:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that a major change, for Jesus

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave his heavenly position
and come to the earth?

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:41.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He truly “emptied himself,”

00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Philippians 2:7 says.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s the question,

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Jesus feel that somehow
he had lost value with Jehovah

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:54.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had gone
through such a huge change

00:05:54.404 --> 00:05:57.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his assignment and now
was a human on earth?

00:05:57.507 --> 00:05:59.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not for a moment.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, will you open your Bibles?

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together this thought

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of John chapter 8,

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look together here at verse 29.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “And the One who sent me

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is with me;

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did not abandon me to myself,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I always do
the things pleasing to him.”

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful verse?

00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:37.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jesus knew
that the work that he was doing

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the work his Father had asked him to do.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not the same work
that he had done when he was in heaven,

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was still always doing

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the things that were pleasing to his Father.

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for that reason, Jesus knew in his heart

00:06:55.665 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God would certainly
never abandon him.

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He kept busy working hard

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his present assignment, not focusing

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what he had done in the past.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now, brothers and sisters,
what do we learn from this?

00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all had some changes

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(some of them even major changes)

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:22.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our assignments because of the pandemic.

00:07:22.058 --> 00:07:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our primary goal has never changed.

00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:30.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like Jesus,
we continually seek to do the things

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pleasing to our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can’t go from door to door right now.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can’t do public witnessing,

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can’t meet at our Kingdom Halls
or Assembly Halls, and so on.

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because we all love Jehovah,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find ways,
even in the midst of this pandemic,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do things that please him.

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower</i>
made an interesting comment. 

00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:58.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  of August 2020,

00:07:58.528 --> 00:08:01.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
page 25—here’s what it said:

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you get discouraged

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you currently do not have
the same privileges

and you will find joy
as you build up the congregation.”

00:08:30.526 --> 00:08:33.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what we’re all trying to do.

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah loves us because we’re trying,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he blesses our efforts.

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, take this experience
that one sister had in the United States.

00:08:44.373 --> 00:08:48.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had sent out some letters
as a part of her ministry,

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:51.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imagine how surprised
this dear sister was

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:56.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive a letter from a lady
that we’re going to call Mary.

00:08:56.552 --> 00:08:58.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what this letter said:

00:08:58.888 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hello, my name is Mary,

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I want to thank you
for sending me a beautiful letter.

00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:09.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was a Jehovah’s Witness
between the ages of 9 and 12.

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:12.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My mother was a full-time pioneer.

“We would go door to door daily.

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as young as I was
and already having the taste

“of birthdays and holidays,
I left my mom to live with my dad.

“My mom pioneered for over 25 years.

“She died in 2007.

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though at my young age
I was not close to her,

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in my adult years, we became best friends.

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To her dying day, she would tell me,

00:09:38.694 --> 00:09:41.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Mary, return to Jehovah.’

00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:45.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I just never felt I could live up
to the standards.

00:09:45.134 --> 00:09:46.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I didn’t want to be a hypocrite.

00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That’s my big issue in not studying.

00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can’t keep one toe in.

00:09:50.506 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s all or nothing.

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:55.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After my mom died, at her memorial,

00:09:55.978 --> 00:09:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“she had a sister give me a Bible.

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:00.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And on the front of the Bible she inscribed:

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:03.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To Mary, from Mom.

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:07.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Return to me in Paradise.’

00:10:07.089 --> 00:10:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to see her so bad,

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I know the only way to do so
is to return to Jehovah, but I get scared.

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What if I can’t do it right?

00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:18.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t want to mess up.

00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every night, I say my prayers
to Jehovah as I have done.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:27.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But on August 19, 2020, I said my prayers,
but this time I asked Jehovah:

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Jehovah, you know how I feel,
and you know my heart.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want to connect to a church,
or a religion, to praise you.’

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I said: ‘Jehovah, you know me.

“It almost has to be a brick to hit me
to understand what’s right.’

00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On August 20th, the very next day,

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I went to get the mail,
and I received your letter.

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could not believe it.

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:53.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was so shocked 
that I actually sat down and thought: 

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Wow! Now what do I do?’

00:10:55.771 --> 00:11:00.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah answered; now I need
to follow through, and I’m nervous.

“I hope that you can help me 
take the steps I need to take.

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:09.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Again, I’m scared, but I hope
that I can make the changes I need to make.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sincerely, Mary.”

00:11:13.055 --> 00:11:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s the power of one letter.

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:21.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we’ve had
to press that “pause button”

00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on many of the assignments
that we have just loved doing.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does that mean
that we’ve lost value with Jehovah?

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is still with us.

00:11:31.574 --> 00:11:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have not lost any value with him,

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is not going to abandon us.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do?

00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:43.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus, let’s not focus
on what we used to do,

00:11:43.753 --> 00:11:48.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead, let’s do everything
we can do right now

00:11:48.424 --> 00:11:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do all the things pleasing

00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:53.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our wonderful heavenly Father, Jehovah.

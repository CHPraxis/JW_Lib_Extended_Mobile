Today’s text and comments

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:07.123 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
highlight two subjects:

00:00:07.123 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one, a very important event;

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:14.798 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
two, a very important quality.

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The event is Armageddon.

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The quality is obedience.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s consider these questions:

00:00:23.573 --> 00:00:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will take place before Armageddon?

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we benefit now from being obedient?

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:33.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the link

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Armageddon and obedience?

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with the subject of Armageddon.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:44.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the events
that are taking place

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before the start of Armageddon?

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as explained in the <i>Pure Worship</i>  book,
chapter 18,

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:59.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the destruction
of all false religious organizations,

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as God’s servants worldwide

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be used by Jehovah to proclaim

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a final and hard-hitting judgment message.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That message may announce

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the political system is about to end.

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not surprisingly, the kings of the earth

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not take that kindly.

00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 38

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes that these kings will attack us

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:34.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their role as Gog of Magog.

00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since we as God’s people
live in many different countries,

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these kings will need to work together

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:45.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across national borders

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to attack us all at the same time.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do so, they have to combine,

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or coalesce, their efforts.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is why in our current publications,

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog of Magog is described as a combination,

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:06.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or coalition, of nations.

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, who among God’s people will be attacked

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Gog of Magog?

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will the remaining anointed Christians
still be on earth

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also be attacked?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The July issue

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower  </i>of 2015 stated this:

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shortly before the remaining ones
of the 144,000

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are taken to heaven,

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gog will attack God’s people.”

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, according to this <i>Watchtower</i>,
the nations will attack us

00:02:38.608 --> 00:02:42.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while the anointed Christians
are still on earth.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:46.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, where does the Bible confirm
that statement?

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:51.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ezekiel 38:16.

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about Gog of Magog,
the prophecy states:

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Like clouds covering the land,

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will come against my people Israel.”

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as our publications have long explained,

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israel here refers to spiritual Israel.

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So indeed, the remnant of spiritual Israel,

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the brothers on the Governing Body
at that time,

00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be with us
when this coalition attacks us.

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, having these faithful brothers
at our side

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will certainly give us an added measure

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of inner calmness and peace

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us
to get through the initial phase

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:36.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the attack
of that fierce coalition of nations.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then at some point
during the attack by Gog of Magog,

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will send out his angels

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gather all the remaining
spiritual Israelites worldwide

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will be raised to heaven.

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That event will mean

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a big change for us on earth.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will face our enemies

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without the anointed brothers at our side.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, even so,

00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 21:28,

00:04:09.232 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will ‘stand up straight
and lift up our heads.’

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why will we not fear?

00:04:16.406 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we know that the departure
of the anointed ones to heaven

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicates that our rescue is imminent.

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus and the angels
and the 144,000 brothers of Christ

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will form the heavenly army
that comes to deliver us

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the coalition of nations.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just think about the emotions

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the anointed ones will feel for us

00:04:41.497 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they come to our rescue.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the anointed have developed
personal friendships with us.

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:52.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have served together with us
here at Bethel and in the congregations

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:57.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we had the privilege
of supporting them in various ways.

00:04:57.113 --> 00:05:00.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can just imagine how happy they will be

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:04.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they follow Jesus to deliver us!

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, they will have

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both the authority and the power

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defend those on earth

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who supported them so loyally

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during their trials while they were on earth.

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder that our text for today

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes from a <i>Watchtower </i> article
with the title

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Armageddon Is Good News!”

00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:30.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is good news
for all those who serve Jehovah

00:05:30.313 --> 00:05:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in heaven and on earth.

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us now consider our second subject,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the quality of obedience.

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, we received a letter
from the Personnel Committee

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the subject of obedience.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:49.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about the lessons
we have learned during the lockdown,

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the letter stated:

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Perhaps the greatest thing we have learned

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the importance of obedience.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In this, you dear brothers and sisters

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:04.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have set an outstanding example.”

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:07.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same warm commendation

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to all faithful brothers
and sisters worldwide.

00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As God’s servants,
we are “obedient from the heart,”

00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read at Romans 6:17.

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are obedient because we love Jehovah.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have we benefited from the instructions

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve received
from Jehovah’s organization?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A married couple in this country said,

00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Following the directions we received gave us

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace of mind.”

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister in the Philippines said,

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:48.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Being obedient gives me freeness of speech

00:06:48.257 --> 00:06:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I teach my Bible students
and give advice to my friends.”

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother in Peru said,

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I now feel better prepared to be obedient

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to instructions yet to come.”

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:07.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you will agree that these expressions
reflect how we all feel

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the benefits of showing obedience.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our obedience also influences
unbelieving family members.

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example.

00:07:18.154 --> 00:07:21.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister in the United States
has been serving Jehovah

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:24.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 45 years.

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But during all these years,

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:29.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her husband did not show interest.

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, during the pandemic, he noticed

00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:36.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loving care that the congregation
was showing to his family.

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And out of appreciation,
the husband began to attend

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:43.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation <i>Zoom </i> meetings.

00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he often heard
announcements from Bethel

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about taking safety measures
to avoid getting the virus,

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could see how obeying that direction

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
safeguarded the congregation.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day,
a non-Witness relative told him,

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:01.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let’s go out together.”

00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:04.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The husband replied,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am doing nothing

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until Bethel says we can go.”

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:12.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how happy the sister was

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she heard her husband’s reply!

00:08:15.478 --> 00:08:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her son said, “My dad is 83 years old,

00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there is still hope for him.”

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:24.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, our final question,

00:08:24.687 --> 00:08:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the link
between Armageddon and obedience?

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, James 3:17 helps us to find the answer.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read
that we need to be “ready to obey.”

00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the expression “ready to obey”

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:46.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a translation of a Greek word
that is mentioned only one time

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:49.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the entire <i>New World Translation</i>

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at James 3:17.

00:08:52.882 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person who is “ready to obey”

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is quick to change his opinion

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:02.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he is presented with facts
that correct his thinking.

00:09:02.391 --> 00:09:05.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is someone
who is known for his willingness

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:08.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get along with others.

00:09:08.231 --> 00:09:11.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, interestingly, in the first century,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same Greek word was also used

00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a military setting.

00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible scholars mentioned
that Flavius Josephus,

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:23.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jewish historian,

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used that same word to describe

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:29.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obedient soldiers in the Roman army.

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:32.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Josephus wrote
that one of the reasons

00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:34.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why the Roman army was so successful

00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that the soldiers were well-trained,

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ready to obey.

00:09:41.097 --> 00:09:43.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does that apply to us?

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, we do not use
literal weapons as soldiers do.

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:51.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, there is a similarity
between those Roman soldiers in the past

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and us today.

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:57.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too have to be well-trained

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to obey.

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:01.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the obedience that we develop today

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to obey life-saving instructions

00:10:07.957 --> 00:10:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will receive
from God’s organization in the future.

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:16.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the nations attack us
and the war of Armageddon follows,

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing obedience will be our protection.

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what were the main points
of our brief discussion?

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:29.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly before Armageddon,

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will face the attack
of a coalition of nations.

00:10:34.383 --> 00:10:37.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s circumstances

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow us to train ourselves
in being obedient.

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as Armageddon comes closer,

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be protected

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as we are “ready to obey.”

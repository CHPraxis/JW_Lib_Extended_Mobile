00:00:01 Today’s text and comments
00:00:04 highlight two subjects:
00:00:07 one, a very important event;
00:00:10 two, a very important quality.
00:00:14 The event is Armageddon.
00:00:17 The quality is obedience.
00:00:20 So let’s consider these questions:
00:00:23 What will take place before Armageddon?
00:00:27 How do we benefit now from being obedient?
00:00:31 What is the link
00:00:33 between Armageddon and obedience?
00:00:37 Let’s start with the subject of Armageddon.
00:00:40 What are some of the events that are taking place
00:00:44 shortly before the start of Armageddon?
00:00:50 Now, as explained in the Pure Worship  book, chapter 18,
00:00:54 after the destruction of all false religious organizations,
00:00:59 we as God’s servants worldwide
00:01:02 may be used by Jehovah to proclaim
00:01:04 a final and hard-hitting judgment message.
00:01:09 That message may announce
00:01:12 that the political system is about to end.
00:01:16 Not surprisingly, the kings of the earth
00:01:19 will not take that kindly.
00:01:25 Ezekiel chapter 38
00:01:27 describes that these kings will attack us
00:01:31 in their role as Gog of Magog.
00:01:34 Now, since we as God’s people live in many different countries,
00:01:39 these kings will need to work together
00:01:43 across national borders
00:01:45 in order to attack us all at the same time.
00:01:48 To do so, they have to combine,
00:01:51 or coalesce, their efforts.
00:01:55 And that is why in our current publications,
00:01:58 Gog of Magog is described as a combination,
00:02:02 or coalition, of nations.
00:02:06 Now, who among God’s people will be attacked
00:02:09 by Gog of Magog?
00:02:11 Will the remaining anointed Christians still be on earth
00:02:14 and also be attacked?
00:02:17 The July issue
00:02:19 of The Watchtower  of 2015 stated this:
00:02:24 “Shortly before the remaining ones of the 144,000
00:02:29 “are taken to heaven,
00:02:31 Gog will attack God’s people.”
00:02:34 Thus, according to this Watchtower, the nations will attack us
00:02:38 while the anointed Christians are still on earth.
00:02:42 Now, where does the Bible confirm that statement?
00:02:46 At Ezekiel 38:16.
00:02:51 Speaking about Gog of Magog, the prophecy states:
00:02:56 “Like clouds covering the land,
00:02:59 you will come against my people Israel.”
00:03:04 Now, as our publications have long explained,
00:03:06 Israel here refers to spiritual Israel.
00:03:10 So indeed, the remnant of spiritual Israel,
00:03:13 including the brothers on the Governing Body at that time,
00:03:16 will be with us when this coalition attacks us.
00:03:20 Now, having these faithful brothers at our side
00:03:23 will certainly give us an added measure
00:03:26 of inner calmness and peace
00:03:29 that will help us to get through the initial phase
00:03:32 of the attack of that fierce coalition of nations.
00:03:36 But then at some point during the attack by Gog of Magog,
00:03:41 Jesus will send out his angels
00:03:44 to gather all the remaining spiritual Israelites worldwide
00:03:47 and they will be raised to heaven.
00:03:51 That event will mean
00:03:53 a big change for us on earth.
00:03:56 We will face our enemies
00:03:59 without the anointed brothers at our side.
00:04:03 Yet, even so,
00:04:05 according to Luke 21:28,
00:04:09 we will ‘stand up straight and lift up our heads.’
00:04:13 Now, why will we not fear?
00:04:16 Because we know that the departure of the anointed ones to heaven
00:04:20 indicates that our rescue is imminent.
00:04:24 Jesus and the angels and the 144,000 brothers of Christ
00:04:28 will form the heavenly army that comes to deliver us
00:04:32 from the coalition of nations.
00:04:35 Now, just think about the emotions
00:04:38 that the anointed ones will feel for us
00:04:41 as they come to our rescue.
00:04:44 Many of the anointed have developed personal friendships with us.
00:04:49 They have served together with us here at Bethel and in the congregations
00:04:52 where we had the privilege of supporting them in various ways.
00:04:57 We can just imagine how happy they will be
00:05:00 when they follow Jesus to deliver us!
00:05:04 At that moment, they will have
00:05:06 both the authority and the power
00:05:09 to defend those on earth
00:05:12 who supported them so loyally
00:05:15 during their trials while they were on earth.
00:05:19 No wonder that our text for today
00:05:21 comes from a Watchtower  article with the title
00:05:24 “Armageddon Is Good News!”
00:05:26 Yes, it is good news for all those who serve Jehovah
00:05:30 in heaven and on earth.
00:05:34 Let us now consider our second subject,
00:05:37 the quality of obedience.
00:05:40 Recently, we received a letter from the Personnel Committee
00:05:43 about the subject of obedience.
00:05:46 Speaking about the lessons we have learned during the lockdown,
00:05:49 the letter stated:
00:05:52 “Perhaps the greatest thing we have learned
00:05:55 “is the importance of obedience.
00:05:57 “In this, you dear brothers and sisters
00:06:00 have set an outstanding example.”
00:06:04 That same warm commendation
00:06:07 applies to all faithful brothers and sisters worldwide.
00:06:11 As God’s servants, we are “obedient from the heart,”
00:06:16 as we read at Romans 6:17.
00:06:19 What does that mean?
00:06:20 We are obedient because we love Jehovah.
00:06:25 How have we benefited from the instructions
00:06:27 that we’ve received from Jehovah’s organization?
00:06:31 A married couple in this country said,
00:06:34 “Following the directions we received gave us
00:06:38 peace of mind.”
00:06:40 A sister in the Philippines said,
00:06:43 “Being obedient gives me freeness of speech
00:06:48 when I teach my Bible students and give advice to my friends.”
00:06:52 A brother in Peru said,
00:06:55 “I now feel better prepared to be obedient
00:06:59 to instructions yet to come.”
00:07:02 Well, you will agree that these expressions reflect how we all feel
00:07:07 about the benefits of showing obedience.
00:07:11 Our obedience also influences unbelieving family members.
00:07:16 Here’s an example.
00:07:18 A sister in the United States has been serving Jehovah
00:07:21 for over 45 years.
00:07:24 But during all these years,
00:07:26 her husband did not show interest.
00:07:29 However, during the pandemic, he noticed
00:07:32 the loving care that the congregation was showing to his family.
00:07:36 And out of appreciation, the husband began to attend
00:07:40 the congregation Zoom  meetings.
00:07:43 There he often heard announcements from Bethel
00:07:46 about taking safety measures to avoid getting the virus,
00:07:50 and he could see how obeying that direction
00:07:53 safeguarded the congregation.
00:07:55 Then one day, a non-Witness relative told him,
00:07:59 “Let’s go out together.”
00:08:01 The husband replied,
00:08:04 “I am doing nothing
00:08:06 until Bethel says we can go.”
00:08:10 Imagine how happy the sister was
00:08:12 when she heard her husband’s reply!
00:08:15 Her son said, “My dad is 83 years old,
00:08:18 but there is still hope for him.”
00:08:22 Now, our final question,
00:08:24 What is the link between Armageddon and obedience?
00:08:29 Now, James 3:17 helps us to find the answer.
00:08:34 There we read that we need to be “ready to obey.”
00:08:38 Now, the expression “ready to obey”
00:08:41 is a translation of a Greek word that is mentioned only one time
00:08:46 in the entire New World Translation
00:08:49 here at James 3:17.
00:08:52 A person who is “ready to obey”
00:08:55 is quick to change his opinion
00:08:58 when he is presented with facts that correct his thinking.
00:09:02 It is someone who is known for his willingness
00:09:05 to get along with others.
00:09:08 Now, interestingly, in the first century,
00:09:11 the same Greek word was also used
00:09:14 in a military setting.
00:09:16 Bible scholars mentioned that Flavius Josephus,
00:09:21 the Jewish historian,
00:09:23 used that same word to describe
00:09:26 obedient soldiers in the Roman army.
00:09:29 In fact, Josephus wrote that one of the reasons
00:09:32 why the Roman army was so successful
00:09:34 was that the soldiers were well-trained,
00:09:38 ready to obey.
00:09:41 Now, how does that apply to us?
00:09:43 Well, of course, we do not use literal weapons as soldiers do.
00:09:47 Still, there is a similarity between those Roman soldiers in the past
00:09:51 and us today.
00:09:53 We too have to be well-trained
00:09:57 and ready to obey.
00:09:59 Why?
00:10:01 Because the obedience that we develop today
00:10:04 will help us to obey life-saving instructions
00:10:07 that we will receive from God’s organization in the future.
00:10:12 When the nations attack us and the war of Armageddon follows,
00:10:16 showing obedience will be our protection.
00:10:22 So, what were the main points of our brief discussion?
00:10:26 Shortly before Armageddon,
00:10:29 we will face the attack of a coalition of nations.
00:10:34 Today’s circumstances
00:10:37 allow us to train ourselves in being obedient.
00:10:41 And as Armageddon comes closer,
00:10:44 we will be protected
00:10:46 as long as we are “ready to obey.”

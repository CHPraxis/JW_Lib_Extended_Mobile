00:00:09 Since ancient times,
00:00:11 humans have wanted to feel close to God.
00:00:15 This is a noble desire.
00:00:19 The Bible says that if we “seek God,”
00:00:22 we can “really find him” and “draw close” to him.
00:00:27 Yet, God is invisible.
00:00:29 So how can we feel close
00:00:31 to a God whom we cannot see?
00:00:35 Would it help if we venerated physical objects
00:00:38 as a means to feel closer to God?
00:00:41 Some people use statues in their worship.
00:00:45 Others venerate icons and other religious images
00:00:47 as part of their worship.
00:00:51 But is it possible that those who try to get closer to God in this way
00:00:56 are actually drawing farther away from him?
00:01:01 Consider what the Bible says happened when the ancient Israelites
00:01:05 made a statue of a calf and tried to use it to worship God
00:01:11 and they called it “a festival to Jehovah,” the God of the Bible.
00:01:17 Did God accept this kind of worship?
00:01:20 No.
00:01:22 He said that he was not pleased
00:01:24 with what they had done.
00:01:26 Just think:
00:01:27 Instead of helping them to get closer to God,
00:01:30 this object actually pushed them away.
00:01:38 In fact, contrary to ancient rulers
00:01:41 who were often viewed as gods and had images of themselves made,
00:01:46 the “great King over all”
00:01:48 —Jehovah God—
00:01:50 told his people not to create
00:01:52 or use images for worship.
00:01:55 He said:
00:01:57 “You must not make for yourself a carved image . . .
00:01:59 “You must not bow down to them . . .
00:02:01 I . . . am a God who requires exclusive devotion.”
00:02:07 Centuries later, the same command applied to Jesus’ followers.
00:02:13 The apostle John wrote to early Christians, saying:
00:02:16 “Guard yourselves from idols.”
00:02:26 God explains why his worship should always be free of images:
00:02:31 “I give my glory to no one else,
00:02:34 nor my praise to graven images.”
00:02:42 He invites people to draw close to him personally
00:02:46 and to pray to him directly without the use of images.
00:02:52 Is it really wrong to use images,
00:02:55 idols, or icons merely as aids in our worship?
00:02:59 How can we feel close to God if we cannot see him?

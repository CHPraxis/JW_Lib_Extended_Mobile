Since ancient times,

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humans have wanted to feel close to God.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a noble desire.

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that if we “seek God,”

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can “really find him”
and “draw close” to him.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yet, God is invisible.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.927 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So how can we feel close

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:33.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to a God whom we cannot see?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would it help
if we venerated physical objects

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a means to feel closer to God?

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people use statues in their worship.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others venerate icons
and other religious images

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as part of their worship.

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it possible that those
who try to get closer to God in this way

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are actually drawing farther away from him?

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what the Bible says
happened when the ancient Israelites

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a statue of a calf
and tried to use it to worship God

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they called it “a festival to Jehovah,”
the God of the Bible.

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:19.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did God accept this kind of worship?

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:24.313 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He said that he was not pleased

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with what they had done.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:27.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just think:

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of helping them to get closer to God,

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this object actually pushed them away.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:41.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, contrary to ancient rulers

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were often viewed as gods
and had images of themselves made,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “great King over all”

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:50.214 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah God—

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.257 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
told his people not to create

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.301 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or use images for worship.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not make
for yourself a carved image . . .

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not bow down to them . . .

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I . . . am a God
who requires exclusive devotion.”

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:11.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Centuries later, the same command
applied to Jesus’ followers.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle John
wrote to early Christians, saying:

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Guard yourselves from idols.”

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God explains why his worship
should always be free of images:

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I give my glory to no one else,

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor my praise to graven images.”

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He invites people
to draw close to him personally

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to pray to him directly
without the use of images.

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it really wrong to use images,

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
idols, or icons
merely as aids in our worship?

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:03.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we feel close to God
if we cannot see him?

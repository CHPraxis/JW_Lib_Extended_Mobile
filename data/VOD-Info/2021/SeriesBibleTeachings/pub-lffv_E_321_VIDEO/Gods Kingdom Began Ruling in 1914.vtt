00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since the first humans
rejected Jehovah God as Ruler,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our world has been plagued
with evil and suffering.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus offered hope.

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:19.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He taught that as King of God’s Kingdom,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would restore peace
and justice to the earth.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when would that Kingdom
begin to rule?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the Bible,
it is ruling right now!

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that?

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what happened over 2,600 years ago.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God caused Nebuchadnezzar,

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a King of ancient Babylon,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a prophetic dream.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.962 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the dream,

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.298 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar saw a giant tree

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that reached all the way to heaven.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:52.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The tree was cut down,

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:55.346 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but its stump was left in the ground.

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:57.974 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After a period of “seven times,”

00:00:57.974 --> 00:00:59.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the tree grew again.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.980 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Bible indicates that this dream

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would have two fulfillments.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.443 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first had to do

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.653 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with King Nebuchadnezzar himself.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.655 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He was very prominent

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.032 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—like the tree that reached

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.867 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all the way to heaven.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was cut down for “seven times.”

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This happened when Nebuchadnezzar

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lost his sanity for seven years.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time,

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was unable to rule as king.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the seven times,

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar regained his sanity

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:36.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started ruling again.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:41.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the first fulfillment
of this prophecy.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the second fulfillment?

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to do with God’s rulership.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:52.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that kings in ancient Israel

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.155 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“sat on Jehovah’s throne.”

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:56.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they represented God and his rulership.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, most of those kings

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became disobedient to Jehovah

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did most of their subjects.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of their disobedience,

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:13.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God allowed the Israelites

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be conquered by the Babylonians,

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.513 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who destroyed the city of Jerusalem

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in 607 B.C.E.

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From that time on,

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:26.145 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no more kings represented Jehovah

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Jerusalem.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thus, 607 B.C.E.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.404 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
marked the beginning of the seven times,

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or the period when God’s rulership

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:38.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be interrupted.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:40.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That period would last

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.703 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until Jehovah installed

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.788 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a new king to represent Him

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:47.000 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—this time, someone in heaven.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When would that happen?

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the second fulfillment of this prophecy,

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the seven times must be

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.801 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
more than seven literal years.

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:58.803 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, nothing significant

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:03.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
relating to God’s rulership happened

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:07.187 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
seven years after Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:09.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And centuries later,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.400 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus indicated that the seven times

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.903 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had not yet ended.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.739 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In a prophecy about the last days,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.741 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that Jerusalem,

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.534 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or God’s rulership,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:23.786 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would “be trampled on by the nations

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“until the appointed times of the nations

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are fulfilled.”

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.044 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The appointed times of the nations”

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:34.047 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are the same as the “seven times.”

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When would those “times” end?

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Bible book of Revelation says

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:43.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that three and a half times

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:47.310 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
equal 1,260 days.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.979 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So seven times is double that number,

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:53.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or 2,520 days.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.443 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In Bible prophecy,

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:58.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a day can represent a year.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.949 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That is the case with the prophecy

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.951 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the seven times.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:08.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They represent 2,520 years.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Counting forward from 607 B.C.E.,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
2,520 years

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
takes us to the year 1914

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:22.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the year that the seven times ended

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus began ruling from heaven

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as King of God’s Kingdom.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That began a period

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:32.855 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible calls “the last days.”

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon,

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will finish gathering

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rest of his corulers
to join him in heaven.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom will then undo every problem

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that afflicts us and our families.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine living there

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the rulership of a King

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really cares about you!

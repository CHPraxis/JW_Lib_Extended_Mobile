There are many people who love to boast.

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:11.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Politicians frequently boast
about what they have done

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:14.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what they have promised to do
for their constituents.

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:16.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And businessmen,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they love to boast
about how successful they are

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:22.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much money they are making.

00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And athletes, you know,
athletes are prideful, many of them.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they boast about the events

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve been great in
and that they’ve won.

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, you know, it’s interesting to note

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the highly competitive sports world,

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is an expression for great achievers.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:45.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression is GOAT

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—G-O-A-T—

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greatest of all time.

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine people thinking

00:00:54.504 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that somehow they have been
the greatest of all time?

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hear the words
“greatest of all time,”

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only one person comes to mind.

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the greatest man who ever lived

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—truly the greatest of all time,
Jesus Christ.

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his greatness had nothing to do

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:17.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with politics, business,

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or playing games.

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it had everything to do

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:27.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with praising Jehovah and boasting

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:29.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah God.

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew the counsel that’s recorded

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah chapter 9,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 23, 24.

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this scripture, this text, is beautiful.

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 9:23, 24

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it says:

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let not the wise man boast
about his wisdom;

00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:58.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘let not the mighty man boast
about his mightiness;

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and let not the rich man boast
about his riches.

00:02:03.306 --> 00:02:06.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘But let the one boasting

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘boast about this:

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That he has insight and knowledge of me,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that I am Jehovah,

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One showing loyal love,

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘justice, and righteousness in the earth,

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for in these things

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:27.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I take delight,’ declares Jehovah.”

00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:32.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to boast in Jehovah really means

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re proud to bear his name.

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We rejoice in his reputation.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got it in the Scriptures,
and we can see it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the organization today.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah takes delight
when we boast in him

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in his provisions, in his justice,

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his promises, and in his loyal love.

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:03.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you students of the 150th class of Gilead

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(students, soon-to-be graduates,
I should add),

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got a lot of reasons
to boast in Jehovah God.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that throughout his ministry,
Jesus boasted in Jehovah.

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:19.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you examine closely the Scriptures
and things that Jesus said,

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to see on many occasions

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he boasted in Jehovah.

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just to give you one example,

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember when the rich young ruler
approached Jesus and he said:

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Oh,] Good Teacher”
to the Lord Jesus Christ?

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jesus say?

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you call me good?

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:43.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is good except one, God.”

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a wonderful boast

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah God, glorifying him.

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you students can boast in Jehovah

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:53.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you’ve been doing it for a long time)

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now you have

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the privilege of going out,
fulfilling an assignment,

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showing how much
you really do rely on Jehovah God.

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast because you’ve experienced
what Jesus declared

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:11.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 8:32.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “And you will know the truth,
and the truth will set you free.”

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s something we all know.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t minimize it.

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate the freedom you have right now

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know the truth.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been set free
from the lies of this world

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that hold people in bondage
about false beliefs in life and death.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re free from human thinking that man

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to remedy
the problems of this old world,

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:41.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we know they can’t do it.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They haven’t got the wherewithal to do it.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No man can really “direct his [own steps],”
not even a perfect man.

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:51.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can deliver his people too.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:56.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even where we’re under severe persecution,

00:04:56.045 --> 00:05:00.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can intervene
whenever he sees fit to do so.

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast also in another thing
—that you are slaves of Jehovah.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’re in a unique position
because very few slaves

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are allowed to choose their master,

00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:12.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve done it.

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve chosen Jehovah God

00:05:15.264 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be your Master and to be a slave to him.

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know that Jehovah is with you.

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re happy, and you’re willing slaves
of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:28.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s a remarkable slavery, really,

00:05:28.878 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because no one has the freedom

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:35.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.

00:05:35.785 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so free and able to do so many things

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving Jehovah but all the while

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the good life
that God has given to us.

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast also in the brotherhood,

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can gather together
in assemblies to praise Jehovah God.

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you know Jesus’ words are true:

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Two or three are gathered in his name.

00:05:57.573 --> 00:05:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he is in our midst.’

00:05:59.008 --> 00:06:03.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether it’s tens of thousands
gathered together at a big convention

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or two or three gathering together secretly,

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:15.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can also boast in the great privilege
you have through prayer.

00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about it for a moment.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:22.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can talk to the almighty Creator
of the universe personally.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is really something quite remarkable.

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that is a privilege we have,

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we boast in the privilege we have

00:06:29.705 --> 00:06:33.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of addressing Jehovah
and asking him for his help,

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his spirit to guide us,
for his strength and protection.

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:39.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s something else too
that I find fascinating

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:41.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can boast in.

00:06:41.884 --> 00:06:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can boast because you bear

00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:48.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fear-inspiring name
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about that.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re carrying Jehovah’s name.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how grateful, really,
we are that back in 1931

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the visible part of Jehovah’s organization

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not just the name of a religion.

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:10.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a description of what people do.

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are living Witnesses of the Creator.

00:07:17.153 --> 00:07:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a privilege that we have,

00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that separates us
from all religion on the earth.

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s no other religion
that wants that name anyhow.

00:07:25.728 --> 00:07:28.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re delighted that we have it.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they regret, perhaps a few,
that they didn’t listen to or adopt it.

00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are God’s name people,
and at 1 Chronicles 16:10,

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says this: “Boast about his holy name.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the hearts of those
seeking Jehovah rejoice.”

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:51.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you examine synonyms,

00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rejoice” is a synonym in certain cases

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “boast”—to boast in Jehovah.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has allowed you a very special privilege.

00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:08.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the unseen.

00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not all people can do that.

00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vision of many people in this world

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is limited to just the physical
that they see before them,

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they can’t see the unseen.

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:21.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember a man who said,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What has God ever done for me?”

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That poor man.

00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was blind—totally blind spiritually.

00:08:29.058 --> 00:08:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He enjoyed food, drink,
the things the earth provides,

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:36.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he couldn’t see
behind those physical things.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t see
that there had to be a wonderful Creator

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who provided all of these things for him.

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:48.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the unseen.

00:08:48.477 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Jesus Christ ruling
as King in the heavens.

00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the new world that’s coming.

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the resurrection of the dead.

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the functioning
of Jehovah God’s holy spirit

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his people today.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, you know very well

00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve only touched
on a few things that you can boast in,

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll want to continue doing that
—boasting in Jehovah.

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And right now, I know
(all of you students) you feel great.

00:09:17.506 --> 00:09:19.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve completed your course.
You’ve done it.

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re graduating from Gilead School,

00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:25.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now the doors of future activity

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:28.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are swinging open to you.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you undertake your assignments,

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever and wherever they may be,

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do these things, please:

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:40.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay humble,

00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be happy,

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work hard.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And always esteem highly

00:09:47.603 --> 00:09:50.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great honor and privilege you have

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “boast in Jehovah.”

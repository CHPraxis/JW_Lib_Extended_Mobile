00:00:01 Today, it’s a privilege to address you
00:00:05 —a very precious group of people.
00:00:08 Your journey to this day has not been an easy one.
00:00:12 In this talk, we want to focus on a specific journey
00:00:17 —the one that began when you were invited to Gilead
00:00:19 up to your first day in class.
00:00:23 Because of the lockdown, that journey brought you unexpected trials
00:00:28 unknown to previous classes of Gilead.
00:00:31 Along the way, you said many prayers
00:00:33 and even shed some tears.
00:00:36 But instead of giving into despair (we’re so proud of you),
00:00:40 you became stronger.
00:00:43 Your journey can be compared
00:00:45 to the journey of a Levite,
00:00:48 as described in Psalm 84.
00:00:50 Let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 84.
00:00:55 We’re going to review the man’s musings
00:00:58 as he traveled from his home to Jehovah’s temple
00:01:02 —Psalm 84.
00:01:04 And as we do, we will learn what it means
00:01:07 to find strength in Jehovah
00:01:10 and what will help you to continue to go
00:01:12 “from strength to strength.”
00:01:15 So we can begin at verse 5:
00:01:20 “Happy are the men
00:01:22 who find their strength in you.”
00:01:26 Now, what does this mean?
00:01:29 To find strength means you have to be looking for it.
00:01:33 So we look to Jehovah for strength.
00:01:36 How do we do that?
00:01:38 We do that by prayer and focus.
00:01:43 When we pray, we pray to Jehovah for his holy spirit
00:01:47 and focus on him.
00:01:50 He gives us strength.
00:01:52 Now, at first, this strength may be just enough
00:01:55 to start a difficult journey,
00:01:57 such as you started when you received your invitation to Gilead.
00:02:02 But as the journey continues, you’ll become stronger
00:02:06 if you take the right approach.
00:02:09 Well, what is that approach?
00:02:12 Well, let’s read on, and we’ll go to verse 6:
00:02:17 “When they pass through the Baca Valley,
00:02:20 “they make it into a place of springs;
00:02:23 and the early rain clothes it with blessings.”
00:02:28 There were many routes to travel to get to Jerusalem,
00:02:32 but this Levite speaks of traveling
00:02:34 through the Baca Valley,
00:02:37 and that’s not the scenic route.
00:02:39 The Baca Valley was a dry,
00:02:42 desolate, parched area.
00:02:45 In fact, the word “baca” comes from a Hebrew word to “weep.”
00:02:49 It seems that the baca plant exuded a type of milky sap,
00:02:53 giving the appearance of tears, which added to the gloominess
00:02:57 of this parched land.
00:02:59 There may also have been literal tears shed
00:03:02 as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.
00:03:06 But notice, notice what this Levite was able to do
00:03:11 as he walked through this valley.
00:03:14 There, he says in verse 6:
00:03:16 “They make it into a place of springs;
00:03:19 and the early rain clothes it with blessings.”
00:03:24 You see, this Levite was so focused
00:03:26 on the joy that he would have worshipping at the temple
00:03:30 that, as he walked through the dry, desolate Baca Valley,
00:03:35 this scenery along the way looked attractive to him.
00:03:39 He was able to look at this dried up valley with eyes of faith
00:03:44 and make it into a place of water springs.
00:03:47 Now, how was that possible?
00:03:50 Well, it’s like when a brother once described
00:03:53 his trip to the house of a sister he was courting.
00:03:57 It involved getting on dirty buses, crowded subways,
00:04:01 and walking past dingy apartments.
00:04:04 But to him, the whole trip was a beautiful scene
00:04:08 because it was taking him to visit her.
00:04:13 Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84
00:04:16 could see past the gloominess around him
00:04:19 and see Jehovah’s blessings ahead.
00:04:22 He was energized by thinking
00:04:25 about his privilege of actually serving at Jehovah’s temple
00:04:28 to the point where even the Baca Valley was beautiful to him,
00:04:33 because it led to the place
00:04:36 he most wanted to be.
00:04:39 And with that in focus, notice what happens.
00:04:43 Let’s read verse 7:
00:04:47 “They will walk on from strength to strength;
00:04:52 “each one appears before God
00:04:55 in Zion.”
00:04:58 Now, what does that mean —“strength to strength”?
00:05:02 Though the Levite may have entered the valley of tears
00:05:05 weak under the weight of his problems,
00:05:07 love for true worship fueled every step taken.
00:05:12 He knew his service would be noticed by Jehovah,
00:05:16 who would bless his whole-souled effort to serve him.
00:05:20 That was the initial strength from Jehovah that he had.
00:05:25 But when he finally arrived at the temple,
00:05:29 the joy of actually appearing
00:05:32 before Jehovah God —that joy—
00:05:35 and having his approval and blessing
00:05:37 empowered him and it energized him
00:05:41 to walk from the strength that Jehovah initially gives
00:05:45 to even greater strength.
00:05:47 In other words, it made him an even stronger person
00:05:51 than he was before beginning the journey.
00:05:57 Now, for you students,
00:05:59 your journey to Gilead was different from others.
00:06:03 You did not take the scenic route.
00:06:06 But in Jehovah’s strength,
00:06:09 you were able to look beyond the four walls of quarantine,
00:06:13 beyond the lockdown,
00:06:15 beyond the start of class being postponed.
00:06:18 You looked beyond the dry, parched ground of the Baca Valley,
00:06:22 and you saw Jehovah’s blessing on his people.
00:06:26 As the Governing Body gave faithful and discreet direction
00:06:30 to the worldwide brotherhood, you were right here.
00:06:33 You watched it personally.
00:06:36 So though you may have arrived here weakened by your personal trials
00:06:41 after walking through your figurative Baca Valley,
00:06:44 in Jehovah’s strength you came out stronger
00:06:48 and ready to appear —to appear before Jehovah God
00:06:53 to be trained by his organization.
00:06:57 And then, it was finally announced
00:07:01 that the school would start in August.
00:07:05 And I remember —I remember the day
00:07:08 when you walked into the classroom for the first time,
00:07:12 and you sat in your seats,
00:07:14 and you opened up your student binder.
00:07:16 You put your Bible on the desk,
00:07:19 and as you looked up, your eyes revealed,
00:07:22 ‘I made it to my journey.’
00:07:27 And class began, day after day.
00:07:30 It is noteworthy that, in Jehovah’s strength,
00:07:34 not one of you —not one of you missed a day of class.
00:07:38 That is to your credit.
00:07:40 You wanted to learn every day.
00:07:42 You took advantage of every opportunity.
00:07:45 Thank you for the zeal that you showed.
00:07:49 So, yes, remember the lessons from class.
00:07:53 We know you will.
00:07:56 But, also, remember the lesson from your journey
00:08:00 as you take on new assignments in the future.
00:08:03 See past the challenges along the way;
00:08:07 see past the disappointments; see past the tears.
00:08:11 Turn your Baca Valley into a spring,
00:08:14 and you will become stronger for it.
00:08:18 You can do this through prayer.
00:08:22 You can do this by praying to Jehovah
00:08:25 for his spirit and focusing on him.
00:08:28 Remember that the end goal
00:08:31 is not the assignment in itself.
00:08:34 The assignment is just a means to experience your real goal
00:08:40 of having and maintaining Jehovah’s blessing.
00:08:43 If you prayerfully keep that in focus,
00:08:46 Jehovah will completely change your outlook
00:08:49 regarding the challenges in front of you.
00:08:52 The parched land becomes streams of water.
00:08:55 The tears of pain become tears of joy.
00:08:58 You will see Jehovah make you walk on
00:09:01 “from strength to strength”
00:09:04 —from the initial strength Jehovah gives
00:09:07 to becoming an ever stronger servant of his.
00:09:11 He will empower you not only to walk through the valley of hardships
00:09:16 but you will be that much more ready
00:09:19 for whatever work lies ahead.
00:09:21 You will be in a much better position
00:09:23 to appear before Jehovah your God
00:09:27 and enjoy his favor.
00:09:30 So in conclusion,
00:09:32 take the Baca Valley route through all your challenges.
00:09:37 There is a wise saying:
00:09:39 “A calm sea never made a good sailor.”
00:09:43 Likewise, don’t trade hardships for comfort,
00:09:47 because you will feel a closeness to your heavenly Father
00:09:50 in a way that you never would have experienced
00:09:53 if you hadn’t walked from “strength to strength”
00:09:57 through the valley of Baca.

00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:05.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, it’s a privilege to address you

00:00:05.188 --> 00:00:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a very precious group of people.

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your journey to this day
has not been an easy one.

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:17.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we want to focus
on a specific journey

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the one that began
when you were invited to Gilead

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to your first day in class.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the lockdown,
that journey brought you unexpected trials

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unknown to previous classes of Gilead.

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along the way, you said many prayers

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even shed some tears.

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But instead of giving into despair
(we’re so proud of you),

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you became stronger.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your journey can be compared

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the journey of a Levite,

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as described in Psalm 84.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 84.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to review the man’s musings

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he traveled from his home
to Jehovah’s temple

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 84.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, we will learn what it means

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find strength in Jehovah

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what will help you to continue to go

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from strength to strength.”

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can begin at verse 5:

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:22.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy are the men

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who find their strength in you.”

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does this mean?

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find strength means
you have to be looking for it.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we look to Jehovah for strength.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we do that?

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:43.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do that by prayer and focus.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:47.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray, we pray to Jehovah
for his holy spirit

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:50.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focus on him.

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives us strength.

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:55.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at first, this strength
may be just enough

00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start a difficult journey,

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as you started
when you received your invitation to Gilead.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the journey continues,
you’ll become stronger

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you take the right approach.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is that approach?

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read on, and we’ll go to verse 6:

00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they pass through the Baca Valley,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they make it into a place of springs;

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the early rain
clothes it with blessings.”

00:02:28.464 --> 00:02:32.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many routes
to travel to get to Jerusalem,

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this Levite speaks of traveling

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:37.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the Baca Valley,

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s not the scenic route.

00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Baca Valley was a dry,

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
desolate, parched area.

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the word “baca”
comes from a Hebrew word to “weep.”

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that the baca plant
exuded a type of milky sap,

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving the appearance of tears,
which added to the gloominess

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this parched land.

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There may also have been literal tears shed

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, notice what this Levite
was able to do

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he walked through this valley.

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:16.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, he says in verse 6:

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:19.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They make it into a place of springs;

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the early rain
clothes it with blessings.”

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:26.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, this Levite was so focused

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the joy that he would have
worshipping at the temple

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:35.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that, as he walked through the dry,
desolate Baca Valley,

00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this scenery along the way
looked attractive to him.

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:44.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to look at this dried up valley
with eyes of faith

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it into a place of water springs.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how was that possible?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s like when a brother once described

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his trip to the house of a sister
he was courting.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It involved getting on dirty buses,
crowded subways,

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walking past dingy apartments.

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:08.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to him, the whole trip
was a beautiful scene

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was taking him to visit her.

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could see past the gloominess around him

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see Jehovah’s blessings ahead.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was energized by thinking

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:28.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his privilege of actually serving
at Jehovah’s temple

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:33.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where even the Baca Valley
was beautiful to him,

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it led to the place

00:04:36.092 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he most wanted to be.

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:43.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that in focus, notice what happens.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 7:

00:04:47.403 --> 00:04:52.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will walk on from strength to strength;

00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one appears before God

00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Zion.”

00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:02.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that mean
—“strength to strength”?

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:05.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though the Levite may have entered
the valley of tears

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weak under the weight of his problems,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love for true worship
fueled every step taken.

00:05:12.595 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew his service would be noticed
by Jehovah,

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would bless his whole-souled effort
to serve him.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the initial strength from Jehovah
that he had.

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he finally arrived at the temple,

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the joy of actually appearing

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah God
—that joy—

00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having his approval and blessing

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
empowered him and it energized him

00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk from the strength
that Jehovah initially gives

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even greater strength.

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, it made him
an even stronger person

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than he was before beginning the journey.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for you students,

00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your journey to Gilead
was different from others.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did not take the scenic route.

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in Jehovah’s strength,

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were able to look
beyond the four walls of quarantine,

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond the lockdown,

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond the start of class being postponed.

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You looked beyond the dry,
parched ground of the Baca Valley,

00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you saw Jehovah’s blessing on his people.

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Governing Body gave
faithful and discreet direction

00:06:30.907 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood,
you were right here.

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You watched it personally.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So though you may have arrived here
weakened by your personal trials

00:06:41.384 --> 00:06:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after walking
through your figurative Baca Valley,

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s strength you came out stronger

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ready to appear
—to appear before Jehovah God

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be trained by his organization.

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, it was finally announced

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the school would start in August.

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
—I remember the day

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you walked into the classroom
for the first time,

00:07:12.148 --> 00:07:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you sat in your seats,

00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:16.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you opened up your student binder.

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You put your Bible on the desk,

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as you looked up, your eyes revealed,

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:27.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I made it to my journey.’

00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:30.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And class began, day after day.

00:07:30.967 --> 00:07:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is noteworthy that, in Jehovah’s strength,

00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of you
—not one of you missed a day of class.

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is to your credit.

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:42.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wanted to learn every day.

00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You took advantage of every opportunity.

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for the zeal that you showed.

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, remember the lessons from class.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you will.

00:07:56.125 --> 00:08:00.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, also, remember the lesson
from your journey

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you take on new assignments in the future.

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See past the challenges along the way;

00:08:07.403 --> 00:08:11.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see past the disappointments;
see past the tears.

00:08:11.374 --> 00:08:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn your Baca Valley into a spring,

00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:17.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become stronger for it.

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do this through prayer.

00:08:22.051 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can do this by praying to Jehovah

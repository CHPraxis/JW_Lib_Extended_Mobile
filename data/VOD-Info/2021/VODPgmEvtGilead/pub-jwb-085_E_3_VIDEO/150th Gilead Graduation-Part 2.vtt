00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have the opportunity

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy this edition that we’re
accustomed to of <i>The Inside Story</i>,

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s hosted by another instructor,

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Trent Lippold.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy it.

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The past year has been a period of change
for all of Jehovah’s people.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to show flexibility,
caution, and reasonableness.

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Gilead, for us too,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Class 150 has presented us with change.

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:03.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, all the students of Class 150

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are from or serving in the United States.

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five couples and one single brother

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all serve in the circuit work.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That represents approximately
50 percent of the class.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today we’re going to meet three couples

00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different parts of the United States

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how they learned
to cope with change in their lives

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they, like the apostle Paul,

00:01:27.403 --> 00:01:30.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked to ‘become all things to all people.’

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s meet our first guests,

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:35.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey and Taylor Bornschein,
from the state of Texas.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey and Taylor, welcome to <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:01:51.427 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re from the big state of Texas.

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where specifically are you from?

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Dallas.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dallas, Texas.
All right.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, nice to have you with us.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, to come to Gilead
(here you are in the 150th class),

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it all starts with regular pioneering.

00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you both start regular pioneering?

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:10.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, Joey, how did you start?

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me,
I feel very grateful that my foundation

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started a long time ago with my family,

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with my grandparents.

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the couple
that after they got married,

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really just wanted to serve Jehovah
the best way they could.

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would ask circuit overseers
where they could move that needed help.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they were ever asked
to go to another congregation,

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would always do it right away.

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that really affected my mom,
which in turn affected me.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that affect you?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for a while after my parents got married,

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they might have just gotten
a little distracted with marriage,

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:48.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
family, taking care of the family.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at one point,
they made a move across the country,

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they used that
as an opportunity to simplify.

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my mom was able to start
regular pioneering at that time.

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just— I remember as a child

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:03.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how different both of my parents were,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in their happiness
and in life in general

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were able
to do more for Jehovah.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How old were you when that happened,

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:15.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when your mom started pioneering
and you saw this change?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about nine.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when did you start
regular pioneering then?

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, actually, the next year

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my sister and I
both got to join her in pioneering.

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:27.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you were 10 years old?

00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:27.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:28.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is amazing!

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:29.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten years old when you started pioneering?
Great!

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:32.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Taylor?

00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:35.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you get your start
in regular pioneering?

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pioneered in Texas,
but I’m originally from Colorado.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:43.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my parents, like Joey’s,
set a really good example for me.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of my life they pioneered as a couple.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:48.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so pioneering was always just something

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—full-time service was something—
that I grew up with.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my mid-teens,

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents got appointed
to the substitute circuit work.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was fun.

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the weekends, I would travel with them
to visit congregations.

00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:02.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in public schools,
so I couldn’t go with them during the week.

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciated about them

00:04:05.028 --> 00:04:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it wasn’t just what they said,
but they set the example by what they did.

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:09.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that must have been cool.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had your parents,
and they were in the substitute circuit work.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But personally, how did that affect you?

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:18.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, so that was just some good motivation
for me to start pioneering.

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I graduated about six months early,

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:22.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a semester early,
and then started pioneering.

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then as soon as I was able to, I hit 19

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:28.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and submitted an application for Bethel,
and soon thereafter 

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was accepted and was able to spend
a few years in Brooklyn.

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, I know you left Bethel.

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two of you got married.

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:39.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re there regular pioneering in Dallas.

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:42.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made the difference for you to reach out

00:04:42.398 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and progress in Jehovah’s service?

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:47.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were pioneering as a young couple.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had goals,
but it can be hard when you’re new

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to figure marriage out
with some distractions

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:55.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with maybe even just knowing
what direction you should take.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we just feel so thankful to Jehovah

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had some
very instrumental circuit overseer couples

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came just at the right time.

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve tried to express it to them,
but I don’t think 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll ever fully understand
the impact that they’ve had on our lives.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is one of the great things
about the impact

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those in the circuit work: what they do
for young people, for young ones.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re all—
I think we’re all so grateful for that.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say then—?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that your inspiration
to get into the circuit work?

00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really.

00:05:26.776 --> 00:05:28.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We actually had different goals.

00:05:28.678 --> 00:05:31.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really wanted to go
to Bethel together as a couple,

00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we applied and applied,
and it just didn’t seem to happen.

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you ended up in the circuit work.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wonder what changed then.

00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it just grow on you, or what happened?

00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one day we opened up a piece of mail,
and it was a questionnaire

00:05:45.795 --> 00:05:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the substitute circuit work.

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while that might not
have been the direction

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we thought we would go down,

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seemed like that was the path
that Jehovah laid out in front of us.

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we happily accepted, and little by little

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it started to grow on us
—the idea of the circuit work.

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were then able to attend

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just continued
to get training and motivation

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what Jehovah wanted us to do.

00:06:09.052 --> 00:06:11.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so after our graduation,
within just a few months,

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:14.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were appointed to the circuit work,

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:16.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we love the circuit work.

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where was your first circuit, Joey?

00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we went to the suburbs of Chicago,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so it was great—from the big city of Dallas

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the big city of Chicago.

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you think of Chicago?

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was everything
that I could want in a circuit

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so two big-city people from Dallas
now going to Chicago, an even bigger city.

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:39.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love diversity of background,
culture, race, and it had everything.

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were just eating it up.

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved being in the Chicago area.

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like a “but” is coming—a change.

00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed for you both?

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:51.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after just about six months
of being in that circuit

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still falling in love
with the circuit work, we got a call 

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the branch office that we were

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now being reassigned
to a different circuit farther north

00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a more rural circuit in Wisconsin.

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Wisconsin.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did you think?
Tell us about it.

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:09.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Wisconsin like for you, Taylor?

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was very different for big-city people

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going into a rural circuit that was

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mostly dairy-farm communities.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, out of our element,
we would drive for miles and miles

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:25.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were out in service
with no stores or shops

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:28.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bathrooms or coffee shops.

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it took a little getting used to.

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably, timing now
became something you had to learn.

00:07:33.102 --> 00:07:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about for you, Joey, coming from Dallas,

00:07:35.838 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was it like for you?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, the big change was the weather
—the winters.

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have extreme winters in Dallas,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Wisconsin had very long,
very cold winters.

00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we invested in really good coats,

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wool leggings, great boots.

00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I jokingly told Taylor
that some mornings I would wake up

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:58.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel exhausted
just getting dressed in the morning.

00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Putting on so much, I guess, also affected
bathroom breaks and things like that

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:04.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—new skills you were learning in Wisconsin.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to adjust to this new change?

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So although it was a different environment,
it was just beautiful to see that, yeah, 

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was cold outside, but that didn’t affect
the friends, their hearts.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were warm in their service to Jehovah.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were so warm in the way
that they treated us.

00:08:22.985 --> 00:08:26.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just adopted us so quickly
into a different environment.

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:30.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We very, very quickly fell in love
with the friends in Wisconsin.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are amazing, aren’t they?

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:34.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Joey?

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say helped you to adjust?

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, like Taylor said,

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love from the friends;
it helped us immediately.

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also actually learned new ways
to have fun that we never had in Dallas.

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you brought a picture.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This photograph is a great picture.

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re obviously having fun there.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey, what can you tell us about it?

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is actually
a gathering that we went to

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:58.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the middle of a frozen lake,
and this is actually us ice fishing.

00:08:58.854 --> 00:08:59.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you catch anything?

00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:00.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did.

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re telling yourself,
‘You’re not in Dallas anymore.’

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:03.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great!

00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:06.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s also another photo,
and I love this one.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:08.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this, Taylor?

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a brother in the circuit
who raised beef cattle,

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:16.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I got to spend some time getting to pet
the little guy and also hand-feeding it

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so an amazing experience and not
something that I would have been able to do

00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in downtown Chicago or downtown Dallas.

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:26.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were really there,
just ‘becoming all things to all people.’

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say you learned

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the changes
you’ve gone through in your lives?

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:35.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I’m just being honest, the circuit work

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not something that I had a desire to do.

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:42.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel like it would make me
comfortable or happy.

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah at times
puts things in front of us

00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we might not think
that we would like or make us comfortable.

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m so glad that he did allow us
to have the opportunity

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be in the circuit work
because we love the circuit work.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just a nice little reminder

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:03.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will choose things for us
or put things in front of us

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe we don’t think
is going to make us happy

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:08.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is not going to make us
comfortable in how we

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel with the circumstance or environment.

00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:14.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah always chooses
what’s best for us if we just let him do it.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say, Joey?
What did you learn?

00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think for me, anytime there’s a change

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s always going to be
a little bit of anxiety,

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uncertainties, worries.

00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:27.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just really learned to just leave it
in Jehovah’s hands

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to pray to him about it—
because a lot of times those things

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never even happen; they never even come true.

00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:34.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever Jehovah asks of us,

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to get through it
because either they won’t happen

00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Jehovah will help us
and bless us through them.

00:10:41.457 --> 00:10:43.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are two great lessons
that you’ve learned.

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:46.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for sharing them with us,
and those are two lessons

00:10:46.696 --> 00:10:50.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will probably help you out
in the changes that are to come in your life.

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:53.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taylor and Joey, thank you so much
for being with us on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:10:53.703 --> 00:10:54.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:58.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our next guests
coming from the state of Michigan,

00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Whitney Frey.

00:11:13.322 --> 00:11:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Whitney, thank you for being
with us on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve come to Gilead from the circuit work,

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:22.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the circuit work also starts
with regular pioneering.

00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:26.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So maybe you can tell us: How did you,
Whitney, start regular pioneering?

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my mom taught me the truth
when I was growing up.

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I loved Jehovah,

00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:34.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by my late teens, I didn’t really know
what I wanted to do with my life.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a girlfriend who invited me

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:39.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support her at a funeral
of a young brother

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had passed away in a tragic accident.

00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s interesting.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you could make—

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the connection of starting
to pioneer and a funeral?

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can make the connection for us.

00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:49.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:52.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me, when I got to the funeral
of this young brother,

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though I didn’t know him personally,
I had seen

00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:57.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had just started regular pioneering

00:11:57.099 --> 00:11:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he had the goal of going
to Bethel when he got old enough.

00:11:59.502 --> 00:12:02.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just compared his life to mine.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was going to give everything
he had to Jehovah.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I had the circumstances
to do the same thing, but I wasn’t doing it.

00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:12.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I just thought, you know,
‘He didn’t get to finish his story.’

00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:15.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wanted to pick up where he left off.

00:12:15.084 --> 00:12:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to start pioneering.

00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:19.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when I went home,
I prayed about it and I turned in

00:12:19.722 --> 00:12:22.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my auxiliary pioneer application
with the goal

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:23.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of starting to regular in September.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s really encouraging
—something so tragic

00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:28.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet something
very positive came out of it.

00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:30.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Ben?
How did you get your start?

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:33.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, similar to Whitney,
my mother taught me the truth.

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad was not in the truth during my youth.

00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I grew up
in a rural congregation in Michigan,

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and while I respected the truth

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my late teens and early 20’s,

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:46.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I struggled spiritually.

00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reason is
because I wanted a lot out of life

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:53.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, at that point,
the truth felt very restrictive to me.

00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like it was holding me back
and not allowing me

00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the rich life that I wanted.

00:12:57.827 --> 00:13:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed in your life then?
What helped you?

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a couple of pioneer elders
move into our congregation

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were a great source
of encouragement to me.

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:10.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped me to see that serving Jehovah
is not about what you <i>can’t </i> do;

00:13:10.105 --> 00:13:12.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about all the things you <i>can </i> do.

00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the way I illustrate it is
with a board game.

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:18.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If all you did was just learn
the rules of that game

00:13:18.647 --> 00:13:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you never played it,
that wouldn’t be a lot of fun.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s really how my view
was at that time of the truth.

00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the rules, so to speak, of the truth.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I respected the truth,
but I wasn’t involved in it.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with the encouragement
of these two brothers, I really got involved.

00:13:34.597 --> 00:13:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started playing the game, so to speak,

00:13:36.866 --> 00:13:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started studying the Bible
like I should have all along.

00:13:40.302 --> 00:13:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I also started
regular pioneering shortly thereafter.

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:45.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re happy you “got in the game.”

00:13:45.774 --> 00:13:48.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there anything else, Whitney,
that helped you

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe inspired you to reach out?

00:13:51.814 --> 00:13:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, when I started wanting to pioneer,
I also got into studying more.

00:13:56.785 --> 00:14:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one thing that really affected me
was the video <i>To the Ends of the Earth.</i>

00:14:01.023 --> 00:14:04.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember watching it and,
as I watched it, thinking: ‘That’s it.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s what I want to do.

00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:08.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to go to Gilead,
and I want to be a missionary.’

00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that video is still available
on jw.org in the video library.

00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that video probably, like for you,

00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired hundreds of people to reach out

00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter missionary service
and attend Gilead.

00:14:23.746 --> 00:14:26.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of them are still out there

00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:28.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthening and stabilizing
the brotherhood.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you both then had

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goal of foreign service
—missionary service.

00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:36.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you keep pursuing that goal?

00:14:36.692 --> 00:14:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we certainly did.

00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:40.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we got married, six months later,

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we served where the need was great
in the country of Guyana in South America.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you brought along a couple of pictures.

00:14:47.236 --> 00:14:48.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can explain these.

00:14:48.737 --> 00:14:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the first one
is obviously your photo, Ben.

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us?

00:14:51.674 --> 00:14:55.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were motivated by the motorbike scene

00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>  video.

00:14:57.012 --> 00:15:00.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we got a motorbike when we were down there

00:15:00.215 --> 00:15:02.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not quite as big or as cool as the one

00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>  video,
but it served its purpose.

00:15:05.588 --> 00:15:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to travel
the territory efficiently

00:15:08.257 --> 00:15:10.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our different Bible studies
and return visits.

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the next photo
—what can you tell us about it, Whitney?

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the bike
couldn’t take us any farther,

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would park it and then we walked.

00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a lot of times,
that meant through mud across the trenches.

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we didn’t mind.
It was fun.

00:15:24.239 --> 00:15:25.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were enjoying it.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Ben is being careful on the bridge.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you had to be careful
because there were black caiman,

00:15:29.712 --> 00:15:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is a form of alligator,
that was in those trenches,

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you chose your steps carefully.

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:15:34.984 --> 00:15:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I know you came back from Guyana.

00:15:37.353 --> 00:15:38.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you continue to pursue Gilead?

00:15:38.887 --> 00:15:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did.

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:42.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we returned to the United States
after serving in Guyana,

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:45.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we applied for Gilead, and to our surprise,

00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were invited to serve as special pioneers

00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:51.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the state of West Virginia
here in the United States.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so did Gilead remain your goal, though,
even though you were there in West Virginia?

00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did.

00:15:56.238 --> 00:15:58.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continued to apply for Gilead,

00:15:58.173 --> 00:16:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then instead we were invited
to the Bible School for Christian Couples.

00:16:02.111 --> 00:16:05.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice
—so more theocratic education, though.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:05.748 --> 00:16:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from there you returned to West Virginia?

00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:10.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s correct.

00:16:10.352 --> 00:16:13.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we continued special pioneering
in West Virginia,

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also got training for circuit work.

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:18.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you end up in the circuit work?

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were invited to start circuit work

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, area

00:16:23.532 --> 00:16:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar (close by) to the Bornscheins.

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:26.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we loved it.

00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved the friends there,
and we loved that circuit.

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:29.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, change came
—didn’t it?—a big change for you.

00:16:33.676 --> 00:16:34.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one day Ben came home.

00:16:36.278 --> 00:16:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d been there about four years.

00:16:37.446 --> 00:16:38.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were loving it.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he came home and told me
that we got field missionary applications.

00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is—foreign service.

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:47.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you feel?
Ben, how did you feel?

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point in our life,
we were really enjoying

00:16:50.626 --> 00:16:53.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the circuit work and we loved the friends.

00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:57.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So admittedly at that point,
the idea of now going foreign

00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:00.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having another change
maybe lost a bit of its luster.

00:17:00.903 --> 00:17:03.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had gotten so comfortable that we had
potentially gotten too comfortable.

00:17:03.872 --> 00:17:05.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Whitney?

00:17:05.874 --> 00:17:08.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I thought, you know:
‘It had always been my goal.

00:17:08.877 --> 00:17:10.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But now, Jehovah?

00:17:10.379 --> 00:17:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now after I got into circuit work

00:17:12.481 --> 00:17:14.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and am enjoying it,
now you want me to go foreign?’

00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:17.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what helped you?

00:17:17.553 --> 00:17:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were explaining what was happening

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:21.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talking to my family
and telling them how we felt.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was talking to my sister
and my brother-in-law,

00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:28.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “You know, Whit, you feel like
you got trained for circuit work,

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe circuit work
was training you for the next assignment.”

00:17:31.433 --> 00:17:34.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just shifting my thoughts
in that way really helped me.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:17:34.837 --> 00:17:35.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s great advice.

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Ben?

00:17:36.739 --> 00:17:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there something in particular
that helped you?

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was.

00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spoke with a brother
in the Service Department at Bethel,

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said that ones in our situation
come across his desk frequently.

00:17:46.348 --> 00:17:48.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “You’re at a crossroads.

00:17:48.784 --> 00:17:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there are some
who turn down the opportunity

00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:53.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept this form of foreign service.”

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:56.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “But for those that accept it,

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who take that step of faith,

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they receive blessings that they

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could never have imagined from Jehovah.”

00:18:03.398 --> 00:18:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can rightly say
that has been completely accurate.

00:18:07.236 --> 00:18:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel exactly that way.

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it shows.

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you went off to a foreign assignment.

00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:14.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You continued in circuit work there.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say, Whitney?

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:19.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did foreign service help you?

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:20.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In so many ways.

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:24.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a couple of them are
just getting to express our faith and trust

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:28.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah in a way
that we never would have if we didn’t go.

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:30.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the greatest gifts
was the people that we met

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the local brothers and sisters,

00:18:32.928 --> 00:18:35.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fellow missionaries,
and circuit overseers.

00:18:35.264 --> 00:18:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith and self-sacrifice
taught us so much.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful.

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you’ve come to Gilead.

00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:42.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has Gilead training helped you?

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:44.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, in so many ways.

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:48.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we loved our foreign assignment,
it did have challenges.

00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:51.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember praying to Jehovah,
asking him for help

00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:53.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with certain things that I struggled with.

00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:56.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first week that we were here
in Gilead, I saw the answer

00:18:56.718 --> 00:18:59.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those prayers
—specific things that I had prayed about—

00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answered right in week one,
and it never stopped since.

00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:03.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:19:03.592 --> 00:19:06.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m sure Gilead training
will just keep helping you in the future.

00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:09.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said at the outset, Ben,
that you wanted to get a lot out of life.

00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think we would all agree:

00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve gotten a lot out of life
—both of you so far.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe in the next 30 minutes,
you’ll find out

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:19.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how much more out of life
you’re going to get.

00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both for being with us
on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our final guests.

00:19:25.347 --> 00:19:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also serving in the United States.

00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:29.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Joshua and Solaydi Rechanek.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josh and Solaydi, welcome.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:43.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nice to have you.

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re our final guests
on <i>The Inside Story </i> for today,

00:19:46.134 --> 00:19:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I should clarify that although you’re
serving in the United States,

00:19:48.904 --> 00:19:51.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are actually from Puerto Rico, correct?

00:19:51.874 --> 00:19:52.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:55.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful tropical island
in the Caribbean.

00:19:55.777 --> 00:19:58.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my mom and dad moved there

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I was born to serve,
and that’s where I was raised.

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:04.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were a tremendous example

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for entering full-time service for me,

00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:10.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when I was one,
they actually started in the circuit work.

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:13.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just that from a very young age,

00:20:13.428 --> 00:20:17.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just seemed very natural to have that
as a goal, and I’m very grateful.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Solaydi, were you also born
and raised in Puerto Rico?

00:20:22.104 --> 00:20:23.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is right.

00:20:23.405 --> 00:20:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have an older brother, Rafi,

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we both were raised by our mom,

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lydia, as a single parent.

00:20:30.779 --> 00:20:34.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She raised us in the truth,
and a little bit

00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:38.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after Joshua came to our congregation,
I started to pioneer.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also I had the privilege
to serve as a commuter

00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:44.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Puerto Rico branch,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were happy
to have him in our congregation.

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something happened.

00:20:51.099 --> 00:20:53.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, before we get to what happened,
we have a nice photograph.

00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:54.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:55.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s you with your mom, Solaydi?

00:20:55.971 --> 00:20:57.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s my mom, Lydia.

00:20:57.606 --> 00:20:59.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Josh, just to clarify this also,

00:20:59.608 --> 00:21:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did you get to Solaydi’s congregation?

00:21:02.411 --> 00:21:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after I started pioneering,
I went to what was called

00:21:05.047 --> 00:21:08.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ministerial Training School in 2003,

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:12.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after a little bit, I got assigned
to this lovely rural congregation,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I just happened to meet
a very beautiful sister.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the way you say lovely congregation.

00:21:17.993 --> 00:21:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a change came.

00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:20.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said, Solaydi, that something changed.

00:21:20.963 --> 00:21:22.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed?

00:21:22.664 --> 00:21:26.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I had gotten some training
as a substitute circuit overseer,

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:30.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there was
a need for a circuit overseer.

00:21:30.906 --> 00:21:34.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t in Puerto Rico;
it was in a Spanish circuit in Ohio.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I prayed about it,

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:39.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and off I went from Puerto Rico to Ohio.

00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that like, Josh?
Tell us about it.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you feel when you got there?

00:21:43.919 --> 00:21:45.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was— It was very different.

00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember dropping my dad off at the airport
(because he helped me move up),

00:21:49.358 --> 00:21:51.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then when I was driving away, I said,

00:21:51.493 --> 00:21:56.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know nobody and nothing
even nearby after that plane takes off.”

00:21:56.231 --> 00:22:00.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because not only was the place different
but also everything was different.

00:22:00.502 --> 00:22:02.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very interesting
because the congregations

00:22:02.637 --> 00:22:06.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the U.S. in Spanish
tend to be very mixed culturally.

00:22:06.508 --> 00:22:09.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I got to be with brothers
from many different cultures

00:22:09.344 --> 00:22:11.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I hadn’t experienced before.

00:22:11.813 --> 00:22:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even had to learn to speak Spanish
in a way that everybody would understand

00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:17.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of just the brothers
from Puerto Rico.

00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a huge change for you

00:22:19.354 --> 00:22:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a change of culture coming
to the United States and then,

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you say, all these other cultures.

00:22:23.725 --> 00:22:25.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brought along
a really nice picture, Josh.

00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:27.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this?

00:22:27.462 --> 00:22:30.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned this day a very important skill,

00:22:30.198 --> 00:22:33.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is to check the weather report
before you leave home to preach.

00:22:33.702 --> 00:22:34.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:22:34.703 --> 00:22:36.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you not check the weather in Puerto Rico?

00:22:36.204 --> 00:22:37.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nope.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:39.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s either going to be sunny,
or it’s going to rain.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two choices.

00:22:40.308 --> 00:22:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:22:41.109 --> 00:22:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Solaydi?

00:22:42.344 --> 00:22:46.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Josh has come to the United States.

00:22:46.114 --> 00:22:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that affect you?

00:22:48.216 --> 00:22:50.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I was happy for the assignment.

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:54.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege,
so I wanted to support him.

00:22:54.056 --> 00:22:55.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we kept in touch.

00:22:55.757 --> 00:22:58.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2010, we got married.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that, we received an invitation

00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue as a couple in Ohio.

00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:06.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a big change for you then.

00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, just like Josh,
you came to a new country, in a sense,

00:23:10.539 --> 00:23:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new marriage,
and a new assignment in circuit work.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were some of the hard moments for you?

00:23:16.711 --> 00:23:18.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, Josh, you could share first.

00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as I said,
there was a lot of adaptation.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you start a new assignment,
I don’t think you ever really feel

00:23:25.554 --> 00:23:28.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualified for it or prepared for it.

00:23:28.723 --> 00:23:31.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were very young
when we started the circuit work,

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:35.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visiting congregations where sometimes
there were brothers that had been serving

00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:37.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as regular pioneers
longer than we’d been alive.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then all of a sudden,
we’d have the responsibility

00:23:40.202 --> 00:23:42.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage them and help them.

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that could be a bit intimidating.

00:23:44.973 --> 00:23:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:23:45.707 --> 00:23:47.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you brought along another photo.

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the confusion of the adaptation.

00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this, Josh?

00:23:52.147 --> 00:23:55.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a field service day

00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:57.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly after getting married.

00:23:57.486 --> 00:24:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t that I was distracted
or anything, but we rushed out the door,

00:24:01.123 --> 00:24:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to field service, took the group out,
and made all the arrangements.

00:24:04.426 --> 00:24:08.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a dear brother,
a very good friend, came up to me,

00:24:08.563 --> 00:24:11.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put his arm around my shoulder,
and he took me over to Solaydi.

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:14.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “I’m not going to say anything.

00:24:14.035 --> 00:24:14.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just going to look.”

00:24:14.936 --> 00:24:16.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he looked down at my shoes,

00:24:16.838 --> 00:24:18.740 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and, well, it just turned out that I had

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.941 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
put two different shoes on.

00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:22.043 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he was kind enough

00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:23.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to point that out before I went out in service.

00:24:23.612 --> 00:24:26.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t point it out
before he took the picture.

00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:27.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:24:27.315 --> 00:24:29.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solaydi, what were you thinking?

00:24:29.184 --> 00:24:31.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was like: “Baby, what happened?

00:24:31.586 --> 00:24:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do?”

00:24:34.156 --> 00:24:36.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you always check his shoes
before he goes out then.

00:24:36.391 --> 00:24:38.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I try to check him before leaving home.

00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe in all seriousness, Josh,

00:24:42.164 --> 00:24:46.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you say were the keys
that helped you?

00:24:46.201 --> 00:24:48.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got some really good advice

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from brothers with more experience,
including my father.

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:54.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are really two keys we found.

00:24:54.342 --> 00:24:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is to love the brothers,
because that’s really what they need.

00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:01.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need love and affection and your time.

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:04.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the other is to be humble,

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:07.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the brothers greatly appreciate
the arrangement of the circuit overseer,

00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:09.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whoever the circuit overseer is.

00:25:09.958 --> 00:25:13.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as long as you remain humble,
Jehovah can use you

00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage the friends
and then all glory goes to him.

00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very nice to love humility,

00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:21.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really what helps us
to “become all things to [all] people.”

00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:23.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about for you, Solaydi?

00:25:23.004 --> 00:25:25.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were challenges for you?

00:25:25.874 --> 00:25:29.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for me it was the emotional part.

00:25:29.344 --> 00:25:32.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it is true:
It is a beautiful privilege

00:25:32.914 --> 00:25:36.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to know 
so many brothers and sisters

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:41.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make bonds with them,
but at the same time, you face reality.

00:25:41.256 --> 00:25:43.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see all the struggles
that they are going through.

00:25:43.858 --> 00:25:47.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some are dealing with health problems

00:25:47.329 --> 00:25:49.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or economic problems

00:25:49.397 --> 00:25:51.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even their status in the country.

00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:53.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was not able to help them

00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:56.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way that I wanted, so I felt helpless.

00:25:56.504 --> 00:25:59.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what could you do for them?

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had to leave that part

00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:06.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s hands and give them my time.

00:26:06.514 --> 00:26:08.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I try to go

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with them in service, try to encourage them.

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:15.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I try to show them my love

00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:20.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and even more important
that Jehovah loves them.

00:26:20.195 --> 00:26:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:26:21.429 --> 00:26:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure you left a little bit
of your heart with all of them.

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very nice.

00:26:26.101 --> 00:26:27.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’re here in Gilead.

00:26:27.335 --> 00:26:28.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that a surprise for you?

00:26:28.937 --> 00:26:31.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, a big surprise.

00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:34.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Josh, I know Gilead actually has
a special place in your heart.

00:26:34.743 --> 00:26:35.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:36.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does.

00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:39.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because my parents attended Gilead,

00:26:39.047 --> 00:26:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s actually what brought them
to Puerto Rico.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They attended the 52nd class.

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:45.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.
Good.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having parents who went to Gilead,
did they

00:26:48.723 --> 00:26:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep Gilead in their heart even after they
had a family and were raising you?

00:26:52.127 --> 00:26:53.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did.
Absolutely.

00:26:53.561 --> 00:26:56.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember they had their graduation photo

00:26:56.798 --> 00:27:00.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up in the hallway, where all of us
would walk every day.

00:27:00.802 --> 00:27:03.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every day of my life growing up
I walked past that photo.

00:27:03.672 --> 00:27:05.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is, the 52nd class.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s them.

00:27:06.408 --> 00:27:09.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also the way they were,

00:27:09.144 --> 00:27:13.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way they served Jehovah,
the love and zeal that they have:

00:27:13.648 --> 00:27:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear to me—even clearer now—

00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:19.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Gilead had a big impact on them.

00:27:19.654 --> 00:27:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say that impact was on them?

00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:24.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you see Gilead training in them?

00:27:24.492 --> 00:27:25.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of two things.

00:27:25.827 --> 00:27:30.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that they’re excellent students
of the Bible and always have been.

00:27:30.198 --> 00:27:33.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom’s Bible has so many notes
that I don’t think it can hold any more.

00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:38.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my dad, I remember he would be reading
the Bible with us at night,

00:27:38.473 --> 00:27:42.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had an envelope that he’d mark
the family Bible with.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of a sudden he’d stop reading
and stop to make a note on the envelope

00:27:45.513 --> 00:27:48.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he came across a scripture
that he wanted to use for a talk

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a shepherding call
or just a point that he liked.

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:53.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was an excellent example.

00:27:53.621 --> 00:27:57.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also they’ve always worked
very, very hard for Kingdom interests.

00:27:57.258 --> 00:28:01.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve always had the goal to do as much
as they can for as long as they can,

00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:03.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that just kind of became
the family motto.

00:28:03.698 --> 00:28:06.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s interesting now going through Gilead

00:28:06.634 --> 00:28:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing so much emphasis
placed on exactly those things

00:28:10.271 --> 00:28:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to feed your love for Jehovah and do
as much as you can for the organization.

00:28:13.742 --> 00:28:16.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I was going to ask you that as well.

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:19.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you are sitting in class,
and you’re hearing

00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:22.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a great degree
the same things your parents heard.

00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:24.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has that helped you at all?

00:28:24.686 --> 00:28:25.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has.

00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:29.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have had those qualities
to an extent when they came to Gilead.

00:28:29.858 --> 00:28:32.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think, listening to the classes now,

00:28:32.427 --> 00:28:36.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear that Gilead
stirred that up in them

00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept that flame burning
for many, many years.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:28:39.701 --> 00:28:41.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they must be very proud of both of you

00:28:41.903 --> 00:28:45.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you apply yourselves
and as you will apply the training

00:28:45.273 --> 00:28:48.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look forward to applying it
in your future assignments.

00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:50.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both very much
for being with us today.

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:51.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:28:51.546 --> 00:28:54.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction, we quoted Paul’s words

00:28:54.849 --> 00:28:57.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 9:22.

00:28:57.318 --> 00:29:01.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:05.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I might
by all possible means save some.”

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:09.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle obligated himself
to adjust his life

00:29:09.431 --> 00:29:13.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal tastes
“for the sake of the good news.”

00:29:13.435 --> 00:29:16.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope today’s program
has been encouraging to you,

00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:20.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s trying something
you just don’t prefer

00:29:20.074 --> 00:29:23.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something you didn’t think
you could do in Jehovah’s service.

00:29:23.645 --> 00:29:26.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s just getting in the game,
so to speak,

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:30.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or giving someone a little piece
of your heart to encourage them.

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:33.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s guests have shown us

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:36.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by adjusting our life

00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal tastes for the sake
of the good news,

00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah, we can cope with any change

00:29:42.897 --> 00:29:46.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or make any change for Jehovah’s service.

00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:49.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing you

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:52.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on another edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:21.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very encouraging and nice

00:30:21.336 --> 00:30:24.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see a picture of that 52nd class

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:27.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I mentioned in the introduction.

00:30:27.976 --> 00:30:30.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josh wasn’t there.

00:30:32.881 --> 00:30:37.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were rewarded
with him later, there in Puerto Rico.

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:40.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was so encouraging.

00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:43.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:46.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thank Trent
and all of those participants.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:48.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now,

00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:51.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look forward to another member
of the Governing Body.

00:30:51.499 --> 00:30:55.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoff Jackson
is going to speak on the subject

00:30:55.703 --> 00:30:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and this is for you students, particularly)

00:30:58.706 --> 00:31:01.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Share What You Have Learned!”

00:31:04.312 --> 00:31:09.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The graduation of the 150th class of Gilead:

00:31:09.317 --> 00:31:11.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would have thought that we would have

00:31:11.553 --> 00:31:15.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
150 classes of Gilead?

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And probably, for you students,
you were wondering if you would survive 

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the 150th graduation.

00:31:22.397 --> 00:31:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:31:24.399 --> 00:31:28.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
graduations of Gilead
have taken various forms.

00:31:28.603 --> 00:31:30.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at this photograph,

00:31:30.772 --> 00:31:34.142 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice that for the 7th class,

00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:37.111 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the graduation was in 1946.

00:31:37.111 --> 00:31:38.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And what do you notice?

00:31:38.913 --> 00:31:41.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The guests who came along were

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.119 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the open air, hoping for good weather.

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:47.355 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I’m told there was no—

00:31:47.355 --> 00:31:49.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t a ticketed event.

00:31:49.357 --> 00:31:51.192 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So just those that wanted to come along

00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:52.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
came along.

00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:54.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then notice in the next one here

00:31:54.128 --> 00:31:55.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve got the president

00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:57.999 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
giving one of the talks

00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.602 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the stairs leading up to Gilead.

00:32:00.602 --> 00:32:02.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, things have changed.

00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:06.507 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1953, the 21st class

00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:10.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
graduated at Yankee Stadium,

00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:13.181 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and you’d imagine that was a huge event.

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.183 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, it commemorated

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:17.352 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the tenth anniversary of Gilead

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:19.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and was very appropriate because that was

00:32:19.654 --> 00:32:22.590 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a very special year, 1953.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.159 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That was the year that the U.S. government

00:32:25.159 --> 00:32:27.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
granted us legal status

00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:29.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that we could have foreign students

00:32:29.163 --> 00:32:31.232 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
come and join the school.

00:32:31.232 --> 00:32:32.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course,

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:34.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no matter what graduation we’ve had,

00:32:34.402 --> 00:32:36.771 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there’s always the joyous look

00:32:36.771 --> 00:32:38.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the faces of those graduating.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.642 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s the common denominator.

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:45.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, in recent years, we’ve had some
very different graduations as well

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—haven’t we?—with no live audience.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But aren’t you happy
that we’ve got a live audience today?

00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:00.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after the last few months,

00:33:00.728 --> 00:33:04.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve been through so many lessons

00:33:04.332 --> 00:33:07.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and written exams and so on.

00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:09.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been a lot of training.

00:33:09.203 --> 00:33:12.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what has been the purpose of all of that?

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we think
of worldly institutions and education,

00:33:16.878 --> 00:33:20.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually it’s all
about the students, isn’t it?

00:33:20.515 --> 00:33:24.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all about the dreams,
as Brother Morris mentioned.

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:27.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all about their ambitions

00:33:27.422 --> 00:33:30.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their success
that they’re looking forward to.

00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Gilead?

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ve learned very clearly,
I’m sure, that it’s not about you.

00:33:37.665 --> 00:33:42.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you haven’t, maybe we need
to enroll you in the next class as well.

00:33:42.303 --> 00:33:46.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, as dedicated servants of Jehovah,

00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:49.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that nothing is about us.

00:33:49.177 --> 00:33:51.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:33:51.012 --> 00:33:53.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about what we can accomplish

00:33:53.448 --> 00:33:56.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in praising our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:33:56.718 --> 00:34:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now you’re at this point
where you’re about to graduate.

00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:08.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time for you
to share what you’ve learned with others.

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:10.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that involve?

00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:13.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean
you’re going to go to different assignments

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:17.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start up little Gilead classes
(you know, informally)

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:20.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the back rooms of Kingdom Halls?

00:34:20.274 --> 00:34:22.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t advise that.

00:34:24.212 --> 00:34:28.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does it mean to share
what you’ve learned with others?

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as has already
been highlighted in this program,

00:34:33.187 --> 00:34:37.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your example
—working hard—is going to help others

00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:42.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see in action what you learned at Gilead.

00:34:42.296 --> 00:34:45.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also we see a very interesting scripture

00:34:45.299 --> 00:34:47.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the second book of Timothy,

00:34:47.301 --> 00:34:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so please turn with me to 2 Timothy chapter 2

00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 2.

00:34:52.907 --> 00:34:55.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:59.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he captures the thought
of what else we need to do.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:01.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 2, it says:

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:05.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The things you heard from me
that were supported by many witnesses,

00:35:05.553 --> 00:35:10.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“these things entrust
to faithful men, who, in turn,

00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:14.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be adequately qualified
to teach others.”

00:35:15.196 --> 00:35:18.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we see from this particular verse?

00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:22.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, you will teach
by your example by doing the hard work,

00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:26.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also you need
to take an interest in others

00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:29.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, perhaps in a more informal setting,

00:35:29.277 --> 00:35:33.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help them to see the principles
and the lessons that you’ve learned

00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:35.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your Gilead training.

00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s a very important thing.

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:42.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can take the example
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:44.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jesus’ main focus

00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:47.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the preaching
of the good news of the Kingdom, wasn’t it?

00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:50.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all he did.

00:35:50.164 --> 00:35:53.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we turn to Mark chapter 9,

00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:56.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice in Jesus’ busy schedule

00:35:56.771 --> 00:35:59.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he made time for.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Mark 9:30, 31:

00:36:04.812 --> 00:36:08.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They departed from there
and went through Galilee,

00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:11.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did not want anyone
to get to know about it.”

00:36:11.953 --> 00:36:15.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a time
when he wanted some peace and quiet.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:19.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 31 says

00:36:19.126 --> 00:36:23.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he was teaching his disciples.”

00:36:23.397 --> 00:36:28.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus took time
from his busy schedule to show interest

00:36:28.135 --> 00:36:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in those who he was training to help them
to be prepared for the future.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a wonderful example for us.

00:36:36.477 --> 00:36:39.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look through the Scriptures,
we see many examples,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for the next few minutes,
we’re going to think about Barnabas

00:36:44.318 --> 00:36:46.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Barnabas

00:36:46.354 --> 00:36:50.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was able to share what he learned with Paul.

00:36:50.424 --> 00:36:52.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we think about what happened

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that interaction
between Barnabas and Paul,

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to learn five lessons

00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—five lessons that teach us

00:37:01.235 --> 00:37:06.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to handle training others
and passing on what we’ve learned.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first lesson: If you turn with me,
please, to the book of Acts

00:37:10.811 --> 00:37:13.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts chapter 9—

00:37:13.247 --> 00:37:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this takes us to around the year 36 C.E.

00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:21.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Saul has already become a Christian.

00:37:21.389 --> 00:37:24.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after a while, he arrives in Jerusalem.

00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happens?

00:37:26.093 --> 00:37:28.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 26 of chapter 9, it says:

00:37:28.763 --> 00:37:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On arriving in Jerusalem, he [that’s Paul]

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:35.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“made efforts to join the disciples,

00:37:35.102 --> 00:37:39.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they were
all afraid of him [I wonder why],

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they did not believe
he was a disciple.”

00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were thinking,
‘This is going to be a very dangerous thing.’

00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:50.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what happened in verse 27?

00:37:50.084 --> 00:37:53.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Barnabas came to his aid

00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:55.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and led him to the apostles.”

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:59.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see, as pictured here,

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:06.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and believed that, really,

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be useful
in Jehovah’s service.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:12.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he risked his reputation, you might say,

00:38:12.139 --> 00:38:14.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by supporting, or sponsoring,

00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:17.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul and taking him to the apostles.

00:38:18.813 --> 00:38:21.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson
that we learn from this?

00:38:22.283 --> 00:38:26.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:38:26.854 --> 00:38:29.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And don’t worry about if you

00:38:29.323 --> 00:38:30.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
perhaps encourage them

00:38:30.658 --> 00:38:32.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and if you give them support

00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:34.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—you sponsor them, you might say—

00:38:34.028 --> 00:38:36.030 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then they don’t really turn out well

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and that now all of a sudden your reputation

00:38:38.165 --> 00:38:39.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to be tarnished.

00:38:39.934 --> 00:38:42.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s not all about you.

00:38:42.436 --> 00:38:44.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s what is good for the work.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:46.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first lesson.

00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:50.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:54.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we turn across to Acts chapter 11,

00:38:54.148 --> 00:38:57.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is about nine years later,

00:38:57.218 --> 00:39:00.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the year 45 C.E.

00:39:00.154 --> 00:39:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in chapter 11 of Acts,

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work is going ahead in the Gentile field

00:39:06.627 --> 00:39:09.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and particularly in the city of Antioch.

00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:13.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas was assigned by the brothers

00:39:13.901 --> 00:39:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help the congregation in Antioch.

00:39:18.005 --> 00:39:21.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look down in verses 25 and 26,

00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:24.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as soon as Barnabas arrived there,

00:39:24.145 --> 00:39:27.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he realized he needed help.

00:39:27.681 --> 00:39:29.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did he do?

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 25, it says:

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:34.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He [that’s Barnabas]

00:39:34.321 --> 00:39:38.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to Tarsus
to make a thorough search for Saul.”

00:39:39.927 --> 00:39:42.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he went to find Saul.

00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembered that this was a man

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could speak Greek and was well-educated.

00:39:48.402 --> 00:39:51.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d be able to help him
with the Gentile field.

00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that when you
look at a map, you’ll notice

00:39:55.509 --> 00:39:58.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s about 120 miles

00:39:58.512 --> 00:40:03.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Antioch to Tarsus,
or about 200 kilometers.

00:40:03.517 --> 00:40:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions here in verse 25
that he made “a thorough search for Saul.”

00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:40:08.422 --> 00:40:13.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we compare 1 Corinthians,
where Paul lists all the things he did,

00:40:13.027 --> 00:40:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of those, it appears,
happened in those nine years.

00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:21.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was shipwrecked several times,
put into prison, and so on.

00:40:21.535 --> 00:40:23.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was very busy.

00:40:23.604 --> 00:40:27.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barnabas sought him out,
and then what did he have to do?

00:40:27.174 --> 00:40:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 26, it says:
“After he found him,

00:40:30.778 --> 00:40:32.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he brought him to Antioch.”

00:40:32.847 --> 00:40:34.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did he have to do?

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:37.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to convince Saul.

00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:39.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine
that may have been a little difficult

00:40:39.553 --> 00:40:42.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Saul was having
a productive ministry.

00:40:42.523 --> 00:40:44.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he brought him to Antioch.

00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:46.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 26 says:

00:40:46.827 --> 00:40:50.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a whole year they assembled
with him in the congregation

00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:53.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taught quite a crowd.”

00:40:53.267 --> 00:40:58.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas didn’t take Paul and say,
“Now I’m going to teach you.”

00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just had him work along with him.

00:41:00.741 --> 00:41:05.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as they worked together,
that would have given Saul some training.

00:41:05.746 --> 00:41:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson

00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:09.416 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we learn?

00:41:09.416 --> 00:41:11.418 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Be willing to make the effort.

00:41:11.418 --> 00:41:13.420 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You see, Barnabas not only

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.156 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
saw the potential

00:41:15.156 --> 00:41:18.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but was willing to go and find Saul

00:41:18.058 --> 00:41:19.560 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then convince him to come

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and work with him,

00:41:20.861 --> 00:41:22.296 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then they worked together.

00:41:22.296 --> 00:41:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the second lesson.

00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:28.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third lesson is in Acts 13.

00:41:28.536 --> 00:41:33.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after Barnabas and Saul
were in Antioch for some time,

00:41:33.541 --> 00:41:36.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened in verse 2?

00:41:36.377 --> 00:41:39.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “As they were ministering
to Jehovah and fasting,

00:41:39.947 --> 00:41:42.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the holy spirit said:

00:41:42.216 --> 00:41:45.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul

00:41:45.653 --> 00:41:48.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the work to which I have called them.’”

00:41:48.822 --> 00:41:53.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, this is a time when they’re
going out in the missionary field,

00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:58.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice that the holy spirit
mentions “Barnabas and Saul.”

00:41:58.799 --> 00:42:02.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this illustration,
we see who is taking the lead—Barnabas.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul is following along.

00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:09.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we look down further
in verse 13 of the same chapter,

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see there’s a little change.

00:42:12.046 --> 00:42:16.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul starts to use a name
that is more common in that area—Paul.

00:42:16.417 --> 00:42:18.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it say now?

00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:21.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul and his companions put out to sea.”

00:42:21.689 --> 00:42:26.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from here on,
it seems that Paul took the lead.

00:42:26.694 --> 00:42:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s just imagine
for a little bit that you were Barnabas.

00:42:30.898 --> 00:42:35.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, maybe we could imagine
ourselves saying quietly to Saul, or Paul,

00:42:35.669 --> 00:42:38.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whatever he was calling
himself at that time:

00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:40.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can I just have a few words with you?

00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:44.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not a big issue, but do you remember

00:42:44.378 --> 00:42:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when holy spirit said we were going out?

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was ‘Barnabas and Saul.’

00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:53.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, now, I don’t have
a big problem with this.

00:42:53.387 --> 00:42:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But, you know, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

00:42:56.757 --> 00:43:00.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, I was the one designated
to take the lead here.”

00:43:00.694 --> 00:43:02.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he didn’t say that, did he?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:07.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Bearing Witness </i> book
mentions that he wasn’t envious at all.

00:43:07.635 --> 00:43:09.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:43:10.537 --> 00:43:14.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we’re working along
with someone and training them,

00:43:14.441 --> 00:43:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lesson is:

00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:20.981 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be envious if they start to excel.

00:43:20.981 --> 00:43:23.117 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And actually, what we’re helping them

00:43:23.117 --> 00:43:24.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do is to blossom.

00:43:24.785 --> 00:43:26.720 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And they will get some of the privileges

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps we would have liked

00:43:28.122 --> 00:43:29.857 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
along the way.

00:43:29.857 --> 00:43:33.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we won’t be saying,
“Well, uhm, excuse me, uhm,

00:43:33.294 --> 00:43:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m the one who went through Gilead.”

00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:39.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we won’t be envious.

00:43:39.066 --> 00:43:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fourth lesson takes us
to the book of Galatians.

00:43:43.137 --> 00:43:47.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you turn with me
to Galatians chapter 2,

00:43:47.474 --> 00:43:51.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is around the year 49 C.E.

00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:55.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already, Peter and Paul and Barnabas

00:43:55.816 --> 00:43:58.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Titus had all been to Jerusalem,

00:43:58.319 --> 00:44:03.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’d had the big discussion
with the governing body about circumcision.

00:44:03.257 --> 00:44:06.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, when they
arrived in Jerusalem,

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:09.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the account says that Barnabas
and Paul were there.

00:44:09.363 --> 00:44:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:44:10.698 --> 00:44:14.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe Barnabas took note of that,
that he was mentioned first again,

00:44:14.768 --> 00:44:18.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably because the governing body
remembered that was actually

00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:20.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the role originally.

00:44:20.407 --> 00:44:24.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we find
that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas

00:44:24.478 --> 00:44:27.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some others were back in Antioch.

00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:31.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened just a few months
after that special meeting?

00:44:31.285 --> 00:44:36.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul had to tell Peter
that he was doing something wrong.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, please, what verse 13 says:

00:44:40.828 --> 00:44:44.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The rest of the Jews also joined him
in putting on this pretense,

00:44:44.932 --> 00:44:49.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that even Barnabas was led along
with them in their pretense.”

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:51.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I just love this picture.

00:44:51.338 --> 00:44:54.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Paul telling Peter he’s wrong,

00:44:54.708 --> 00:44:59.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have a look at Barnabas’ face.

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:01.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looks guilty.

00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:03.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awkward!

00:45:05.052 --> 00:45:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see?

00:45:06.086 --> 00:45:08.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was caught in the crossfire.

00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:13.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likewise was getting counsel
because he was involved with this.

00:45:13.227 --> 00:45:15.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what lesson

00:45:15.396 --> 00:45:17.030 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
do we gain from this?

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.032 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Accept counsel

00:45:19.032 --> 00:45:21.101 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
even from those whom we are viewing

00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:23.270 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as the ones whom we’re training.

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:24.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t feel that we’re 

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:27.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
above accepting counsel.

00:45:28.108 --> 00:45:32.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the final lesson is the one
probably you thought about immediately

00:45:32.479 --> 00:45:34.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we mentioned Paul and Barnabas.

00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:36.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know what you were thinking—Acts 15.

00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s turn there

00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:43.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts 15:37-39.

00:45:45.692 --> 00:45:49.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is after the incident in Antioch.

00:45:49.296 --> 00:45:53.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says: “Barnabas was determined
to take along John,

00:45:53.767 --> 00:45:55.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who was called Mark.

00:45:55.969 --> 00:46:00.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

00:46:00.207 --> 00:46:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:13.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they separated from each other.”

00:46:13.587 --> 00:46:16.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is the instance
that we usually remember

00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:19.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we think of Paul and Barnabas.

00:46:19.726 --> 00:46:21.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What led to this problem?

00:46:21.762 --> 00:46:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought about that?

00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:26.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions that Paul was very hesitant

00:46:26.733 --> 00:46:29.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about taking John Mark along with them.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:33.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps he remembered
on that first missionary tour

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when John Mark had gone back,

00:46:35.476 --> 00:46:38.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and Barnabas continued on into Galatia.

00:46:38.879 --> 00:46:41.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And reading what Paul said to the Galatians,

00:46:41.482 --> 00:46:45.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems obvious that Paul
had problems with his eyes

00:46:45.486 --> 00:46:48.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was very sick at that point.

00:46:48.188 --> 00:46:52.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, no doubt, you know,
he missed having a young man available

00:46:52.593 --> 00:46:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry the luggage and to do
all the things that needed to be done.

00:46:56.797 --> 00:47:01.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas could understand
why Paul was hesitant.

00:47:01.802 --> 00:47:04.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t want to lose the help again.

00:47:04.671 --> 00:47:06.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, on the other hand,
what about Barnabas?

00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think he was
so determined to take John Mark?

00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:14.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could be the fact
that he was a relative

00:47:14.515 --> 00:47:17.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(that sometimes comes into a factor),

00:47:17.451 --> 00:47:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it could be the fact

00:47:20.187 --> 00:47:23.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:26.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the same thing he saw in John Mark.

00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:28.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is a good young man.

00:47:28.195 --> 00:47:30.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to give him a chance.”

00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:34.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that he was
still stinging a little bit

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:38.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the rebuke in Antioch?

00:47:38.005 --> 00:47:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that he was still viewing

00:47:42.576 --> 00:47:45.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul, or Paul, as a student,

00:47:45.379 --> 00:47:48.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone newer in the truth
than him and someone from whom

00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:52.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he just found it hard to accept his opinion?

00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:56.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re not going to play
the “blame game.”

00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:59.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us will be working
with these brothers later.

00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:11.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I feel safe in saying this:

00:48:11.104 --> 00:48:14.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that Paul and Barnabas

00:48:14.007 --> 00:48:16.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they think back to that day

00:48:16.543 --> 00:48:18.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would agree that they
could have done things better.

00:48:18.712 --> 00:48:20.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that a safe comment?

00:48:20.714 --> 00:48:25.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of us have times
when we felt maybe we were right,

00:48:25.085 --> 00:48:27.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we could have handled it better.

00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:29.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to respect different opinions;

00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:34.895 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
don’t overreact.

00:48:34.895 --> 00:48:36.597 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get upset.

00:48:36.597 --> 00:48:38.198 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to work through things

00:48:38.198 --> 00:48:39.900 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that it doesn’t affect

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.935 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our working relationship.

00:48:42.636 --> 00:48:46.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we’ve thought
about Barnabas and Paul,

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really gives us
a lot of food for thought, doesn’t it?

00:48:49.209 --> 00:48:51.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember those five lessons?

00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:54.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:48:54.715 --> 00:48:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then be willing to put forward
the effort that’s required to train them.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be envious if they get privileges.

00:49:03.156 --> 00:49:05.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept counsel if they offer you counsel,

00:49:05.792 --> 00:49:08.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect their opinions as well.

00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:13.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you’ll try
to implement those suggestions.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as you go to your assignments,

00:49:16.937 --> 00:49:20.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may Jehovah be with you and bless you.

00:49:20.073 --> 00:49:24.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you try to help others
by sharing what you’ve learned at Gilead.

00:49:24.645 --> 00:49:29.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that way, you will fulfill
the purpose of Gilead

00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to stabilize and strengthen others.

00:49:42.062 --> 00:49:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you heard him nice and clear.

00:49:45.232 --> 00:49:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Share What You Have Learned”

00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful lessons to keep in mind.

00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:56.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the students
have certainly looked forward

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this point for over five months.

00:50:01.515 --> 00:50:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’re going to transition
into Gilead graduates,

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so this is what this is.

00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Ken Flodin,

00:50:10.624 --> 00:50:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

by introducing the graduates

and then letting us know
where they’re assigned.

00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:22.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Well, that went quick!

00:54:22.943 --> 00:54:25.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very good

—well, very special.

00:54:28.348 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:36.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just want to share
some concluding comments,

00:54:36.556 --> 00:54:41.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I think you are supposed to raise
that curtain, aren’t you?

Oh, you know what?

Yeah, I want to see Ryan.

Oh, yeah.

00:54:47.233 --> 00:54:51.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Ryan is going to read a letter

00:54:53.273 --> 00:54:55.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:58:57.417 --> 00:59:00.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just some concluding comments for you,

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some things to pass on that, of course,

00:59:03.723 --> 00:59:05.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us listening can benefit from.

00:59:05.725 --> 00:59:10.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We mentioned we’d talk about the SKE

00:59:10.163 --> 00:59:12.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(School for Kingdom Evangelizers),

00:59:12.865 --> 00:59:15.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, see, everything changed with Gilead.

00:59:15.201 --> 00:59:18.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll give you some statistics shortly.

00:59:18.738 --> 00:59:22.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:59:22.508 --> 00:59:25.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has just been so blessed by Jehovah.

00:59:25.712 --> 00:59:30.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only two months,
but they are just strengthening

00:59:30.717 --> 00:59:33.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers and sisters in the field.

00:59:33.052 --> 00:59:36.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them end up
in the circuit work or as missionaries.

00:59:36.022 --> 00:59:38.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So He’s blessing that.

00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:43.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is another blessing is that
as we deal with this side of Armageddon

00:59:43.296 --> 00:59:45.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(all these different languages),

00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t have to learn English,
which was always a struggle.

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:54.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the fault of language

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but certainly not
of those sincere individuals

00:59:57.176 --> 00:59:59.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanting to come to Gilead.

00:59:59.979 --> 01:00:02.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they’ve done wonderfully.

01:00:02.115 --> 01:00:03.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has blessed the school.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ve had these five months,

01:00:06.753 --> 01:00:11.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these are some statistics
that reveal how Jehovah has blessed

01:00:11.758 --> 01:00:15.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body’s decision years ago.

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:17.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because, you know, Gilead has changed.

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:20.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see some of the history
and appreciate it very much

01:00:20.266 --> 01:00:24.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Brother Jackson’s review
of some of these pictures.

01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:27.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was a missionary school, obviously,

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it did tremendous work
after World War II.

01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:33.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may remember

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:35.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(these are statistics

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:39.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with class 132, October 2011)

01:00:39.952 --> 01:00:43.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the focus of the school changed.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:47.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, now He brought in
special full-time servants.

01:00:47.694 --> 01:00:49.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there was a time
that you could go to Gilead

01:00:49.696 --> 01:00:53.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you were a regular pioneer
and you had good recommendations.

01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:57.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these were all
special full-time servants.

01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the thinking behind the decision?

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:04.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was to stabilize and strengthen

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the field and branch organization

01:01:09.048 --> 01:01:12.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the brothers there in the branches

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they serve in to be sure to adhere

01:01:15.855 --> 01:01:18.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Scriptural and theocratic direction.

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:21.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the school has really been blessed

01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:26.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the decision that Jehovah
helped the Governing Body to make.

01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:28.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s his organization

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:31.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this earthly part,
and it’s just been amazing

01:01:31.404 --> 01:01:34.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what has happened to show the results:

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:38.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wisdom is proved righteous
by its works [or results].”

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here are some statistics:

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:44.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are 675 Branch

01:01:44.016 --> 01:01:47.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 17 Country Committee
members worldwide.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:51.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s 692.

01:01:51.023 --> 01:01:54.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of these 692 members,

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
355 are Gilead graduates.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:04.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re talking about 51.3 percent already

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since we started that.

01:02:07.039 --> 01:02:10.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of the 355 graduates,

01:02:10.443 --> 01:02:13.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
221 of them (which is 62 percent)

01:02:13.713 --> 01:02:17.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are from classes 132 to 149.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:20.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is in these last ten years.

01:02:20.586 --> 01:02:23.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So these 221 brothers

01:02:23.856 --> 01:02:26.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represent 46.2 percent

01:02:26.659 --> 01:02:30.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 478 total brothers
who are graduates

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:33.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of classes 132-149.

01:02:34.634 --> 01:02:39.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happens, too,
is that now we have some of you here

01:02:39.305 --> 01:02:42.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are already going to be
on Branch Committees.

01:02:42.308 --> 01:02:44.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That happened in past classes too,

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of them
who went to their assignments

01:02:47.613 --> 01:02:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weren’t on their committees right away.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not too long after (some years),

01:02:52.752 --> 01:02:54.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re on the committees.

01:02:54.754 --> 01:02:58.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Gilead made a big difference for them,

01:02:58.624 --> 01:03:01.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s helping the organization.

01:03:01.327 --> 01:03:03.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been around headquarters,

01:03:03.429 --> 01:03:05.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I’ve told classes in the past,

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:09.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they’re way
on the other side of the planet.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:13.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just can’t make that appear in a video.

01:03:13.439 --> 01:03:17.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not like being here
and receiving that education.

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:20.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the numbers have gone up now,

01:03:20.813 --> 01:03:24.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are more of you
on Branch Committees.

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:26.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will take Jehovah’s training

01:03:26.953 --> 01:03:31.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offer themselves
and strengthen as they can.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So good results

01:03:33.092 --> 01:03:36.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah gets all the praise and glory.

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:39.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead has been a blessing

01:03:39.198 --> 01:03:43.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

01:03:43.469 --> 01:03:48.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, finally, just these
brief comments for you

01:03:48.508 --> 01:03:50.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very brief.

01:03:50.977 --> 01:03:54.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the graduation, the 52nd class,

01:03:55.848 --> 01:04:00.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Knorr stressed the need
for the graduates to be humble.

01:04:00.052 --> 01:04:03.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you’ve heard that
quite a few times during class,

01:04:05.124 --> 01:04:08.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they intensified this
toward the last couple of weeks

01:04:08.528 --> 01:04:12.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I know these instructors
like I think I do.

01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:16.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be lowly in mind when you’re teaching
others,” Brother Knorr told them.

01:04:16.502 --> 01:04:20.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t overemphasize being humble

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you just can’t overemphasize it.

01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:27.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s crucial for Jehovah
to use us continually,

01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:29.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we believe

01:04:29.015 --> 01:04:32.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that same message
goes for you in class 150

01:04:32.652 --> 01:04:35.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Brother Knorr gave class 52.

01:04:35.755 --> 01:04:36.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be humble.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:40.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Teach others with a lowliness of mind.

01:04:42.728 --> 01:04:46.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you humbly rendering
your sacred service

01:04:46.332 --> 01:04:48.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah God

01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:52.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to cause
your heavenly Father to rejoice.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So cause him to rejoice,
and we know you will.

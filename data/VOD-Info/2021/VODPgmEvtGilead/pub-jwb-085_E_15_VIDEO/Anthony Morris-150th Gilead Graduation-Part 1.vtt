00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:06.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to go back many decades ago

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:11.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Monday, March 6, 1972.

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:15.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you in the class weren’t alive.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think I know of one for sure who was alive.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an inside joke, not <i>Inside Story</i>

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but anyway<i>.</i>

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And along with my wife,
we had the privilege

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and that was rare
unless you were a Bethelite)

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the graduation

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the 52nd class.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:45.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re in the Assembly Hall

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:48.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(jam packed there in New York City)

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just enjoying it.

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege for us to sit there

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy that program of the 52nd class!

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here we are almost 100
(just two shy) classes later

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the 150th class.

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we’re grateful

00:01:08.585 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because many are tied in live as we speak.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then the rest of the brotherhood

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to have it available
in a few months.

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So boy, things have changed,
and they enjoy that privilege.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was a rare privilege.

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
Brother Knorr was the chairman

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the program.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly, he just loved Gilead.

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that you’ve got to give him.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah used him mightily
to get it all started there

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:43.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1943 was the first one.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But knowing that the beast was coming out,

00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:52.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed them and said,
‘Yeah, we need a missionary school.’

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a missionary school for years.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention
is that I remember an outstanding talk.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard Brother Fred Franz
the summer before

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:06.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Yankee Stadium convention,

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were a little closer there
in the Assembly Hall.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll tell you what;
I was just glued to him.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had the privilege to hear him,
Jehovah blessed—

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:18.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a blessed, beautiful mind.

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could just quote these scriptures.

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve told folks:

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:26.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, if you don’t pay attention
and stay with him,

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you’re going to get lost.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to lose you.”

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you paid attention,
it was thrilling

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:34.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to hear him pour out his heart

00:02:34.938 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was all written
on his figurative heart.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he discussed Ecclesiastes 5.

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I was thinking
of bringing it up for your class here.

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:46.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is really directed to you.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he spoke there about vows.

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those first seven verses,
dreams are mentioned.

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:58.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciate it because it just struck me
when he mentioned it.

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:03.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dreams don’t refer to dreams
one has while they’re sleeping

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the busy day.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can’t get that on your own

00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just reading Ecclesiastes
with whatever version you have.

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to do with getting sidetracked

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with personal pursuits.

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These dreams
—these are the things they’re doing.

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would be “vanity”
(as we’d said then).

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just take a moment

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you here in the class and others
who want to follow along in Ecclesiastes 5)

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just touch on some of the nice things.

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:37.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, you could—

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, don’t do it right now,
but you can do it later.

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:43.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have access to the <i>Research Guide</i>

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—</i>an in-depth understanding

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:49.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this wisdom in Ecclesiastes.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Brother Franz addressed it.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:56.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, verse 1 says: “Watch your step.”

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is for you soon-to-be graduates.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is saying: “Watch your step.”

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:04.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t stop doing that.

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:09.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have thus far,
so continue to “watch your step.”

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he mentions those morally “stupid ones.”

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not you.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can avoid that.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I love this in verse 2:

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be quick with your mouth.”

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, there are a lot of people in the world
who could benefit from that counsel.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:30.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like:
‘Does he or she ever shut up?

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I mean, they must—
I bet you they talk in their sleep.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just won’t shut up.’

00:04:40.296 --> 00:04:42.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, anyway,
‘don’t be quick with your mouth,’

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly in context here

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re speaking to Jehovah.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, those are some good things
to keep in mind,

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for you brothers
who will speak in public.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:57.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you sisters too, when it’s personal
with your prayers to Jehovah,

00:04:57.013 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be quick with your mouth

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:02.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you approach
the Sovereign of the universe.

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words should be few.

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:08.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do not impress God with vocabulary.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s impressed with sincerity of heart.

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves those who love him.

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:22.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in all different languages,
he treasures those prayers.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he mentions this:

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A dream comes
from too many preoccupations.”

00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:31.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the revised Bible here,
it says “too many cares.”

00:05:31.214 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this idea isn’t just dreams
from a busy, busy day.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:39.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This preoccupation with self

00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:42.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being warned against here.

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:45.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t do it.
See, do not do it.

00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be preoccupied with yourself.

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:53.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for those who are,
there are many words from them.

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But be careful, you know.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:00.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have the privilege now;
you’ll be praying more in public

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—probably more than you ever have before.

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You get privileges, you know.

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:10.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you’re praying to Jehovah,
sometimes—

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to be counseling
or criticizing prayers.

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:14.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to be careful of that.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes you even hear
a prayer at Bethel, and it’s like:

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘OK. We’re trying to eat breakfast here.’

00:06:25.568 --> 00:06:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ve told folks that it’s like,
you know, I just can’t help but—

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is there, the most eloquent person
to walk the planet,

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the meal comes.

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He ‘raised his eyes to heaven’
and “gave thanks.”

00:06:41.784 --> 00:06:43.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Amen.

00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s eat.”

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, there are other times
you want to pour out your heart and all that,

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’re not praying to the audience.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking
to the Sovereign of the universe.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The counsel is, you know—

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I’m a Gilead graduate

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you brothers particularly),
so I’m going to have longer prayers.”

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope not.

00:07:07.043 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure hope not unless they’re private.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he gets into something crucial,

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just so important
to keep in mind verse 4.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 4 and 5:

00:07:22.725 --> 00:07:25.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever you make a vow to God,

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not delay to pay it,

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:32.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he finds no pleasure
in the stupid ones [morally stupid].”

00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:34.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it’s very clear:

00:07:34.504 --> 00:07:37.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you vow, pay.”

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you vow, pay.”

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:43.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then:
“[It’s] better for you not to vow

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:46.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to vow and not pay.”

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is serious counsel,

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the warning is,
Don’t allow your mouth to cause you to sin.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to vows
(and some of you are married),

00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you have the vow.

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:03.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always have to hold on to that.

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a light matter with Jehovah God.

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And any other vows—be careful.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re going to make a vow,
it’s between you and him.

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, notice here:

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not allow [in verse 6]
your mouth to cause you to sin,

00:08:19.549 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and do not say before the angel

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[see, think about this]

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was a mistake.”

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:31.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah has the angels
doing all sorts of things.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t even begin to know the things

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are always going on all the time

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s servants and his holy angels.

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s priceless.

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:44.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, angels are, according to this,

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to check on these things.

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you don’t say to the angel:

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, look, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.”

00:08:53.683 --> 00:08:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-uh.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made a vow.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But see, it shouldn’t be
because an angel is going to check

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that’s Jehovah’s direction.

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should be
because of our love for Jehovah.

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you make a vow (you know,
whether it was marriage or whatever),

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s your love for Jehovah
—that’s what cements the vow.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It matters.

00:09:20.276 --> 00:09:23.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, it matters to him.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:28.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then finally, in verse 7:

00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For just as many preoccupations
lead to dreams,

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:36.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so, too, many words lead to futility.”

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:38.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good counsel.

00:09:38.928 --> 00:09:42.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are so filled

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Word of God.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a special class,

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Gilead is a special school.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have other schools, SKE;
I’ll mention something later about that.

00:09:55.044 --> 00:09:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is unique

00:09:57.613 --> 00:10:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to have men whom
Jehovah has appointed to instruct.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Teaching Committee selects them

00:10:04.987 --> 00:10:09.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—totally whole-souled
and devoted to Jehovah God—

00:10:09.258 --> 00:10:11.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach you during the class.

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:14.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going over all these things
in the Word of God.

00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:17.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it’s all in there,

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just special.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you thank Jehovah
that you have this education,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re going
to move forward to glorify him.

00:10:30.946 --> 00:10:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s pretty similar
to what is mentioned here

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last sentence in verse 7:

00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But fear the true God.”

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you soon-to-be graduates,

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep those words in your heart.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just “fear the true God” in the days ahead,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay away from these kind of dreams

00:10:56.439 --> 00:11:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about self-preoccupation, you know?

00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-mm.
No, not for you.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, your education was futile,

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not good.

00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:15.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t see that in any of you
(and I’m not implying).

00:11:15.658 --> 00:11:18.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s such wise counsel

00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah God in his Word.

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s much, much more there.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:26.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy thinking about it

00:11:26.068 --> 00:11:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a little tool we have there,
the <i>Research Guide.</i>

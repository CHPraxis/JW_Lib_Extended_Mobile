00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:05.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had an important decision
suddenly thrust on you?

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You thought you knew the right thing to do.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as soon as you decide,
you start having second thoughts

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe even regrets—
and now you can’t stop thinking,

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Did I do the right thing?’

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tendency to repeat a thought

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over and over again is called rumination.

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when those thoughts make us feel anxious,

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be bad for our health.

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you students 

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made tough decisions
before you came to this class.

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that.

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone right now is faced

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with challenging decisions every day.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we do

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stop anxious rumination once it starts?

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37:5,

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the advice
that is given to us here:

00:00:57.273 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Commit your way to Jehovah;

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rely on him,

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:05.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will act in your behalf.”

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the word for “commit” here

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:12.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
literally means “to roll, or remove,
something from our life.”

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as the footnote says,

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to “roll [our] way

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[our concerns, our anxieties] upon” Jehovah.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we ruminate anxiously,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re holding on to our problem,

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Bible says that through prayer,

00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to take the problem off our shoulders

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put it on Jehovah’s.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, we no longer act
as if the burden is ours.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to leave it in his hands.

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:46.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds so simple,
but at times, it’s hard to do.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us
when we have trouble letting go?

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our suggestion today

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to let Jehovah inspire you with awe.

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:01.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to inspire someone
means to make them feel

00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they want to do something and can do it.

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it may be that Jehovah
gave us the emotion of awe

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:10.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that very purpose.

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:14.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be wondering now,
How can awe help me?

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, open your Bibles again,

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time to Genesis chapter 28.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:23.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s look at an example together

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that illustrates how this can work.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10,

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we catch up with the patriarch Jacob.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s on the road.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice it says:
“Jacob departed from Beer-sheba

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept going toward Haran.”

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was he going there?

00:02:42.478 --> 00:02:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the main reason
was to get away from his brother, Esau.

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jacob had just made a tough decision.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Esau was mad.

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know the story.

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:59.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For most of his life,
Esau despised the family birthright,

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:02.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that upset Jacob very much.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at some point,
he purchased the birthright from him.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years go by, and then one day, 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their father, Isaac, is getting ready
to bless Esau as the firstborn.

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture the scene?

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:20.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jacob going to do?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not possible today
to know all the factors

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that influenced Isaac,
Rebekah, and Jacob back then.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is,

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob’s decision
put a strain on the whole family.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esau began plotting to kill his brother,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why Jacob was on the road.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think he might have been ruminating

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:46.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a bit that day on what happened?

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he perhaps have second thoughts?

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he asking himself:
‘Did I do the right thing?

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Was it OK to fool my father?

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah think of me now?’

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:02.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those would have been reasonable questions.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
we don’t know what Jacob was thinking.

00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if he was having second thoughts,

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened next

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have helped him
to stop ruminating on them.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what we read in verses 11 and 12:

00:04:17.106 --> 00:04:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In time

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he came to a place

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and prepared to spend
the night there because the sun had set.

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he took one of the stones of that place

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and set it to rest his head on
and lay down there.

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he had a dream, and look!

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there was a stairway set on the earth,

00:04:37.927 --> 00:04:41.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and its top reached up to the heavens;

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and there were God’s angels ascending

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and descending on it.”

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this heavenly ladder

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have looked
like a rising flight of stones

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the one you see here
in this illustration.

00:04:56.913 --> 00:05:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob could see now
that he was not alone.

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a small part

00:05:03.786 --> 00:05:06.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an awesome organization.

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:08.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is communication

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the different parts
of that organization.

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:15.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angels minister in some important way

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Jehovah and humans
who have his approval.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:21.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was more.

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue in verse 13:

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:26.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And look!

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there was Jehovah stationed above it,
and he said:

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:33.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am Jehovah the God of Abraham

00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:36.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘your father and the God of Isaac.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The land on which you are lying,

00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to you I am going to give it

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to your offspring.’”

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting those words
must have been to Jacob!

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:52.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wasn’t displeased with him.

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:54.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quite the contrary.

00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He promised to bless Jacob
in a marvelous way.

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah apparently used
this awesome experience

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Jacob to let go
of any anxiety he might have had.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as he continued to do his best,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob could trust Jehovah to do the rest.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a relief!

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his reaction in verse 17:

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he grew fearful and added:

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:27.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘How awe-inspiring this place is!

00:06:27.937 --> 00:06:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This can only be the house of God,

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:34.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is the gate of the heavens.’”

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jacob’s relief here is almost palpable.

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is no longer conflicted.

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vision inspires him

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a vow of loyalty to Jehovah forever.

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can read what he did and said

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the latter part of this chapter.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, verse 17

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses the same Hebrew word twice.

00:06:56.933 --> 00:07:01.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first time it’s translated as “fearful,”

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second time as “awe-inspiring,”

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:06.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that may be

00:07:06.976 --> 00:07:10.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because awe is a surprising emotion.

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful mix

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of inspiration and fear.

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You sense you’re in the presence of someone

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something greater than yourself,

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it makes you feel small in a good way.

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe can humble you,
and that shifts your thinking.

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps you to see things as they are

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not as you expect them to be.

00:07:36.105 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the kind of fear Proverbs 1:7 says

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the beginning of knowledge,” or wisdom,

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that may be why at times

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah evokes awe in us.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jacob,

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people often say they feel more centered

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spiritual after an awesome experience.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe seems to pull us out of ourselves.

00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:05.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It connects us
on a deeper level with Jehovah,

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it reconnects us
with what is most important

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s sovereignty,

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his creation, and his people.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, getting away from Esau
did not end Jacob’s problems.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:23.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other times in his life

00:08:23.486 --> 00:08:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he again became very anxious and afraid,

00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:30.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but true to his word,

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was always there.

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jacob was faithful,

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:39.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made sure he would succeed.

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:44.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty years later, when Jacob returned
to Canaan with his family,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent out a company
of angels to greet him.

00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:51.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How awesome was that!

00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:56.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does all of this mean
then for you and me?

00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 89:7 says

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:02.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is “awe-inspiring

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all [those] around him.”

00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve ever hiked in Banff National Park

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or walked in Muir Woods

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or felt goose bumps as you looked up
into the night sky,

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know what awe feels like.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve experienced

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah inspiring you.

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:31.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the next time you need
to get out of your head,

00:09:31.354 --> 00:09:33.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember awe.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a walk in the woods;

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:39.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sing your favorite Kingdom song.

00:09:39.262 --> 00:09:43.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awe may be
the most underutilized way we know

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:47.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to stop ruminating
on anxious thoughts

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fully commit our way to Jehovah.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let your problems stress you out.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your research, pray for guidance,

00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make the best decision you can,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let Jehovah

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspire you with awe.

00:00:01 You have completed your Gilead schooling.
00:00:04 You’ve done well, and we warmly commend you.
00:00:08 You’ve reached the finish line for this school.
00:00:11 When the program concludes, you will be a graduate.
00:00:14 You’ve run this course, so to speak,
00:00:17 with that goal in mind, haven’t you?
00:00:19 Yet, through it all, you’ve also kept in mind that,
00:00:22 for you, this experience is a part of a bigger race
00:00:26 —the race for life.
00:00:28 Like determined runners,
00:00:30 loyal servants of God keep moving forward
00:00:33 after each goal in their service to him.
00:00:36 Such goals are like stages in a race.
00:00:40 Some of our goals and our pace may vary
00:00:43 from person to person based on circumstances.
00:00:47 For you, Gilead School
00:00:49 is a goal, or stage, that you have now completed.
00:00:53 But keep running!
00:00:55 See, we run until we reach what our faith shows us,
00:00:59 the prize waiting beyond the ultimate finish line
00:01:03 —everlasting life in the service of Jehovah.
00:01:07 The promises found in God’s Word
00:01:10 move us to keep reaching out for that prize.
00:01:14 Consider the apostle Paul, who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.
00:01:18 At 2 Timothy 4:7, 8,
00:01:21 he indicated that he had reached the finish line.
00:01:23 His prize was in sight, and it was reserved for him.
00:01:27 He said: “I have fought the fine fight,
00:01:30 “I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith.
00:01:35 “From this time on, there is reserved for me
00:01:38 the crown of righteousness.”
00:01:40 With strong faith, Paul could see beyond the finish line
00:01:45 and he yearned for the reward that he would receive.
00:01:50 And then there is Jesus’ example.
00:01:53 Just before breathing his last,
00:01:55 he cried out: “It has been accomplished!”
00:01:59 Throughout his earthly ministry,
00:02:01 that goal to accomplish Jehovah’s will for him
00:02:05 never left his sight.
00:02:07 No matter how painful his life course proved to be,
00:02:11 Jesus kept his integrity and finished that course,
00:02:15 like the true Son of God that he is.
00:02:18 In all of this, Jesus saw more than just the finish line.
00:02:23 He saw the endless joy that was waiting for him.
00:02:27 So powerful is Jesus’ example
00:02:30 that Hebrews 12:2 urges us
00:02:33 to keep it centered in our sight.
00:02:36 We invite you to follow along there with Hebrews 12:2.
00:02:41 It says: “. . . as we look intently
00:02:45 “at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.
00:02:49 “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake,
00:02:54 “despising shame, and has sat down
00:02:57 at the right hand of the throne of God.”
00:03:00 Who are we urged to look at intently?
00:03:03 The “Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”
00:03:07 And what did Jesus look at?
00:03:08 What did he see?
00:03:10 He saw the joy that his faith placed directly in front of him.
00:03:15 Jesus focused on the joy that would result
00:03:19 from his life course of perfect integrity,
00:03:22 from providing the ransom for us,
00:03:25 and from being back alongside his heavenly Father.
00:03:29 Jesus never took his eyes off the prize waiting beyond the finish line,
00:03:34 and neither should we.
00:03:36 Let’s look at some important lessons
00:03:39 that will help all of us to complete the race for life.
00:03:42 We will consider two main points:
00:03:45 first, how should you run each stage of the race?
00:03:49 and, second, qualities that will help you
00:03:52 to run like a true Christian and win.
00:03:56 Now, for the first point: How should you run each stage of the race?
00:04:01 The race for life is a race of endurance,
00:04:03 and as mentioned, it includes stages, or successive goals.
00:04:07 We strive for each goal at our individual best pace
00:04:11 and with a clear focus on the ultimate goal, or prize.
00:04:16 First Timothy 6:19
00:04:18 calls that prize “the real life”
00:04:22 —that is, everlasting life in perfection,
00:04:25 either in heaven or on earth.
00:04:28 As mentioned, your Gilead training
00:04:30 is now a completed stage of the race for you.
00:04:33 With humility, apply all that you have learned
00:04:37 and remain focused on the endless joy ahead of you.
00:04:41 When hardships and difficulties come
00:04:44 —and they will— keep moving forward.
00:04:47 If you are knocked down by anything,
00:04:50 get back up and run with determination,
00:04:53 with everything that you’ve got.
00:04:56 Be like the marathon runner from the country of Tanzania
00:05:00 who ran in the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City.
00:05:05 At one point during that race, he was bumped by other runners,
00:05:09 and he fell to the ground so hard
00:05:11 that he gashed his knee and dislocated it.
00:05:14 He also smashed his shoulder against the pavement.
00:05:18 Yet, after receiving some medical attention,
00:05:21 he refused to stop running.
00:05:23 He continued in the race.
00:05:26 His pace was slower, but he moved forward toward his goal.
00:05:30 He was no longer running for a mere material prize.
00:05:34 He was running to complete the race
00:05:36 with his honor intact and that of the land he represented.
00:05:39 He finished the race.
00:05:42 In the race for life,
00:05:44 you may experience times when you feel as if someone or something
00:05:48 is trying to knock you down.
00:05:50 What will you do?
00:05:52 Learn from what happened to the Galatians.
00:05:55 When some in the first century allowed the speech and actions of others
00:06:00 to knock them out of the race, notice what Paul said to them
00:06:03 at Galatians 5:7, 8.
00:06:08 Imagine that he has an incredulous tone
00:06:11 as he speaks to them and states in verse 7:
00:06:16 “You were running well.
00:06:18 “Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?
00:06:22 This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you.”
00:06:27 What was the problem?
00:06:29 Some in Galatia had allowed themselves
00:06:32 to be persuaded by false teachings,
00:06:34 and they were no longer obeying the truth.
00:06:38 They gave in to pressure.
00:06:40 Also, in verse 13,
00:06:42 Paul refers to the danger of “fleshly desires.”
00:06:47 Whatever happened to them,
00:06:49 those Christian runners were “hindered,”
00:06:51 as he said, because they took their eyes off of the prize.
00:06:55 All of us must keep that lesson in front of us.
00:06:59 If we do, we will never be hindered or thrown off course
00:07:03 in our pursuit of the real life.
00:07:06 We will be rock solid in our focus.
00:07:10 When others see that you are looking straight ahead toward the prize,
00:07:14 they’re helped to look in the same direction.
00:07:18 Continue to be a real stabilizing influence
00:07:21 in the branches where you will serve.
00:07:24 So for our first point, how should you run each stage of the race?
00:07:29 Run at your very best pace
00:07:31 and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal
00:07:34 —the real life.
00:07:36 Now, for our second main point:
00:07:39 qualities that will help you
00:07:41 to run like a true Christian and win.
00:07:45 We run as true Christians
00:07:47 when we follow the example of Christ.
00:07:50 Jesus’ example of doing all things for Jehovah’s glory,
00:07:54 despite the suffering that he endured,
00:07:57 is one that we must follow.
00:07:59 First Peter 2:21 reminds us
00:08:02 that “Christ suffered for you,
00:08:04 leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.”
00:08:09 Let’s consider two qualities
00:08:11 that Jesus had in abundance and that we must imitate closely
00:08:16 —faith and courage.
00:08:19 For each quality, we will look at why we need it to win.
00:08:24 So we begin with faith.
00:08:26 Now, you do not need to be told what faith is.
00:08:29 You have it, and you’ve learned much about examples of faith in your studies.
00:08:34 We need faith because faith helps us to endure,
00:08:38 and faith helps us to remember
00:08:40 that our trials in life are temporary.
00:08:43 We look ahead with confidence,
00:08:45 we see beyond the troubles of today,
00:08:48 and we trust Jehovah every step of the way.
00:08:52 You needed to have faith after you arrived for this school
00:08:56 and then had to wait patiently for some months for your classes to begin.
00:09:00 True?
00:09:02 You no doubt wondered: ‘When will the classes start?
00:09:05 How will they be carried out in a pandemic?’
00:09:08 You waited, and in due time your faith was rewarded.
00:09:12 Jehovah saw to it that things worked out, didn’t he?
00:09:15 Your instructors and so many others working with them
00:09:19 ensured that the school moved forward safely
00:09:22 and that you received the full benefit from the classes.
00:09:26 That experience highlights the kind of faith
00:09:29 that all of us will need in the days ahead
00:09:32 whenever new challenges arise.
00:09:35 You could say that 20/20 vision will be necessary
00:09:38 for each of us to keep running successfully.
00:09:41 And I don’t mean the year 2020.
00:09:44 True Christians look far ahead with clear,
00:09:47 spiritual vision —that’s the point—
00:09:49 and remain focused on the prize beyond the finish line.
00:09:54 Those without faith cannot see it.
00:09:57 They cannot focus on things unseen.
00:10:00 But those with faith can see it.
00:10:03 That is why they —why you—
00:10:06 remain focused on Jehovah’s promises.
00:10:09 The Scriptures urge us to keep looking ahead.
00:10:13 An example of this is found
00:10:15 at 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18
00:10:21 —2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.
00:10:24 Now, when writing these inspired words,
00:10:26 Paul was encouraging the brothers
00:10:28 not to allow problems, difficulties, and persecutions
00:10:32 to cloud or block their view
00:10:35 of the glorious reward that was set before them.
00:10:38 Please look at what is said starting in verse 17:
00:10:42 “For though the tribulation is momentary and light,
00:10:46 “it works out for us a glory
00:10:48 “that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting;
00:10:53 “while we keep our eyes,
00:10:55 “not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.
00:11:00 “For the things seen are temporary,
00:11:02 but the things unseen are everlasting.”
00:11:07 Again, these inspired words
00:11:10 should move us to look beyond the trials we face
00:11:14 and to remain focused on what is ahead of us.
00:11:17 Paul was speaking to those with the heavenly hope.
00:11:21 But the encouragement and meaning behind these words
00:11:25 apply to all who are running for the real life,
00:11:29 that is, for the things “everlasting,”
00:11:32 as it says here.
00:11:34 When we are determined and focused,
00:11:36 we are helped to press on each day.
00:11:39 Proverbs 4:25 tells us to “look straight ahead . . . ,
00:11:43 fix [your eyes or] your gaze straight ahead of you.”
00:11:47 To keep doing that, we need faith.
00:11:51 We need good spiritual eyesight to see
00:11:54 what is otherwise “unseen,” as Paul said.
00:11:57 Keep in mind that the objective of your Gilead training
00:12:00 is to strengthen and stabilize the field and branch organization.
00:12:05 Whether a brother or sister,
00:12:07 your example of faith goes a long way in doing that.
00:12:11 Others will imitate the faith and example of a determined runner.
00:12:16 When you are settled in your assignments,
00:12:19 keep your eyes of faith set on doing God’s will.
00:12:24 Danger can come when you start to feel
00:12:27 that you’ve achieved most or even all of your goals.
00:12:30 What could be the result?
00:12:32 When we lose sight of the race and of its prize,
00:12:36 our interests will focus on other things,
00:12:39 perhaps material things.
00:12:41 Don’t let this happen to you.
00:12:44 Never allow distractions to pull you off of the Christian course,
00:12:48 and avoid ever becoming self-satisfied
00:12:51 because of privileges that you may come to enjoy.
00:12:54 Focus on the real life, and remain humble.
00:12:59 Appreciate your privileges in Jehovah’s service,
00:13:03 but remain focused on what you desire most
00:13:06 —pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever.
00:13:10 As we read earlier in Hebrews chapter 12,
00:13:13 when Jesus suffered unjustly to the point of death,
00:13:17 he endured “for the joy that was set before him.”
00:13:21 He always looked at what was ahead of him.
00:13:24 The reward that he longed for was clear to him.
00:13:28 It was that real to him.
00:13:30 We must always remember Jesus’ example as we keep looking ahead.
00:13:35 Maintain your strong faith by reading God’s Word every day
00:13:39 and applying its counsel in everything that you do.
00:13:43 We endure in the race with courage
00:13:45 when our faith is strong.
00:13:48 And that is the second quality we will now look at
00:13:52 —courage, why we need courage to win.
00:13:56 True Christians have courage that stems from their faith.
00:14:00 We live with hope, with expectation
00:14:03 —and not just any expectation
00:14:05 but “assured expectation,” as the Scriptures call it.
00:14:09 When your rescue is assured, it gives you courage, doesn’t it?
00:14:14 Imagine how Jeremiah felt when Ebed-melech
00:14:17 and 30 other men arrived to pull him up out of a deep cistern.
00:14:21 What could have seemed hopeless was now a moment filled with hope,
00:14:26 and he continued on with courage.
00:14:30 Courage moves us to look beyond any obstacles
00:14:33 that may stand between us and the finish line.
00:14:37 The fact is that nothing promised in God’s Word will fail to come true.
00:14:42 So take courage.
00:14:43 Keep in mind that your determination to do God’s will
00:14:46 means that for you the prize will be waiting.
00:14:50 Jehovah cannot lie.
00:14:52 Therefore, as you go to your assignments,
00:14:55 remain calm and assured of Jehovah’s help.
00:14:59 True, great changes have taken place in the world
00:15:02 since you arrived for Gilead School.
00:15:05 But though the world is changing around us
00:15:07 (and certainly not for the better),
00:15:09 remember Jehovah’s promises.
00:15:12 What we see happening is temporary.
00:15:15 A pandemic—nothing new!
00:15:17 Jesus foretold it —didn’t he?—
00:15:20 “pestilences,” he called it, “in one place after another.”
00:15:24 So we’re not shaken by this.
00:15:26 We have faith and courage, and we keep going, don’t we?
00:15:31 Think back to the Olympic marathon runner
00:15:33 from Tanzania whom we mentioned earlier.
00:15:37 After being injured, he was bandaged and then continued to run.
00:15:42 It took courage and determination to run,
00:15:45 and sometimes walk, through the pain.
00:15:47 When he eventually crossed the finish line,
00:15:49 he was cheered by the small crowd remaining in the stadium.
00:15:53 Now, try to imagine:
00:15:55 He was limping with his bandages blowing in the wind,
00:15:59 but he moved forward toward his goal.
00:16:03 For many, the race would have been long over.
00:16:06 But that man was running for something more than a material prize.
00:16:10 He saw something greater beyond that finish line.
00:16:13 What was it?
00:16:15 We find it in what he said afterward.
00:16:19 When he was asked why he continued on in the race, he replied:
00:16:24 “My country did not send me
5,000 miles to start the race.
00:16:28 They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.”
00:16:33 That sense of responsibility
00:16:36 gave him the courage to go on despite the pain.
00:16:39 He saw a greater purpose, and he returned home with honor.
00:16:44 We too have a greater responsibility
00:16:47 and a far more important race.
00:16:50 We owe it to Jehovah to keep running the Christian course.
00:16:54 He and his Son gave everything,
00:16:57 you could say, so that we can keep running.
00:17:01 We also owe it to others to set a good example for them
00:17:05 that will motivate them never to give up.
00:17:08 And we owe it to ourselves to use what we have been given
00:17:12 so as to run in a way that we gain the real life.
00:17:17 We are certain that you have both the faith and the courage
00:17:22 to run with the eyes of your heart
00:17:24 looking intently at Jesus’ example and at the prize.
00:17:29 So in review, what is the overall lesson
00:17:33 for you Gilead graduates and, really, for every Christian runner?
00:17:36 It is this: Run for the real life at your very best pace
00:17:41 (Jehovah will help you),
00:17:43 run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal,
00:17:48 and run the course with faith and with courage.
00:17:53 When will the finish line be reached?
00:17:55 For those who will live forever on earth,
00:17:58 the Revelation Climax  book states this in chapter 11:
00:18:02 “By exercising faith throughout Jesus’ Millennial Reign
00:18:07 “and during the decisive test that follows,
00:18:10 “these will be rewarded with life everlasting in Paradise on earth.
00:18:14 “Their names will then remain indelibly written
00:18:18 in the book of life.”
00:18:21 For true servants of God, that “decisive test” will be nothing to fear.
00:18:26 They will never drop out of the race.
00:18:28 For them, that test will be just another day on the calendar, so to speak.
00:18:32 They will keep going
00:18:34 with their eyes fixed on what is ahead for them.
00:18:37 Faith, courage, and all other godly qualities
00:18:42 will carry loyal ones into the real life.
00:18:46 Use your Gilead training to run the race well.
00:18:49 Strengthen others to do the same.
00:18:52 See the prize ahead of you.
00:18:54 And follow Jesus’ steps closely.
00:18:57 Run the race through the approaching great tribulation,
00:19:01 and then keep running like a true Christian.

With those lyrics ringing in our ears,

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it puts us in the mind for the next talk

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be delivered by Brother Kenneth Cook.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title is “Look Beyond the Finish Line.”

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Cook, you have piqued our interest.

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have completed your Gilead schooling.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:25.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve done well,
and we warmly commend you.

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve reached
the finish line for this school.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the program concludes,
you will be a graduate.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve run this course, so to speak,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that goal in mind, haven’t you?

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:39.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, through it all,
you’ve also kept in mind that,

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you, this experience
is a part of a bigger race

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the race for life.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like determined runners,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal servants of God keep moving forward

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after each goal in their service to him.

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such goals are like stages in a race.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our goals and our pace may vary

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from person to person based on circumstances.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For you, Gilead School

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a goal, or stage,
that you have now completed.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:13.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep running!

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we run until we reach
what our faith shows us,

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prize waiting
beyond the ultimate finish line

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everlasting life in the service of Jehovah.

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The promises found in God’s Word

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:31.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move us to keep reaching out for that prize.

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the apostle Paul,
who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Timothy 4:7, 8,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he indicated
that he had reached the finish line.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His prize was in sight,
and it was reserved for him.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I have fought the fine fight,

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:52.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,
I have observed the faith.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From this time on, there is reserved for me

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the crown of righteousness.”

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With strong faith,
Paul could see beyond the finish line

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he yearned for the reward
that he would receive.

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there is Jesus’ example.

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just before breathing his last,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cried out: “It has been accomplished!”

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout his earthly ministry,

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that goal to accomplish
Jehovah’s will for him

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never left his sight.

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how painful
his life course proved to be,

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus kept his integrity
and finished that course,

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the true Son of God that he is.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this, Jesus saw
more than just the finish line.

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:44.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw the endless joy
that was waiting for him.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:47.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So powerful is Jesus’ example

00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Hebrews 12:2 urges us

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep it centered in our sight.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:58.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to follow along there
with Hebrews 12:2.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:02.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “. . . as we look intently

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:07.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent
and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him
he endured a torture stake,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“despising shame, and has sat down

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the right hand of the throne of God.”

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:21.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are we urged to look at intently?

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:24.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jesus look at?

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:27.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he see?

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:32.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw the joy that his faith
placed directly in front of him.

00:03:32.941 --> 00:03:36.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus focused on the joy that would result

00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his life course of perfect integrity,

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from providing the ransom for us,

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from being back alongside
his heavenly Father.

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:52.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus never took his eyes off the prize
waiting beyond the finish line,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither should we.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some important lessons

00:03:56.423 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help all of us
to complete the race for life.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will consider two main points:

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, how should you run
each stage of the race?

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, second, qualities that will help you

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:14.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run like a true Christian and win.

00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:18.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for the first point:
How should you run each stage of the race?

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:21.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The race for life is a race of endurance,

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as mentioned, it includes stages,
or successive goals.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We strive for each goal
at our individual best pace

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a clear focus
on the ultimate goal, or prize.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:36.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 6:19

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calls that prize “the real life”

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, everlasting life in perfection,

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either in heaven or on earth.

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As mentioned, your Gilead training

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now a completed stage of the race for you.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With humility, apply all
that you have learned

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain focused
on the endless joy ahead of you.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When hardships and difficulties come

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:05.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and they will—
keep moving forward.

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:07.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are knocked down by anything,

00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:10.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get back up and run with determination,

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:13.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with everything that you’ve got.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like the marathon runner
from the country of Tanzania

00:05:17.796 --> 00:05:22.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ran in the 1968 Olympics
held in Mexico City.

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point during that race,
he was bumped by other runners,

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he fell to the ground so hard

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gashed his knee and dislocated it.

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:35.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also smashed his shoulder
against the pavement.

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, after receiving some medical attention,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he refused to stop running.

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:43.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued in the race.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His pace was slower,
but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was no longer running
for a mere material prize.

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:53.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was running to complete the race

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:57.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his honor intact
and that of the land he represented.

00:05:57.252 --> 00:05:59.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He finished the race.

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the race for life,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may experience times
when you feel as if someone or something

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:07.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is trying to knock you down.

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:13.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn from what happened to the Galatians.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When some in the first century
allowed the speech and actions of others

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to knock them out of the race,
notice what Paul said to them

00:06:21.109 --> 00:06:25.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Galatians 5:7, 8.

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:29.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that he has an incredulous tone

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:33.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he speaks to them and states in verse 7:

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:35.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You were running well.

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who hindered you
from continuing to obey the truth?

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:44.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This sort of persuasion
does not come from the One calling you.”

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the problem?

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:49.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in Galatia had allowed themselves

00:06:49.763 --> 00:06:52.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be persuaded by false teachings,

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were no longer obeying the truth.

00:06:55.394 --> 00:06:57.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave in to pressure.

00:06:57.813 --> 00:07:00.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, in verse 13,

00:07:00.357 --> 00:07:04.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul refers to the danger
of “fleshly desires.”

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:06.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever happened to them,

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:09.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those Christian runners were “hindered,”

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:13.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he said, because they
took their eyes off of the prize.

00:07:13.287 --> 00:07:16.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us must keep
that lesson in front of us.

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, we will never be hindered
or thrown off course

00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our pursuit of the real life.

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be rock solid in our focus.

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:32.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others see that you are looking
straight ahead toward the prize,

00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:35.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re helped to look in the same direction.

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to be a real stabilizing influence

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branches where you will serve.

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for our first point,
how should you run each stage of the race?

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:48.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run at your very best pace

00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:51.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal

00:07:51.908 --> 00:07:53.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the real life.

00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:56.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for our second main point:

00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:58.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities that will help you

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:02.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run like a true Christian and win.

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We run as true Christians

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we follow the example of Christ.

00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:11.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ example
of doing all things for Jehovah’s glory,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the suffering that he endured,

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one that we must follow.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 2:21 reminds us

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Christ suffered for you,

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:27.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leaving a model for you
to follow his steps closely.”

00:08:27.027 --> 00:08:29.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider two qualities

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:33.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had in abundance
and that we must imitate closely

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:36.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith and courage.

00:08:36.995 --> 00:08:41.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For each quality,
we will look at why we need it to win.

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:43.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we begin with faith.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you do not need
to be told what faith is.

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:52.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have it, and you’ve learned much
about examples of faith in your studies.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith
because faith helps us to endure,

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith helps us to remember

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:00.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our trials in life are temporary.

00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:02.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look ahead with confidence,

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:05.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see beyond the troubles of today,

00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:09.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we trust Jehovah every step of the way.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:13.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You needed to have faith
after you arrived for this school

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:18.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then had to wait patiently
for some months for your classes to begin.

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:19.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True?

00:09:19.663 --> 00:09:22.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You no doubt wondered:
‘When will the classes start?

00:09:22.749 --> 00:09:25.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will they be carried out in a pandemic?’

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You waited, and in due time
your faith was rewarded.

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw to it
that things worked out, didn’t he?

00:09:32.843 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your instructors
and so many others working with them

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:39.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensured that the school moved forward safely

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you received
the full benefit from the classes.

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:47.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That experience highlights the kind of faith

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of us will need in the days ahead

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:52.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever new challenges arise.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:56.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say
that 20/20 vision will be necessary

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of us to keep running successfully.

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t mean the year 2020.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians look far ahead
with clear,

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:07.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual vision
—that’s the point—

00:10:07.294 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain focused
on the prize beyond the finish line.

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those without faith cannot see it.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:17.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cannot focus on things unseen.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:21.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those with faith can see it.

00:10:21.016 --> 00:10:23.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they
—why you—

00:10:23.393 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remain focused on Jehovah’s promises.

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures urge us to keep looking ahead.

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:32.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of this is found

00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:37.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18

00:10:38.825 --> 00:10:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when writing these inspired words,

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:46.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was encouraging the brothers

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow problems,
difficulties, and persecutions

00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:52.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cloud or block their view

00:10:52.756 --> 00:10:55.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the glorious reward
that was set before them.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please look at what is said
starting in verse 17:

00:10:59.888 --> 00:11:03.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it works out for us a glory

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is of more and more
surpassing greatness and is everlasting;

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while we keep our eyes,

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not on the things seen,
but on the things unseen.

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the things seen are temporary,

00:11:20.116 --> 00:11:24.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the things unseen are everlasting.”

00:11:24.538 --> 00:11:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, these inspired words

00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should move us
to look beyond the trials we face

00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:35.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remain focused on what is ahead of us.

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:38.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was speaking
to those with the heavenly hope.

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:42.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the encouragement
and meaning behind these words

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:46.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply to all
who are running for the real life,

00:11:46.518 --> 00:11:49.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, for the things “everlasting,”

00:11:49.396 --> 00:11:51.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it says here.

00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:54.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are determined and focused,

00:11:54.109 --> 00:11:57.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are helped to press on each day.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:01.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 4:25 tells us
to “look straight ahead . . . ,

00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:05.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fix [your eyes or] your gaze
straight ahead of you.”

00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:09.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep doing that, we need faith.

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:11.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need good spiritual eyesight to see

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is otherwise “unseen,” as Paul said.

00:12:14.963 --> 00:12:18.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
that the objective of your Gilead training

00:12:18.258 --> 00:12:22.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strengthen and stabilize
the field and branch organization.

00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:25.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether a brother or sister,

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:29.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your example of faith
goes a long way in doing that.

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:34.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will imitate the faith
and example of a determined runner.

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:37.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you are settled in your assignments,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep your eyes of faith
set on doing God’s will.

00:12:41.615 --> 00:12:44.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danger can come when you start to feel

00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:47.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve achieved
most or even all of your goals.

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:49.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could be the result?

00:12:49.914 --> 00:12:53.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we lose sight
of the race and of its prize,

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:57.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our interests will focus
on other things,

00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps material things.

00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:01.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let this happen to you.

00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:05.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow distractions
to pull you off of the Christian course,

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid ever becoming self-satisfied

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:12.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of privileges
that you may come to enjoy.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:17.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the real life, and remain humble.

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:20.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate your privileges
in Jehovah’s service,

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but remain focused on what you desire most

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:27.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read earlier in Hebrews chapter 12,

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:34.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus suffered unjustly
to the point of death,

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:39.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he endured “for the joy
that was set before him.”

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always looked at what was ahead of him.

00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:45.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward that he longed for
was clear to him.

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:48.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was that real to him.

00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:52.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must always remember Jesus’ example
as we keep looking ahead.

00:13:52.977 --> 00:13:57.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintain your strong faith
by reading God’s Word every day

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and applying its counsel
in everything that you do.

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:02.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We endure in the race with courage

00:14:02.904 --> 00:14:06.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when our faith is strong.

00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:09.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the second quality
we will now look at

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:13.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—courage, why we need courage to win.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:18.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians have courage
that stems from their faith.

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:20.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live with hope, with expectation

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:23.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just any expectation

00:14:23.258 --> 00:14:27.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “assured expectation,”
as the Scriptures call it.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When your rescue is assured,
it gives you courage, doesn’t it?

00:14:31.474 --> 00:14:34.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how Jeremiah felt when Ebed-melech

00:14:34.769 --> 00:14:39.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 30 other men arrived
to pull him up out of a deep cistern.

00:14:39.232 --> 00:14:44.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could have seemed hopeless
was now a moment filled with hope,

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:47.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued on with courage.

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:50.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage moves us
to look beyond any obstacles

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may stand
between us and the finish line.

00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:59.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that nothing promised
in God’s Word will fail to come true.

00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:01.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take courage.

00:15:01.045 --> 00:15:04.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
that your determination to do God’s will

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:07.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that for you the prize will be waiting.

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cannot lie.

00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:12.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, as you go to your assignments,

00:15:12.474 --> 00:15:16.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remain calm and assured of Jehovah’s help.

00:15:16.478 --> 00:15:19.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, great changes
have taken place in the world

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since you arrived for Gilead School.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But though the world is changing around us

00:15:24.819 --> 00:15:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and certainly not for the better),

00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:29.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember Jehovah’s promises.

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we see happening is temporary.

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:35.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A pandemic—nothing new!

00:15:35.163 --> 00:15:37.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold it
—didn’t he?—

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pestilences,” he called it,
“in one place after another.”

00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:44.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not shaken by this.

00:15:44.339 --> 00:15:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have faith and courage,
and we keep going, don’t we?

00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to the Olympic marathon runner

00:15:51.304 --> 00:15:54.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Tanzania whom we mentioned earlier.

00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:59.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being injured,
he was bandaged and then continued to run.

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took courage and determination to run,

00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:04.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes walk, through the pain.

00:16:04.818 --> 00:16:07.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he eventually crossed the finish line,

00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:10.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was cheered by the small crowd
remaining in the stadium.

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, try to imagine:

00:16:12.742 --> 00:16:17.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was limping
with his bandages blowing in the wind,

00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:20.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:23.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many, the race would have been long over.

00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:27.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that man was running
for something more than a material prize.

00:16:27.882 --> 00:16:31.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw something greater
beyond that finish line.

00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find it in what he said afterward.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was asked
why he continued on in the race, he replied:

00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:46.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My country did not send me
5,000 miles to start the race.

00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:51.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.”

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:53.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sense of responsibility

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave him the courage
to go on despite the pain.

00:16:57.287 --> 00:17:01.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw a greater purpose,
and he returned home with honor.

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:04.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too have a greater responsibility

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:07.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a far more important race.

00:17:07.672 --> 00:17:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We owe it to Jehovah
to keep running the Christian course.

00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:15.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his Son gave everything,

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:18.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say, so that we can keep running.

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:23.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also owe it to others
to set a good example for them

00:17:23.021 --> 00:17:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will motivate them never to give up.

00:17:25.773 --> 00:17:30.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we owe it to ourselves
to use what we have been given

00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:35.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to run in a way
that we gain the real life.

00:17:35.116 --> 00:17:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are certain
that you have both the faith and the courage

00:17:39.787 --> 00:17:42.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run with the eyes of your heart

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:47.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking intently at Jesus’ example
and at the prize.

00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:50.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review, what is the overall lesson

00:17:50.381 --> 00:17:54.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you Gilead graduates and, really,
for every Christian runner?

00:17:54.177 --> 00:17:59.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is this: Run for the real life
at your very best pace

00:17:59.182 --> 00:18:01.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Jehovah will help you),

00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal,

00:18:05.688 --> 00:18:10.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and run the course
with faith and with courage.

00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will the finish line be reached?

00:18:13.196 --> 00:18:15.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who will live forever on earth,

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:19.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Revelation Climax</i>  book
states this in chapter 11:

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By exercising faith
throughout Jesus’ Millennial Reign

00:18:24.415 --> 00:18:27.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and during the decisive test that follows,

00:18:27.502 --> 00:18:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“these will be rewarded
with life everlasting in Paradise on earth.

00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their names
will then remain indelibly written

00:18:35.843 --> 00:18:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.”

00:18:38.846 --> 00:18:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For true servants of God,
that “decisive test” will be nothing to fear.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will never drop out of the race.

00:18:45.853 --> 00:18:49.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For them, that test will be just another day
on the calendar, so to speak.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will keep going

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their eyes fixed
on what is ahead for them.

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:59.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith, courage, and all other godly qualities

00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:03.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will carry loyal ones into the real life.

00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:07.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use your Gilead training
to run the race well.

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:10.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthen others to do the same.

00:19:10.211 --> 00:19:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See the prize ahead of you.

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:15.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And follow Jesus’ steps closely.

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:18.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
through the approaching great tribulation,

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then keep running like a true Christian.

00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:29.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the circumstances, the students
have already received their diplomas.

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:32.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know you would like to see them

00:19:32.275 --> 00:19:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear where they are being assigned.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m happy to have
Brother Ronald Curzan with me.

00:19:39.574 --> 00:19:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He serves as a helper
to the Teaching Committee.

00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why am I happy?

00:19:44.912 --> 00:19:47.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s going to pronounce

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:50.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the students’ names for me

00:19:50.668 --> 00:19:52.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let us know their assignments.

00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:57.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and person by person.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would you like to see all 25
of these happy graduates together?

There they are.

00:22:23.487 --> 00:22:25.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can just imagine the applause

from all of your individual apartments
and homes out there.

00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:33.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ron Curzan is still with us,

and that is because we are going to have
a letter read from the class.

00:22:38.753 --> 00:22:42.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since he already knows
how to pronounce the brother’s name,

I’m going to let Ron introduce him again.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The class letter will be read
by Brother Phongsri.

00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:45.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We take all these memories

“on to our assignments,

00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:50.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we are determined

“to follow your examples

“to our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

“Your brothers and sisters,

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:07.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 149th Class of Gilead.”

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for the beautiful sentiments
expressed in that class letter.

00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were truly heartfelt.

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:20.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I concluded my opening comments

00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:24.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.

00:27:24.038 --> 00:27:28.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In part, it said:
“Remember that it is Jehovah your God

00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:31.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gives power to you.”

00:27:32.546 --> 00:27:36.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have had five months
of wonderful instruction.

00:27:36.175 --> 00:27:38.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have learned so much

00:27:38.177 --> 00:27:41.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you likely
did not fully appreciate before.

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:47.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been elevated personally
by this experience.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has improved your knowledge of God’s Word.

00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:55.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have already noticed
that your Christian personality

00:27:55.402 --> 00:27:59.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has developed even further
than when you came.

00:27:59.698 --> 00:28:02.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But always remember:

00:28:02.117 --> 00:28:07.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gifts you have attained
are not by your own power and strength.

00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me

00:28:11.293 --> 00:28:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:29-31.

00:28:20.094 --> 00:28:22.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought of a source of power

00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:26.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is woven throughout the Scriptures.

00:28:26.267 --> 00:28:31.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 28 is speaking about Jehovah,
the Creator of the ends of the earth.

00:28:32.273 --> 00:28:37.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s now read chapter 40, verse 29:

00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:41.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“He gives power to the tired one

00:28:41.824 --> 00:28:45.619 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and full might to those lacking strength.”

00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m old and tired.

00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:55.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah going to infuse me
with physical power and strength?

00:28:57.006 --> 00:29:00.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t complain if he chose to do so,

00:29:00.593 --> 00:29:04.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that is not the kind of power
being discussed.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not physical power.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we know it isn’t?

00:29:10.352 --> 00:29:12.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 30.

00:29:12.688 --> 00:29:16.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says, even boys and young men
get tired physically.

00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:18.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 30 says:

00:29:18.944 --> 00:29:23.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Boys will tire out and grow weary,

00:29:23.574 --> 00:29:26.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and young men will stumble and fall.”

00:29:28.537 --> 00:29:30.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, what kind of power

00:29:30.581 --> 00:29:34.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can we expect from Jehovah
according to these verses?

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:40.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s power to reinvigorate us spiritually.

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:44.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power to help us carry out
our theocratic activities

00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:48.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the extent our physical strength allows.

00:29:48.182 --> 00:29:52.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the power to endure the trials of life.

00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:54.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, verse 31:

00:29:54.146 --> 00:29:57.066 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“But those hoping in Jehovah

00:29:57.066 --> 00:29:59.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“will regain power.

00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:02.780 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“They will run and not grow weary;

00:30:05.157 --> 00:30:08.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they will walk and not tire out.”

00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:13.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that verse, hope and power

00:30:13.832 --> 00:30:16.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are linked together.

00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:20.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By hoping in Jehovah
and depending on his strength,

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can soar like an eagle

00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:25.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
far above the challenges we face.

00:30:25.511 --> 00:30:28.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can accomplish
the assignments we are given.

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t sure
if I could complete this assignment

00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:36.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the chairman of Gilead graduation.

00:30:36.438 --> 00:30:40.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here we are
at the last part of the program.

00:30:40.651 --> 00:30:43.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider with me a final Scriptural thought

00:30:43.779 --> 00:30:46.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Romans 15:13.

00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:55.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, too, hope and power
are linked together.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can consider this as our prayer for you,

00:30:58.836 --> 00:31:03.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 25 graduates of the 149th class.

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:06.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13:

00:31:06.385 --> 00:31:10.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:31:10.973 --> 00:31:13.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“fill you with all joy and peace

00:31:13.517 --> 00:31:15.978 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“by your trusting in him,

00:31:15.978 --> 00:31:18.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“so that you may abound in hope

00:31:18.564 --> 00:31:21.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with power of holy spirit.”

00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:28.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust absolutely in Jehovah
and not in yourself.

00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:30.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do so, the verse said

00:31:30.367 --> 00:31:33.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will “abound in hope

00:31:33.078 --> 00:31:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with power of holy spirit.”

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:41.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Holy spirit reminds us
of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:31:41.503 --> 00:31:43.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it a project to work

00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:47.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on each of the nine aspects of the spirit

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:52.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned in Galatians 5:22, 23.

00:31:54.683 --> 00:31:56.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love all of you.

00:31:57.728 --> 00:32:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m still open to Romans 15.

00:32:01.231 --> 00:32:03.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My concluding comment to you

00:32:03.442 --> 00:32:07.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the 33rd verse:

00:32:07.446 --> 00:32:11.241 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“May the God who gives peace

00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:13.786 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“be with all of you.

00:32:13.786 --> 00:32:15.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Amen.”

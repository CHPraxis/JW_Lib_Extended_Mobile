00:00:01 With those lyrics ringing in our ears,
00:00:03 it puts us in the mind for the next talk
00:00:05 to be delivered by Brother Kenneth Cook.
00:00:09 The title is “Look Beyond the Finish Line.”
00:00:13 Brother Cook, you have piqued our interest.
00:00:18 You have completed your Gilead schooling.
00:00:21 You’ve done well, and we warmly commend you.
00:00:25 You’ve reached the finish line for this school.
00:00:28 When the program concludes, you will be a graduate.
00:00:32 You’ve run this course, so to speak,
00:00:34 with that goal in mind, haven’t you?
00:00:36 Yet, through it all, you’ve also kept in mind that,
00:00:39 for you, this experience is a part of a bigger race
00:00:44 —the race for life.
00:00:46 Like determined runners,
00:00:48 loyal servants of God keep moving forward
00:00:51 after each goal in their service to him.
00:00:54 Such goals are like stages in a race.
00:00:58 Some of our goals and our pace may vary
00:01:01 from person to person based on circumstances.
00:01:04 For you, Gilead School
00:01:07 is a goal, or stage, that you have now completed.
00:01:10 But keep running!
00:01:13 See, we run until we reach what our faith shows us,
00:01:16 the prize waiting beyond the ultimate finish line
00:01:20 —everlasting life in the service of Jehovah.
00:01:24 The promises found in God’s Word
00:01:27 move us to keep reaching out for that prize.
00:01:31 Consider the apostle Paul, who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.
00:01:35 At 2 Timothy 4:7, 8,
00:01:38 he indicated that he had reached the finish line.
00:01:41 His prize was in sight, and it was reserved for him.
00:01:44 He said: “I have fought the fine fight,
00:01:47 “I have run the race to the finish, I have observed the faith.
00:01:52 “From this time on, there is reserved for me
00:01:55 the crown of righteousness.”
00:01:58 With strong faith, Paul could see beyond the finish line
00:02:03 and he yearned for the reward that he would receive.
00:02:07 And then there is Jesus’ example.
00:02:10 Just before breathing his last,
00:02:13 he cried out: “It has been accomplished!”
00:02:17 Throughout his earthly ministry,
00:02:19 that goal to accomplish Jehovah’s will for him
00:02:22 never left his sight.
00:02:24 No matter how painful his life course proved to be,
00:02:28 Jesus kept his integrity and finished that course,
00:02:33 like the true Son of God that he is.
00:02:36 In all of this, Jesus saw more than just the finish line.
00:02:40 He saw the endless joy that was waiting for him.
00:02:44 So powerful is Jesus’ example
00:02:47 that Hebrews 12:2 urges us
00:02:50 to keep it centered in our sight.
00:02:53 We invite you to follow along there with Hebrews 12:2.
00:02:58 It says: “. . . as we look intently
00:03:02 “at the Chief Agent and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.
00:03:07 “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake,
00:03:11 “despising shame, and has sat down
00:03:14 at the right hand of the throne of God.”
00:03:18 Who are we urged to look at intently?
00:03:21 The “Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”
00:03:24 And what did Jesus look at?
00:03:26 What did he see?
00:03:27 He saw the joy that his faith placed directly in front of him.
00:03:32 Jesus focused on the joy that would result
00:03:36 from his life course of perfect integrity,
00:03:39 from providing the ransom for us,
00:03:43 and from being back alongside his heavenly Father.
00:03:47 Jesus never took his eyes off the prize waiting beyond the finish line,
00:03:52 and neither should we.
00:03:54 Let’s look at some important lessons
00:03:56 that will help all of us to complete the race for life.
00:03:59 We will consider two main points:
00:04:02 first, how should you run each stage of the race?
00:04:06 and, second, qualities that will help you
00:04:10 to run like a true Christian and win.
00:04:14 Now, for the first point: How should you run each stage of the race?
00:04:18 The race for life is a race of endurance,
00:04:21 and as mentioned, it includes stages, or successive goals.
00:04:25 We strive for each goal at our individual best pace
00:04:29 and with a clear focus on the ultimate goal, or prize.
00:04:33 First Timothy 6:19
00:04:36 calls that prize “the real life”
00:04:39 —that is, everlasting life in perfection,
00:04:42 either in heaven or on earth.
00:04:45 As mentioned, your Gilead training
00:04:47 is now a completed stage of the race for you.
00:04:50 With humility, apply all that you have learned
00:04:54 and remain focused on the endless joy ahead of you.
00:04:58 When hardships and difficulties come
00:05:01 —and they will— keep moving forward.
00:05:05 If you are knocked down by anything,
00:05:07 get back up and run with determination,
00:05:10 with everything that you’ve got.
00:05:13 Be like the marathon runner from the country of Tanzania
00:05:17 who ran in the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico City.
00:05:22 At one point during that race, he was bumped by other runners,
00:05:26 and he fell to the ground so hard
00:05:28 that he gashed his knee and dislocated it.
00:05:31 He also smashed his shoulder against the pavement.
00:05:35 Yet, after receiving some medical attention,
00:05:38 he refused to stop running.
00:05:41 He continued in the race.
00:05:43 His pace was slower, but he moved forward toward his goal.
00:05:48 He was no longer running for a mere material prize.
00:05:51 He was running to complete the race
00:05:53 with his honor intact and that of the land he represented.
00:05:57 He finished the race.
00:05:59 In the race for life,
00:06:01 you may experience times when you feel as if someone or something
00:06:05 is trying to knock you down.
00:06:07 What will you do?
00:06:09 Learn from what happened to the Galatians.
00:06:13 When some in the first century allowed the speech and actions of others
00:06:17 to knock them out of the race, notice what Paul said to them
00:06:21 at Galatians 5:7, 8.
00:06:25 Imagine that he has an incredulous tone
00:06:29 as he speaks to them and states in verse 7:
00:06:33 “You were running well.
00:06:35 “Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth?
00:06:39 This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you.”
00:06:44 What was the problem?
00:06:46 Some in Galatia had allowed themselves
00:06:49 to be persuaded by false teachings,
00:06:52 and they were no longer obeying the truth.
00:06:55 They gave in to pressure.
00:06:57 Also, in verse 13,
00:07:00 Paul refers to the danger of “fleshly desires.”
00:07:04 Whatever happened to them,
00:07:06 those Christian runners were “hindered,”
00:07:09 as he said, because they took their eyes off of the prize.
00:07:13 All of us must keep that lesson in front of us.
00:07:16 If we do, we will never be hindered or thrown off course
00:07:20 in our pursuit of the real life.
00:07:23 We will be rock solid in our focus.
00:07:28 When others see that you are looking straight ahead toward the prize,
00:07:32 they’re helped to look in the same direction.
00:07:35 Continue to be a real stabilizing influence
00:07:39 in the branches where you will serve.
00:07:41 So for our first point, how should you run each stage of the race?
00:07:46 Run at your very best pace
00:07:48 and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal
00:07:51 —the real life.
00:07:53 Now, for our second main point:
00:07:56 qualities that will help you
00:07:58 to run like a true Christian and win.
00:08:02 We run as true Christians
00:08:05 when we follow the example of Christ.
00:08:08 Jesus’ example of doing all things for Jehovah’s glory,
00:08:11 despite the suffering that he endured,
00:08:14 is one that we must follow.
00:08:17 First Peter 2:21 reminds us
00:08:19 that “Christ suffered for you,
00:08:22 leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.”
00:08:27 Let’s consider two qualities
00:08:29 that Jesus had in abundance and that we must imitate closely
00:08:33 —faith and courage.
00:08:36 For each quality, we will look at why we need it to win.
00:08:41 So we begin with faith.
00:08:43 Now, you do not need to be told what faith is.
00:08:47 You have it, and you’ve learned much about examples of faith in your studies.
00:08:52 We need faith because faith helps us to endure,
00:08:55 and faith helps us to remember
00:08:57 that our trials in life are temporary.
00:09:00 We look ahead with confidence,
00:09:02 we see beyond the troubles of today,
00:09:05 and we trust Jehovah every step of the way.
00:09:09 You needed to have faith after you arrived for this school
00:09:13 and then had to wait patiently for some months for your classes to begin.
00:09:18 True?
00:09:19 You no doubt wondered: ‘When will the classes start?
00:09:22 How will they be carried out in a pandemic?’
00:09:25 You waited, and in due time your faith was rewarded.
00:09:29 Jehovah saw to it that things worked out, didn’t he?
00:09:32 Your instructors and so many others working with them
00:09:36 ensured that the school moved forward safely
00:09:39 and that you received the full benefit from the classes.
00:09:44 That experience highlights the kind of faith
00:09:47 that all of us will need in the days ahead
00:09:49 whenever new challenges arise.
00:09:52 You could say that 20/20 vision will be necessary
00:09:56 for each of us to keep running successfully.
00:09:58 And I don’t mean the year 2020.
00:10:01 True Christians look far ahead with clear,
00:10:04 spiritual vision —that’s the point—
00:10:07 and remain focused on the prize beyond the finish line.
00:10:11 Those without faith cannot see it.
00:10:14 They cannot focus on things unseen.
00:10:17 But those with faith can see it.
00:10:21 That is why they —why you—
00:10:23 remain focused on Jehovah’s promises.
00:10:27 The Scriptures urge us to keep looking ahead.
00:10:30 An example of this is found
00:10:32 at 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18
00:10:38 —2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.
00:10:41 Now, when writing these inspired words,
00:10:44 Paul was encouraging the brothers
00:10:46 not to allow problems, difficulties, and persecutions
00:10:50 to cloud or block their view
00:10:52 of the glorious reward that was set before them.
00:10:55 Please look at what is said starting in verse 17:
00:10:59 “For though the tribulation is momentary and light,
00:11:03 “it works out for us a glory
00:11:06 “that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting;
00:11:11 “while we keep our eyes,
00:11:13 “not on the things seen, but on the things unseen.
00:11:17 “For the things seen are temporary,
00:11:20 but the things unseen are everlasting.”
00:11:24 Again, these inspired words
00:11:27 should move us to look beyond the trials we face
00:11:31 and to remain focused on what is ahead of us.
00:11:35 Paul was speaking to those with the heavenly hope.
00:11:38 But the encouragement and meaning behind these words
00:11:42 apply to all who are running for the real life,
00:11:46 that is, for the things “everlasting,”
00:11:49 as it says here.
00:11:51 When we are determined and focused,
00:11:54 we are helped to press on each day.
00:11:57 Proverbs 4:25 tells us to “look straight ahead . . . ,
00:12:01 fix [your eyes or] your gaze straight ahead of you.”
00:12:05 To keep doing that, we need faith.
00:12:09 We need good spiritual eyesight to see
00:12:11 what is otherwise “unseen,” as Paul said.
00:12:14 Keep in mind that the objective of your Gilead training
00:12:18 is to strengthen and stabilize the field and branch organization.
00:12:22 Whether a brother or sister,
00:12:25 your example of faith goes a long way in doing that.
00:12:29 Others will imitate the faith and example of a determined runner.
00:12:34 When you are settled in your assignments,
00:12:37 keep your eyes of faith set on doing God’s will.
00:12:41 Danger can come when you start to feel
00:12:44 that you’ve achieved most or even all of your goals.
00:12:47 What could be the result?
00:12:49 When we lose sight of the race and of its prize,
00:12:53 our interests will focus on other things,
00:12:57 perhaps material things.
00:12:59 Don’t let this happen to you.
00:13:01 Never allow distractions to pull you off of the Christian course,
00:13:05 and avoid ever becoming self-satisfied
00:13:08 because of privileges that you may come to enjoy.
00:13:12 Focus on the real life, and remain humble.
00:13:17 Appreciate your privileges in Jehovah’s service,
00:13:20 but remain focused on what you desire most
00:13:24 —pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever.
00:13:27 As we read earlier in Hebrews chapter 12,
00:13:31 when Jesus suffered unjustly to the point of death,
00:13:34 he endured “for the joy that was set before him.”
00:13:39 He always looked at what was ahead of him.
00:13:41 The reward that he longed for was clear to him.
00:13:45 It was that real to him.
00:13:48 We must always remember Jesus’ example as we keep looking ahead.
00:13:52 Maintain your strong faith by reading God’s Word every day
00:13:57 and applying its counsel in everything that you do.
00:14:00 We endure in the race with courage
00:14:02 when our faith is strong.
00:14:06 And that is the second quality we will now look at
00:14:09 —courage, why we need courage to win.
00:14:13 True Christians have courage that stems from their faith.
00:14:18 We live with hope, with expectation
00:14:20 —and not just any expectation
00:14:23 but “assured expectation,” as the Scriptures call it.
00:14:27 When your rescue is assured, it gives you courage, doesn’t it?
00:14:31 Imagine how Jeremiah felt when Ebed-melech
00:14:34 and 30 other men arrived to pull him up out of a deep cistern.
00:14:39 What could have seemed hopeless was now a moment filled with hope,
00:14:44 and he continued on with courage.
00:14:47 Courage moves us to look beyond any obstacles
00:14:50 that may stand between us and the finish line.
00:14:54 The fact is that nothing promised in God’s Word will fail to come true.
00:14:59 So take courage.
00:15:01 Keep in mind that your determination to do God’s will
00:15:04 means that for you the prize will be waiting.
00:15:07 Jehovah cannot lie.
00:15:10 Therefore, as you go to your assignments,
00:15:12 remain calm and assured of Jehovah’s help.
00:15:16 True, great changes have taken place in the world
00:15:19 since you arrived for Gilead School.
00:15:22 But though the world is changing around us
00:15:24 (and certainly not for the better),
00:15:27 remember Jehovah’s promises.
00:15:29 What we see happening is temporary.
00:15:32 A pandemic—nothing new!
00:15:35 Jesus foretold it —didn’t he?—
00:15:37 “pestilences,” he called it, “in one place after another.”
00:15:42 So we’re not shaken by this.
00:15:44 We have faith and courage, and we keep going, don’t we?
00:15:48 Think back to the Olympic marathon runner
00:15:51 from Tanzania whom we mentioned earlier.
00:15:54 After being injured, he was bandaged and then continued to run.
00:15:59 It took courage and determination to run,
00:16:02 and sometimes walk, through the pain.
00:16:04 When he eventually crossed the finish line,
00:16:07 he was cheered by the small crowd remaining in the stadium.
00:16:10 Now, try to imagine:
00:16:12 He was limping with his bandages blowing in the wind,
00:16:17 but he moved forward toward his goal.
00:16:20 For many, the race would have been long over.
00:16:23 But that man was running for something more than a material prize.
00:16:27 He saw something greater beyond that finish line.
00:16:31 What was it?
00:16:33 We find it in what he said afterward.
00:16:37 When he was asked why he continued on in the race, he replied:
00:16:41 “My country did not send me
5,000 miles to start the race.
00:16:46 They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.”
00:16:51 That sense of responsibility
00:16:53 gave him the courage to go on despite the pain.
00:16:57 He saw a greater purpose, and he returned home with honor.
00:17:01 We too have a greater responsibility
00:17:04 and a far more important race.
00:17:07 We owe it to Jehovah to keep running the Christian course.
00:17:12 He and his Son gave everything,
00:17:15 you could say, so that we can keep running.
00:17:18 We also owe it to others to set a good example for them
00:17:23 that will motivate them never to give up.
00:17:25 And we owe it to ourselves to use what we have been given
00:17:30 so as to run in a way that we gain the real life.
00:17:35 We are certain that you have both the faith and the courage
00:17:39 to run with the eyes of your heart
00:17:42 looking intently at Jesus’ example and at the prize.
00:17:47 So in review, what is the overall lesson
00:17:50 for you Gilead graduates and, really, for every Christian runner?
00:17:54 It is this: Run for the real life at your very best pace
00:17:59 (Jehovah will help you),
00:18:01 run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal,
00:18:05 and run the course with faith and with courage.
00:18:10 When will the finish line be reached?
00:18:13 For those who will live forever on earth,
00:18:15 the Revelation Climax  book states this in chapter 11:
00:18:19 “By exercising faith throughout Jesus’ Millennial Reign
00:18:24 “and during the decisive test that follows,
00:18:27 “these will be rewarded with life everlasting in Paradise on earth.
00:18:32 “Their names will then remain indelibly written
00:18:35 in the book of life.”
00:18:38 For true servants of God, that “decisive test” will be nothing to fear.
00:18:43 They will never drop out of the race.
00:18:45 For them, that test will be just another day on the calendar, so to speak.
00:18:49 They will keep going
00:18:51 with their eyes fixed on what is ahead for them.
00:18:55 Faith, courage, and all other godly qualities
00:18:59 will carry loyal ones into the real life.
00:19:03 Use your Gilead training to run the race well.
00:19:07 Strengthen others to do the same.
00:19:10 See the prize ahead of you.
00:19:12 And follow Jesus’ steps closely.
00:19:15 Run the race through the approaching great tribulation,
00:19:18 and then keep running like a true Christian.
00:19:24 Because of the circumstances, the students have already received their diplomas.
00:19:29 But we know you would like to see them
00:19:32 and hear where they are being assigned.
00:19:35 So I’m happy to have Brother Ronald Curzan with me.
00:19:39 He serves as a helper to the Teaching Committee.
00:19:42 And why am I happy?
00:19:44 Because he’s going to pronounce
00:19:47 all the students’ names for me
00:19:50 and let us know their assignments.
00:19:52 Brother Curzan, we are waiting on you.
00:19:59 Brother and Sister James
00:20:01 will be returning to Trinidad and Tobago.
00:20:08 Brother Kasambala will be returning to Malawi.

00:22:01 Thank you, Brother Curzan.
00:22:03 Well, we have seen them couple by couple
00:22:07 and person by person.
00:22:10 But would you like to see all 25 of these happy graduates together?
00:22:17 There they are.
00:22:23 We can just imagine the applause
00:22:25 from all of your individual apartments and homes out there.
00:22:31 Ron Curzan is still with us,
00:22:33 and that is because we are going to have a letter read from the class.
00:22:38 And since he already knows how to pronounce the brother’s name,
00:22:43 I’m going to let Ron introduce him again.
00:22:49 The class letter will be read by Brother Phongsri.
00:22:55 “To the Governing Body and the Bethel family:
00:23:02 “We were so excited when we received our invitations
00:23:06 “to attend the 149th class of Gilead.
00:23:10 “However, when it was announced
00:23:12 “that the 149th class would be postponed,
00:23:17 “anxiety filled our hearts
00:23:20 “as to what our future would be.
00:23:24 “To help in allaying this anxiety,
00:23:27 “the Governing Body made loving decisions
00:23:31 “to comfort us.
00:23:33 “We never felt abandoned or forgotten.
00:23:38 “One thing we were absolutely confident of
00:23:42 “was that the Governing Body would do all they could
00:23:47 “to make sure we had the class!
00:23:51 “We are ever thankful for the Bethel family
00:23:55 “who warmly welcomed us
00:23:57 “into their hearts and their home.
00:24:01 “It seemed every day someone would ask:
00:24:04 “‘Do you need anything?’ or ‘How can I help you?’
00:24:09 “We have observed this beautiful, obedient Bethel family
00:24:13 “and have learned a lot, especially how to show personal interest
00:24:18 “in concrete ways during difficult times.
00:24:23 “We can say that we had practical lessons
00:24:26 “in endurance, love,
00:24:29 “concern for others, trust in Jehovah,
00:24:33 “obedience, and shepherding.
00:24:37 “This is an example
00:24:40 “that we will take with us in our hearts
00:24:44 “and try to reflect in our dealings with others.
00:24:50 “Once the school started, we could see Jehovah’s hand in the arrangements
00:24:55 “and how the brothers taking the lead trusted in Jehovah
00:24:59 “and the arrangements he had in place.
00:25:03 “As one of our first lessons,
00:25:06 “we want to follow their fine example
00:25:09 “in showing trust in Jehovah
00:25:12 “for whatever lies ahead.
00:25:16 “We were touched by the sincerity
00:25:20 “of our instructors, ‘gifts in men,’
00:25:24 “who helped us to broaden and improve
00:25:28 “our understanding of the Scriptures.
00:25:33 “It is our heartfelt desire
00:25:36 “to do as the psalmist sang
00:25:39 “at Psalm 105:1:
00:25:43 “‘Give thanks to Jehovah,
00:25:46 “‘call on his name,
00:25:49 “make his deeds known among the peoples!’
00:25:53 “Yes, we want to share what we have learned
00:25:58 “with humble hearts,
00:26:00 “all to the praise of our Grand Instructor,
00:26:03 “Jehovah God.
00:26:06 “More than that, we are determined to use all that we have learned
00:26:10 “to continue to grow spiritually
00:26:13 “and be used in whatever way Jehovah decides to use us.
00:26:21 “All that we experienced during our time here
00:26:25 “makes us appreciate
00:26:27 “our loving worldwide brotherhood all the more
00:26:31 “and continues to give us insight
00:26:34 “into what it will be like to live together
00:26:38 “in Jehovah’s new world.
00:26:40 “We take all these memories and lessons we learned here
00:26:45 “on to our assignments,
00:26:48 “and we are determined
00:26:50 “to follow your examples
00:26:54 “in bringing honor and glory
00:26:56 “to our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:27:01 “Your brothers and sisters,
00:27:04 the 149th Class of Gilead.”
00:27:09 Thank you for the beautiful sentiments expressed in that class letter.
00:27:13 They were truly heartfelt.
00:27:18 I concluded my opening comments
00:27:20 with Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.
00:27:24 In part, it said: “Remember that it is Jehovah your God
00:27:28 who gives power to you.”
00:27:32 You have had five months of wonderful instruction.
00:27:36 You have learned so much
00:27:38 that you likely did not fully appreciate before.
00:27:43 You have been elevated personally by this experience.
00:27:47 It has improved your knowledge of God’s Word.
00:27:51 You may have already noticed that your Christian personality
00:27:55 has developed even further than when you came.
00:27:59 But always remember:
00:28:02 The gifts you have attained are not by your own power and strength.
00:28:09 Please find with me
00:28:11 Isaiah 40:29-31.
00:28:20 The thought of a source of power
00:28:22 is woven throughout the Scriptures.
00:28:26 Verse 28 is speaking about Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth.
00:28:32 But let’s now read chapter 40, verse 29:
00:28:37 “He gives power to the tired one
00:28:41 and full might to those lacking strength.”
00:28:47 I’m old and tired.
00:28:51 Is Jehovah going to infuse me with physical power and strength?
00:28:57 I wouldn’t complain if he chose to do so,
00:29:00 but that is not the kind of power being discussed.
00:29:04 It’s not physical power.
00:29:08 Well, how do we know it isn’t?
00:29:10 Look at verse 30.
00:29:12 It says, even boys and young men get tired physically.
00:29:16 Verse 30 says:
00:29:18 “Boys will tire out and grow weary,
00:29:23 and young men will stumble and fall.”
00:29:28 So then, what kind of power
00:29:30 can we expect from Jehovah according to these verses?
00:29:35 It’s power to reinvigorate us spiritually.
00:29:40 The power to help us carry out our theocratic activities
00:29:44 to the extent our physical strength allows.
00:29:48 It’s the power to endure the trials of life.
00:29:52 Now, verse 31:
00:29:54 “But those hoping in Jehovah
00:29:57 “will regain power.
00:29:59 “They will soar on wings like eagles.
00:30:02 “They will run and not grow weary;
00:30:05 they will walk and not tire out.”
00:30:10 In that verse, hope and power
00:30:13 are linked together.
00:30:16 By hoping in Jehovah and depending on his strength,
00:30:20 we can soar like an eagle
00:30:22 far above the challenges we face.
00:30:25 We can accomplish the assignments we are given.
00:30:30 I wasn’t sure if I could complete this assignment
00:30:32 as the chairman of Gilead graduation.
00:30:36 But here we are at the last part of the program.
00:30:40 Consider with me a final Scriptural thought
00:30:43 —Romans 15:13.
00:30:50 Here, too, hope and power are linked together.
00:30:55 We can consider this as our prayer for you,
00:30:58 the 25 graduates of the 149th class.
00:31:04 Verse 13:
00:31:06 “May the God who gives hope
00:31:10 “fill you with all joy and peace
00:31:13 “by your trusting in him,
00:31:15 “so that you may abound in hope
00:31:18 with power of holy spirit.”
00:31:24 Trust absolutely in Jehovah and not in yourself.
00:31:28 If you do so, the verse said
00:31:30 you will “abound in hope
00:31:33 with power of holy spirit.”
00:31:37 Holy spirit reminds us of the fruitage of the spirit.
00:31:41 Make it a project to work
00:31:43 on each of the nine aspects of the spirit
00:31:47 mentioned in Galatians 5:22, 23.
00:31:54 We love all of you.
00:31:57 I’m still open to Romans 15.
00:32:01 My concluding comment to you
00:32:03 is in the 33rd verse:
00:32:07 “May the God who gives peace
00:32:11 “be with all of you.
00:32:13 Amen.”

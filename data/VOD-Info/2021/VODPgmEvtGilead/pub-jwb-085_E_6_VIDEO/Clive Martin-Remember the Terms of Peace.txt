00:00:01 Have you ever had to sue for peace?
00:00:05 While you’re thinking of that question,
00:00:07 would you please turn with me to Luke chapter 14?
00:00:12 I’d like to put you and me
00:00:14 in the middle of one of Jesus’ illustrations.
00:00:17 Jesus has been talking about what it costs
00:00:20 to become one of his disciples.
00:00:23 And then in verse 31, he says:
00:00:26 “Or what king
00:00:29 “[this is where we come in, what king]
00:00:32 “marching out against another king in war
00:00:34 “does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with 10,000 troops
00:00:39 “to stand up to the one who comes against him with 20,000?
00:00:44 “If, in fact, he cannot do so,
00:00:46 “then while that one is yet far away,
00:00:50 he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace.”
00:00:56 How do you think that conversation goes?
00:01:00 “I want peace, and these are my terms.”
00:01:04 Hardly!
00:01:07 It’s more like: “I don’t want to be your enemy.
00:01:10 Please tell me what to do so that I can have peace with you.”
00:01:16 Now, with that in mind, Jesus gives the application, verse 33:
00:01:21 “In the same way, you may be sure that not one of you
00:01:25 “who does not say good-bye to all his belongings
00:01:29 can be my disciple.”
00:01:32 That is you and me.
00:01:34 We got to the point where we realized
00:01:37 we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.
00:01:39 And so we were willing to sacrifice everything
00:01:43 —belongings, career, status, everything—
00:01:47 for the privilege of being at peace with Jehovah
00:01:50 and being a disciple of his Son.
00:01:53 Now for you students of class 150,
00:01:56 your pursuit of peace with Jehovah
00:01:59 has led you into the special full-time service.
00:02:02 And what a beautiful record every one of you has set!
00:02:07 You remind me in many ways
00:02:10 of a group in the Bible
00:02:12 that literally sued for peace.
00:02:15 Their story is told in the book of Joshua chapter 9.
00:02:19 That’s right; we’re talking about the Gibeonites.
00:02:23 Do you have Joshua chapter 9?
00:02:26 Now, they had heard of all the things that Jehovah had done
00:02:30 for his people, Israel, and to his enemies.
00:02:34 They did not want to be Jehovah’s enemy.
00:02:36 And so they did exactly what the king in Jesus’ illustration did.
00:02:41 They sent a body of ambassadors.
00:02:44 So Joshua chapter 9
00:02:47 —and this is the opening overture
00:02:51 in verse 6:
00:02:54 “We have come from a distant land.
00:02:57 Now make a covenant with us.”
00:03:01 When they didn’t get a very warm initial reception, they persisted.
00:03:06 Verse 8: “We are your servants.”
00:03:09 In other words, “Set the terms; we want peace.”
00:03:14 They were willing to sacrifice everything
00:03:18 in order to enjoy peace with Israel and with Israel’s God.
00:03:23 Now, Joshua and the chieftains didn’t see it exactly the same way,
00:03:27 particularly when they found out
00:03:29 that they were not from a distant land as they had claimed.
00:03:32 Nobody likes to be fooled.
00:03:34 So the tone got a little sterner.
00:03:37 So turn and look at verse 23.
00:03:41 This is what they said: “From now on you are cursed,
00:03:44 “and you will always occupy a slave’s position
00:03:47 as gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”
00:03:53 What will the Gibeonites say to that?
00:03:56 Verse 25: “We are at your mercy.
00:04:00 Do to us whatever you think is good and right.”
00:04:06 And just so, the terms of peace were set.
00:04:10 Verse 27: “That day Joshua made them
00:04:14 “gatherers of wood and drawers of water
00:04:16 “for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar
00:04:19 “at the place that He should choose,
00:04:21 and they remain so to this day.”
00:04:25 So now a few questions, a few lessons.
00:04:28 What do you think of the Gibeonites’ assignment?
00:04:33 It was presented to them as a punishment.
00:04:35 But just think,
00:04:37 they weren’t being sold off as household slaves.
00:04:41 Their humble service would directly contribute
00:04:44 to pure worship and support Jehovah’s people.
00:04:50 That’s a privilege, isn’t it?
00:04:52 That’s the kind of service we reach out for as a privilege.
00:04:59 Now, the kind of service—
00:05:01 Was it because they were lowly people,
00:05:04 no skills to do anything else, that they were given this kind of job?
00:05:09 Well, look at chapter 10
00:05:12 and verse 2
00:05:16 and see the kind of people the Gibeonites were:
00:05:18 “Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities.
00:05:22 “It was greater than Ai, and all its men were warriors
00:05:29 [capable, skilled people].”
00:05:31 However,
00:05:34 clearly the Gibeonites realized
00:05:36 that if their army was no match for Israel,
00:05:40 then Jehovah didn’t need them
00:05:42 to bolster his army in order to complete the conquest.
00:05:45 It was better for them
00:05:48 to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do and to do that.
00:05:52 So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.
00:05:57 Does that mean, though, that their skills were irrelevant,
00:06:02 never even considered?
00:06:05 Well, no.
00:06:06 For example, a few hundred years later,
00:06:09 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite
00:06:11 is listed among David’s 30 mighty men.
00:06:15 Different needs call for different skills.
00:06:18 What did Ishmaiah do with his skill?
00:06:22 Well, he humbly defended pure worship and Jehovah’s people.
00:06:27 So the details of the assignment were different,
00:06:30 but the focus was about the same.
00:06:36 Another question: Was this just
00:06:39 a short-term starter assignment?
00:06:41 “Yes, we will do this for now, but once the campaign is over,
00:06:45 we’ll be able to resume our regular place in society.”
00:06:51 Go back to verse 27 of chapter 9.
00:06:55 Remember what Joshua said at this point
00:06:58 when he gave them their assignment?
00:06:59 “They remain so to this day.”
00:07:03 Not only to the day that Joshua wrote these words
00:07:08 but about 900 years later
00:07:11 among the exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem
00:07:16 to restore pure worship there were temple servants,
00:07:20 and likely
00:07:22 this included descendants of the Gibeonites.
00:07:25 Just think, these temple servants
00:07:29 once again were willing to leave behind the life that they’d built up
00:07:33 to make the trek in behalf of pure worship
00:07:37 and take up their duties.
00:07:39 They must have really cherished their assignment
00:07:42 in order to stick to it that way.
00:07:47 So as we’ve talked about them,
00:07:49 have you been noting some personal lessons?
00:07:52 These are the four that come to my mind.
00:07:55 Number one, as with the king
00:07:58 in Jesus’ illustration and the Gibeonites,
00:08:02 peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.
00:08:05 We’re willing to sacrifice anything to enjoy it.
00:08:10 Number two, Jehovah’s terms for us
00:08:14 include humble service
00:08:16 on behalf of pure worship and in support of his people,
00:08:21 and that kind of humble service
00:08:23 we view as the greatest privilege.
00:08:26 Number three, different needs call for different skills,
00:08:31 and that may lead to a change of assignment
00:08:35 for you or for someone else.
00:08:38 Either way, we don’t compete and we don’t compare.
00:08:42 The details of the assignment may be different,
00:08:44 but the focus, or goal, is always the same.
00:08:48 And the fourth one,
00:08:51 we cherish our assignments.
00:08:53 We’re going to stay in them as long as Jehovah allows.
00:08:58 In short, we cherish our assignments;
00:09:02 we love our God.
00:09:04 Peace with Jehovah is a treasure that we will never let go.

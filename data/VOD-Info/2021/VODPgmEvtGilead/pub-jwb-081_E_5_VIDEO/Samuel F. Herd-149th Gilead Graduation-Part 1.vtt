This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a most unique time in world events.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family is fully aware
of what transpired.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since this program

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be broadcast to our global brotherhood,

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let me remind all of you of what transpired.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are well aware
of the unique time in world events

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:31.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a global pandemic!

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes this class so unique?

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A normal class of Gilead
consists of some 50 students.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 149th class is made up of just 25.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your class is abnormal.

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know why.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let me share your experience
with the worldwide brotherhood.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who had been invited
to attend this class of Gilead

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:07.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had begun to arrive at the Watchtower
Educational Center at Patterson, New York.

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:09.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 25 students in this class

00:01:09.753 --> 00:01:14.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:16.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we all know,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was at that time that the coronavirus

00:01:20.263 --> 00:01:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was declared to be a global pandemic.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most travel was shut down.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rest of their classmates could not come.

00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of government restrictions
on educational facilities,

00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 149th class had to be postponed.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:45.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You students were stuck at Patterson,
New York, with no classes in session.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:50.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Commendably, many of you
were able to work remotely

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your home branch office in the interim.

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:57.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, here in New York,

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
government agencies
allowed for educational facilities

00:02:00.436 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to again conduct classes
if physical distancing could be maintained.

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just 25 of you,

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:12.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:17.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have only 25 “abnormal” students

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:19.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will graduate today.

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To clarify,

00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is the number of students

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:29.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes this class “abnormal.”

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:33.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I am told by your instructors
that, individually,

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are very “normal.”

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, they are very impressed
with your spirituality

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your Christian personalities.

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have excelled in your studies
and classroom participation.

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a delight to be with you
on this very special day.

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else, though, makes this
an “abnormal” Gilead graduation?

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were not able to invite
family members and close friends

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be here in person with you
for this exciting event.

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Teaching Committee
made arrangements for you

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tie in a number of these ones

00:03:15.044 --> 00:03:19.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a streamed recording of the program.

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good news is

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the entire program
is being recorded and will be posted

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a future JW Broadcasting monthly program

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of the approved languages.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a few statistics
to share about the 149th class.

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of the 25 students, 8 are married couples;

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
7 are single brothers,

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are 2 single sisters in the class.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess they’re still single.

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All were serving at a Bethel branch facility

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at a remote translation office
before attending school.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:06.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The students are from 14 different countries

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak 29 different languages.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their average age is 41.

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:14.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good age.

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:17.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty-four years ago, I was 41.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their average years 
in full-time service is 20<b>.</b>

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Bible, Gilead referred
to a territory in Israel.

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that name, “Gilead,”

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:35.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was derived from a Hebrew word
that meant “witness heap.”

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the school
was first inaugurated in 1943,

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Gilead” was an appropriate name.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the instructors
described the purpose of the school,

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that it was
“to instill in the students

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a more intense desire
to share in the evangelizing work.”

00:04:55.311 --> 00:04:57.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for decades,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thousands of missionaries were sent out

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:04.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open up new territories around the world.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A “heap of witness” was given
during that period of time.

00:05:09.859 --> 00:05:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in 2011,

00:05:11.961 --> 00:05:15.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
adjusted the specific purpose of Gilead.

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:20.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of focusing on opening up
new territories for preaching,

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the purpose of the curriculum changed.

00:05:24.207 --> 00:05:26.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we mentioned previously,

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this entire class was already serving

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a Bethel facility

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a remote translation office.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The goal of Gilead now

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to bolster such ones so as to strengthen

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize God’s people
in the respective territories

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to which they will be assigned.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, what about the all-important
evangelizing work?

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is assisting
with the “heap of witness” worldwide?

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:04.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s now the focus
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each Branch Committee
selects qualified pioneers

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are willing to be transferred
to another part of the country

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:14.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that needs help with the preaching work.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:20.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By using the large pool
of zealous local pioneers,

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “heap of witness” is still being given

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the need is greater.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:30.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These local ones
are already adapted to the culture,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
climate, and living conditions
in their countries

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, often times,
they already know the language

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where there is the greatest need.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the 25 of you
in this class of Gilead

00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are expected to strengthen

00:06:47.123 --> 00:06:51.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize God’s people
where you are assigned.

00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that entail?

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:57.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For you brothers,

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time, it may mean that you
will be given more responsibility.

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:05.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your training has given you another way

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:08.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stabilize fellow believers
in your assignment.

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this applies to all 25 of you,

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether brothers or sisters.

00:07:15.918 --> 00:07:19.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been elevated while here at Gilead.

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the territory of Gilead,
in the Bible,

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elevation changes dramatically.

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:30.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Jordan Valley,

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gilead was 690 feet,

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:37.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 210 meters below sea level.

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But traveling east
to the domelike mountainous region of Gilead,

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elevation rises

00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to over 3,300 feet,

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:51.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 1,000 meters.

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You students came to Gilead below sea level.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:00.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with daily Bible study and lectures,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have been elevated.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the past five months,
your faith has grown.

00:08:08.604 --> 00:08:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your spirituality has been enhanced.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Christian personality has been refined.

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been elevated.

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be going out to your assignment,

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not so much for a “heap of witness,”

00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as a “heap of example.”

00:08:28.724 --> 00:08:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,

00:08:30.726 --> 00:08:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will strengthen and stabilize

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:36.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those you work with at the branch

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those you associate
with in your congregations.

00:08:43.973 --> 00:08:48.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:58.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never forget that your power and strength,

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your spiritual wealth,

00:09:00.756 --> 00:09:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not originate with you.

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is Jehovah who has made
this transformation in you.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me, Deuteronomy 8:17, 18:

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you should say in your heart,

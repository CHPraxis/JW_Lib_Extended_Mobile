00:00:01 This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead
00:00:04 at a most unique time in world events.
00:00:08 The Bethel family is fully aware of what transpired.
00:00:12 But since this program
00:00:15 will be broadcast to our global brotherhood,
00:00:18 let me remind all of you of what transpired.
00:00:24 You are well aware of the unique time in world events
00:00:28 —a global pandemic!
00:00:31 What makes this class so unique?
00:00:35 A normal class of Gilead consists of some 50 students.
00:00:40 The 149th class is made up of just 25.
00:00:45 Your class is abnormal.
00:00:49 But why?
00:00:51 You know why.
00:00:53 But let me share your experience with the worldwide brotherhood.
00:00:59 Those who had been invited to attend this class of Gilead
00:01:02 had begun to arrive at the Watchtower Educational Center at Patterson, New York.
00:01:07 The 25 students in this class
00:01:09 actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.
00:01:14 And as we all know,
00:01:16 it was at that time that the coronavirus
00:01:20 was declared to be a global pandemic.
00:01:24 Most travel was shut down.
00:01:27 The rest of their classmates could not come.
00:01:31 Because of government restrictions on educational facilities,
00:01:35 the 149th class had to be postponed.
00:01:40 You students were stuck at Patterson, New York, with no classes in session.
00:01:45 Commendably, many of you were able to work remotely
00:01:50 for your home branch office in the interim.
00:01:54 Finally, here in New York,
00:01:57 government agencies allowed for educational facilities
00:02:00 to again conduct classes if physical distancing could be maintained.
00:02:06 With just 25 of you,
00:02:08 that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.
00:02:12 So we have only 25 “abnormal” students
00:02:17 who will graduate today.
00:02:20 To clarify,
00:02:22 it is the number of students
00:02:25 that makes this class “abnormal.”
00:02:29 But I am told by your instructors that, individually,
00:02:33 you are very “normal.”
00:02:38 In fact, they are very impressed with your spirituality
00:02:42 and your Christian personalities.
00:02:44 You have excelled in your studies and classroom participation.
00:02:49 It’s a delight to be with you on this very special day.
00:02:54 What else, though, makes this an “abnormal” Gilead graduation?
00:02:59 You were not able to invite family members and close friends
00:03:03 to be here in person with you for this exciting event.
00:03:08 However, the Teaching Committee made arrangements for you
00:03:11 to tie in a number of these ones
00:03:15 for a streamed recording of the program.
00:03:19 And the good news is
00:03:21 that the entire program is being recorded and will be posted
00:03:25 as a future JW Broadcasting monthly program
00:03:29 in all of the approved languages.
00:03:33 We have a few statistics to share about the 149th class.
00:03:38 Of the 25 students, 8 are married couples;
00:03:42 7 are single brothers,
00:03:46 and there are 2 single sisters in the class.
00:03:49 I guess they’re still single.
00:03:54 All were serving at a Bethel branch facility
00:03:56 or at a remote translation office before attending school.
00:04:02 The students are from 14 different countries
00:04:06 and speak 29 different languages.
00:04:10 Their average age is 41.
00:04:12 That’s a good age.
00:04:14 Forty-four years ago, I was 41.
00:04:19 Their average years  in full-time service is 20.
00:04:23 In the Bible, Gilead referred to a territory in Israel.
00:04:27 And that name, “Gilead,”
00:04:30 was derived from a Hebrew word that meant “witness heap.”
00:04:36 When the school was first inaugurated in 1943,
00:04:40 “Gilead” was an appropriate name.
00:04:43 One of the instructors described the purpose of the school,
00:04:46 saying that it was “to instill in the students
00:04:50 a more intense desire to share in the evangelizing work.”
00:04:55 And for decades,
00:04:57 thousands of missionaries were sent out
00:05:00 to open up new territories around the world.
00:05:04 A “heap of witness” was given during that period of time.
00:05:09 However, in 2011,
00:05:11 the Governing Body adjusted the specific purpose of Gilead.
00:05:15 Instead of focusing on opening up new territories for preaching,
00:05:20 the purpose of the curriculum changed.
00:05:24 As we mentioned previously,
00:05:26 this entire class was already serving
00:05:30 at a Bethel facility
00:05:32 or a remote translation office.
00:05:35 The goal of Gilead now
00:05:38 is to bolster such ones so as to strengthen
00:05:42 and stabilize God’s people in the respective territories
00:05:45 to which they will be assigned.
00:05:48 Then, what about the all-important evangelizing work?
00:05:52 Who is assisting with the “heap of witness” worldwide?
00:05:59 That’s now the focus of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:06:04 Each Branch Committee selects qualified pioneers
00:06:08 who are willing to be transferred to another part of the country
00:06:12 that needs help with the preaching work.
00:06:15 By using the large pool of zealous local pioneers,
00:06:20 the “heap of witness” is still being given
00:06:24 where the need is greater.
00:06:27 These local ones are already adapted to the culture,
00:06:30 climate, and living conditions in their countries
00:06:34 and, often times, they already know the language
00:06:37 where there is the greatest need.
00:06:40 However, the 25 of you in this class of Gilead
00:06:44 are expected to strengthen
00:06:47 and stabilize God’s people where you are assigned.
00:06:52 Well, what does that entail?
00:06:55 For you brothers,
00:06:57 in time, it may mean that you will be given more responsibility.
00:07:02 But your training has given you another way
00:07:05 to stabilize fellow believers in your assignment.
00:07:09 And this applies to all 25 of you,
00:07:13 whether brothers or sisters.
00:07:15 You have been elevated while here at Gilead.
00:07:19 In fact, in the territory of Gilead, in the Bible,
00:07:23 the elevation changes dramatically.
00:07:28 In the Jordan Valley,
00:07:30 Gilead was 690 feet,
00:07:33 or 210 meters below sea level.
00:07:38 But traveling east to the domelike mountainous region of Gilead,
00:07:42 the elevation rises
00:07:44 to over 3,300 feet,
00:07:49 or 1,000 meters.
00:07:52 You students came to Gilead below sea level.
00:07:56 But with daily Bible study and lectures,
00:08:00 you have been elevated.
00:08:04 Throughout the past five months, your faith has grown.
00:08:08 Your spirituality has been enhanced.
00:08:12 Your Christian personality has been refined.
00:08:16 You have been elevated.
00:08:19 You will be going out to your assignment,
00:08:22 not so much for a “heap of witness,”
00:08:25 but as a “heap of example.”
00:08:28 In this way,
00:08:30 you will strengthen and stabilize
00:08:33 those you work with at the branch
00:08:36 and those you associate with in your congregations.
00:08:43 Find Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.
00:08:54 Never forget that your power and strength,
00:08:58 your spiritual wealth,
00:09:00 does not originate with you.
00:09:03 It is Jehovah who has made this transformation in you.
00:09:09 Read with me, Deuteronomy 8:17, 18:
00:09:15 “If you should say in your heart,
00:09:17 “‘My own power
00:09:19 “‘and the strength of my own hand
00:09:22 “have produced this wealth for me,’
00:09:24 “remember that it is Jehovah your God
00:09:28 “who gives power to you to make wealth,
00:09:31 “in order to carry out his covenant
00:09:34 “that he swore to your forefathers,
00:09:36 as it is today.”
00:09:41 Today, you will graduate from the 149th class of Gilead.
00:09:46 But you will strengthen and stabilize those in your assignment
00:09:50 if you “remember
00:09:53 “that it is Jehovah your God
00:09:56 who gives power to you.”

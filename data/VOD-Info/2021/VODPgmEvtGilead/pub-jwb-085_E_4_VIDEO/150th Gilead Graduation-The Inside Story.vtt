00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:03.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have the opportunity

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enjoy this edition that we’re
accustomed to of <i>The Inside Story</i>,

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s hosted by another instructor,

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:13.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Trent Lippold.

00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:15.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy it.

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:45.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The past year has been a period of change
for all of Jehovah’s people.

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:50.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to show flexibility,
caution, and reasonableness.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at Gilead, for us too,

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Class 150 has presented us with change.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, all the students of Class 150

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are from or serving in the United States.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five couples and one single brother

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all serve in the circuit work.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That represents approximately
50 percent of the class.

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today we’re going to meet three couples

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from different parts of the United States

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how they learned
to cope with change in their lives

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they, like the apostle Paul,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked to ‘become all things to all people.’

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s meet our first guests,

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:30.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey and Taylor Bornschein,
from the state of Texas.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey and Taylor, welcome to <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re from the big state of Texas.

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where specifically are you from?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Dallas.

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:53.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dallas, Texas.
All right.

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, nice to have you with us.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, to come to Gilead
(here you are in the 150th class),

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it all starts with regular pioneering.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you both start regular pioneering?

00:02:04.407 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, Joey, how did you start?

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:09.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me,
I feel very grateful that my foundation

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started a long time ago with my family,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with my grandparents.

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:17.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the couple
that after they got married,

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really just wanted to serve Jehovah
the best way they could.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would ask circuit overseers
where they could move that needed help.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they were ever asked
to go to another congregation,

00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would always do it right away.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that really affected my mom,
which in turn affected me.

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that affect you?

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for a while after my parents got married,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they might have just gotten
a little distracted with marriage,

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
family, taking care of the family.

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at one point,
they made a move across the country,

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they used that
as an opportunity to simplify.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my mom was able to start
regular pioneering at that time.

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just— I remember as a child

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how different both of my parents were,

00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in their happiness
and in life in general

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were able
to do more for Jehovah.

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:08.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How old were you when that happened,

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when your mom started pioneering
and you saw this change?

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about nine.

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:12.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when did you start
regular pioneering then?

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, actually, the next year

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my sister and I
both got to join her in pioneering.

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you were 10 years old?

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is amazing!

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten years old when you started pioneering?
Great!

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:27.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Taylor?

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you get your start
in regular pioneering?

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pioneered in Texas,
but I’m originally from Colorado.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my parents, like Joey’s,
set a really good example for me.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of my life they pioneered as a couple.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so pioneering was always just something

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—full-time service was something—
that I grew up with.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my mid-teens,

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my parents got appointed
to the substitute circuit work.

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was fun.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the weekends, I would travel with them
to visit congregations.

00:03:55.585 --> 00:03:58.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in public schools,
so I couldn’t go with them during the week.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I appreciated about them

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it wasn’t just what they said,
but they set the example by what they did.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:04.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:04.861 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, that must have been cool.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had your parents,
and they were in the substitute circuit work.

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But personally, how did that affect you?

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, so that was just some good motivation
for me to start pioneering.

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I graduated about six months early,

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a semester early,
and then started pioneering.

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then as soon as I was able to, I hit 19

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and submitted an application for Bethel,
and soon thereafter 

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was accepted and was able to spend
a few years in Brooklyn.

00:04:26.783 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that, I know you left Bethel.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two of you got married.

00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re there regular pioneering in Dallas.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made the difference for you to reach out

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and progress in Jehovah’s service?

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:43.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were pioneering as a young couple.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:46.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had goals,
but it can be hard when you’re new

00:04:46.002 --> 00:04:48.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to figure marriage out
with some distractions

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:51.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with maybe even just knowing
what direction you should take.

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we just feel so thankful to Jehovah

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we had some
very instrumental circuit overseer couples

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came just at the right time.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve tried to express it to them,
but I don’t think 

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ll ever fully understand
the impact that they’ve had on our lives.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is one of the great things
about the impact

00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those in the circuit work: what they do
for young people, for young ones.

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re all—
I think we’re all so grateful for that.

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say then—?

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:19.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that your inspiration
to get into the circuit work?

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not really.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We actually had different goals.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really wanted to go
to Bethel together as a couple,

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we applied and applied,
and it just didn’t seem to happen.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you ended up in the circuit work.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wonder what changed then.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it just grow on you, or what happened?

00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:41.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one day we opened up a piece of mail,
and it was a questionnaire

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the substitute circuit work.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while that might not
have been the direction

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:47.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we thought we would go down,

00:05:47.663 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seemed like that was the path
that Jehovah laid out in front of us.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we happily accepted, and little by little

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it started to grow on us
—the idea of the circuit work.

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were then able to attend

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just continued
to get training and motivation

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what Jehovah wanted us to do.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so after our graduation,
within just a few months,

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were appointed to the circuit work,

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we love the circuit work.

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where was your first circuit, Joey?

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we went to the suburbs of Chicago,

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:18.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so it was great—from the big city of Dallas

00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the big city of Chicago.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you think of Chicago?

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:26.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was everything
that I could want in a circuit

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so two big-city people from Dallas
now going to Chicago, an even bigger city.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love diversity of background,
culture, race, and it had everything.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were just eating it up.

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved being in the Chicago area.

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sounds like a “but” is coming—a change.

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed for you both?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after just about six months
of being in that circuit

00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still falling in love
with the circuit work, we got a call 

00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:51.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the branch office that we were

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now being reassigned
to a different circuit farther north

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a more rural circuit in Wisconsin.

00:06:58.234 --> 00:06:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Wisconsin.

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did you think?
Tell us about it.

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Wisconsin like for you, Taylor?

00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:08.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was very different for big-city people

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:10.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going into a rural circuit that was

00:07:10.446 --> 00:07:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mostly dairy-farm communities.

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, out of our element,
we would drive for miles and miles

00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:20.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were out in service
with no stores or shops

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bathrooms or coffee shops.

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:25.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it took a little getting used to.

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably, timing now
became something you had to learn.

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:07:29.065 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about for you, Joey, coming from Dallas,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was it like for you?

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:37.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, the big change was the weather
—the winters.

00:07:37.406 --> 00:07:39.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have extreme winters in Dallas,

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Wisconsin had very long,
very cold winters.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we invested in really good coats,

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wool leggings, great boots.

00:07:48.484 --> 00:07:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I jokingly told Taylor
that some mornings I would wake up

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel exhausted
just getting dressed in the morning.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:57.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Putting on so much, I guess, also affected
bathroom breaks and things like that

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—new skills you were learning in Wisconsin.

00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:01.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:08:01.063 --> 00:08:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to adjust to this new change?

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So although it was a different environment,
it was just beautiful to see that, yeah, 

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:12.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was cold outside, but that didn’t affect
the friends, their hearts.

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were warm in their service to Jehovah.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were so warm in the way
that they treated us.

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:21.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just adopted us so quickly
into a different environment.

00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We very, very quickly fell in love
with the friends in Wisconsin.

00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are amazing, aren’t they?

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:29.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Joey?

00:08:29.692 --> 00:08:32.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say helped you to adjust?

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, of course, like Taylor said,

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the love from the friends;
it helped us immediately.

00:08:36.866 --> 00:08:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also actually learned new ways
to have fun that we never had in Dallas.

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you brought a picture.

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:44.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This photograph is a great picture.

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re obviously having fun there.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:47.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joey, what can you tell us about it?

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is actually
a gathering that we went to

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:54.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the middle of a frozen lake,
and this is actually us ice fishing.

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you catch anything?

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:56.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did.

00:08:56.185 --> 00:08:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re telling yourself,
‘You’re not in Dallas anymore.’

00:08:58.254 --> 00:08:59.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:08:59.121 --> 00:08:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great!

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s also another photo,
and I love this one.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:04.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this, Taylor?

00:09:04.293 --> 00:09:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there’s a brother in the circuit
who raised beef cattle,

00:09:07.263 --> 00:09:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I got to spend some time getting to pet
the little guy and also hand-feeding it

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:15.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so an amazing experience and not
something that I would have been able to do

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in downtown Chicago or downtown Dallas.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were really there,
just ‘becoming all things to all people.’

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say you learned

00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the changes
you’ve gone through in your lives?

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:30.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if I’m just being honest, the circuit work

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not something that I had a desire to do.

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:37.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel like it would make me
comfortable or happy.

00:09:37.693 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah at times
puts things in front of us

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we might not think
that we would like or make us comfortable.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does.

00:09:46.602 --> 00:09:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m so glad that he did allow us
to have the opportunity

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be in the circuit work
because we love the circuit work.

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just a nice little reminder

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will choose things for us
or put things in front of us

00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:00.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe we don’t think
is going to make us happy

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is not going to make us
comfortable in how we

00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:05.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel with the circumstance or environment.

00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah always chooses
what’s best for us if we just let him do it.

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say, Joey?
What did you learn?

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:15.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think for me, anytime there’s a change

00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s always going to be
a little bit of anxiety,

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uncertainties, worries.

00:10:19.468 --> 00:10:22.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just really learned to just leave it
in Jehovah’s hands

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to pray to him about it—
because a lot of times those things

00:10:25.007 --> 00:10:27.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never even happen; they never even come true.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever Jehovah asks of us,

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:34.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be able to get through it
because either they won’t happen

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Jehovah will help us
and bless us through them.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are two great lessons
that you’ve learned.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:42.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for sharing them with us,
and those are two lessons

00:10:42.158 --> 00:10:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will probably help you out
in the changes that are to come in your life.

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taylor and Joey, thank you so much
for being with us on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:10:49.165 --> 00:10:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:54.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our next guests
coming from the state of Michigan,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Whitney Frey.

00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben and Whitney, thank you for being
with us on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:11:11.554 --> 00:11:14.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve come to Gilead from the circuit work,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the circuit work also starts
with regular pioneering.

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:21.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So maybe you can tell us: How did you,
Whitney, start regular pioneering?

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my mom taught me the truth
when I was growing up.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I loved Jehovah,

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:30.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by my late teens, I didn’t really know
what I wanted to do with my life.

00:11:30.172 --> 00:11:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a girlfriend who invited me

00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:35.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support her at a funeral
of a young brother

00:11:35.378 --> 00:11:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had passed away in a tragic accident.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s interesting.

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you could make—

00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the connection of starting
to pioneer and a funeral?

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can make the connection for us.

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me, when I got to the funeral
of this young brother,

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though I didn’t know him personally,
I had seen

00:11:50.326 --> 00:11:52.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had just started regular pioneering

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he had the goal of going
to Bethel when he got old enough.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just compared his life to mine.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was going to give everything
he had to Jehovah.

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I had the circumstances
to do the same thing, but I wasn’t doing it.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I just thought, you know,
‘He didn’t get to finish his story.’

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I wanted to pick up where he left off.

00:12:10.546 --> 00:12:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to start pioneering.

00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:15.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so when I went home,
I prayed about it and I turned in

00:12:15.184 --> 00:12:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my auxiliary pioneer application
with the goal

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of starting to regular in September.

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:21.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s really encouraging
—something so tragic

00:12:21.757 --> 00:12:23.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet something
very positive came out of it.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Ben?
How did you get your start?

00:12:25.761 --> 00:12:28.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, similar to Whitney,
my mother taught me the truth.

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad was not in the truth during my youth.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I grew up
in a rural congregation in Michigan,

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and while I respected the truth

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my late teens and early 20’s,

00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I struggled spiritually.

00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:45.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the reason is
because I wanted a lot out of life

00:12:45.247 --> 00:12:48.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, at that point,
the truth felt very restrictive to me.

00:12:48.784 --> 00:12:51.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt like it was holding me back
and not allowing me

00:12:51.253 --> 00:12:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the rich life that I wanted.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:56.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed in your life then?
What helped you?

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a couple of pioneer elders
move into our congregation

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:01.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were a great source
of encouragement to me.

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped me to see that serving Jehovah
is not about what you <i>can’t </i> do;

00:13:05.568 --> 00:13:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about all the things you <i>can </i> do.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the way I illustrate it is
with a board game.

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:14.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If all you did was just learn
the rules of that game

00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:17.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you never played it,
that wouldn’t be a lot of fun.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s really how my view
was at that time of the truth.

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:23.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew the rules, so to speak, of the truth.

00:13:23.452 --> 00:13:26.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I respected the truth,
but I wasn’t involved in it.

00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:30.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with the encouragement
of these two brothers, I really got involved.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started playing the game, so to speak,

00:13:32.328 --> 00:13:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I started studying the Bible
like I should have all along.

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I also started
regular pioneering shortly thereafter.

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:39.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re happy you “got in the game.”

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there anything else, Whitney,
that helped you

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe inspired you to reach out?

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:52.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, when I started wanting to pioneer,
I also got into studying more.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one thing that really affected me
was the video <i>To the Ends of the Earth.</i>

00:13:56.485 --> 00:14:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember watching it and,
as I watched it, thinking: ‘That’s it.

00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:01.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s what I want to do.

00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to go to Gilead,
and I want to be a missionary.’

00:14:03.626 --> 00:14:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that video is still available
on jw.org in the video library.

00:14:09.298 --> 00:14:11.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that video probably, like for you,

00:14:11.867 --> 00:14:15.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired hundreds of people to reach out

00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter missionary service
and attend Gilead.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of them are still out there

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthening and stabilizing
the brotherhood.

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you both then had

00:14:26.382 --> 00:14:30.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goal of foreign service
—missionary service.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you keep pursuing that goal?

00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we certainly did.

00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:35.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we got married, six months later,

00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:39.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we served where the need was great
in the country of Guyana in South America.

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:40.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:14:40.262 --> 00:14:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you brought along a couple of pictures.

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can explain these.

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:46.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the first one
is obviously your photo, Ben.

00:14:46.368 --> 00:14:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us?

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were motivated by the motorbike scene

00:14:50.539 --> 00:14:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>  video.

00:14:52.474 --> 00:14:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we got a motorbike when we were down there

00:14:55.678 --> 00:14:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not quite as big or as cool as the one

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>To the Ends of the Earth</i>  video,
but it served its purpose.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to travel
the territory efficiently

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:05.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our different Bible studies
and return visits.

00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:10.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the next photo
—what can you tell us about it, Whitney?

00:15:10.459 --> 00:15:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the bike
couldn’t take us any farther,

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would park it and then we walked.

00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:18.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a lot of times,
that meant through mud across the trenches.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we didn’t mind.
It was fun.

00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were enjoying it.

00:15:20.703 --> 00:15:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Ben is being careful on the bridge.

00:15:22.638 --> 00:15:25.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, you had to be careful
because there were black caiman,

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is a form of alligator,
that was in those trenches,

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:29.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you chose your steps carefully.

00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:32.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I know you came back from Guyana.

00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:34.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you continue to pursue Gilead?

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did.

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:38.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we returned to the United States
after serving in Guyana,

00:15:38.153 --> 00:15:41.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we applied for Gilead, and to our surprise,

00:15:41.423 --> 00:15:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were invited to serve as special pioneers

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:46.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the state of West Virginia
here in the United States.

00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so did Gilead remain your goal, though,
even though you were there in West Virginia?

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:51.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continued to apply for Gilead,

00:15:53.636 --> 00:15:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then instead we were invited
to the Bible School for Christian Couples.

00:15:57.573 --> 00:16:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice
—so more theocratic education, though.

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:01.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from there you returned to West Virginia?

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s correct.

00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we continued special pioneering
in West Virginia,

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also got training for circuit work.

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:11.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you end up in the circuit work?

00:16:13.922 --> 00:16:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were invited to start circuit work

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:18.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, area

00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:21.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar (close by) to the Bornscheins.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we loved it.

00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved the friends there,
and we loved that circuit.

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:24.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, change came
—didn’t it?—a big change for you.

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:29.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:16:29.972 --> 00:16:31.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one day Ben came home.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d been there about four years.

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:33.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were loving it.

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:38.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he came home and told me
that we got field missionary applications.

00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is—foreign service.

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:42.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how did you feel?
Ben, how did you feel?

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:46.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that point in our life,
we were really enjoying

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the circuit work and we loved the friends.

00:16:48.957 --> 00:16:52.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So admittedly at that point,
the idea of now going foreign

00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having another change
maybe lost a bit of its luster.

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had gotten so comfortable that we had
potentially gotten too comfortable.

00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:01.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Whitney?

00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:04.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I thought, you know:
‘It had always been my goal.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But now, Jehovah?

00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:07.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now after I got into circuit work

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and am enjoying it,
now you want me to go foreign?’

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:13.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what helped you?

00:17:13.015 --> 00:17:15.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were explaining what was happening

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talking to my family
and telling them how we felt.

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was talking to my sister
and my brother-in-law,

00:17:20.055 --> 00:17:23.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “You know, Whit, you feel like
you got trained for circuit work,

00:17:23.592 --> 00:17:26.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe circuit work
was training you for the next assignment.”

00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:29.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just shifting my thoughts
in that way really helped me.

00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:30.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s great advice.

00:17:31.433 --> 00:17:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Ben?

00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there something in particular
that helped you?

00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:34.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was.

00:17:34.503 --> 00:17:37.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spoke with a brother
in the Service Department at Bethel,

00:17:37.606 --> 00:17:41.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said that ones in our situation
come across his desk frequently.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “You’re at a crossroads.

00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:46.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there are some
who turn down the opportunity

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept this form of foreign service.”

00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “But for those that accept it,

00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who take that step of faith,

00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they receive blessings that they

00:17:55.791 --> 00:17:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could never have imagined from Jehovah.”

00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can rightly say
that has been completely accurate.

00:18:02.698 --> 00:18:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel exactly that way.

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it shows.

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you went off to a foreign assignment.

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:09.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You continued in circuit work there.

00:18:10.639 --> 00:18:12.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say, Whitney?

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:14.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did foreign service help you?

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In so many ways.

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a couple of them are
just getting to express our faith and trust

00:18:19.882 --> 00:18:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah in a way
that we never would have if we didn’t go.

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:26.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the greatest gifts
was the people that we met

00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:28.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the local brothers and sisters,

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fellow missionaries,
and circuit overseers.

00:18:30.726 --> 00:18:33.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith and self-sacrifice
taught us so much.

00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you’ve come to Gilead.

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has Gilead training helped you?

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, in so many ways.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we loved our foreign assignment,
it did have challenges.

00:18:44.273 --> 00:18:46.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember praying to Jehovah,
asking him for help

00:18:46.975 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with certain things that I struggled with.

00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:52.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the first week that we were here
in Gilead, I saw the answer

00:18:52.181 --> 00:18:54.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those prayers
—specific things that I had prayed about—

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answered right in week one,
and it never stopped since.

00:18:58.253 --> 00:18:59.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:02.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m sure Gilead training
will just keep helping you in the future.

00:19:02.357 --> 00:19:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said at the outset, Ben,
that you wanted to get a lot out of life.

00:19:05.127 --> 00:19:06.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think we would all agree:

00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:10.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve gotten a lot out of life
—both of you so far.

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:12.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe in the next 30 minutes,
you’ll find out

00:19:12.768 --> 00:19:15.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how much more out of life
you’re going to get.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both for being with us
on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:18.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:19:18.707 --> 00:19:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s welcome our final guests.

00:19:20.809 --> 00:19:22.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also serving in the United States.

00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Joshua and Solaydi Rechanek.

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Josh and Solaydi, welcome.

00:19:38.327 --> 00:19:39.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s nice to have you.

00:19:39.394 --> 00:19:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re our final guests
on <i>The Inside Story </i> for today,

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:44.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I should clarify that although you’re
serving in the United States,

00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are actually from Puerto Rico, correct?

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:48.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:19:48.036 --> 00:19:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful tropical island
in the Caribbean.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my mom and dad moved there

00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:57.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I was born to serve,
and that’s where I was raised.

00:19:57.045 --> 00:19:59.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they were a tremendous example

00:19:59.748 --> 00:20:01.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for entering full-time service for me,

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when I was one,
they actually started in the circuit work.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s just that from a very young age,

00:20:08.891 --> 00:20:12.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just seemed very natural to have that
as a goal, and I’m very grateful.

00:20:12.594 --> 00:20:17.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Solaydi, were you also born
and raised in Puerto Rico?

00:20:17.566 --> 00:20:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is right.

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have an older brother, Rafi,

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:23.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we both were raised by our mom,

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:26.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lydia, as a single parent.

00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:29.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She raised us in the truth,
and a little bit

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:33.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after Joshua came to our congregation,
I started to pioneer.

00:20:33.782 --> 00:20:37.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also I had the privilege
to serve as a commuter

00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:40.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Puerto Rico branch,

00:20:40.422 --> 00:20:44.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were happy
to have him in our congregation.

00:20:44.793 --> 00:20:46.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something happened.

00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:49.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, before we get to what happened,
we have a nice photograph.

00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:49.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is.

00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:51.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s you with your mom, Solaydi?

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s my mom, Lydia.

00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:55.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Josh, just to clarify this also,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did you get to Solaydi’s congregation?

00:20:57.873 --> 00:21:00.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after I started pioneering,
I went to what was called

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:03.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Ministerial Training School in 2003,

00:21:03.545 --> 00:21:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after a little bit, I got assigned
to this lovely rural congregation,

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:10.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I just happened to meet
a very beautiful sister.

00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:13.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the way you say lovely congregation.

00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:14.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a change came.

00:21:14.556 --> 00:21:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said, Solaydi, that something changed.

00:21:16.425 --> 00:21:18.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What changed?

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:21.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I had gotten some training
as a substitute circuit overseer,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:26.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then there was
a need for a circuit overseer.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t in Puerto Rico;
it was in a Spanish circuit in Ohio.

00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:33.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I prayed about it,

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and off I went from Puerto Rico to Ohio.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was that like, Josh?
Tell us about it.

00:21:36.912 --> 00:21:39.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you feel when you got there?

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:41.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was— It was very different.

00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember dropping my dad off at the airport
(because he helped me move up),

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then when I was driving away, I said,

00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:51.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know nobody and nothing
even nearby after that plane takes off.”

00:21:51.693 --> 00:21:55.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because not only was the place different
but also everything was different.

00:21:55.964 --> 00:21:58.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very interesting
because the congregations

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the U.S. in Spanish
tend to be very mixed culturally.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I got to be with brothers
from many different cultures

00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:06.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I hadn’t experienced before.

00:22:07.275 --> 00:22:10.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even had to learn to speak Spanish
in a way that everybody would understand

00:22:10.445 --> 00:22:12.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of just the brothers
from Puerto Rico.

00:22:12.681 --> 00:22:14.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a huge change for you

00:22:14.816 --> 00:22:17.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a change of culture coming
to the United States and then,

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you say, all these other cultures.

00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:21.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brought along
a really nice picture, Josh.

00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:22.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this?

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:25.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned this day a very important skill,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is to check the weather report
before you leave home to preach.

00:22:29.164 --> 00:22:30.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:22:30.165 --> 00:22:31.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you not check the weather in Puerto Rico?

00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:32.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nope.

00:22:32.801 --> 00:22:34.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s either going to be sunny,
or it’s going to rain.

00:22:34.903 --> 00:22:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two choices.

00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:36.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:22:36.571 --> 00:22:37.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Solaydi?

00:22:37.806 --> 00:22:41.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Josh has come to the United States.

00:22:41.576 --> 00:22:43.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did that affect you?

00:22:43.678 --> 00:22:45.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I was happy for the assignment.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a privilege,
so I wanted to support him.

00:22:49.518 --> 00:22:51.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we kept in touch.

00:22:51.219 --> 00:22:54.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2010, we got married.

00:22:54.322 --> 00:22:57.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that, we received an invitation

00:22:57.426 --> 00:22:59.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue as a couple in Ohio.

00:22:59.828 --> 00:23:01.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a big change for you then.

00:23:01.563 --> 00:23:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, just like Josh,
you came to a new country, in a sense,

00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:10.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new marriage,
and a new assignment in circuit work.

00:23:10.572 --> 00:23:12.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were some of the hard moments for you?

00:23:12.174 --> 00:23:14.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, Josh, you could share first.

00:23:14.209 --> 00:23:17.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as I said,
there was a lot of adaptation.

00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:21.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you start a new assignment,
I don’t think you ever really feel

00:23:21.016 --> 00:23:24.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualified for it or prepared for it.

00:23:24.186 --> 00:23:27.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were very young
when we started the circuit work,

00:23:27.456 --> 00:23:30.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visiting congregations where sometimes
there were brothers that had been serving

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as regular pioneers
longer than we’d been alive.

00:23:33.462 --> 00:23:35.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then all of a sudden,
we’d have the responsibility

00:23:35.664 --> 00:23:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage them and help them.

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:40.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that could be a bit intimidating.

00:23:40.435 --> 00:23:41.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you brought along another photo.

00:23:43.138 --> 00:23:45.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see the confusion of the adaptation.

00:23:45.874 --> 00:23:47.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about this, Josh?

00:23:47.609 --> 00:23:51.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a field service day

00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:52.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly after getting married.

00:23:52.948 --> 00:23:56.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t that I was distracted
or anything, but we rushed out the door,

00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:59.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to field service, took the group out,
and made all the arrangements.

00:23:59.888 --> 00:24:04.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a dear brother,
a very good friend, came up to me,

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:06.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put his arm around my shoulder,
and he took me over to Solaydi.

00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “I’m not going to say anything.

00:24:09.498 --> 00:24:10.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m just going to look.”

00:24:10.398 --> 00:24:12.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he looked down at my shoes,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and, well, it just turned out that I had

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:15.403 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
put two different shoes on.

00:24:15.403 --> 00:24:17.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he was kind enough

00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:19.074 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to point that out before I went out in service.

00:24:19.074 --> 00:24:21.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t point it out
before he took the picture.

00:24:21.743 --> 00:24:22.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:24.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solaydi, what were you thinking?

00:24:24.646 --> 00:24:27.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was like: “Baby, what happened?

00:24:27.048 --> 00:24:28.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you do?”

00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:31.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you always check his shoes
before he goes out then.

00:24:31.853 --> 00:24:34.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I try to check him before leaving home.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe in all seriousness, Josh,

00:24:37.626 --> 00:24:41.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you say were the keys
that helped you?

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:43.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got some really good advice

00:24:43.932 --> 00:24:46.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from brothers with more experience,
including my father.

00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are really two keys we found.

00:24:49.804 --> 00:24:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is to love the brothers,
because that’s really what they need.

00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:57.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need love and affection and your time.

00:24:57.045 --> 00:24:59.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the other is to be humble,

00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:03.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the brothers greatly appreciate
the arrangement of the circuit overseer,

00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:05.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whoever the circuit overseer is.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as long as you remain humble,
Jehovah can use you

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage the friends
and then all glory goes to him.

00:25:11.493 --> 00:25:14.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very nice to love humility,

00:25:14.329 --> 00:25:16.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s really what helps us
to “become all things to [all] people.”

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about for you, Solaydi?

00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:21.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were challenges for you?

00:25:21.336 --> 00:25:24.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for me it was the emotional part.

00:25:24.806 --> 00:25:28.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it is true:
It is a beautiful privilege

00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to know 
so many brothers and sisters

00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:36.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make bonds with them,
but at the same time, you face reality.

00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:39.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see all the struggles
that they are going through.

00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:42.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So some are dealing with health problems

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:44.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or economic problems

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:46.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even their status in the country.

00:25:46.962 --> 00:25:49.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was not able to help them

00:25:49.297 --> 00:25:51.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way that I wanted, so I felt helpless.

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what could you do for them?

00:25:54.603 --> 00:25:58.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I had to leave that part

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:01.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s hands and give them my time.

00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:04.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I try to go

00:26:04.012 --> 00:26:07.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with them in service, try to encourage them.

00:26:07.115 --> 00:26:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry,

00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:13.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I try to show them my love

00:26:13.388 --> 00:26:15.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and even more important
that Jehovah loves them.

00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:16.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:19.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m sure you left a little bit
of your heart with all of them.

00:26:19.561 --> 00:26:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very nice.

00:26:21.563 --> 00:26:22.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’re here in Gilead.

00:26:22.797 --> 00:26:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that a surprise for you?

00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:26.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, a big surprise.

00:26:26.968 --> 00:26:30.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Josh, I know Gilead actually has
a special place in your heart.

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:31.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:32.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does.

00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:34.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because my parents attended Gilead,

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s actually what brought them
to Puerto Rico.

00:26:37.112 --> 00:26:39.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They attended the 52nd class.

00:26:39.648 --> 00:26:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.
Good.

00:26:40.982 --> 00:26:44.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So having parents who went to Gilead,
did they

00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:47.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep Gilead in their heart even after they
had a family and were raising you?

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:49.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did.
Absolutely.

00:26:49.024 --> 00:26:52.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember they had their graduation photo

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up in the hallway, where all of us
would walk every day.

00:26:56.264 --> 00:26:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every day of my life growing up
I walked past that photo.

00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:00.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is, the 52nd class.

00:27:00.802 --> 00:27:01.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s them.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also the way they were,

00:27:04.606 --> 00:27:09.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way they served Jehovah,
the love and zeal that they have:

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear to me—even clearer now—

00:27:12.514 --> 00:27:15.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Gilead had a big impact on them.

00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:16.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say that impact was on them?

00:27:16.885 --> 00:27:19.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you see Gilead training in them?

00:27:19.954 --> 00:27:21.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of two things.

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:25.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is that they’re excellent students
of the Bible and always have been.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom’s Bible has so many notes
that I don’t think it can hold any more.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my dad, I remember he would be reading
the Bible with us at night,

00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:37.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he had an envelope that he’d mark
the family Bible with.

00:27:37.572 --> 00:27:40.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of a sudden he’d stop reading
and stop to make a note on the envelope

00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:44.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he came across a scripture
that he wanted to use for a talk

00:27:44.045 --> 00:27:46.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a shepherding call
or just a point that he liked.

00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:49.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was an excellent example.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:52.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also they’ve always worked
very, very hard for Kingdom interests.

00:27:52.721 --> 00:27:56.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve always had the goal to do as much
as they can for as long as they can,

00:27:56.691 --> 00:27:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that just kind of became
the family motto.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s interesting now going through Gilead

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:05.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing so much emphasis
placed on exactly those things

00:28:05.734 --> 00:28:09.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to feed your love for Jehovah and do
as much as you can for the organization.

00:28:09.204 --> 00:28:11.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I was going to ask you that as well.

00:28:11.873 --> 00:28:15.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you are sitting in class,
and you’re hearing

00:28:15.276 --> 00:28:18.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a great degree
the same things your parents heard.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has that helped you at all?

00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:21.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has.

00:28:21.316 --> 00:28:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have had those qualities
to an extent when they came to Gilead.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think, listening to the classes now,

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:31.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s clear that Gilead
stirred that up in them

00:28:31.593 --> 00:28:34.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and kept that flame burning
for many, many years.

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:35.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s beautiful.

00:28:35.163 --> 00:28:37.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they must be very proud of both of you

00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:40.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you apply yourselves
and as you will apply the training

00:28:40.735 --> 00:28:43.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look forward to applying it
in your future assignments.

00:28:43.772 --> 00:28:45.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both very much
for being with us today.

00:28:45.907 --> 00:28:47.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:50.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction, we quoted Paul’s words

00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:52.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 9:22.

00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:56.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:28:56.851 --> 00:29:00.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I might
by all possible means save some.”

00:29:00.688 --> 00:29:04.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle obligated himself
to adjust his life

00:29:04.893 --> 00:29:08.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal tastes
“for the sake of the good news.”

00:29:08.897 --> 00:29:12.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope today’s program
has been encouraging to you,

00:29:12.033 --> 00:29:15.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it’s trying something
you just don’t prefer

00:29:15.537 --> 00:29:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something you didn’t think
you could do in Jehovah’s service.

00:29:19.107 --> 00:29:22.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s just getting in the game,
so to speak,

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or giving someone a little piece
of your heart to encourage them.

00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today’s guests have shown us

00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:31.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that by adjusting our life

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:34.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal tastes for the sake
of the good news,

00:29:34.656 --> 00:29:38.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah, we can cope with any change

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:41.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or make any change for Jehovah’s service.

00:29:41.996 --> 00:29:44.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing you

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:47.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on another edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

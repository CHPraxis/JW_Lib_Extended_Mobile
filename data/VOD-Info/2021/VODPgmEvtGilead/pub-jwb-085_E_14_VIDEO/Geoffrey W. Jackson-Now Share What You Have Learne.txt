00:00:01 The graduation of the 150th class of Gilead:
00:00:06 Who would have thought that we would have
00:00:08 150 classes of Gilead?
00:00:12 And probably, for you students, you were wondering if you would survive
00:00:15 to the 150th graduation.
00:00:19 Over the years,
00:00:21 graduations of Gilead have taken various forms.
00:00:25 If you look at this photograph,
00:00:27 you’ll notice that for the 7th class,
00:00:30 the graduation was in 1946.
00:00:33 And what do you notice?
00:00:35 The guests who came along were
00:00:38 in the open air, hoping for good weather.
00:00:41 And I’m told there was no—
00:00:44 It wasn’t a ticketed event.
00:00:46 So just those that wanted to come along
00:00:47 came along.
00:00:49 And then notice in the next one here
00:00:50 that we’ve got the president
00:00:52 giving one of the talks
00:00:54 on the stairs leading up to Gilead.
00:00:57 Well, things have changed.
00:00:59 In 1953, the 21st class
00:01:03 graduated at Yankee Stadium,
00:01:07 and you’d imagine that was a huge event.
00:01:09 And in fact, it commemorated
00:01:11 the tenth anniversary of Gilead
00:01:14 and was very appropriate because that was
00:01:16 a very special year, 1953.
00:01:19 That was the year that the U.S. government
00:01:21 granted us legal status
00:01:23 so that we could have foreign students
00:01:25 come and join the school.
00:01:27 And then, of course,
00:01:29 no matter what graduation we’ve had,
00:01:31 there’s always the joyous look
00:01:33 on the faces of those graduating.
00:01:35 That’s the common denominator.
00:01:38 Of course, in recent years, we’ve had some very different graduations as well
00:01:42 —haven’t we?—with no live audience.
00:01:45 But aren’t you happy that we’ve got a live audience today?
00:01:55 Now, after the last few months,
00:01:57 you’ve been through so many lessons
00:02:01 and written exams and so on.
00:02:03 There’s been a lot of training.
00:02:05 And what has been the purpose of all of that?
00:02:08 Well, when we think of worldly institutions and education,
00:02:13 usually it’s all about the students, isn’t it?
00:02:17 It’s all about the dreams, as Brother Morris mentioned.
00:02:21 It’s all about their ambitions
00:02:24 and their success that they’re looking forward to.
00:02:26 But what about Gilead?
00:02:29 Well, you’ve learned very clearly, I’m sure, that it’s not about you.
00:02:34 And if you haven’t, maybe we need to enroll you in the next class as well.
00:02:39 No, as dedicated servants of Jehovah,
00:02:42 we see that nothing is about us.
00:02:45 It’s not all about us.
00:02:47 It’s about what we can accomplish
00:02:50 in praising our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:02:53 So now you’re at this point where you’re about to graduate.
00:02:58 Now what?
00:03:00 Now is the time for you to share what you’ve learned with others.
00:03:05 Now, what does that involve?
00:03:07 Does this mean you’re going to go to different assignments
00:03:10 and start up little Gilead classes (you know, informally)
00:03:13 in the back rooms of Kingdom Halls?
00:03:16 I wouldn’t advise that.
00:03:20 So, what does it mean to share what you’ve learned with others?
00:03:25 Well, as has already been highlighted in this program,
00:03:29 your example —working hard—is going to help others
00:03:34 to see in action what you learned at Gilead.
00:03:39 But also we see a very interesting scripture
00:03:42 in the second book of Timothy,
00:03:44 so please turn with me to 2 Timothy chapter 2
00:03:47 and verse 2.
00:03:49 And here Paul is speaking to Timothy,
00:03:52 but he captures the thought of what else we need to do.
00:03:56 In verse 2, it says:
00:03:58 “The things you heard from me that were supported by many witnesses,
00:04:02 “these things entrust to faithful men, who, in turn,
00:04:06 will be adequately qualified to teach others.”
00:04:11 What do we see from this particular verse?
00:04:15 Well, yes, you will teach by your example by doing the hard work,
00:04:19 but also you need to take an interest in others
00:04:22 and, perhaps in a more informal setting,
00:04:25 help them to see the principles and the lessons that you’ve learned
00:04:29 from your Gilead training.
00:04:32 And that’s a very important thing.
00:04:35 We can take the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.
00:04:38 Of course, Jesus’ main focus
00:04:41 was the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom, wasn’t it?
00:04:44 But that’s not all he did.
00:04:46 If we turn to Mark chapter 9,
00:04:50 notice in Jesus’ busy schedule
00:04:53 what he made time for.
00:04:55 This is Mark 9:30, 31:
00:05:01 “They departed from there and went through Galilee,
00:05:04 but he did not want anyone to get to know about it.”
00:05:08 So this was a time when he wanted some peace and quiet.
00:05:12 Why?
00:05:13 Well, verse 31 says
00:05:15 “for he was teaching his disciples.”
00:05:20 So Jesus took time from his busy schedule to show interest
00:05:24 in those who he was training to help them to be prepared for the future.
00:05:29 So that’s a wonderful example for us.
00:05:33 When we look through the Scriptures, we see many examples,
00:05:36 but for the next few minutes, we’re going to think about Barnabas
00:05:41 and how Barnabas
00:05:43 was able to share what he learned with Paul.
00:05:47 And as we think about what happened
00:05:49 in that interaction between Barnabas and Paul,
00:05:52 we’re going to learn five lessons
00:05:55 —five lessons that teach us
00:05:57 how to handle training others and passing on what we’ve learned.
00:06:02 So the first lesson: If you turn with me, please, to the book of Acts
00:06:07 —Acts chapter 9—
00:06:09 this takes us to around the year 36 C.E.
00:06:14 So Saul has already become a Christian.
00:06:18 Now, after a while, he arrives in Jerusalem.
00:06:21 So, what happens?
00:06:22 In verse 26 of chapter 9, it says:
00:06:25 “On arriving in Jerusalem, he [that’s Paul]
00:06:28 “made efforts to join the disciples,
00:06:31 “but they were all afraid of him [I wonder why],
00:06:35 because they did not believe he was a disciple.”
00:06:39 They were thinking, ‘This is going to be a very dangerous thing.’
00:06:43 But now, what happened in verse 27?
00:06:46 “So Barnabas came to his aid
00:06:49 and led him to the apostles.”
00:06:53 So we see, as pictured here,
00:06:56 Barnabas saw the potential in Saul
00:07:00 and believed that, really,
00:07:03 he could be useful in Jehovah’s service.
00:07:05 So he risked his reputation, you might say,
00:07:08 by supporting, or sponsoring,
00:07:11 Saul and taking him to the apostles.
00:07:15 So, what’s the lesson that we learn from this?
00:07:18 Try to see the potential in others.
00:07:23 And don’t worry about if you
00:07:26 perhaps encourage them
00:07:27 and if you give them support
00:07:28 —you sponsor them, you might say—
00:07:30 and then they don’t really turn out well
00:07:32 and that now all of a sudden your reputation
00:07:34 is going to be tarnished.
00:07:36 Remember, it’s not all about you.
00:07:39 It’s what is good for the work.
00:07:41 So that’s the first lesson.
00:07:43 Try to see the potential in others.
00:07:46 Now, if we turn across to Acts chapter 11,
00:07:50 this is about nine years later,
00:07:53 around the year 45 C.E.
00:07:56 Now, in chapter 11 of Acts,
00:07:59 the work is going ahead in the Gentile field
00:08:03 and particularly in the city of Antioch.
00:08:06 So Barnabas was assigned by the brothers
00:08:10 to go and help the congregation in Antioch.
00:08:14 Well, let’s look down in verses 25 and 26,
00:08:18 because as soon as Barnabas arrived there,
00:08:20 he realized he needed help.
00:08:24 So, what did he do?
00:08:26 Well, in verse 25, it says:
00:08:29 “He [that’s Barnabas]
00:08:31 went to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul.”
00:08:36 So he went to find Saul.
00:08:39 He remembered that this was a man
00:08:41 who could speak Greek and was well-educated.
00:08:45 He’d be able to help him with the Gentile field.
00:08:48 It’s interesting that when you look at a map, you’ll notice
00:08:52 that it’s about 120 miles
00:08:55 from Antioch to Tarsus, or about 200 kilometers.
00:09:00 It mentions here in verse 25 that he made “a thorough search for Saul.”
00:09:04 Why?
00:09:05 Well, if we compare 1 Corinthians, where Paul lists all the things he did,
00:09:09 many of those, it appears, happened in those nine years.
00:09:14 He was shipwrecked several times, put into prison, and so on.
00:09:18 So he was very busy.
00:09:20 Barnabas sought him out, and then what did he have to do?
00:09:23 Well, in verse 26, it says: “After he found him,
00:09:27 he brought him to Antioch.”
00:09:29 So, what did he have to do?
00:09:31 He had to convince Saul.
00:09:33 You can imagine that may have been a little difficult
00:09:36 because Saul was having a productive ministry.
00:09:39 So he brought him to Antioch.
00:09:41 Then verse 26 says:
00:09:43 “For a whole year they assembled with him in the congregation
00:09:47 and taught quite a crowd.”
00:09:49 So Barnabas didn’t take Paul and say, “Now I’m going to teach you.”
00:09:54 He just had him work along with him.
00:09:57 And as they worked together, that would have given Saul some training.
00:10:02 So, what’s the lesson
00:10:04 that we learn?
00:10:06 Be willing to make the effort.
00:10:08 You see, Barnabas not only
00:10:10 saw the potential
00:10:11 but was willing to go and find Saul
00:10:14 and then convince him to come
00:10:16 and work with him,
00:10:17 and then they worked together.
00:10:19 So that’s the second lesson.
00:10:21 The third lesson is in Acts 13.
00:10:25 So after Barnabas and Saul were in Antioch for some time,
00:10:30 what happened in verse 2?
00:10:33 It says: “As they were ministering to Jehovah and fasting,
00:10:36 “the holy spirit said:
00:10:38 “‘Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul
00:10:42 for the work to which I have called them.’”
00:10:45 Well, now, this is a time when they’re going out in the missionary field,
00:10:50 but notice that the holy spirit mentions “Barnabas and Saul.”
00:10:55 So in this illustration, we see who is taking the lead—Barnabas.
00:10:59 Saul is following along.
00:11:01 But if we look down further in verse 13 of the same chapter,
00:11:06 we see there’s a little change.
00:11:08 Saul starts to use a name that is more common in that area—Paul.
00:11:13 But what does it say now?
00:11:15 “Paul and his companions put out to sea.”
00:11:18 And from here on, it seems that Paul took the lead.
00:11:23 Now, let’s just imagine for a little bit that you were Barnabas.
00:11:27 You know, maybe we could imagine ourselves saying quietly to Saul, or Paul,
00:11:32 or whatever he was calling himself at that time:
00:11:34 “Can I just have a few words with you?
00:11:37 “This is not a big issue, but do you remember
00:11:41 “when holy spirit said we were going out?
00:11:43 “It was ‘Barnabas and Saul.’
00:11:47 “Now, now, I don’t have a big problem with this.
00:11:50 “But, you know, I appreciate your enthusiasm.
00:11:53 But, really, I was the one designated to take the lead here.”
00:11:57 No, he didn’t say that, did he?
00:11:59 The Bearing Witness  book mentions that he wasn’t envious at all.
00:12:04 So, what’s the lesson?
00:12:07 Well, if we’re working along with someone and training them,
00:12:11 the lesson is:
00:12:13 Don’t be envious if they start to excel.
00:12:17 And actually, what we’re helping them
00:12:19 to do is to blossom.
00:12:21 And they will get some of the privileges
00:12:23 that perhaps we would have liked
00:12:24 along the way.
00:12:26 So we won’t be saying, “Well, uhm, excuse me, uhm,
00:12:29 but I’m the one who went through Gilead.”
00:12:32 No, we won’t be envious.
00:12:35 The fourth lesson takes us to the book of Galatians.
00:12:39 So if you turn with me to Galatians chapter 2,
00:12:44 this is around the year 49 C.E.
00:12:48 Already, Peter and Paul and Barnabas
00:12:52 and Titus had all been to Jerusalem,
00:12:55 and they’d had the big discussion with the governing body about circumcision.
00:12:59 Interestingly, when they arrived in Jerusalem,
00:13:02 the account says that Barnabas and Paul were there.
00:13:06 Interesting.
00:13:07 Maybe Barnabas took note of that, that he was mentioned first again,
00:13:11 probably because the governing body remembered that was actually
00:13:14 the role originally.
00:13:17 But now we find that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas
00:13:21 and some others were back in Antioch.
00:13:23 And what happened just a few months after that special meeting?
00:13:27 Well, Paul had to tell Peter that he was doing something wrong.
00:13:32 But notice, please, what verse 13 says:
00:13:37 “The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense,
00:13:41 so that even Barnabas was led along with them in their pretense.”
00:13:45 Now I just love this picture.
00:13:48 You see Paul telling Peter he’s wrong,
00:13:51 and have a look at Barnabas’ face.
00:13:55 He looks guilty.
00:13:57 Awkward!
00:14:01 Do you see?
00:14:02 He was caught in the crossfire.
00:14:05 He likewise was getting counsel because he was involved with this.
00:14:09 So, what lesson
00:14:12 do we gain from this?
00:14:13 Accept counsel
00:14:15 even from those whom we are viewing
00:14:17 as the ones whom we’re training.
00:14:19 Don’t feel that we’re
00:14:21 above accepting counsel.
00:14:24 Now, the final lesson is the one probably you thought about immediately
00:14:29 when we mentioned Paul and Barnabas.
00:14:31 I know what you were thinking—Acts 15.
00:14:33 So let’s turn there
00:14:35 —Acts 15:37-39.
00:14:42 And this is after the incident in Antioch.
00:14:46 And it says: “Barnabas was determined to take along John,
00:14:50 “who was called Mark.
00:14:52 “Paul, however, was not in favor of taking him along with them,
00:14:56 “seeing that he had departed from them in Pamphylia
00:15:00 “and had not gone with them to the work.
00:15:02 “At this there was a sharp burst of anger,
00:15:06 so that they separated from each other.”
00:15:10 Now, this is the instance that we usually remember
00:15:13 when we think of Paul and Barnabas.
00:15:16 What led to this problem?
00:15:18 Have you ever thought about that?
00:15:20 It mentions that Paul was very hesitant
00:15:23 about taking John Mark along with them.
00:15:26 Perhaps he remembered on that first missionary tour
00:15:30 when John Mark had gone back,
00:15:32 he and Barnabas continued on into Galatia.
00:15:35 And reading what Paul said to the Galatians,
00:15:38 it seems obvious that Paul had problems with his eyes
00:15:42 and that he was very sick at that point.
00:15:44 So, no doubt, you know, he missed having a young man available
00:15:49 to carry the luggage and to do all the things that needed to be done.
00:15:53 So Barnabas could understand why Paul was hesitant.
00:15:58 He didn’t want to lose the help again.
00:16:01 But then, on the other hand, what about Barnabas?
00:16:03 Why do you think he was so determined to take John Mark?
00:16:08 Well, it could be the fact that he was a relative
00:16:11 (that sometimes comes into a factor),
00:16:14 or it could be the fact
00:16:16 that Barnabas saw the potential in Saul
00:16:20 was the same thing he saw in John Mark.
00:16:22 “This is a good young man.
00:16:24 We need to give him a chance.”
00:16:27 Or could it be that he was still stinging a little bit
00:16:31 after the rebuke in Antioch?
00:16:34 Or could it be that he was still viewing
00:16:39 Saul, or Paul, as a student,
00:16:42 someone newer in the truth than him and someone from whom
00:16:45 he just found it hard to accept his opinion?
00:16:49 Now, we’re not going to play the “blame game.”
00:16:53 Some of us will be working with these brothers later.
00:17:03 But I feel safe in saying this:
00:17:07 I’m sure that Paul and Barnabas
00:17:10 when they think back to that day
00:17:13 would agree that they could have done things better.
00:17:15 Is that a safe comment?
00:17:17 I think all of us have times when we felt maybe we were right,
00:17:21 but we could have handled it better.
00:17:24 So, what’s the lesson?
00:17:26 Try to respect different opinions;
00:17:29 don’t overreact.
00:17:31 Don’t get upset.
00:17:33 Try to work through things
00:17:34 so that it doesn’t affect
00:17:36 our working relationship.
00:17:39 Well, when we’ve thought about Barnabas and Paul,
00:17:43 it really gives us a lot of food for thought, doesn’t it?
00:17:45 Remember those five lessons?
00:17:48 Try to see the potential in others.
00:17:51 Then be willing to put forward the effort that’s required to train them.
00:17:56 Don’t be envious if they get privileges.
00:17:59 Accept counsel if they offer you counsel,
00:18:02 and respect their opinions as well.
00:18:05 We know that you’ll try to implement those suggestions.
00:18:10 Yes, as you go to your assignments,
00:18:13 may Jehovah be with you and bless you.
00:18:16 May you try to help others by sharing what you’ve learned at Gilead.
00:18:21 And in that way, you will fulfill the purpose of Gilead
00:18:25 —to stabilize and strengthen others.

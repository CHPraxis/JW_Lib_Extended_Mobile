So, Dad,
why don’t we celebrate our birthday?

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:10.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good question.

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you answer that at school?

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, because Jehovah doesn’t like it?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, but why?

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:24.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you like presents and treats?

00:00:24.312 --> 00:00:25.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you want them like this?

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Birthday celebrations mix good things

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with things Jehovah doesn’t like.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long ago,

00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people believed in good and evil spirits

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:53.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were afraid of them.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They thought presents and treats

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their birthday could protect them.

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:01.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like today, they made wishes

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that only good things would happen to them.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the Bible say about birthdays?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It talks about them, but not good ones.

00:01:10.562 --> 00:01:13.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was Pharaoh in Egypt

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Herod in Jesus’ day.

00:01:15.187 --> 00:01:17.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were proud rulers

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had people put to death

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:21.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at their birthday parties.

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:25.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you remember
if Jesus celebrated his birthday?

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:26.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, no!

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right. He didn’t.

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told us to celebrate the date of his death

00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:32.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it gives us

00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:34.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hope of living forever.

00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus taught us to give good things

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to each other anytime we want,

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like . . .

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like today!

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:44.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good timing!

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pie! Yes!

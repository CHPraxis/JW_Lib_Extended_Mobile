00:00:04 There’s a girl at school.
00:00:06 She’s so mean to me.
00:00:14 Hey, Sophia, we know you’re in there.
00:00:18 What a loser!
00:00:25 I prayed for it to stop,
00:00:27 but nothing’s happened.
00:00:31 When Jehovah listens to your prayers,
00:00:34 he really listens.
00:00:39 Is there about to be a fight?
00:00:41 Angela would win.
00:00:43 What do you want, Angela?
00:00:46 Uhhh!
00:00:52 Jehovah, please! I need your help!

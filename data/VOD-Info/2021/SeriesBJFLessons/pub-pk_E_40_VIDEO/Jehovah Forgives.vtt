It was Jesus’ last night with his apostles.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are the ones
who have stuck with me in my trials.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, Jesus would be arrested.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:27.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was going to be very hard for them.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:32.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you will be stumbled
in connection with me on this night,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for it is written:
“I will strike the shepherd,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sheep of the flock
will be scattered about.”

00:00:38.937 --> 00:00:42.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were going to run away
and abandon Jesus.

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:45.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter said:

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all the others
are stumbled in connection with you,—

00:00:48.312 --> 00:00:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“I will never be stumbled!”

00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:52.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good, Caleb!

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter thought he was strong
and would never make Jehovah sad.

00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:02.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tell you, Peter,
a rooster will not crow today

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:06.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you have denied knowing me three times.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:09.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cock-a-roo!

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nuh-uh.
That’s not a rooster!

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:14.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, kids!

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not important how the rooster sounds.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll never make Jehovah sad!

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me neither!

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you’d never want to.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you are afraid . . .

00:01:29.562 --> 00:01:30.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[Screeching brakes]

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!
You’re late!

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry!
Grab your bags!

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:38.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Careful!

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love you kids!
See you later!

00:01:43.104 --> 00:01:43.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be good!

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m home!

00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, hello!

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:28.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anybody?

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:33.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a rough day.

00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:36.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aww, what happened?

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:46.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb, are you OK?

00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:50.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if Jehovah doesn’t wanna be
my Friend anymore?

00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:53.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:57.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants to be your Friend.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you did something bad,
he wants you to tell.

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So today at school,
I was outside on the playground.

00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:52.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Caleb.

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:54.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hey.

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:57.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I was just, uh . . .

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can have it.

00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:02.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought he can’t have it.

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:04.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah!
Which is it?

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I didn’t want it anyway.

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:12.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I thought the Bible says you can’t?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, it says . . .

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
C’mon!
What does it say?

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, I’m not sure.

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:21.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you came to my house the other day
to talk about the Bible.

00:04:21.312 --> 00:04:23.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you remember?

00:04:24.687 --> 00:04:26.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um, yeah.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that wasn’t me.

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:34.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, ha-ha.

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:38.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Huh!

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was you, but you’re scared.

00:04:44.937 --> 00:04:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[Ringtone of a rooster crowing]

00:04:49.145 --> 00:04:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Honey.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I can’t talk right now.

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:54.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you give me a call back later?

00:05:00.062 --> 00:05:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a rough day.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when Peter said
he would never stumble?

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:11.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later that night,

00:05:11.312 --> 00:05:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was arrested.

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move it!

00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:31.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter loved him and wanted to help.

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doing the right thing isn’t always easy.

00:05:57.187 --> 00:05:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too were with Jesus the Galilean!

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I don’t know what you’re talking about.

00:06:12.562 --> 00:06:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:16.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one of them!

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know the man!

00:06:37.604 --> 00:06:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, 
you follow Jesus!

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I swear, I do not know the man!

00:06:47.187 --> 00:06:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[A rooster crows twice]

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter knew the right thing to do.

00:07:32.062 --> 00:07:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.

00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:44.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like at school.

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:53.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter didn’t want to make that mistake
ever again.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah
would still be his friends.

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:20.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jesus was resurrected,
he talked to Peter.

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:24.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simon, son of John,

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you love me?

00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Lord,

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:31.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know I have affection for you.

00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:34.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus forgave him!

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:36.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so did Jehovah.

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Peter had to talk to Jesus.

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you upset Jehovah,
what do you think you have to do?

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to Jehovah.

00:08:47.479 --> 00:08:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.

00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven

00:08:56.145 --> 00:08:58.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving him more work to do.

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shepherd my little sheep.

00:09:09.937 --> 00:09:13.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why didn’t Peter give up
when he made a mistake?

00:09:13.645 --> 00:09:15.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah forgives.

00:09:15.937 --> 00:09:18.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, guys!

00:09:26.687 --> 00:09:28.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, wait!

00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:30.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m gonna need to explain birthdays.

00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:32.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you help me?

00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:34.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

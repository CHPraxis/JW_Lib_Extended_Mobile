00:00:11 It was Jesus’ last night with his apostles.
00:00:16 You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.
00:00:20 Soon, Jesus would be arrested.
00:00:24 It was going to be very hard for them.
00:00:28 All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night,
00:00:32 for it is written: “I will strike the shepherd,
00:00:35 and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.”
00:00:38 They were going to run away and abandon Jesus.
00:00:42 But Peter said:
00:00:45 Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,—
00:00:48 —“I will never be stumbled!”
00:00:50 Very good, Caleb!
00:00:52 Peter thought he was strong and would never make Jehovah sad.
00:00:59 I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today
00:01:02 until you have denied knowing me three times.
00:01:07 Cock-a-roo!
00:01:09 No, it’s cock-a-doodle-doo!
00:01:11 Nuh-uh. That’s not a rooster!
00:01:13 Hey, kids!
00:01:14 It’s not important how the rooster sounds.
00:01:18 I’ll never make Jehovah sad!
00:01:21 Me neither!
00:01:22 We know you’d never want to.
00:01:24 But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.
00:01:27 And when you are afraid . . .
00:01:29 [Screeching brakes]
00:01:30 Oh, no! You’re late!
00:01:32 Hurry! Grab your bags!
00:01:36 Careful!
00:01:40 Love you kids! See you later!
00:01:43 Be good!
00:01:43 Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!
00:02:19 I’m home!
00:02:22 Uh, hello!
00:02:26 Anybody?
00:02:30 He had a rough day.
00:02:33 Aww, what happened?
00:02:42 Caleb, are you OK?
00:02:46 What if Jehovah doesn’t wanna be my Friend anymore?
00:02:52 Hmm.
00:02:54 Jehovah wants to be your Friend.
00:02:57 But if you did something bad, he wants you to tell.
00:03:04 OK.
00:03:05 So today at school, I was outside on the playground.
00:03:50 Hey, Caleb.
00:03:53 Oh, hey.
00:03:54 Uh, I was just, uh . . .
00:03:57 You can have it.
00:03:59 Wait!
00:04:00 I thought he can’t have it.
00:04:02 Yeah! Which is it?
00:04:04 Uh, I didn’t want it anyway.
00:04:08 But I thought the Bible says you can’t?
00:04:12 Uh, it says . . .
00:04:14 C’mon! What does it say?
00:04:15 Uh, I’m not sure.
00:04:18 But you came to my house the other day to talk about the Bible.
00:04:21 Don’t you remember?
00:04:24 Um, yeah.
00:04:26 Maybe that wasn’t me.
00:04:32 Uh, ha-ha.
00:04:37 Huh!
00:04:38 That was you, but you’re scared.
00:04:44 [Ringtone of a rooster crowing]
00:04:49 Hi, Honey.
00:04:50 Yeah, I can’t talk right now.
00:04:52 Can you give me a call back later?
00:05:00 That was a rough day.
00:05:05 Do you remember when Peter said he would never stumble?
00:05:10 Later that night,
00:05:11 Jesus was arrested.
00:05:15 Move it!
00:05:28 Peter loved him and wanted to help.
00:05:45 But doing the right thing isn’t always easy.
00:05:57 You too were with Jesus the Galilean!
00:06:02 Ah, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
00:06:12 Wait!
00:06:13 This is one of them!
00:06:19 I do not know the man!
00:06:37 Hey,  you follow Jesus!
00:06:40 I saw you in the garden with him, did I not?
00:06:44 I swear, I do not know the man!
00:06:47 [A rooster crows twice]
00:07:29 Peter knew the right thing to do.
00:07:32 But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.
00:07:42 Just like at school.
00:07:48 Yes.
00:07:50 Peter didn’t want to make that mistake ever again.
00:07:55 But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah would still be his friends.
00:08:16 After Jesus was resurrected, he talked to Peter.
00:08:22 Simon, son of John,
00:08:24 do you love me?
00:08:26 Yes, Lord,
00:08:28 you know I have affection for you.
00:08:32 Jesus forgave him!
00:08:34 And so did Jehovah.
00:08:37 But Peter had to talk to Jesus.
00:08:40 If you upset Jehovah, what do you think you have to do?
00:08:45 Talk to Jehovah.
00:08:47 That’s right.
00:08:49 You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.
00:08:53 And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven
00:08:56 by giving him more work to do.
00:08:58 Shepherd my little sheep.
00:09:09 So why didn’t Peter give up when he made a mistake?
00:09:13 Because Jehovah forgives.
00:09:15 Hey, guys!
00:09:26 Oh, wait!
00:09:28 I’m gonna need to explain birthdays.
00:09:30 Can you help me?
00:09:32 Of course.

Roma people in many parts of the world

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are subject to prejudice and discrimination.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the summer of 2017,

00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they—for the first time ever—
experienced a regional convention

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own language.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Delegates from 12 different countries

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to Macedonia to attend the convention.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The program was presented
in the Romany languages

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:29.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoken in Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Serbia.

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 2007, Bible literature

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been translated into Romany in Macedonia.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the release of the book
<i>Lessons You Can Learn From the Bible</i>

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought great joy to both the many children
and their parents.

00:00:44.732 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention was truly a witness

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is the God of impartial love.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that we would have
a convention in Romany.

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It enters directly into your heart

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you hear it in your own language.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could hardly wait
for this Romany convention

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially the songs
that touched our hearts.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:09.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the world,

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not all kinds of people are loved,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for Jehovah, they are all significant.

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I am happy that I am serving

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a God who is so impartial
and to whom all nations are the same.

00:00:02 “Through faith they defeated kingdoms,
00:00:06 “brought about righteousness,
00:00:09 “obtained promises,
00:00:11 “stopped the mouths of lions,
00:00:14 “quenched the force of fire,
00:00:16 “escaped the edge of the sword,
00:00:19 “from a weak state were made powerful,
00:00:23 “became mighty in war,
00:00:25 routed invading armies.”
00:00:29 Faith in Jehovah has allowed ordinary people
00:00:33 to do extraordinary things.
00:00:36 This kind of faith is still active today
00:00:40 and still has the power to help us
00:00:43 through any difficulty.
00:00:45 So let’s travel across the globe
00:00:48 and see how deep reliance on Jehovah
00:00:52 has helped many overcome their unique trials.
00:00:57 As we visit each land,
00:00:59 we’ll enjoy a story of faith
00:01:02 shared both from the perspective of close friends
00:01:05 as well as the individuals involved.
00:01:09 Now to our first destination.
00:01:20 South Africa is full of contrasts
00:01:23 and diversity.
00:01:25 Big, modern cities mix with poorer remote areas.
00:01:29 For many volunteers in Kingdom Hall construction,
00:01:32 this presents wonderful opportunities
00:01:34 but also unique challenges that require faith
00:01:38 in Jehovah.
00:01:40 An example of that is our young friend Namhla.
00:01:44 My wife and I really appreciated
00:01:46 the faith she showed
00:01:47 to make herself available
00:01:49 and to keep her joy in her assignment.
00:01:52 I’m the only Jehovah’s Witness in my family.
00:01:57 What my mother desired the most for me
00:02:00 was to grow up,
00:02:02 go to college
00:02:04 and, in time, get a high-paying job.
00:02:10 My congregation was busy building a Kingdom Hall,
00:02:14 so I would sometimes also go to help.
00:02:18 I wanted to see and feel the joy that those brothers were having
00:02:22 building Kingdom Halls.
00:02:25 My mom didn’t like it when she heard
00:02:27 that I was going to help with Kingdom Hall construction.
00:02:31 She felt that I was wasting my time.
00:02:36 When I arrived on-site, everything I did was for the first time.
00:02:40 I didn’t have skills, and I had never done this work before.
00:02:45 It is not easy.
00:02:47 Sometimes I get tired
00:02:49 —mentally exhausted and even physically exhausted.
00:02:53 Sometimes it’s difficult to even read the Bible.
00:02:56 I just want to wash up and go to sleep.
00:03:02 It was important for Namhla to find her spiritual balance
00:03:07 because her spirituality
00:03:10 was more important
00:03:12 than working hard on-site.
00:03:15 I realized that I needed to be really determined
00:03:18 because my spirituality was not the same as before.
00:03:22 I saw that I needed to make a change.
00:03:27 I made it a priority to read the Bible first
00:03:30 and to think about the things I read.
00:03:34 I also made sure that I was regular in going out in the ministry.
00:03:40 Prayer helped a lot
00:03:42 because prayer is the best way for me to tell Jehovah
00:03:45 things that concern me.
00:03:48 I have seen for myself how Jehovah God has sustained me.
00:03:53 We’ve seen that she is much more balanced.
00:03:57 My mom would phone and ask,
00:03:59 “Namhla, how is the project going?”
00:04:01 And then she would say,
00:04:03 “If this makes you happy, then I am also happy.”
00:04:08 At first, I had my fears,
00:04:11 but faith made me confident
00:04:13 that Jehovah God would always be there
00:04:15 to support me in everything I do.
00:04:38 Canada is a diverse country
00:04:40 —both the landscape
00:04:42 and, because of immigration, the people and their languages.
00:04:45 In order to share Bible truth with these ones,
00:04:49 many brothers are learning a new language,
00:04:51 like my friend Shaquille.
00:04:56 When Shaquille got invited to Bethel,
00:04:58 I had the privilege of serving
00:05:00 at the Canada branch at the time.
00:05:02 So it was such a pleasure to see this young man
00:05:04 who had all these wonderful goals and to see one by one
00:05:07 Jehovah opening those doors to him.
00:05:10 He had made a promise to Jehovah as a young person.
00:05:14 I want to help those
00:05:17 that don’t have anyone to help them.
00:05:20 Jehovah saw good in me,
00:05:22 and he invested in me, and he was very patient with me,
00:05:24 and I saw it through every brother and sister who sincerely reached out to help me.
00:05:29 Meditating on Jehovah’s qualities —you want to imitate him.
00:05:32 You want to show the kindness that he has shown toward you and toward others.
00:05:36 So in a foreign language, I feel like there is a giant opportunity to do that.
00:05:40 I started to learn Punjabi, and I never regretted it.
00:05:42 It changed my service to Jehovah.
00:05:49 There was a time period in my Bethel service
00:05:52 when I was really, really sick,
00:05:54 and it was a kind of sickness
00:05:57 where I didn’t know why it was happening.
00:05:59 No doctor could tell me why it was happening.
00:06:01 It affected my physical appearance,
00:06:03 and it seemed liked torment throughout each and every day.
00:06:08 A lot of times, I would have rather not been seen.
00:06:13 So serving in a foreign language now when you’re one of the people
00:06:16 who is spiritually supposed to be strengthening others,
00:06:19 but you’re going through a hard time yourself,
00:06:20 was a massive challenge for me.
00:06:24 I think all of his friends just really appreciated
00:06:28 the faith that he had to overcome that.
00:06:31 And even though it was a very low point in his life,
00:06:34 he really hung on to Jehovah.
00:06:37 If I’m in this assignment and I’ve seen that Jehovah has blessed me,
00:06:41 what would lead me to conclude that he’s going to stop?
00:06:45 He couldn’t sleep; he just couldn’t continue at Bethel either.
00:06:50 I had left Bethel.
00:06:51 But still, my health was decreasing, and it was getting really bad.
00:06:55 And it was getting to the point that doctors
00:06:57 expressed concern about maybe an organ failing
00:06:59 and things like that.
00:07:01 But they did not give me any way out.
00:07:04 I had no way out.
00:07:05 He kept making progress
00:07:07 even though there were certainly some really difficult times for him.
00:07:11 I had to take a realistic approach toward my new situation,
00:07:16 and I had to figure out, “OK, how am I going to put Kingdom interests first
00:07:21 “while materially taking care of myself
00:07:23 “and hopefully figure out why I’m sick
00:07:27 and if I can do anything about it?”
00:07:29 In the end, he decided to stick with the foreign language.
00:07:35 And something I really learned from Shaquille is
00:07:37 that he really took the Scriptures and made it personal.
00:07:42 He would read it as if he was the person in the Scriptures,
00:07:47 and he would meditate on it,
00:07:49 and now he could see how, even though he didn’t know the answers,
00:07:53 Jehovah would help him through his difficult times.
00:07:56 So, what am I going to do?
00:07:59 I’m going to live up to what I promised to Jehovah.
00:08:02 Today, he serves with his wife in the Punjabi field.
00:08:06 He’s a loving shepherd, and he even instructs Punjabi-language classes.
00:08:31 In Indonesia, people work very hard.
00:08:35 They seek stability through a secure job.
00:08:38 This can have a powerful influence on the brothers and sisters
00:08:42 because they may feel that they can’t expand their ministry.
00:08:46 When I met the Jatmikos, they were working toward pioneer service.
00:08:52 When they started, I asked them,
00:08:55 “Would you like to be used
00:08:56 more fully by Jehovah?”
00:08:58 I was confused.
00:09:00 We felt that the pioneer service itself was
00:09:04 already a big accomplishment.
00:09:07 I encouraged them to think about the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:09:12 I had never imagined applying for SKE.
00:09:17 It was tempting.
00:09:18 I wanted to be used by Jehovah,
00:09:22 but
00:09:24 what would happen to us after graduation?
00:09:29 Where would we be assigned?
00:09:32 What would be our assignment?
00:09:36 We needed more faith,
00:09:40 so we prayed a lot about that.
00:09:43 Jehovah answered my prayers
00:09:45 through the brothers and sisters in the congregation.
00:09:49 Mardha had a prestigious job.
00:09:52 She was even being offered many scholarships
00:09:55 so that she could pursue higher education
00:09:58 and further advance her career.
00:10:01 The brothers and sisters never criticized Mardha’s work choice.
00:10:06 Rather, they showed us the joys
00:10:08 of serving Jehovah more fully.
00:10:12 When I was still deciding what to do,
00:10:14 some of them asked me about my spiritual goals
00:10:18 and what I could see myself doing.
00:10:20 Thinking about such questions
00:10:23 convinced me to choose SKE.
00:10:29 They were invited to attend the school.
00:10:32 They had to leave their jobs, their house,
00:10:35 and the comforts of the place and city where they lived.
00:10:38 They were assigned to a small congregation.
00:10:41 They had to pray even more
00:10:43 to ask Jehovah God for guidance and direction.
00:10:48 Now they’re serving in the traveling work,
00:10:51 caring for a circuit.
00:10:54 We are fully convinced
00:10:56 that it was not due to any greatness on our part
00:11:00 but because of Jehovah’s help.
00:11:03 If we want to be used by Jehovah
00:11:06 and if we want to serve him,
00:11:08 Jehovah can use us in many different ways.
00:11:32 Fiji is a beautiful place.
00:11:38 However, one thing that is common here
00:11:41 is poverty.
00:11:44 That is the situation Sister Bakata faces.
00:11:50 My husband was a hard worker.
00:11:55 While we were out in the water, he cried out from the mangroves.
00:12:00 When I went and found him,
00:12:03 I knew that it was a stroke.
00:12:08 I had to take on both roles as husband and wife.
00:12:13 I would farm; I would fish.
00:12:17 It was a difficult life.
00:12:24 One day, a sister was sick.
00:12:28 Even though Sister Bakata faced challenges,
00:12:32 if there was any washing or cleaning needed for the sick sister,
00:12:37 she was happy to go and help with that too.
00:12:44 I think back to when a cyclone hit Kadavu
00:12:47 —Cyclone Keni.
00:12:52 I was scared by the damage it did to our house.
00:12:56 Our outdoor kitchen was blown off.
00:13:01 When I heard about the things that happened to the brothers,
00:13:04 I felt so sorry for them.
00:13:08 Their roofs were blown away,
00:13:11 and the walls had fallen down.
00:13:17 Just think about what Sister Bakata did.
00:13:21 She had 20 Fijian dollars.
00:13:25 That is the only money she had,
00:13:31 but she decided to give all of that to the brothers.
00:13:38 I didn’t have any other way to help them.
00:13:43 Jehovah is “the God of love.”
00:13:46 Like it says at 1 John 4:8,
00:13:48 his main quality is love.
00:13:51 Because of that love,
00:13:53 I gave the money from the bottom of my heart.
00:13:59 I learned that even though we are poor,
00:14:02 we can still be generous to assist our brothers.
00:14:09 The more I gave,
00:14:11 the more Jehovah gave back to me.
00:14:15 Till today,
00:14:17 we’ve always had what we’ve needed.
00:14:42 In Peru, like many places around the world,
00:14:45 our brothers and sisters need to work hard.
00:14:54 Benjamín and Doris have to make good use of their resources
00:14:58 in order to provide for their family.
00:15:03 We want to give our children a spiritual heritage.
00:15:07 We want them to be able to serve Jehovah
00:15:09 by watching how we are doing it.
00:15:12 We watch a lot of videos that help us.
00:15:15 We often remember the video
00:15:17 about Abilio and Ulla.
00:15:19 They also had three children.
00:15:22 They moved to another place and grew up in a very nice, spiritual atmosphere.
00:15:27 They are serving Jehovah now as adults.
00:15:31 So we asked ourselves,
00:15:33 ‘Could we move to another place where the need is greater?’
00:15:37 It takes faith to go to an unfamiliar place.
00:15:41 One video on jw.org that helped us a lot
00:15:45 was about the family from England who moved to Ecuador.
00:15:48 First, they went for one month.
00:15:50 So we said that we should also go visit first.
00:15:54 Going to another country would have been exciting
00:15:56 and would have been super,
00:15:58 but our economic situation wouldn’t allow us to go that far.
00:16:04 We took a trip together with our children to visit a territory that had a need
00:16:09 called Calango.
00:16:11 It takes about an hour and a half to get there.
00:16:14 They liked the geography of the area
00:16:16 and all the vegetation.
00:16:18 There were many things that captured their attention.
00:16:22 The things that I like in Calango are playing and preaching.
00:16:29 We were unable to move to the city of Calango
00:16:33 because of the economic situation that the people face there.
00:16:37 It’s hard to get a job there.
00:16:39 So for that reason,
00:16:41 we decided to travel to Calango on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays
00:16:46 and work the other days here in Pachacamác.
00:16:49 We have felt that Jehovah is helping us
00:16:52 because he has made it possible to work here.
00:16:56 And the money that we earn in those days
00:16:58 allows us to be with our brothers there.
00:17:03 We needed to know how to keep things simple.
00:17:06 We learned that from the videos on jw.org.
00:17:10 The hard work that they do proves to me that they really love Jehovah.
00:17:15 They fully trust that Jehovah is our Father.
00:17:19 He is the Dad.
00:17:20 And we know that Dad always comes through for his children.
00:17:24 And that faith is something that greatly motivates them.
00:17:28 The videos on jw.org had given us
00:17:30 the push that we needed.
00:17:33 We needed those videos in order to take action
00:17:36 and move to another area.
00:17:56 Across Russia,
00:17:59 our brothers have successfully faced decades
00:18:02 of persecution and ban.
00:18:05 The Budenchuks, like so many families there,
00:18:08 still face these challenges today.
00:18:13 On June 12, 2018,
00:18:16 at 5:30 a.m.,
00:18:19 armed men burst into our home.
00:18:24 They threw my husband to the floor and handcuffed him.
00:18:29 Eventually, they sent my husband to a pretrial detention facility
00:18:33 for 11 months.
00:18:35 It was frightening just imagining certain things.
00:18:39 She didn’t find it easy and shed many tears.
00:18:43 I was really worried about how I would care for the children
00:18:47 and how I would fulfill their needs spiritually,
00:18:50 emotionally, and physically.
00:18:54 Prayer calmed me down
00:18:56 because I wanted, of course, to react very emotionally
00:19:00 to everything —to the injustice that we were facing.
00:19:05 When the court hearings were going on,
00:19:07 brothers and sisters would come.
00:19:10 It was such a support —so strengthening!
00:19:17 On September 19, 2019,
00:19:20 the court convicted my husband
00:19:24 and sent him to a prison colony
00:19:26 for three and a half years.
00:19:32 In January 2020,
00:19:34 a new disaster hit us.
00:19:38 At 1:00 a.m., our house burned to the ground.
00:19:43 We stood there near the house,
00:19:46 and my son, Yegor, suggested saying a prayer.
00:19:51 I don’t remember the prayer,
00:19:53 but afterward I felt calmer.
00:19:56 Then cars started coming to the house.
00:19:58 It was our brothers and sisters.
00:20:01 I was frozen, shaking from the cold,
00:20:04 and they dressed me like a small child.
00:20:08 They brought us hot tea, food
00:20:11 —everything of the highest quality.
00:20:22 Just one month after the fire,
00:20:28 when they took my husband to the prison colony,
00:20:31 officers there beat him up.
00:20:37 When I found out about it, it was so hard for me
00:20:43 because I didn’t know how to help my husband
00:20:45 or how he was feeling.
00:20:51 Tanya copes with hardships very courageously.
00:20:55 I prayed to Jehovah, sometimes all night.
00:20:58 It felt as though Jehovah gave me
00:21:01 painkillers to dull my pain.
00:21:06 My husband, Aleksey, tries to take care of us.
00:21:08 In the pretrial detention facility, for example,
00:21:11 each day he wrote letters of encouragement to us,
00:21:14 which we read together as a family.
00:21:16 My dear family: Remember the qualities that we need right now
00:21:21 —endurance, courage, calmness
00:21:24 and, most important, faith.
00:21:27 I like the thought that after winter, summer always comes;
00:21:31 after the night, the day arrives;
00:21:34 and after the darkest days, there will definitely come a sunny one.
00:21:40 Throughout all these trials, having a good spiritual schedule
00:21:44 and reading the Bible has given me strength.
00:21:46 Also, we prepare for meetings and participate in the ministry.
00:21:51 I was really afraid to do it,
00:21:55 but this situation has helped me to see Jehovah’s support.
00:21:59 I have realized that even in my circumstances,
00:22:03 I can still help others.
00:22:05 We know that Jehovah has already given us his support,
00:22:09 and we believe that he will continue to support us.
00:22:12 Their example of courage
00:22:14 and steadfast faith in the face of difficulties and trials
00:22:18 proves that we can also remain faithful.
00:22:21 We too can make Jehovah happy
00:22:23 and continue to serve him without becoming discouraged.
00:22:26 We have learned to trust more in Jehovah
00:22:29 and not to panic when a difficult situation arises.
00:22:33 These difficulties have made me stronger,
00:22:36 helped me to overcome many of the fears I used to have,
00:22:39 and strengthened my faith and my desire to help others.
00:22:49 As we have seen,
00:22:52 our brothers the world over
00:22:54 continue to show strong faith.
00:22:59 How did they do it?
00:23:04 A regular study of God’s Word,
00:23:09 time spent in deep meditation,
00:23:13 and seeking His direction in prayer.
00:23:16 What did this allow them to accomplish?
00:23:20 Through faith, our brothers handled theocratic building assignments;
00:23:25 learned foreign languages;
00:23:27 attended theocratic schools;
00:23:30 though poor, remained generous;
00:23:33 served where the need was greater;
00:23:36 and preached despite persecution.
00:23:40 And Jehovah knows we can do the same.
00:23:44 Yes, if we let faith move us to action,
00:23:49 those actions will strengthen our faith.

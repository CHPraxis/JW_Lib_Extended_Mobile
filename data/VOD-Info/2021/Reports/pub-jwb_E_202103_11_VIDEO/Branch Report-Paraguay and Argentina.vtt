As was true in the first century,

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life” are becoming believers.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This truly is the case

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the countries of Argentina, Paraguay,
and Uruguay.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work in these three countries
is cared for

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the branch offices
in Argentina and Paraguay.

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith and I had the privilege
of visiting these branches

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a branch visit in March 2018.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both branches have beautiful Bethel families

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are working hard
to support the activity in the field.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the work taking place,

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these branches take care of the translation
of spiritual food

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into 11 languages.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are also busy building, renovating,
and maintaining Kingdom Halls

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring for the needs
of the congregations.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Argentina, a new branch facility
is being built

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help further simplify
the work of the branch

00:00:57.286 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that even more attention can be given
to the field.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eleven brothers serve
on the Branch Committee in Argentina,

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and six brothers serve
on the Branch Committee in Paraguay.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These loyal and faithful men are working hard
to support the Governing Body,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are looking for ways
to find even more

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to learn about Jehovah.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result of their hard work
and Jehovah’s blessing is most evident.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2017, over 200 percent

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 173,000 publishers
in these three countries

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the Memorial.

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past ten years, over 55,000 persons

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been baptized.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:39.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is the equivalent of 15 persons baptized
every day of the week

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the past ten years!

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is also a fine zeal
for the preaching work.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just in the last year alone,

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of pioneers increased
by about 16 percent

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:54.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nearly 2.8 million more hours
were put in in the ministry.

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both branches have organized

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
special preaching campaigns
to reach those in unassigned territories

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to reach indigenous populations.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These initiatives have had much success.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time,
publications were translated into Nivaclé,

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a language spoken
by a sizable indigenous population.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To distribute the literature,
a campaign was organized

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the northern territory of Paraguay
called El Chaco.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one location, the brothers talked
with the head of the community,

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was very happy
to see publications in his own language.

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he saw one of our videos in Nivaclé,
he started to cry.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He called his entire family
to watch the video

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked for a Bible study for himself
and his family.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brothers asked if they could have
a meeting

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the community, he agreed and even offered

00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to invite all the people to the meeting.

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother who shared in the campaign

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work unassigned and seldom-worked
territory in Paraguay wrote,

00:02:55.696 --> 00:03:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People showed so much interest
in the good news that it was very difficult

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:03.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to end conversations
and go to another house.”

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some places, people spread
the news of their visits by word of mouth.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when our brothers and sisters
arrived in a territory,

00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found that many householders
already had prepared chairs,

00:03:14.214 --> 00:03:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waiting for them to arrive.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:20.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some householders invited them for lunch,
offered lodging,

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:23.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even offered part of their property
to build a meeting place.

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man who was the owner of a little store

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:30.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was enjoying what he was hearing
about the Kingdom message so much

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when some customers arrived to shop,

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told them: “Now I am very busy.

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you need something, come back later.”

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Buenos Aires, Argentina,

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one afternoon while in the ministry,
two sisters approached a house

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was listed in the territory records
as a possible address

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a Romani Kalderash speaker.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:56.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A 14-year-old Romani girl
ran out to them and asked,

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are you Jehovah’s Witnesses?”

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:01.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they replied that they were,
she exclaimed,

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:04.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah sent you!”

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She explained that she was

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:09.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the southernmost tip of South America.

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:12.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d been studying the Bible
with her neighbor,

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but her family was very opposed
and took her Bible

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>Bible Teach </i> book away.

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:20.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, she would secretly sneak away

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three times a week to meet her neighbor
and continue her Bible study.

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her family found out
that she was still studying,

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:30.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they decided to send her
about 3,000 kilometers,

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 1,800 miles, away to Buenos Aires

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:37.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that she would not be able to contact
the Witness

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom she was studying with anymore.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When her Bible teacher heard
that she was being sent far away,

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:45.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she wrote a letter to the young girl,

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that no matter where she ended up,

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she should keep praying to Jehovah
and try to find the Witnesses.

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:55.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After relating the story,
the young girl asked,

00:04:55.023 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Were you sent by my teacher,

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were you just preaching
from house to house?”

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters replied,
saying that they were preaching in the area,

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking for Romani Kalderash speakers.

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They then asked the girl
how long she had been in Buenos Aires.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:12.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: “I arrived today!

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:15.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What I just told you happened today!

00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:17.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I left this morning,
and after arriving here,

00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:19.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I started to pray to Jehovah.

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:24.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I opened my eyes,
I saw you standing at my door.”

00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:27.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arrangements were made
to follow up on her interest.

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:32.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Argentina, the branch reached a milestone
in the Wichí language

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by translating
the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  videos.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:38.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The response was beyond expectations.

00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children and adults alike were amazed
to see the characters

00:05:42.237 --> 00:05:44.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speaking in their native tongue.

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:49.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of this project, the Wichí people
feel that they are not forgotten by Jehovah,

00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this helps their love for him
to grow even more.

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:56.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even those in prison are being reached
with the good news

00:05:56.293 --> 00:05:58.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are taking a stand for the truth.

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the experience of Jesús Wekid.

00:06:01.924 --> 00:06:05.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Formerly, he was considered
a dangerous inmate.

00:06:05.177 --> 00:06:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the prison kept him guarded
by a whole security team.

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:13.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, others now view him
as completely the opposite.

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Wekid is serving a 50-year sentence,

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which he is now in his 6th year.

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last May, he went through

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:24.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was probably
the biggest test of his faith yet.

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:26.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His former friends proposed the idea

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:30.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that through some illegal means
he could get out of prison

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:33.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do the rest of the time in home custody.

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:37.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Making the right decision
was very difficult for Brother Wekid,

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:41.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this would have meant
that he could be with his beloved family,

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:43.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of whom are also Witnesses.

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:47.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After consulting with his family
with many tears, he decided

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve out the rest of his sentence
in prison,

00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:55.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving a great witness to his former friends,
non-Witness family members,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the prison inmates.

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:02.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave up his freedom
to put his relationship with Jehovah first.

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:07.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Jesús has found joy
even despite his current circumstances.

00:07:07.197 --> 00:07:11.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He conducts six Bible studies
and witnesses from cell to cell.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one of the general areas of the prison,
he displays the publications

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the visitation days
for the families of the inmates,

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with very positive results.

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so encouraging to see

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the outstanding young brothers and sisters
in these countries

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their desire to do more for Jehovah.

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many are learning new languages,

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:37.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
reaching out for Bethel service,

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:40.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and working with
their Local Design/Construction Department

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

This is Leandro Támula on the left
and Ary Navarro on the right.

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:51.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ary was part of a family

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was truly passionate for football,
or soccer.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Ary’s dream
to be a part of the national team someday.

00:07:57.873 --> 00:07:59.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ary excelled at the sport

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:03.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received offers
from two national football teams.

00:08:03.253 --> 00:08:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were especially tempting offers
because these were his two favorite teams.

00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:12.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though it was a hard decision for him
because of his passion for the sport,

00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had already decided to serve Jehovah
and he turned down the offers.

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leandro had a similar test
but with a different sport.

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:23.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leandro excelled at basketball

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:26.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and received an offer
to play for the national team,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included a chance
to play internationally.

00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:33.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He realized
that he could not serve two masters.

After watching the video Young People Ask
—<i>What Will I Do With My Life?</i>

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he made the decision to serve Jehovah.

Both of these young men serve together
at the branch in Argentina.

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel that the decisions they have made
have brought them

00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:50.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much happiness and fulfillment in life.

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say that they are receiving
much more satisfaction

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:55.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a life in sports
would have ever provided.

00:08:55.472 --> 00:08:58.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are just a few of the many experiences

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the outstanding brothers and sisters
serving in these countries.

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to organizing
the work in the field,

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:07.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the members of the Branch Committee
and Bethel families

00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:10.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are themselves active in the field ministry.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While on the visit, we had the opportunity
to engage in the ministry

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:17.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in both countries with them
and had a very encouraging time.

00:09:17.786 --> 00:09:21.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, we had the privilege
of having two meetings,

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:24.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a combined attendance of nearly 200,000.

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:29.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were greatly encouraged by hearing reports
of the work in these countries

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:31.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were reminded of the privilege we have

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:34.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be part of this incredible organization.

00:09:34.928 --> 00:09:39.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The many brothers and sisters
in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:42.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
count it a privilege to work with you
“shoulder to shoulder”

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping all those who are streaming
to the house of Jehovah.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like you, they are joyfully keeping busy

in the exciting work going on in our branches
and in the field in these last days.

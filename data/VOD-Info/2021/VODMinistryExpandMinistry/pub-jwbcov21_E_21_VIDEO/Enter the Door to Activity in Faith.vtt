Oh, honestly, you shouldn’t have.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to need it.

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gabriel’s leaving to serve where

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need is greater made us feel like we

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had missed the chance to expand our ministry.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t we start now?

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not getting any younger.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could ask the circuit overseer for advice

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:39.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on his next visit,
but I’m worried he’s going to say

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should . . .

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . join the new language group.

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a big need in our circuit.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve never felt like the right people

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve in a foreign language.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lindstrom
shared Zechariah 8:23 with us,

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helped us see how we could have a hand

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping “men out of all
the languages of the nations”

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn about Jehovah.

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning was a struggle at first.

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help, we made progress

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—slowly.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!
You did it!

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the language was a challenge,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving our new family was not.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, um, uhh.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t—I don’t understand.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say again what you say.

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:33.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, uh.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come.

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, thank—thank you!

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:55.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, we aren’t getting any younger.

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why we’re so glad

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we took the chance to expand our ministry.

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:12.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you had told me two years ago that I’d 

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be moving to where the need was greater,

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would have laughed.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started when they announced
a special preaching campaign.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Samuel
encouraged me to apply with him.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you think?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, yeah, 

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, but you enjoy that.

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you’re going to love it.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I got you a form as well,
all right?

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:40.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do this!

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:48.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I could do more,
but I was comfortable.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:55.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to examine my heart.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read about Abraham’s faith
at Hebrews 11:8,

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like the words jumped off the page.

00:04:08.644 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He went out although

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing where he was going.”

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:19.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who better to be in control
of my life than Jehovah?

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A door was opened to me.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just needed to go through it.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:28.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do it, man.

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The results of the campaign were incredible!

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the experience pushed me
out of my comfort zone.

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Gabriel is going to try some food.

00:04:53.814 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try, try, try!

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on, go on, give it a try, Gabriel!

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:01.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good, yeah—really good!

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:14.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw the ministry in a new way,
and I wanted to do more.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I calculated the cost

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:27.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked

00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my local elders
to write to the branch office.

00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:45.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed about it
and did research before choosing.

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:53.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many unknowns,

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:54.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I couldn’t wait!

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:59.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:05.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was ready for whatever
Jehovah had in store for me.

00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:29.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At our convention, they had the meeting
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:32.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My friend Anton asked if I was going to go.

00:06:32.537 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, Gabriel.

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:34.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, hi, Anton.

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:35.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you coming?

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:36.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, to what?

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The SKE meeting.

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:39.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, uh, no.

00:06:39.503 --> 00:06:40.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t planning on it,

00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all right, yeah, sure.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:44.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go.

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:46.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, then, and afterward, I can . . .

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:52.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went, but I felt conflicted.

00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:54.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought,

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:57.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I already have an assignment,
one that I love.’

00:06:57.646 --> 00:07:02.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t fully understand
the incredible privilege of attending SKE.

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:07.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked the circuit overseer
a few more questions.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it felt like, this is it!

00:07:11.285 --> 00:07:15.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed right,
and all I had to do was apply online.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was months ago.

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s holding you back?

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like Jehovah led me here,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve never been happier.

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:32.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now another door has opened,
and the fear is back.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter how far you’ve come.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear of the unknown can be overwhelming.

00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:40.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you need a reminder that Jehovah

00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:42.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is leading you in the right direction.

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:44.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s one to keep in mind

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 4:13.

00:07:48.113 --> 00:07:53.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read it, and just think
about how far Jehovah has taken you.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:30.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in control.

00:08:30.322 --> 00:08:32.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was I so afraid of?

00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, SKE is for two months.

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you’re just alike you two,

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:57.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing every last thing with you.

00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:03.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I—can I leave this with you?

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:06.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been on a few adventures,
but it’s still great for traveling.

00:09:07.317 --> 00:09:08.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, please.

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows, you might need it sometime soon.

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:26.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi, darling, we’re back.

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:28.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I learned that I was invited

00:09:28.922 --> 00:09:32.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work for a few weeks
on the upcoming construction project,

00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:34.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thrilled.

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:37.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that excitement
quickly turned into anxiety

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what I had to do.

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:48.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah for weeks
to give me the strength

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the conversation with my employer.

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, Sarah, come in!

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:04.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So?

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, first of all, say thank you

00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:09.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time to meet with me, . . .

00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:11.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to explain
about the construction project

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I had been invited to volunteer.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:14.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and I would
really like the time to . . .

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you want time off

00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:19.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the busiest time of our year?

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:24.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, but . . .

00:10:24.352 --> 00:10:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your choice, but under no circumstances
will I hold your position.

00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:38.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege
felt like a huge risk.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:43.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I making my life
more complicated by doing this?

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read the account
about the people in Nehemiah’s day.

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:05.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their willing spirit demonstrated faith,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jerusalem’s walls were built by people

00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:11.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “put their heart into the work.”

00:11:15.487 --> 00:11:17.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to miss out

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:20.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the opportunity
to serve Jehovah in that way.

This is my resignation letter.

00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:30.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have faith that Jehovah
would bless my decision.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:35.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not sure what the future holds
when I get back,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I know Jehovah will take care of me.

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For now, I’m going to focus

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:48.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on putting my heart into the work.

00:12:05.912 --> 00:12:08.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a disaster struck
in the north of the country,

00:12:08.915 --> 00:12:12.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we immediately answered the call for help.

00:12:14.129 --> 00:12:17.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing our brothers and sisters
in need was heartbreaking.

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:34.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what really touched our heart
was the spirit

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:36.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the local brothers and sisters.

00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:39.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like the Macedonians.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have much,
but they gave generously from the heart.

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got home,

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:09.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Madeline and I resolved
to show the same kind of spirit.

00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our appreciation led us

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:18.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to review our contribution
to the worldwide work.

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve come up with this figure.

00:13:21.738 --> 00:13:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this right?

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:33.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just thank Jehovah.

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:42.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We looked for ways to be generous

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those around us.

00:13:54.437 --> 00:13:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We discovered that we had

00:13:56.439 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the means to give more,
so we didn’t hold back.

00:14:21.005 --> 00:14:23.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then,
our congregation was invited to help

00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:26.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a special preaching campaign.

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:29.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . reach as many
as possible with the good news.

00:14:32.934 --> 00:14:34.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think we could do a bit more?

00:14:34.978 --> 00:14:36.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d really like to.

00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:41.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was within our power to help,

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:43.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s exactly what we did!

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:49.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m bringing too much?

00:14:49.701 --> 00:14:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not.

00:00:02 We are happy to continue
00:00:04 with the annual meeting program.
00:00:07 We now have with us Brother Len Myers,
00:00:10 a helper to the Writing Committee,
00:00:12 who will conduct an interview with wives of Branch Committee members
00:00:16 in the United States.
00:00:18 Brother Myers, please.
00:00:23 The accounts of faithful women are found throughout the Bible.
00:00:27 One faithful Christian sister is mentioned by the apostle Paul
00:00:30 at Romans 16:1, 2.
00:00:33 There he mentions Phoebe,
00:00:35 who ‘proved herself to be a defender of many, including Paul.’
00:00:40 Today, we’re blessed to be able to get to know
00:00:43 faithful Christian sisters who share something unique.
00:00:47 All of them are wives of brothers
00:00:49 who serve as members of the United States Branch Committee.
00:00:52 Sister Snyder, we’d like to get to know more about you.
00:00:55 Can you, please, first tell us how you got the truth?
00:00:58 I was introduced to the truth by my parents.
00:01:01 And Jehovah used the example of my sister
00:01:04 and the nurturing love of older ones
00:01:06 in the congregations to draw me to him.
00:01:09 Then how did you start in the full-time ministry
00:01:11 and then into Bethel service?
00:01:14 Well, it was a bit of a test.
00:01:16 When I was in my late teens, a friend of mine died,
00:01:19 and I couldn’t understand why Jehovah would allow this
00:01:22 to happen to such a kind person.
00:01:24 So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me
00:01:28 to do deeper research on the issue of universal sovereignty.
00:01:32 And this not only comforted me,
00:01:34 but it caused me to reevaluate my priorities
00:01:38 and to see if I
00:01:40 truly believed Jehovah would take care of me
00:01:43 if I really put him first.
00:01:46 So I started pioneering and put college on hold.
00:01:50 And it wasn’t long before I was broke
00:01:52 and the rent was coming due.
00:01:54 And so the next meeting,
00:01:57 I quietly put my last $50 in the contribution box
00:02:01 and thought: ‘That’s it, done, doesn’t work.
00:02:04 I’m going back to school.’
00:02:06 But that evening,
00:02:09 I learned that Matthew 6:33 is undeniably true.
00:02:14 Jehovah surprised me
00:02:16 and cared for all my needs from the most unlikely sources,
00:02:20 and he hasn’t stopped caring for me since.
00:02:24 And then you joined Troy in Bethel service later on, right?
00:02:27 Now, what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:02:30 I’ve enjoyed housekeeping.
00:02:32 I’ve really enjoyed a lot of assignments within Transportation Department,
00:02:36 and I was one of the thousands who worked
00:02:38 on the Warwick and Tuxedo construction projects.
00:02:41 Now, as the wife of a Branch Committee member,
00:02:42 you have a demanding schedule.
00:02:44 Can you explain one challenge?
00:02:47 Well, like most wives of good shepherds,
00:02:50 I would love to have more time with my husband.
00:02:52 That’s understandable.
00:02:54 So, what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:02:58 Well, prayer, study, and meditation
00:03:00 have reminded me that we’re at spiritual war.
00:03:04 And we’re at war, so our priorities have to change.
00:03:08 So I can’t long for ideal circumstances,
00:03:12 although they’re coming quickly.
00:03:14 Right now, it’s about advancing pure worship.
00:03:17 And while it’s important to maintain
00:03:19 a healthy and close relationship with Troy,
00:03:23 my primary joy should be in Jehovah.
00:03:25 And, then, second is remembering the sacrifices that were made for me.
00:03:31 Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years with his best friend for me.
00:03:36 And also there were sisters when I was single and pioneering
00:03:40 who would invite me over for lots of meals
00:03:43 and to go out in service.
00:03:45 They would even send their husband
00:03:47 out on freezing cold, dark nights to fix my car,
00:03:51 which broke down often.
00:03:53 So I’m grateful,
00:03:55 and the main way I can show this appreciation
00:03:59 is to imitate their examples.
00:04:02 Now, with challenges come blessings.
00:04:04 What’s one blessing you enjoy as the wife of a Branch Committee member?
00:04:07 Increased peace
00:04:09 that comes from having complete confidence
00:04:13 in how Jehovah directs and blesses the decisions
00:04:16 his organization makes through the Governing Body.
00:04:19 If I were not married to a Branch Committee member,
00:04:24 I may never have known
00:04:26 just how much the brothers rely on Jehovah’s spirit
00:04:29 and how much time they spend
00:04:32 —long periods of time— in prayer
00:04:34 and how much they deeply, deeply love the friends.
00:04:38 So I’m embarrassed
00:04:41 about how much worrying I’ve done in the past about these things.
00:04:44 But now it’s a lot easier to just be supportive
00:04:48 and listen, obey, and be blessed.
00:04:50 Very nice.
00:04:51 Now, as you look back
00:04:52 on your rich spiritual life in Jehovah’s service,
00:04:54 is there an experience you can share with us?
00:04:58 We were visiting a small branch in a developing country
00:05:01 that had been ravaged by decades of civil war.
00:05:04 I’d never seen poverty like that before.
00:05:06 And one evening, I went into the dining room
00:05:09 to gather dinner for us.
00:05:12 But before getting the dinner,
00:05:14 I stopped and talked to a lovely young brother.
00:05:16 At one point, I turned around and noticed that all the food had been taken.
00:05:20 And I said, “There’s no more food.”
00:05:23 Now, this young brother hadn’t eaten either.
00:05:26 But he just shrugged and said, “It’s just hunger,”
00:05:29 and he continued zealously talking about his assignment.
00:05:33 Now, this brother was a commuter and very thin,
00:05:36 and so it was likely that he might not eat that night
00:05:40 or maybe even the next morning.
00:05:42 But the way his face glowed when he talked about his assignment,
00:05:47 it was clear that his joy was not based on anything physical
00:05:52 or the lack of anything physical.
00:05:54 So I really treasure this lesson
00:05:57 because it’s made me want to appreciate more what I do have currently
00:06:02 and to imitate his example in focusing on what’s truly important.
00:06:07 And I think you told me that he did get some food that night,
00:06:09 so we’re happy about that.
00:06:11 Thanks for letting us get to know you and for sharing that experience.
00:06:15 Now we’d like to get to know Sister Shirrell Georges.
00:06:19 Sister Georges, can you tell us how you got the truth?
00:06:21 When I was 11, my mother started to study.
00:06:24 Another sister studied with my two sisters and me
00:06:29 out of the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.
00:06:32 Two years later, on November 13, 1971,
00:06:36 my mother, my oldest sister, and I were baptized.
00:06:40 How did you start in the full-time ministry?
00:06:44 As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us
00:06:46 when we temporary, or vacation, pioneered, as it was called then.
00:06:50 That led me to want to regular pioneer after high school.
00:06:54 However, after graduating, I started working full-time.
00:06:59 It was at a district convention where the point was made,
00:07:04 ‘If you’re not pioneering, tell Jehovah why.’
00:07:07 Well, I really didn’t have a good reason.
00:07:11 So I started making plans to work part-time.
00:07:14 It was in September of 1980
00:07:16 when I realized my goal of regular pioneering.
00:07:19 And how did that lead to Bethel service?
00:07:21 While pioneering,
00:07:23 I had the opportunity to assist
00:07:24 with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall renovation project on Thursdays.
00:07:28 It was one Thursday that I learned
00:07:30 of an announcement made at Bethel:
00:07:32 Sisters could now commute.
00:07:34 So after a while, I turned in my application
00:07:37 and started commuting in November of 1987.
00:07:41 But before commuting, I had met Luther.
00:07:44 We started to court, and then later,
00:07:46 we were married and accepted as a couple to Bethel.
00:07:49 And what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:07:53 While commuting, I worked in the Dry Cleaning Department
00:07:56 and continued there after marriage.
00:07:58 For a short time, I worked with the Brooklyn Warehouse Department.
00:08:02 Then Luther and I received a surprise assignment.
00:08:05 We were asked to assist at the Jamaica branch,
00:08:08 starting in March of 1995.
00:08:11 There I worked in alterations,
00:08:13 laundry, kitchen, housekeeping,
00:08:17 shipping, and the Bethel Office.
00:08:19 Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch merged with the United States branch.
00:08:24 We were invited to serve back in the United States
00:08:28 —first at Patterson, where I worked in Audio/Video Services,
00:08:31 and now at Wallkill, in the Service Department.
00:08:35 Now, you too have a demanding schedule.
00:08:37 Can you explain one challenge?
00:08:40 Well, many of the assignments that Luther has involve traveling.
00:08:43 So that means that we are away from our congregation,
00:08:46 sometimes for weeks.
00:08:48 It also means that we’re not able to get back
00:08:50 to our return visits and Bible studies on a weekly basis.
00:08:55 So, what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:08:58 We’ve found it helpful to let the friends know
00:09:00 whenever we will be away.
00:09:02 Many times we would receive a text from them:
00:09:04 “Just saying hi. Checking on you.
00:09:06 Hope you’re doing well.”
00:09:08 This really has helped us to stay connected.
00:09:11 Something else we did was to invite publishers
00:09:14 to go with us on our return visits and Bible studies.
00:09:17 This way, whenever we were away, they could keep the interest going.
00:09:21 That’s a good idea.
00:09:23 What good habits did you form early in life
00:09:26 that help you now as you support your husband?
00:09:29 Growing up, my mother taught us to be content
00:09:31 and to share whatever we had.
00:09:33 One Watchtower  article stated:
00:09:36 “True contentment comes from loving and being loved.”
00:09:40 We grew up in a loving family,
00:09:42 and then learning about Jehovah and his love as I grew older
00:09:46 helped me to find contentment in Jehovah’s service.
00:09:51 So whatever assignment I have, I try to be content
00:09:53 and view any differences as an opportunity for me to learn
00:09:57 about the various aspects, unique personalities,
00:10:01 and qualities of my brothers and sisters.
00:10:04 Now, as you look back on your rich spiritual life,
00:10:07 is there a memory you can share with us?
00:10:09 Proverbs 10:22 says:
00:10:12 “The blessing of Jehovah —that is what makes [one] rich.”
00:10:15 I feel as if I have been enriched
00:10:17 in so many ways with so many memories.
00:10:20 One memory is being able to assist
00:10:23 in the former Jamaica branch for over 19 years.
00:10:26 Working together with the brothers
00:10:29 was such a unique privilege
00:10:31 and was really encouraging.
00:10:33 To see the brothers exhibit their faith and loyalty to Jehovah
00:10:37 despite various challenging circumstances
00:10:40 was a true encouragement for us.
00:10:43 We made many friends in that assignment,
00:10:45 and we continue to keep in touch to this day.
00:10:47 That is a nice memory.
00:10:49 Thanks for sharing that with us.
00:10:51 Finally, we’d like to talk to Sister Sunny Cheiky.
00:10:54 Sister Cheiky, can you tell us how you got the truth
00:10:56 and then entered the full-time ministry?
00:10:58 My mother raised me and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.
00:11:02 It was difficult for her because my father left the truth
00:11:06 and our family when we were very young.
00:11:08 But she set a very good example for us.
00:11:11 And then because of the encouragement of young pioneers in our congregation,
00:11:15 I began regular pioneering in the Pasadena, California, Congregation
00:11:19 after I graduated from high school in 1962.
00:11:24 And how did that lead to Bethel service?
00:11:26 I served in a few other areas where the need was great
00:11:29 in New Mexico, northern California,
00:11:32 a special pioneer assignment in Iowa,
00:11:34 and then a small congregation in Mississippi.
00:11:37 Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite,
00:11:39 and he came down to Mississippi to dedicate a Kingdom Hall.
00:11:43 In May 1981, we met;
00:11:46 seven months later, we were married,
00:11:50 and we were accepted to serve as a couple at Bethel.
00:11:52 Nice.
00:11:54 What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:11:56 I was a housekeeper for my first three years,
00:11:58 and now I’ve been in laundry for 35 years.
00:12:01 I did have a part-time assignment in grounds maintenance for a while,
00:12:06 but now I joyfully serve full-time in the Wallkill laundry.
00:12:10 Now, you too have a demanding schedule.
00:12:12 Can you explain one challenge?
00:12:14 Meeting so many wonderful friends  in our assignments,
00:12:16 I like to keep in touch with them.
00:12:18 But time is so limited,
00:12:20 so I feel that that can be overwhelming at times.
00:12:24 So, what practical thing have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:12:27 Well, I love to write cards and send letters,
00:12:29 so that’s how I deal with this.
00:12:31 To be able to keep in touch with my friends —that really helps a lot.
00:12:36 So, what has helped you to be balanced despite your busy schedule?
00:12:39 I loved the March 2016 broadcast that stressed three things.
00:12:44 The first is count your blessings.
00:12:46 We are a part of an amazing organization
00:12:48 that is carrying on the most meaningful work of preaching and teaching.
00:12:53 The second is look at the big picture.
00:12:56 When I feel stressed out,
00:12:58 I try to put things in the right perspective
00:13:00 —Jehovah’s sovereignty first, foremost, and not focusing on myself—
00:13:05 and that helps me to keep calm.
00:13:09 And third is get enough rest.
00:13:12 Without enough rest, I can’t think straight
00:13:14 and even ordinary activities in my routine
00:13:18 seem overwhelming, or too much.
00:13:20 That’s very practical.
00:13:22 Now, is there a particular experience you’d like to share with us?
00:13:25 When I was special pioneering in Iowa,
00:13:27 I married a brother who was a pioneer
00:13:30 and then became an elder,
00:13:32 and so I continued in the congregation as a regular pioneer.
00:13:36 After several years, he became an apostate,
00:13:39 and he tried to encourage me to go with him; but I refused.
00:13:43 The elders made great efforts to help him to recover,
00:13:48 but he was persistent in carrying out his course.
00:13:52 So in time, he separated from me and ended the marriage.
00:13:56 But I felt Jehovah’s support in so many ways.
00:14:00 One in particular was a couple who would call me often,
00:14:04 and they would have me to their home,
00:14:06 and they never wanted me to feel alone.
00:14:08 Then another blessing came later when I moved to Mississippi,
00:14:12 and I became partners with a sister who was 20 years older than me.
00:14:17 She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,
00:14:20 and she had been special pioneering for 30 years.
00:14:23 So you can imagine she was a tremendous help to me.
00:14:26 More blessings came later
00:14:29 when I married Tom and began serving at Bethel.
00:14:32 So feeling Jehovah’s support in a difficult time
00:14:35 and experiencing his blessings is unforgettable.
00:14:38 Sister Cheiky, thank you so much for sharing that experience with us.
00:14:43 In the introduction, we referenced the example of Phoebe,
00:14:46 that faithful Christian sister.
00:14:49 Interestingly, our Kingdom song number 137,
00:14:52 entitled “Faithful Women, Christian Sisters,”
00:14:55 is based on the description of Phoebe at Romans 16:2.
00:14:59 The lyrics of that song remind us that our Christian sisters
00:15:03 show a faithful spirit we all can imitate,
00:15:06 and that’s true of the sisters we interviewed today.
00:15:09 The song concludes with the words:
00:15:12 “Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you  firm in your conviction,
00:15:17 your prize is drawing near.”
00:15:20 How we appreciate the example set by all of our faithful Christian sisters!
00:15:27 Thank you, Brother Myers.
00:15:29 We thank you sisters as well.
00:15:32 There are so many faithful wives around the world who support their husbands
00:15:37 who are putting Kingdom interests first.
00:15:39 We thank you and pray for all of you.
00:15:45 Now we have the pleasure of hearing
00:15:47 from another member of the Governing Body,
00:15:49 Brother Gerrit Lösch.
00:15:51 He will speak on the subject “We Do Not Give Up.”
00:15:57 Brother Lösch, we look forward to your discussion.
00:16:02 Some of us have been in the truth for 40 years,
00:16:05 50 years, 60 years, or more.
00:16:09 During our life, we may have been confronted
00:16:12 with various tests, or challenges.
00:16:15 Still, we did not and “we do not give up”
00:16:19 the truth and our precious relationship with our heavenly Father.
00:16:24 Also, we do not give up preaching the Word of God.
00:16:29 Second Corinthians 4:16
00:16:33 is the theme scripture I’ve selected for this talk.
00:16:37 Please locate that with me
00:16:39 —2 Corinthians 4:16.
00:16:45 It says: “Therefore, we do not give up,
00:16:50 “but even if the man we are outside is wasting away,
00:16:53 certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.”
00:17:00 As it said, “we do not give up,”
00:17:04 and we do not give in when it comes to temptations.
00:17:08 First Peter 3:6 encourages us
00:17:11 to “not give in to fear.”
00:17:16 Deuteronomy 13:6-8 tells the Israelites
00:17:19 that when a false prophet becomes active,
00:17:22 “you must not give in to him or listen to him.”
00:17:28 In the Sermon on the Mount, according to an alternate rendering,
00:17:32 Jesus told his listeners to pray to Jehovah
00:17:35 to “not allow us to give in to temptation.”
00:17:41 On one occasion, Peter encouraged others
00:17:45 —1 Peter 3:6: “Do not give in to fear.”
00:17:51 We do give ear when somebody gives us good counsel;
00:17:55 we give serious thought
00:17:58 when somebody wants to help us;
00:18:01 we give comfort to those in need.
00:18:05 In the first century, Paul gave comfort
00:18:07 to the congregation in Corinth.
00:18:11 Please find 2 Corinthians 4:1
00:18:14 with me, and we can read it together.
00:18:18 And it says there:
00:18:23 “Therefore,
00:18:25 “since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us,
00:18:30 we do not give up.”
00:18:34 So who were the “we”?
00:18:37 The anointed.
00:18:39 Second Corinthians 3:3
00:18:44 tells the Corinthians
00:18:47 (they are the words of Paul)
00:18:49 that they are like “a letter of Christ
00:18:52 “written by [him and his friends] as ministers,
00:18:55 inscribed . . . with the spirit of [our] living God.”
00:19:00 The apostle, then, in verse 5, humbly acknowledges
00:19:04 that the fact that he and the Corinthians
00:19:07 ‘were qualified came from God’
00:19:09 and, in verse 6,
00:19:12 that he “has . . . adequately qualified [Christians]
00:19:15 to be ministers of a new covenant.”
00:19:20 What did Paul refer to when he said in verse 1
00:19:24 “since we have this ministry”?
00:19:28 He referred to the ministry of that “new covenant”
00:19:32 of which he was just talking about.
00:19:35 Please follow the reading
00:19:38 of 2 Corinthians 3:5, 6,
00:19:43 where it says:
00:19:45 “Not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified
00:19:49 “to consider that anything comes from us,
00:19:52 “but our being adequately qualified comes from God,
00:19:57 “who has indeed adequately qualified us
00:20:00 “to be ministers of a new covenant,
00:20:05 not of a written code, but of spirit.”
00:20:10 At 2 Corinthians 3:18, he says
00:20:14 “and all of us, while we . . . reflect like mirrors
00:20:18 the glory of Jehovah.”
00:20:21 Well, who did he refer to when he wrote “all of us”?
00:20:25 He meant all of the anointed.
00:20:29 In chapter 4, verse 1, he says
00:20:32 “therefore, since we have this ministry
00:20:35 through the mercy that was shown us.”
00:20:38 The expression “therefore”
00:20:41 refers back to the reason and motivation
00:20:44 for the anointed not to give up.
00:20:48 In chapter 3, verse 18, he refers to the anointed
00:20:52 as being “transformed . . .
00:20:54 from one degree of glory to another,”
00:20:57 culminating in the glory they receive when entering heaven.
00:21:03 Since the anointed are progressing “from glory to glory,”
00:21:07 until going to heaven,
00:21:09 they have a strong motivation
00:21:11 not to give up but to endure,
00:21:15 since there is such a precious prize, or reward, ahead of them.
00:21:21 Understandably, Paul said in chapter 4, verse 1:
00:21:26 “Therefore, . . . we do not give up.”
00:21:31 Also in 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul wrote:
00:21:35 “Therefore, we do not give up.”
00:21:39 In the third chapter, Paul contrasts
00:21:42 the old covenant that was “stripped of glory”
00:21:45 with the new covenant that would (like verses 10 and 11 say)
00:21:50 excel with greater glory
00:21:52 —a glory that would remain.
00:21:56 And 2 Corinthians 3:12 says
00:21:59 “since we have such a hope.”
00:22:02 What hope?
00:22:04 The heavenly hope.
00:22:06 Did you note the similarity with chapter 4, verse 1?
00:22:10 It said “since we have this ministry.”
00:22:15 What ministry was Paul referring to?
00:22:18 Was he referring to the field ministry in a general sense?
00:22:22 No.
00:22:24 He referred to the ministry of the new covenant.
00:22:29 In chapter 4, verse 7,
00:22:31 he then calls the ministry of the new covenant
00:22:34 a “treasure.”
00:22:37 “Since we have this [treasure],” he said.
00:22:41 It’s not just any treasure.
00:22:44 It was a great incentive for the anointed in the first century
00:22:48 not to give up in view of this treasure of the new covenant
00:22:53 that involves progressive glory.
00:22:57 Paul wrote: “Therefore, we do not give up.”
00:23:02 Also, the context of the next verses
00:23:05 shows that Paul was writing about the heavenly calling
00:23:09 that the new covenant made possible.
00:23:12 What Paul wrote is a strong incentive for the anointed today
00:23:18 not to give up.
00:23:21 What about the “great crowd” of “other sheep”?
00:23:24 Paul did not have the great crowd in mind
00:23:27 when he wrote the words of 2 Corinthians chapters 3 and 4.
00:23:33 In the introduction to his letter,
00:23:35 he referred to “all the holy ones.”
00:23:40 In 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22, he says:
00:23:44 “Who anointed us is God.
00:23:47 He has also put his seal on us.”
00:23:52 However, the great crowd is a recipient
00:23:55 of the radiant blessings of the ministry of the new covenant.
00:24:00 Some time ago, The Watchtower
00:24:02 made a general application in principle to the great crowd.
00:24:07 Just like the anointed have
00:24:09 the treasure of the new covenant and its ministry,
00:24:13 the great crowd also considers
00:24:15 their ministry a treasure.
00:24:19 The great crowd is also determined not to give up
00:24:22 in view of the beautiful hope
00:24:25 to live forever in Paradise on earth.
00:24:29 And all of us, no matter what hope,
00:24:32 have to endure.
00:24:35 Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 4:8
00:24:39 that “we are hard-pressed”
00:24:42 —some more than others.
00:24:45 Please find Psalm 90:10.
00:24:51 None of us are exempt from the pressures
00:24:54 that can cause discouragement.
00:24:59 And it says there:
00:25:01 “The span of our life is 70 years,
00:25:04 “or 80 if one is especially strong.
00:25:07 “But they are filled with trouble and sorrow;
00:25:10 they quickly pass by, and away we fly.”
00:25:16 Because of the pressures of life and disappointments,
00:25:20 most of us grow weary at times.
00:25:22 But we must remember that God never promised
00:25:25 that we would have a problem-free life in this old system.
00:25:30 Even in the first century, God’s servants faced adversities,
00:25:33 including persecution and poverty.
00:25:37 Jehovah does allow his servants
00:25:39 to be tempted and tested.
00:25:42 For the time of the end, he also foretold
00:25:45 “earthquakes,” wars,
00:25:47 increased lawlessness, and “pestilences”
00:25:51 according to Luke 21:11.
00:25:55 In Revelation, he foretold
00:25:57 that a figurative horseman on the “pale horse”
00:26:00 would kill a large amount of people.
00:26:03 This has happened for decades
00:26:06 but started with the Spanish flu at the end of World War I,
00:26:10 where an estimated 500 million were affected
00:26:15 —one third of mankind of that time—
00:26:18 and about 50 million died.
00:26:22 Satan exploits our moments of discouragement
00:26:25 just as a lion takes advantage of an animal when it is most vulnerable.
00:26:30 But we will not give up!
00:26:33 We will not give up if others disappoint us.
00:26:37 In Bible times, even the most faithful servants of Jehovah
00:26:41 may have felt weighed down at times.
00:26:45 “I have grown weary with my sighing,”
00:26:48 wrote David.
00:26:50 “All night long I make my couch swim;
00:26:54 with my tears I make my own divan overflow.”
00:26:59 Why did David feel that way?
00:27:02 “Because of all those showing hostility to me,”
00:27:05 he explained.
00:27:07 The hurtful actions of others caused David such pain of heart
00:27:11 that his tears flowed freely.
00:27:14 Still, David did not draw away from Jehovah
00:27:18 because of what fellow humans had done to him
00:27:22 —and neither do we!
00:27:26 Similarly, the words or actions of others
00:27:29 may cause us much pain of heart.
00:27:32 “There exists the one speaking thoughtlessly
00:27:35 as with the stabs of a sword,” says Proverbs 12:18.
00:27:40 When the thoughtless one is a Christian brother or sister,
00:27:44 the stab wound can go deep.
00:27:47 The human tendency may be to take offense,
00:27:50 perhaps harboring resentment.
00:27:53 This is especially true if we feel
00:27:55 that we have been treated unkindly or unjustly.
00:27:59 We may find it hard to talk to the offender.
00:28:03 We might even deliberately avoid him or her.
00:28:07 Weighed down with resentment, some have given up
00:28:12 and have stopped coming to Christian meetings.
00:28:16 How can we avoid playing into the Devil’s hands
00:28:20 when others disappoint or hurt us?
00:28:24 We must try not to harbor resentment.
00:28:27 It can hurt us so much that we start suffering from depression.
00:28:32 Instead of giving in to depression or aggression,
00:28:36 take the initiative to make peace
00:28:39 or settle matters as quickly as possible.
00:28:43 Colossians 3:13 urges us:
00:28:46 “Continue . . . forgiving one another freely
00:28:50 . . . if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.”
00:28:57 We do not have to fall prey to Satan.
00:29:00 Jehovah and Jesus are on our  side.
00:29:04 How can we find encouragement to endure?
00:29:07 Jehovah deeply cares about those who may be discouraged.
00:29:12 Acts 17:27 shows
00:29:15 that “he is not far off from each one of us.”
00:29:19 Jehovah comforts and strengthens us
00:29:22 through loving brothers and through his spirit and his Word.
00:29:27 Reading the Bible daily
00:29:29 and meditating upon it helps.
00:29:33 The publications have encouraged us
00:29:35 to read the Bible through once a year.
00:29:39 Why not make it your resolve to try such a program?
00:29:45 Nasho Dori, an anointed brother from Albania
00:29:49 who persevered under ban, said:
00:29:52 ‘My goal was to read the Bible
00:29:54 ‘for at least one hour each day,
00:29:57 ‘which I did for some 60 years
00:30:00 before my eyesight failed.’
00:30:04 Was he bragging when saying this?
00:30:07 No.
00:30:08 It helped him not to give up
00:30:10 under the extreme Communist dictatorship.
00:30:15 We do not necessarily expect you
00:30:17 to read the Bible for one hour each day,
00:30:20 but we encourage you to read it through in one year
00:30:24 and to read it slowly enough that you can meditate on it.
00:30:29 About 20 minutes a day provides ample opportunity
00:30:32 to read and meditate on what you read.
00:30:36 If you read so you hear your own voice,
00:30:39 it will help you to read slower and to meditate.
00:30:45 We also find encouragement through his organization
00:30:48 —things we read in the literature or magazines.
00:30:51 And we greatly benefit from the congregation meetings.
00:30:56 We also benefit from sweet association with our brothers
00:31:00 —be it live or via television.
00:31:03 So do not give up!
00:31:08 Elders, when they shepherd,
00:31:10 are also a big help for many to persevere.
00:31:14 Publishers in our congregation do a lot to strengthen us.
00:31:19 According to Hebrews 10:25, it is God’s will
00:31:23 that we keep “encouraging one another,”
00:31:26 and doing so is more urgent now than ever before.
00:31:31 Let us always keep in mind the inspired words
00:31:34 of 2 Thessalonians 3:13:
00:31:38 “For your part, brothers,
00:31:41 do not give up in doing good.”
00:31:45 Galatians 6:9 similarly says:
00:31:48 “Let us not give up in doing what is fine,
00:31:52 for in due time we will reap.”
00:31:56 What do we conclude from this?
00:31:59 It is in the words of our theme text,
00:32:01 2 Corinthians 4:16:
00:32:04 “We do not give up”!
00:32:09 Thank you, Brother Lösch.
00:32:11 May we all be determined to follow
00:32:14 that Scriptural advice and not give up,
00:32:17 no matter what we face ahead during these last days.
00:32:21 And we’d like to remind all of you
00:32:24 that the concluding segment of the annual meeting
00:32:27 will be posted on February 1, 2021,
00:32:30 right here on JW Broadcasting®.

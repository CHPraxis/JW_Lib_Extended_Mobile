00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are happy to continue

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the annual meeting program.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now have with us Brother Len Myers,

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will conduct an interview
with wives of Branch Committee members

00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the United States.

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Myers, please.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:27.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The accounts of faithful women
are found throughout the Bible.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One faithful Christian sister
is mentioned by the apostle Paul

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 16:1, 2.

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he mentions Phoebe,

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ‘proved herself to be
a defender of many, including Paul.’

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re blessed
to be able to get to know

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful Christian sisters
who share something unique.

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them are wives of brothers

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:52.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve as members
of the United States Branch Committee.

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Snyder,
we’d like to get to know more about you.

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you, please,
first tell us how you got the truth?

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was introduced to the truth by my parents.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah used the example of my sister

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the nurturing love of older ones

00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregations to draw me to him.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then how did you start
in the full-time ministry

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then into Bethel service?

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was a bit of a test.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my late teens,
a friend of mine died,

00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I couldn’t understand
why Jehovah would allow this

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to happen to such a kind person.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do deeper research
on the issue of universal sovereignty.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this not only comforted me,

00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it caused me to reevaluate my priorities

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see if I

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly believed Jehovah would take care of me

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I really put him first.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started pioneering
and put college on hold.

00:01:50.297 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t long before I was broke

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the rent was coming due.

00:01:54.927 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the next meeting,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quietly put my last $50
in the contribution box

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought:
‘That’s it, done, doesn’t work.

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going back to school.’

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that evening,

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that Matthew 6:33
is undeniably true.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah surprised me

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cared for all my needs
from the most unlikely sources,

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he hasn’t stopped caring for me since.

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you joined Troy
in Bethel service later on, right?

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:30.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what assignments
have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve enjoyed housekeeping.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve really enjoyed a lot of assignments
within Transportation Department,

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was one of the thousands who worked

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Warwick and Tuxedo
construction projects.

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as the wife
of a Branch Committee member,

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a demanding schedule.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like most wives of good shepherds,

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would love
to have more time with my husband.

00:02:52.276 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s understandable.

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical things
have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, prayer, study, and meditation

00:03:00.743 --> 00:03:04.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reminded me that we’re at spiritual war.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re at war,
so our priorities have to change.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I can’t long for ideal circumstances,

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they’re coming quickly.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, it’s about advancing pure worship.

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:19.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it’s important to maintain

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:22.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a healthy and close relationship with Troy,

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:25.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my primary joy should be in Jehovah.

00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, then, second is remembering
the sacrifices that were made for me.

00:03:31.732 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years
with his best friend for me.

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:40.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also there were sisters
when I was single and pioneering

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would invite me over for lots of meals

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to go out in service.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would even send their husband

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out on freezing cold, dark nights
to fix my car,

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which broke down often.

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m grateful,

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the main way I can show this appreciation

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to imitate their examples.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with challenges come blessings.

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:06.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s one blessing you enjoy
as the wife of a Branch Committee member?

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Increased peace

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from having complete confidence

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how Jehovah directs
and blesses the decisions

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his organization makes
through the Governing Body.

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:24.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I were not married
to a Branch Committee member,

00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I may never have known

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how much the brothers
rely on Jehovah’s spirit

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much time they spend

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—long periods of time—
in prayer

00:04:34.628 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much
they deeply, deeply love the friends.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m embarrassed

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:44.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how much worrying
I’ve done in the past about these things.

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:48.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now it’s a lot easier
to just be supportive

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen, obey, and be blessed.

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you look back

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your rich spiritual life
in Jehovah’s service,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there an experience you can share with us?

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were visiting a small branch
in a developing country

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been ravaged
by decades of civil war.

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d never seen poverty like that before.

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one evening,
I went into the dining room

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:12.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gather dinner for us.

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:14.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before getting the dinner,

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped and talked
to a lovely young brother.

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, I turned around
and noticed that all the food had been taken.

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “There’s no more food.”

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this young brother hadn’t eaten either.

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:29.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he just shrugged and said,
“It’s just hunger,”

00:05:29.558 --> 00:05:32.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued zealously talking
about his assignment.

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this brother was a commuter
and very thin,

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:40.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so it was likely
that he might not eat that night

00:05:40.027 --> 00:05:42.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even the next morning.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way his face glowed
when he talked about his assignment,

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:52.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was clear that his joy
was not based on anything physical

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:54.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the lack of anything physical.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:57.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I really treasure this lesson

00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:02.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s made me want to appreciate more
what I do have currently

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to imitate his example in focusing
on what’s truly important.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think you told me
that he did get some food that night,

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:11.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’re happy about that.

00:06:11.725 --> 00:06:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for letting us get to know you
and for sharing that experience.

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:18.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’d like to get to know
Sister Shirrell Georges.

00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:21.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Georges,
can you tell us how you got the truth?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 11, my mother started to study.

00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:29.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister studied
with my two sisters and me

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:32.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the book
<i>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</i>

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:36.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two years later, on November 13, 1971,

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:40.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother, my oldest sister, and I
were baptized.

00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:42.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you start in the full-time ministry?

00:06:44.174 --> 00:06:46.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we temporary, or vacation, pioneered,
as it was called then.

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:54.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led me to want
to regular pioneer after high school.

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:59.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, after graduating,
I started working full-time.

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was at a district convention
where the point was made,

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:07.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you’re not pioneering, tell Jehovah why.’

00:07:07.948 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I really didn’t have a good reason.

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:14.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started making plans to work part-time.

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:16.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was in September of 1980

00:07:16.248 --> 00:07:19.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I realized my goal
of regular pioneering.

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:21.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:07:21.586 --> 00:07:23.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While pioneering,

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the opportunity to assist

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall
renovation project on Thursdays.

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:30.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one Thursday that I learned

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an announcement made at Bethel:

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters could now commute.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after a while,
I turned in my application

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:41.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started commuting
in November of 1987.

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before commuting, I had met Luther.

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:46.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to court, and then later,

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:49.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were married
and accepted as a couple to Bethel.

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:51.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what assignments
have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While commuting,
I worked in the Dry Cleaning Department

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:58.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued there after marriage.

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:02.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a short time, I worked
with the Brooklyn Warehouse Department.

00:08:02.085 --> 00:08:05.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Luther and I
received a surprise assignment.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were asked to assist
at the Jamaica branch,

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:11.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting in March of 1995.

00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:13.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There I worked in alterations,

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:17.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
laundry, kitchen, housekeeping,

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shipping, and the Bethel Office.

00:08:19.895 --> 00:08:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch
merged with the United States branch.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were invited to serve
back in the United States

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—first at Patterson,
where I worked in Audio/Video Services,

00:08:31.656 --> 00:08:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now at Wallkill,
in the Service Department.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you too have a demanding schedule.

00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:43.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many of the assignments
that Luther has involve traveling.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means that we are away
from our congregation,

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:48.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes for weeks.

00:08:48.256 --> 00:08:50.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also means that we’re not able to get back

00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:54.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our return visits and Bible studies
on a weekly basis.

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:57.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical things have you done
to deal with that challenge?

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve found it helpful
to let the friends know

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we will be away.

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:04.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times we would receive a text from them:

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:06.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just saying hi.
Checking on you.

00:09:06.274 --> 00:09:08.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope you’re doing well.”

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:11.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really has helped us
to stay connected.

00:09:11.238 --> 00:09:14.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else we did
was to invite publishers

00:09:14.324 --> 00:09:17.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go with us on our return visits
and Bible studies.

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, whenever we were away,
they could keep the interest going.

00:09:21.498 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good idea.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good habits did you form early in life

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help you now
as you support your husband?

00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:31.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up, my mother taught us to be content

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:33.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to share whatever we had.

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One <i>Watchtower</i>  article stated:

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:40.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“True contentment comes
from loving and being loved.”

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:42.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up in a loving family,

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:46.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then learning about Jehovah
and his love as I grew older

00:09:46.898 --> 00:09:49.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to find contentment
in Jehovah’s service.

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:53.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever assignment I have,
I try to be content

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:57.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and view any differences
as an opportunity for me to learn

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the various aspects,
unique personalities,

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:04.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and qualities of my brothers and sisters.

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:07.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you look back
on your rich spiritual life,

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there a memory
you can share with us?

00:10:09.963 --> 00:10:12.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 10:22 says:

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The blessing of Jehovah
—that is what makes [one] rich.”

00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel as if I have been enriched

00:10:17.554 --> 00:10:20.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many ways with so many memories.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One memory is being able to assist

00:10:23.518 --> 00:10:26.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the former Jamaica branch
for over 19 years.

00:10:26.855 --> 00:10:29.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working together with the brothers

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:31.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was such a unique privilege

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:33.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was really encouraging.

00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:37.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see the brothers exhibit
their faith and loyalty to Jehovah

00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:40.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite various challenging circumstances

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:43.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a true encouragement for us.

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:45.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made many friends
in that assignment,

00:10:45.248 --> 00:10:47.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we continue
to keep in touch to this day.

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:49.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a nice memory.

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:51.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:54.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we’d like to talk
to Sister Sunny Cheiky.

00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:56.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Cheiky,
can you tell us how you got the truth

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:58.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then entered the full-time ministry?

00:10:58.845 --> 00:11:02.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother raised me
and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.

00:11:02.432 --> 00:11:06.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult for her
because my father left the truth

00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:08.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our family when we were very young.

00:11:08.522 --> 00:11:11.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she set a very good example for us.

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:15.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then because of the encouragement
of young pioneers in our congregation,

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:19.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began regular pioneering
in the Pasadena, California, Congregation

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after I graduated from high school in 1962.

00:11:24.287 --> 00:11:26.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served in a few other areas
where the need was great

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in New Mexico, northern California,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special pioneer assignment in Iowa,

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:37.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then a small congregation in Mississippi.

00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:39.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite,

00:11:39.594 --> 00:11:43.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came down to Mississippi
to dedicate a Kingdom Hall.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In May 1981, we met;

00:11:46.977 --> 00:11:50.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven months later, we were married,

00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:52.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were accepted
to serve as a couple at Bethel.

00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:54.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:11:56.444 --> 00:11:58.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a housekeeper for my first three years,

00:11:58.947 --> 00:12:01.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I’ve been in laundry for 35 years.

00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:06.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did have a part-time assignment
in grounds maintenance for a while,

00:12:06.204 --> 00:12:09.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I joyfully serve full-time
in the Wallkill laundry.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you too have a demanding schedule.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:12:14.212 --> 00:12:16.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meeting so many wonderful friends 
in our assignments,

00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:18.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to keep in touch with them.

00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:20.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But time is so limited,

00:12:20.969 --> 00:12:23.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I feel that that can be
overwhelming at times.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:27.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical thing have you done
to deal with that challenge?

00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:29.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I love to write cards and send letters,

00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:31.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that’s how I deal with this.

00:12:31.813 --> 00:12:36.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be able to keep in touch with my friends
—that really helps a lot.

00:12:36.192 --> 00:12:39.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what has helped you to be balanced
despite your busy schedule?

00:12:39.237 --> 00:12:44.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved the March 2016 broadcast
that stressed three things.

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:46.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is count your blessings.

00:12:46.536 --> 00:12:48.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a part of an amazing organization

00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:53.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is carrying on the most meaningful work
of preaching and teaching.

00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:56.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second is look at the big picture.

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I feel stressed out,

00:12:58.048 --> 00:13:00.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to put things in the right perspective

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:05.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s sovereignty first, foremost,
and not focusing on myself—

00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps me to keep calm.

00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:12.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third is get enough rest.

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:14.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without enough rest,
I can’t think straight

00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even ordinary activities in my routine

00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:20.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem overwhelming, or too much.

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:22.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very practical.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is there a particular experience
you’d like to share with us?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was special pioneering in Iowa,

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:30.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married a brother who was a pioneer

00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:32.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then became an elder,

00:13:32.832 --> 00:13:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I continued in the congregation
as a regular pioneer.

00:13:36.753 --> 00:13:39.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After several years, he became an apostate,

00:13:39.964 --> 00:13:43.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he tried to encourage me
to go with him; but I refused.

00:13:43.843 --> 00:13:48.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders made great efforts
to help him to recover,

00:13:48.848 --> 00:13:52.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was persistent
in carrying out his course.

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in time, he separated from me
and ended the marriage.

00:13:56.773 --> 00:14:00.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I felt Jehovah’s support in so many ways.

00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:04.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One in particular was a couple
who would call me often,

00:14:04.155 --> 00:14:06.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would have me to their home,

00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:08.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they never wanted me to feel alone.

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:12.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then another blessing came later
when I moved to Mississippi,

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:17.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I became partners with a sister
who was 20 years older than me.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,

00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:23.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she had been special pioneering
for 30 years.

00:14:23.425 --> 00:14:26.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can imagine
she was a tremendous help to me.

00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:29.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More blessings came later

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I married Tom
and began serving at Bethel.

00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:35.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feeling Jehovah’s support
in a difficult time

00:14:35.854 --> 00:14:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiencing his blessings
is unforgettable.

00:14:38.982 --> 00:14:43.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Cheiky, thank you so much
for sharing that experience with us.

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:46.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction,
we referenced the example of Phoebe,

00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:49.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that faithful Christian sister.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:52.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, our Kingdom song number 137,

00:14:52.287 --> 00:14:55.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Faithful Women, Christian Sisters,”

00:14:55.623 --> 00:14:59.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is based on the description of Phoebe
at Romans 16:2.

00:14:59.753 --> 00:15:03.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lyrics of that song remind us
that our Christian sisters

00:15:03.173 --> 00:15:06.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show a faithful spirit we all can imitate,

00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s true of the sisters
we interviewed today.

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:12.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song concludes with the words:

00:15:12.265 --> 00:15:17.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you </i>
<i>firm in your conviction,</i>

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:20.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>your prize is drawing near.” </i>

00:15:20.565 --> 00:15:25.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we appreciate the example set
by all of our faithful Christian sisters!

00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:29.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Myers.

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you sisters as well.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many faithful wives
around the world who support their husbands

00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:39.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are putting Kingdom interests first.

00:15:39.751 --> 00:15:43.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you and pray for all of you.

00:15:45.423 --> 00:15:47.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have the pleasure of hearing

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:49.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from another member of the Governing Body,

00:15:49.886 --> 00:15:51.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will speak on the subject
“We Do Not Give Up.”

00:15:57.519 --> 00:16:00.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch,
we look forward to your discussion.

00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:05.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us have been in the truth
for 40 years,

00:16:05.985 --> 00:16:09.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
50 years, 60 years, or more.

00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:12.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our life, we may have been confronted

00:16:12.408 --> 00:16:15.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with various tests, or challenges.

00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we did not and “we do not give up”

00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth and our precious relationship
with our heavenly Father.

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:29.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we do not give up
preaching the Word of God.

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 4:16

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:37.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the theme scripture
I’ve selected for this talk.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate that with me

00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:16.

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:50.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Therefore, we do not give up,

00:16:50.113 --> 00:16:53.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but even if the man we are outside
is wasting away,

00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:58.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly the man we are inside
is being renewed from day to day.”

00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:04.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it said, “we do not give up,”

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:08.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we do not give in
when it comes to temptations.

00:17:08.214 --> 00:17:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:6 encourages us

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:16.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “not give in to fear.”

00:17:16.222 --> 00:17:19.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 13:6-8 tells the Israelites

00:17:19.267 --> 00:17:22.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when a false prophet becomes active,

00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:26.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you must not give in to him
or listen to him.”

00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Sermon on the Mount,
according to an alternate rendering,

00:17:32.196 --> 00:17:35.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told his listeners to pray to Jehovah

00:17:35.408 --> 00:17:40.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “not allow us to give in to temptation.”

00:17:41.998 --> 00:17:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On one occasion, Peter encouraged others

00:17:45.376 --> 00:17:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 3:6: “Do not give in to fear.”

00:17:51.257 --> 00:17:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do give ear
when somebody gives us good counsel;

00:17:55.803 --> 00:17:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give serious thought

00:17:58.181 --> 00:18:01.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when somebody wants to help us;

00:18:01.768 --> 00:18:05.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give comfort to those in need.

00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:07.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, Paul gave comfort

00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:11.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the congregation in Corinth.

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:14.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find 2 Corinthians 4:1

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with me, and we can read it together.

00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says there:

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,

00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have this ministry
through the mercy that was shown us,

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not give up.”

00:18:34.884 --> 00:18:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who were the “we”?

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The anointed.

00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 3:3

00:18:44.018 --> 00:18:47.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells the Corinthians

00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:49.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they are the words of Paul)

00:18:49.607 --> 00:18:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are like “a letter of Christ

00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:55.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“written by [him and his friends]
as ministers,

00:18:55.822 --> 00:18:59.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inscribed . . . with the spirit
of [our] living God.”

00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle, then, in verse 5,
humbly acknowledges

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:07.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the fact that he and the Corinthians

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘were qualified came from God’

00:19:09.877 --> 00:19:12.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in verse 6,

00:19:12.046 --> 00:19:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “has . . . adequately qualified
[Christians]

00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ministers of a new covenant.”

00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:24.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Paul refer to
when he said in verse 1

00:19:24.392 --> 00:19:28.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have this ministry”?

00:19:28.521 --> 00:19:32.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He referred to the ministry
of that “new covenant”

00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:35.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which he was just talking about.

00:19:35.778 --> 00:19:38.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow the reading

00:19:38.406 --> 00:19:43.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Corinthians 3:5, 6,

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:45.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:

00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:49.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not that we of ourselves
are adequately qualified

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to consider that anything comes from us,

00:19:52.962 --> 00:19:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but our being adequately qualified
comes from God,

00:19:57.341 --> 00:20:00.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who has indeed adequately qualified us

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:05.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be ministers of a new covenant,

00:20:05.266 --> 00:20:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not of a written code, but of spirit.”

00:20:10.605 --> 00:20:14.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 3:18, he says

00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all of us,
while we . . . reflect like mirrors

00:20:18.654 --> 00:20:21.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glory of Jehovah.”

00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:25.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, who did he refer to
when he wrote “all of us”?

00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:29.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He meant all of the anointed.

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, verse 1, he says

00:20:32.168 --> 00:20:35.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“therefore, since we have this ministry

00:20:35.296 --> 00:20:37.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the mercy that was shown us.”

00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “therefore”

00:20:41.135 --> 00:20:44.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refers back to the reason and motivation

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:48.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the anointed not to give up.

00:20:48.768 --> 00:20:52.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 3, verse 18,
he refers to the anointed

00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being “transformed . . .

00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:57.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one degree of glory to another,”

00:20:57.985 --> 00:21:02.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
culminating in the glory they receive
when entering heaven.

00:21:03.825 --> 00:21:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the anointed are progressing
“from glory to glory,”

00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until going to heaven,

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:11.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have a strong motivation

00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:15.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up but to endure,

00:21:15.503 --> 00:21:20.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there is such a precious prize,
or reward, ahead of them.

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:26.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understandably, Paul said
in chapter 4, verse 1:

00:21:26.764 --> 00:21:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, . . . we do not give up.”

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:35.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also in 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul wrote:

00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:38.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, we do not give up.”

00:21:39.735 --> 00:21:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third chapter, Paul contrasts

00:21:42.613 --> 00:21:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the old covenant that was “stripped of glory”

00:21:45.908 --> 00:21:50.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the new covenant that would
(like verses 10 and 11 say)

00:21:50.329 --> 00:21:52.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
excel with greater glory

00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:55.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a glory that would remain.

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:59.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 2 Corinthians 3:12 says

00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:02.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have such a hope.”

00:22:02.592 --> 00:22:04.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope?

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:06.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heavenly hope.

00:22:06.387 --> 00:22:10.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the similarity
with chapter 4, verse 1?

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:15.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said “since we have this ministry.”

00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What ministry was Paul referring to?

00:22:18.524 --> 00:22:22.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he referring to the field ministry
in a general sense?

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:24.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:22:24.197 --> 00:22:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He referred to the ministry
of the new covenant.

00:22:29.535 --> 00:22:31.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, verse 7,

00:22:31.746 --> 00:22:34.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he then calls
the ministry of the new covenant

00:22:34.498 --> 00:22:37.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a “treasure.”

00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:41.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since we have this [treasure],” he said.

00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:44.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just any treasure.

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:48.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great incentive
for the anointed in the first century

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:53.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up in view of this treasure
of the new covenant

00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:57.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that involves progressive glory.

00:22:57.021 --> 00:23:01.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote: “Therefore, we do not give up.”

00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:05.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the context of the next verses

00:23:05.988 --> 00:23:09.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that Paul was writing
about the heavenly calling

00:23:09.408 --> 00:23:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the new covenant made possible.

00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Paul wrote is a strong incentive
for the anointed today

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up.

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:24.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the “great crowd”
of “other sheep”?

00:23:24.966 --> 00:23:27.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul did not have the great crowd in mind

00:23:27.843 --> 00:23:32.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wrote the words
of 2 Corinthians chapters 3 and 4.

00:23:33.182 --> 00:23:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction to his letter,

00:23:35.184 --> 00:23:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he referred to “all the holy ones.”

00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:44.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22, he says:

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who anointed us is God.

00:23:47.655 --> 00:23:50.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has also put his seal on us.”

00:23:52.451 --> 00:23:55.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the great crowd is a recipient

00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the radiant blessings
of the ministry of the new covenant.

00:24:00.668 --> 00:24:02.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago, <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a general application in principle
to the great crowd.

00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like the anointed have

00:24:09.385 --> 00:24:13.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treasure of the new covenant
and its ministry,

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:15.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd also considers

00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:19.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their ministry a treasure.

00:24:19.353 --> 00:24:22.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great crowd is also determined
not to give up

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in view of the beautiful hope

00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:29.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live forever in Paradise on earth.

00:24:29.572 --> 00:24:32.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, no matter what hope,

00:24:32.325 --> 00:24:35.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have to endure.

00:24:35.202 --> 00:24:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 4:8

00:24:39.373 --> 00:24:42.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “we are hard-pressed”

00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:44.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some more than others.

00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:50.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Psalm 90:10.

00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:54.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of us are exempt from the pressures

00:24:54.555 --> 00:24:57.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause discouragement.

00:24:59.143 --> 00:25:01.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says there:

00:25:01.479 --> 00:25:04.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The span of our life is 70 years,

00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:07.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or 80 if one is especially strong.

00:25:07.401 --> 00:25:10.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But they are filled with trouble and sorrow;

00:25:10.946 --> 00:25:14.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they quickly pass by, and away we fly.”

00:25:16.869 --> 00:25:20.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the pressures of life
and disappointments,

00:25:20.122 --> 00:25:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of us grow weary at times.

00:25:22.792 --> 00:25:25.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we must remember
that God never promised

00:25:25.586 --> 00:25:30.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would have a problem-free life
in this old system.

00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:33.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in the first century,
God’s servants faced adversities,

00:25:33.803 --> 00:25:37.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including persecution and poverty.

00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:39.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does allow his servants

00:25:39.517 --> 00:25:42.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be tempted and tested.

00:25:42.853 --> 00:25:45.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the time of the end, he also foretold

00:25:45.398 --> 00:25:47.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“earthquakes,” wars,

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
increased lawlessness, and “pestilences”

00:25:51.487 --> 00:25:55.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 21:11.

00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Revelation, he foretold

00:25:57.326 --> 00:26:00.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a figurative horseman
on the “pale horse”

00:26:00.955 --> 00:26:03.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would kill a large amount of people.

00:26:03.874 --> 00:26:06.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has happened for decades

00:26:06.335 --> 00:26:10.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but started with the Spanish flu
at the end of World War I,

00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:15.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where an estimated 500 million were affected

00:26:15.094 --> 00:26:18.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one third of mankind of that time—

00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:21.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about 50 million died.

00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:25.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan exploits our moments of discouragement

00:26:25.938 --> 00:26:30.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as a lion takes advantage of an animal
when it is most vulnerable.

00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:33.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will not give up!

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:37.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will not give up if others disappoint us.

00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:41.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times,
even the most faithful servants of Jehovah

00:26:41.245 --> 00:26:45.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have felt weighed down at times.

00:26:45.207 --> 00:26:48.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have grown weary with my sighing,”

00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:50.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote David.

00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:54.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All night long I make my couch swim;

00:26:54.008 --> 00:26:59.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my tears I make my own divan overflow.”

00:26:59.013 --> 00:27:02.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did David feel that way?

00:27:02.141 --> 00:27:05.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of all those
showing hostility to me,”

00:27:05.978 --> 00:27:07.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he explained.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hurtful actions of others
caused David such pain of heart

00:27:11.942 --> 00:27:14.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his tears flowed freely.

00:27:14.695 --> 00:27:18.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, David did not draw away from Jehovah

00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:22.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what fellow humans had done to him

00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:24.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and neither do we!

00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:29.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, the words or actions of others

00:27:29.293 --> 00:27:31.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause us much pain of heart.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There exists the one speaking thoughtlessly

00:27:35.174 --> 00:27:39.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as with the stabs of a sword,”
says Proverbs 12:18.

00:27:40.888 --> 00:27:44.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the thoughtless one
is a Christian brother or sister,

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stab wound can go deep.

00:27:47.394 --> 00:27:50.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The human tendency may be to take offense,

00:27:50.356 --> 00:27:53.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps harboring resentment.

00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:55.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is especially true if we feel

00:27:55.361 --> 00:27:59.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have been treated unkindly
or unjustly.

00:27:59.698 --> 00:28:03.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may find it hard to talk to the offender.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might even deliberately avoid him or her.

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:12.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Weighed down with resentment,
some have given up

00:28:12.211 --> 00:28:16.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have stopped coming
to Christian meetings.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we avoid
playing into the Devil’s hands

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:24.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when others disappoint or hurt us?

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:27.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must try not to harbor resentment.

00:28:27.685 --> 00:28:32.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can hurt us so much
that we start suffering from depression.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of giving in
to depression or aggression,

00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the initiative to make peace

00:28:39.655 --> 00:28:43.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or settle matters as quickly as possible.

00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:46.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:13 urges us:

00:28:46.537 --> 00:28:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue . . . forgiving one another freely

00:28:50.666 --> 00:28:55.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . if anyone has a cause for complaint
against another.”

00:28:57.339 --> 00:29:00.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not have to fall prey to Satan.

00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:04.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are on <i>our </i> side.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we find encouragement to endure?

00:29:07.975 --> 00:29:12.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah deeply cares about those
who may be discouraged.

00:29:12.313 --> 00:29:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:27 shows

00:29:15.024 --> 00:29:18.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he is not far off from each one of us.”

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:22.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah comforts and strengthens us

through loving brothers
and through his spirit and his Word.

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:29.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading the Bible daily

00:29:29.747 --> 00:29:33.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating upon it helps.

00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:35.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publications have encouraged us

00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:39.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Bible through once a year.

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not make it your resolve

‘My goal was to read the Bible

‘for at least one hour each day,

‘which I did for some 60 years

before my eyesight failed.’

00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:07.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he bragging when saying this?

00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:10.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped him not to give up

under the extreme Communist dictatorship.

00:30:15.209 --> 00:30:17.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not necessarily expect you

00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:20.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Bible for one hour each day,

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:24.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we encourage you to read it through
in one year

00:30:24.718 --> 00:30:29.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to read it slowly enough
that you can meditate on it.

00:30:29.556 --> 00:30:32.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 20 minutes a day
provides ample opportunity

00:30:32.976 --> 00:30:36.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read and meditate on what you read.

00:30:36.313 --> 00:30:39.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you read so you hear your own voice,

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will help you to read slower
and to meditate.

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:48.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also find encouragement
through his organization

And we greatly benefit
from the congregation meetings.

00:31:03.382 --> 00:31:07.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do not give up!

Elders, when they shepherd,

00:31:10.597 --> 00:31:14.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also a big help for many to persevere.

00:31:14.893 --> 00:31:19.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publishers in our congregation
do a lot to strengthen us.

00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Hebrews 10:25, it is God’s will

that we keep “encouraging one another,”

00:31:26.071 --> 00:31:30.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing so is more urgent now
than ever before.

00:31:31.493 --> 00:31:34.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us always keep in mind the inspired words

00:31:34.246 --> 00:31:38.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Thessalonians 3:13:

00:31:38.917 --> 00:31:41.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For your part, brothers,

00:31:41.378 --> 00:31:45.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not give up in doing good.”

00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:48.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:9 similarly says:

00:31:48.927 --> 00:31:52.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:31:52.347 --> 00:31:55.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for in due time we will reap.”

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we conclude from this?

00:31:59.396 --> 00:32:01.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is in the words of our theme text,

00:00:01 Annual meetings of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:00:06 have been held for many years
00:00:08 —in fact, since January 1885.
00:00:12 They have been held in different states in the United States
00:00:15 and, in 1983, in Britain.
00:00:19 This year, 2020, the corporate meeting
00:00:22 is being held by videoconference.
00:00:25 The spiritual program has been recorded
00:00:28 for the benefit of the brothers all over the earth.
00:00:31 This is a historic annual meeting.
00:00:36 In the past, we have had some historic annual meetings.
00:00:40 For example,
00:00:42 at the annual meeting held on October 2, 1944, in Pittsburgh,
00:00:47 the members of the Pennsylvania corporation
00:00:50 adopted six resolutions amending its charter.
00:00:54 The charter had provided that voting shares be issued
00:00:58 to contributors of funds to the Society’s work,
00:01:02 but the third amendment eliminated that provision.
00:01:06 Thereafter, directors of the Society were to be voted into office
00:01:11 by individuals who were fully devoted to Jehovah,
00:01:15 irrespective of the amount of money that they contributed
00:01:19 to advance the Kingdom work.
00:01:23 After the historic annual meeting in 1944,
00:01:27 a vital question remained.
00:01:30 Since the Governing Body was then closely identified
00:01:34 with the Pennsylvania corporation’s seven-member board of directors,
00:01:39 did this mean that the Governing Body
00:01:42 could never be made up of more than seven anointed Christians?
00:01:48 Moreover, since the directors
00:01:50 are elected by the members of the corporation,
00:01:54 were the corporation members electing members of the Governing Body
00:01:58 at the annual meeting each year?
00:02:02 Are the directors and officers
00:02:04 of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:02:08 and the members of the Governing Body
00:02:10 one and the same, or are they different?
00:02:15 These questions were answered years later.
00:02:18 They were answered at the annual meeting held
00:02:20 on October 1, 1971
00:02:24 —another historic annual meeting.
00:02:28 On that occasion, one of the speakers pointed out
00:02:32 that the governing body preceded
00:02:35 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania
00:02:39 by hundreds of years.
00:02:42 Now, despite some who opposed Jehovah
00:02:45 and the earthly part of his organization
00:02:47 and who claimed there was no governing body in the first century
00:02:51 and hence saw no need for a Governing Body today,
00:02:54 a governing body was formed at Pentecost of 33 C.E.,
00:02:59 more than 18 centuries
00:03:01 before the Pennsylvania corporation came into existence.
00:03:07 At first, the governing body consisted of 12 apostles.
00:03:11 Its number was enlarged later,
00:03:14 for “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem” were taking the lead.
00:03:19 Now notice what happened later
00:03:22 here in the Bible book of Acts
00:03:26 in chapter 15.
00:03:28 So other issues had been handled by the 12 apostles,
00:03:32 but now with this circumcision issue
00:03:35 that came up among the congregations,
00:03:39 notice what we read here in verse 2 of Acts 15:
00:03:43 “But after quite a bit of dissension and disputing
00:03:47 “by Paul and Barnabas with them,
00:03:49 “it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others
00:03:53 “to go up to the apostles
00:03:56 “and elders in Jerusalem
00:03:59 regarding this issue.”
00:04:02 So the issue was going to be settled by the first-century governing body.
00:04:06 And now it’s larger than the apostles;
00:04:09 it included the elders and the apostles
00:04:13 in Jerusalem.
00:04:15 Now, what is the benefit
00:04:17 of following the direction from the governing body in the first century
00:04:22 and, by extension, today?
00:04:24 Notice that at Acts 16:4, 5,
00:04:29 they’re carrying the decree there.
00:04:31 And it mentions: “As they traveled on through the cities,
00:04:34 “they would deliver to them for observance
00:04:38 “the decrees that had been decided on
00:04:40 “by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.
00:04:44 “[Now notice.]
00:04:46 “Then, indeed, the congregations
00:04:49 “continued to be made firm in the faith
00:04:52 and to increase in number day by day.”
00:04:56 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:04:58 There was a governing body.
00:05:00 They didn’t have a need for legal entities
00:05:04 to advance the Kingdom work in the first century,
00:05:07 but they did indeed need a governing body.
00:05:13 As long as conditions in this world permit,
00:05:16 the Governing Body will make use of legal entities.
00:05:20 If a legal entity is dissolved by government decree,
00:05:24 the preaching work will still go on.
00:05:28 Even now, in lands where restrictions are in effect
00:05:31 and no legal entities are used,
00:05:34 the Kingdom message is being proclaimed,
00:05:36 disciples are being made,
00:05:38 and theocracy’s increase continues.
00:05:43 In the midst of this pandemic, the preaching continues.
00:05:48 Many experiences are happening globally.
00:05:51 Now, one I received and confirmed
00:05:53 from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel,
00:05:56 I think you’ll appreciate.
00:05:58 So much is going on and so many nice experiences.
00:06:02 A health-care system that operates
00:06:05 dozens of hospitals across the United States,
00:06:08 and many of them were COVID hot spots,
00:06:10 wanted to publish a video interview
00:06:13 featuring two frontline health-care workers in one of the hospitals.
00:06:18 Well, it happened that the two nurses they chose for the interviews
00:06:22 were our brothers.
00:06:24 They were asked to supply pictures of their families.
00:06:28 One of the pictures had been taken before the pandemic
00:06:31 in front of a paradise scene in one of our Assembly Halls.
00:06:35 Now, the woman coordinating the video interviews
00:06:38 told the brother that she recognized that scene.
00:06:42 So he asked her if she was a Witness.
00:06:45 She replied: “No, but I studied with the Witnesses,
00:06:49 “and I know it’s the truth.
00:06:51 I can see how close we are to the end.”
00:06:55 The brother then told her that she’d be happy to know
00:06:59 that the second nurse whom she had interviewed the day before
00:07:03 was also a Witness.
00:07:06 Then the woman burst into tears.
00:07:10 She said it made sense that the two nurses selected for this interview
00:07:15 would both be Witnesses.
00:07:18 “I can see it in your approach
00:07:20 and in the belief in something bigger than this.”
00:07:23 And she said she planned to resume her Bible study.
00:07:27 So we pray for this woman and all the wonderful experiences happening
00:07:32 as the preaching goes on during this pandemic.
00:07:36 So this is all happening because Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:07:39 plant and water
00:07:42 and “God [keeps] making it grow.”
00:07:45 All glory goes to Jehovah.
00:07:49 At this meeting, as was pointed out last year
00:07:52 with the announcement about the Ramapo project,
00:07:55 you will learn that the faithful slave is not slowing down.
00:08:00 We have more work to do until Jehovah says
00:08:03 the preaching work is finished.
00:08:07 As we look to the future, we are confident
00:08:10 that Jehovah will care for the spiritual and material needs of his people.
00:08:14 He and his Son, Jesus Christ, will continue to provide
00:08:18 the heavenly direction and support needed
00:08:21 to complete the Kingdom preaching work.
00:08:23 We therefore beg Jehovah for his spirit
00:08:26 to finish the work he has given us.

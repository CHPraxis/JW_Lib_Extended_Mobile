00:00:01 The accounts of faithful women are found throughout the Bible.
00:00:05 One faithful Christian sister is mentioned by the apostle Paul
00:00:08 at Romans 16:1, 2.
00:00:11 There he mentions Phoebe,
00:00:13 who ‘proved herself to be a defender of many, including Paul.’
00:00:18 Today, we’re blessed to be able to get to know
00:00:21 faithful Christian sisters who share something unique.
00:00:25 All of them are wives of brothers
00:00:27 who serve as members of the United States Branch Committee.
00:00:30 Sister Snyder, we’d like to get to know more about you.
00:00:33 Can you, please, first tell us how you got the truth?
00:00:35 I was introduced to the truth by my parents.
00:00:39 And Jehovah used the example of my sister
00:00:42 and the nurturing love of older ones
00:00:44 in the congregations to draw me to him.
00:00:48 Then how did you start in the full-time ministry
00:00:50 and then into Bethel service?
00:00:52 Well, it was a bit of a test.
00:00:54 When I was in my late teens, a friend of mine died,
00:00:57 and I couldn’t understand why Jehovah would allow this
00:01:00 to happen to such a kind person.
00:01:03 So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me
00:01:07 to do deeper research on the issue of universal sovereignty.
00:01:10 And this not only comforted me,
00:01:13 but it caused me to reevaluate my priorities
00:01:16 and to see if I
00:01:18 truly believed Jehovah would take care of me
00:01:22 if I really put him first.
00:01:24 So I started pioneering and put college on hold.
00:01:28 And it wasn’t long before I was broke
00:01:31 and the rent was coming due.
00:01:33 And so the next meeting,
00:01:36 I quietly put my last $50 in the contribution box
00:01:40 and thought: ‘That’s it, done, doesn’t work.
00:01:42 I’m going back to school.’
00:01:45 But that evening,
00:01:47 I learned that Matthew 6:33 is undeniably true.
00:01:52 Jehovah surprised me
00:01:54 and cared for all my needs from the most unlikely sources,
00:01:59 and he hasn’t stopped caring for me since.
00:02:02 And then you joined Troy in Bethel service later on, right?
00:02:06 Now, what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:02:08 I’ve enjoyed housekeeping.
00:02:10 I’ve really enjoyed a lot of assignments within Transportation Department,
00:02:14 and I was one of the thousands who worked
00:02:16 on the Warwick and Tuxedo construction projects.
00:02:19 Now, as the wife of a Branch Committee member,
00:02:21 you have a demanding schedule.
00:02:23 Can you explain one challenge?
00:02:26 Well, like most wives of good shepherds,
00:02:28 I would love to have more time with my husband.
00:02:30 That’s understandable.
00:02:32 So, what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:02:36 Well, prayer, study, and meditation
00:02:39 have reminded me that we’re at spiritual war.
00:02:43 And we’re at war, so our priorities have to change.
00:02:47 So I can’t long for ideal circumstances,
00:02:50 although they’re coming quickly.
00:02:52 Right now, it’s about advancing pure worship.
00:02:56 And while it’s important to maintain
00:02:58 a healthy and close relationship with Troy,
00:03:01 my primary joy should be in Jehovah.
00:03:04 And, then, second is remembering the sacrifices that were made for me.
00:03:10 Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years with his best friend for me.
00:03:14 And also there were sisters when I was single and pioneering
00:03:19 who would invite me over for lots of meals
00:03:22 and to go out in service.
00:03:24 They would even send their husband
00:03:26 out on freezing cold, dark nights to fix my car,
00:03:29 which broke down often.
00:03:31 So I’m grateful,
00:03:33 and the main way I can show this appreciation
00:03:39 is to imitate their examples.
00:03:40 Now, with challenges come blessings.
00:03:42 What’s one blessing you enjoy as the wife of a Branch Committee member?
00:03:46 Increased peace
00:03:48 that comes from having complete confidence
00:03:52 in how Jehovah directs and blesses the decisions
00:03:55 his organization makes through the Governing Body.
00:03:58 If I were not married to a Branch Committee member,
00:04:02 I may never have known
00:04:05 just how much the brothers rely on Jehovah’s spirit
00:04:08 and how much time they spend
00:04:11 —long periods of time— in prayer
00:04:13 and how much they deeply, deeply love the friends.
00:04:17 So I’m embarrassed
00:04:19 about how much worrying I’ve done in the past about these things.
00:04:22 But now it’s a lot easier to just be supportive
00:04:26 and listen, obey, and be blessed.
00:04:28 Very nice.
00:04:29 Now, as you look back
00:04:31 on your rich spiritual life in Jehovah’s service,
00:04:33 is there an experience you can share with us?
00:04:37 We were visiting a small branch in a developing country
00:04:40 that had been ravaged by decades of civil war.
00:04:42 I’d never seen poverty like that before.
00:04:45 And one evening, I went into the dining room
00:04:48 to gather dinner for us.
00:04:50 But before getting the dinner,
00:04:52 I stopped and talked to a lovely young brother.
00:04:55 At one point, I turned around and noticed that all the food had been taken.
00:04:58 And I said, “There’s no more food.”
00:05:01 Now, this young brother hadn’t eaten either.
00:05:04 But he just shrugged and said, “It’s just hunger,”
00:05:08 and he continued zealously talking about his assignment.
00:05:12 Now, this brother was a commuter and very thin,
00:05:15 and so it was likely that he might not eat that night
00:05:18 or maybe even the next morning.
00:05:20 But the way his face glowed when he talked about his assignment,
00:05:25 it was clear that his joy was not based on anything physical
00:05:30 or the lack of anything physical.
00:05:33 So I really treasure this lesson
00:05:36 because it’s made me want to appreciate more what I do have currently
00:05:41 and to imitate his example in focusing on what’s truly important.
00:05:46 And I think you told me that he did get some food that night,
00:05:47 so we’re happy about that.
00:05:50 Thanks for letting us get to know you and for sharing that experience.
00:05:54 Now we’d like to get to know Sister Shirrell Georges.
00:05:57 Sister Georges, can you tell us how you got the truth?
00:06:00 When I was 11, my mother started to study.
00:06:03 Another sister studied with my two sisters and me
00:06:07 out of the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.
00:06:10 Two years later, on November 13, 1971,
00:06:14 my mother, my oldest sister, and I were baptized.
00:06:19 How did you start in the full-time ministry?
00:06:22 As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us
00:06:24 when we temporary, or vacation, pioneered, as it was called then.
00:06:28 That led me to want to regular pioneer after high school.
00:06:32 However, after graduating, I started working full-time.
00:06:37 It was at a district convention where the point was made,
00:06:42 ‘If you’re not pioneering, tell Jehovah why.’
00:06:46 Well, I really didn’t have a good reason.
00:06:49 So I started making plans to work part-time.
00:06:52 It was in September of 1980
00:06:54 when I realized my goal of regular pioneering.
00:06:57 And how did that lead to Bethel service?
00:06:59 While pioneering,
00:07:01 I had the opportunity to assist
00:07:03 with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall renovation project on Thursdays.
00:07:06 It was one Thursday that I learned
00:07:08 of an announcement made at Bethel:
00:07:10 Sisters could now commute.
00:07:13 So after a while, I turned in my application
00:07:16 and started commuting in November of 1987.
00:07:19 But before commuting, I had met Luther.
00:07:22 We started to court, and then later,
00:07:24 we were married and accepted as a couple to Bethel.
00:07:28 And what assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:07:31 While commuting, I worked in the Dry Cleaning Department
00:07:34 and continued there after marriage.
00:07:37 For a short time, I worked with the Brooklyn Warehouse Department.
00:07:40 Then Luther and I received a surprise assignment.
00:07:44 We were asked to assist at the Jamaica branch,
00:07:47 starting in March of 1995.
00:07:49 There I worked in alterations,
00:07:52 laundry, kitchen, housekeeping,
00:07:55 shipping, and the Bethel Office.
00:07:58 Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch merged with the United States branch.
00:08:03 We were invited to serve back in the United States
00:08:06 —first at Patterson, where I worked in Audio/Video Services,
00:08:10 and now at Wallkill, in the Service Department.
00:08:13 Now, you too have a demanding schedule.
00:08:15 Can you explain one challenge?
00:08:18 Well, many of the assignments that Luther has involve traveling.
00:08:22 So that means that we are away from our congregation,
00:08:24 sometimes for weeks.
00:08:26 It also means that we’re not able to get back
00:08:28 to our return visits and Bible studies on a weekly basis.
00:08:33 So, what practical things have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:08:36 We’ve found it helpful to let the friends know
00:08:38 whenever we will be away.
00:08:40 Many times we would receive a text from them:
00:08:42 “Just saying hi. Checking on you.
00:08:44 Hope you’re doing well.”
00:08:46 This really has helped us to stay connected.
00:08:49 Something else we did was to invite publishers
00:08:52 to go with us on our return visits and Bible studies.
00:08:56 This way, whenever we were away, they could keep the interest going.
00:08:59 That’s a good idea.
00:09:01 What good habits did you form early in life
00:09:04 that help you now as you support your husband?
00:09:07 Growing up, my mother taught us to be content
00:09:09 and to share whatever we had.
00:09:12 One Watchtower  article stated:
00:09:14 “True contentment comes from loving and being loved.”
00:09:18 We grew up in a loving family,
00:09:21 and then learning about Jehovah and his love as I grew older
00:09:25 helped me to find contentment in Jehovah’s service.
00:09:29 So whatever assignment I have, I try to be content
00:09:32 and view any differences as an opportunity for me to learn
00:09:35 about the various aspects, unique personalities,
00:09:39 and qualities of my brothers and sisters.
00:09:43 Now, as you look back on your rich spiritual life,
00:09:45 is there a memory you can share with us?
00:09:48 Proverbs 10:22 says:
00:09:50 “The blessing of Jehovah —that is what makes [one] rich.”
00:09:53 I feel as if I have been enriched
00:09:55 in so many ways with so many memories.
00:09:58 One memory is being able to assist
00:10:01 in the former Jamaica branch for over 19 years.
00:10:05 Working together with the brothers
00:10:07 was such a unique privilege
00:10:09 and was really encouraging.
00:10:12 To see the brothers exhibit their faith and loyalty to Jehovah
00:10:16 despite various challenging circumstances
00:10:19 was a true encouragement for us.
00:10:21 We made many friends in that assignment,
00:10:23 and we continue to keep in touch to this day.
00:10:25 That is a nice memory.
00:10:27 Thanks for sharing that with us.
00:10:29 Finally, we’d like to talk to Sister Sunny Cheiky.
00:10:32 Sister Cheiky, can you tell us how you got the truth
00:10:35 and then entered the full-time ministry?
00:10:37 My mother raised me and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.
00:10:40 It was difficult for her because my father left the truth
00:10:44 and our family when we were very young.
00:10:46 But she set a very good example for us.
00:10:49 And then because of the encouragement of young pioneers in our congregation,
00:10:54 I began regular pioneering in the Pasadena, California, Congregation
00:10:58 after I graduated from high school in 1962.
00:11:02 And how did that lead to Bethel service?
00:11:05 I served in a few other areas where the need was great
00:11:07 in New Mexico, northern California,
00:11:10 a special pioneer assignment in Iowa,
00:11:12 and then a small congregation in Mississippi.
00:11:15 Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite,
00:11:17 and he came down to Mississippi to dedicate a Kingdom Hall.
00:11:22 In May 1981, we met;
00:11:25 seven months later, we were married,
00:11:28 and we were accepted to serve as a couple at Bethel.
00:11:31 Nice.
00:11:32 What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?
00:11:34 I was a housekeeper for my first three years,
00:11:37 and now I’ve been in laundry for 35 years.
00:11:40 I did have a part-time assignment in grounds maintenance for a while,
00:11:44 but now I joyfully serve full-time in the Wallkill laundry.
00:11:48 Now, you too have a demanding schedule.
00:11:50 Can you explain one challenge?
00:11:52 Meeting so many wonderful friends  in our assignments,
00:11:55 I like to keep in touch with them.
00:11:57 But time is so limited,
00:11:59 so I feel that that can be overwhelming at times.
00:12:03 So, what practical thing have you done to deal with that challenge?
00:12:06 Well, I love to write cards and send letters,
00:12:08 so that’s how I deal with this.
00:12:10 To be able to keep in touch with my friends —that really helps a lot.
00:12:14 So, what has helped you to be balanced despite your busy schedule?
00:12:17 I loved the March 2016 broadcast that stressed three things.
00:12:22 The first is count your blessings.
00:12:24 We are a part of an amazing organization
00:12:27 that is carrying on the most meaningful work of preaching and teaching.
00:12:31 The second is look at the big picture.
00:12:34 When I feel stressed out,
00:12:36 I try to put things in the right perspective
00:12:39 —Jehovah’s sovereignty first, foremost, and not focusing on myself—
00:12:44 and that helps me to keep calm.
00:12:47 And third is get enough rest.
00:12:50 Without enough rest, I can’t think straight
00:12:53 and even ordinary activities in my routine
00:12:56 seem overwhelming, or too much.
00:12:58 That’s very practical.
00:13:00 Now, is there a particular experience you’d like to share with us?
00:13:03 When I was special pioneering in Iowa,
00:13:06 I married a brother who was a pioneer
00:13:08 and then became an elder,
00:13:11 and so I continued in the congregation as a regular pioneer.
00:13:15 After several years, he became an apostate,
00:13:18 and he tried to encourage me to go with him; but I refused.
00:13:22 The elders made great efforts to help him to recover,
00:13:27 but he was persistent in carrying out his course.
00:13:31 So in time, he separated from me and ended the marriage.
00:13:35 But I felt Jehovah’s support in so many ways.
00:13:38 One in particular was a couple who would call me often,
00:13:42 and they would have me to their home,
00:13:44 and they never wanted me to feel alone.
00:13:47 Then another blessing came later when I moved to Mississippi,
00:13:50 and I became partners with a sister who was 20 years older than me.
00:13:55 She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,
00:13:58 and she had been special pioneering for 30 years.
00:14:01 So you can imagine she was a tremendous help to me.
00:14:05 More blessings came later
00:14:07 when I married Tom and began serving at Bethel.
00:14:10 So feeling Jehovah’s support in a difficult time
00:14:14 and experiencing his blessings is unforgettable.
00:14:17 Sister Cheiky, thank you so much for sharing that experience with us.
00:14:21 In the introduction, we referenced the example of Phoebe,
00:14:25 that faithful Christian sister.
00:14:27 Interestingly, our Kingdom song number 137,
00:14:30 entitled “Faithful Women, Christian Sisters,”
00:14:34 is based on the description of Phoebe at Romans 16:2.
00:14:38 The lyrics of that song remind us that our Christian sisters
00:14:41 show a faithful spirit we all can imitate,
00:14:45 and that’s true of the sisters we interviewed today.
00:14:48 The song concludes with the words:
00:14:50 “Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you  firm in your conviction,
00:14:55 your prize is drawing near.”
00:14:59 How we appreciate the example set by all of our faithful Christian sisters!

The accounts of faithful women
are found throughout the Bible.

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One faithful Christian sister
is mentioned by the apostle Paul

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 16:1, 2.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he mentions Phoebe,

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ‘proved herself to be
a defender of many, including Paul.’

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re blessed
to be able to get to know

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful Christian sisters
who share something unique.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them are wives of brothers

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve as members
of the United States Branch Committee.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Snyder,
we’d like to get to know more about you.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:35.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you, please,
first tell us how you got the truth?

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was introduced to the truth by my parents.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah used the example of my sister

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the nurturing love of older ones

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregations to draw me to him.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then how did you start
in the full-time ministry

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then into Bethel service?

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was a bit of a test.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was in my late teens,
a friend of mine died,

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I couldn’t understand
why Jehovah would allow this

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to happen to such a kind person.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So an elderly pioneer sister encouraged me

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do deeper research
on the issue of universal sovereignty.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this not only comforted me,

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it caused me to reevaluate my priorities

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see if I

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly believed Jehovah would take care of me

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I really put him first.

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started pioneering
and put college on hold.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wasn’t long before I was broke

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the rent was coming due.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the next meeting,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quietly put my last $50
in the contribution box

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought:
‘That’s it, done, doesn’t work.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going back to school.’

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that evening,

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that Matthew 6:33
is undeniably true.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah surprised me

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cared for all my needs
from the most unlikely sources,

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he hasn’t stopped caring for me since.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you joined Troy
in Bethel service later on, right?

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:08.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what assignments
have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve enjoyed housekeeping.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve really enjoyed a lot of assignments
within Transportation Department,

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was one of the thousands who worked

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the Warwick and Tuxedo
construction projects.

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as the wife
of a Branch Committee member,

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a demanding schedule.

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like most wives of good shepherds,

00:02:28.711 --> 00:02:30.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would love
to have more time with my husband.

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s understandable.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical things
have you done to deal with that challenge?

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, prayer, study, and meditation

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reminded me that we’re at spiritual war.

00:02:43.392 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re at war,
so our priorities have to change.

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:50.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I can’t long for ideal circumstances,

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they’re coming quickly.

00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, it’s about advancing pure worship.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it’s important to maintain

00:02:58.407 --> 00:03:00.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a healthy and close relationship with Troy,

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my primary joy should be in Jehovah.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:09.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, then, second is remembering
the sacrifices that were made for me.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah gave up 33 years
with his best friend for me.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also there were sisters
when I was single and pioneering

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would invite me over for lots of meals

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to go out in service.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would even send their husband

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out on freezing cold, dark nights
to fix my car,

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:31.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which broke down often.

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m grateful,

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:38.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the main way I can show this appreciation

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:40.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to imitate their examples.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with challenges come blessings.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:46.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s one blessing you enjoy
as the wife of a Branch Committee member?

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Increased peace

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:52.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from having complete confidence

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:55.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in how Jehovah directs
and blesses the decisions

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his organization makes
through the Governing Body.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I were not married
to a Branch Committee member,

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I may never have known

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how much the brothers
rely on Jehovah’s spirit

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much time they spend

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—long periods of time—
in prayer

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how much
they deeply, deeply love the friends.

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m embarrassed

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:22.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how much worrying
I’ve done in the past about these things.

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:26.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now it’s a lot easier
to just be supportive

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listen, obey, and be blessed.

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:29.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very nice.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you look back

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your rich spiritual life
in Jehovah’s service,

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there an experience you can share with us?

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:40.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were visiting a small branch
in a developing country

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been ravaged
by decades of civil war.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d never seen poverty like that before.

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:48.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one evening,
I went into the dining room

00:04:48.183 --> 00:04:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gather dinner for us.

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before getting the dinner,

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:55.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stopped and talked
to a lovely young brother.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, I turned around
and noticed that all the food had been taken.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “There’s no more food.”

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:04.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this young brother hadn’t eaten either.

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:08.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he just shrugged and said,
“It’s just hunger,”

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued zealously talking
about his assignment.

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this brother was a commuter
and very thin,

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so it was likely
that he might not eat that night

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even the next morning.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:25.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way his face glowed
when he talked about his assignment,

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:30.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was clear that his joy
was not based on anything physical

00:05:30.684 --> 00:05:33.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the lack of anything physical.

00:05:33.437 --> 00:05:36.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I really treasure this lesson

00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:41.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s made me want to appreciate more
what I do have currently

00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to imitate his example in focusing
on what’s truly important.

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:47.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think you told me
that he did get some food that night,

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:50.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’re happy about that.

00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:53.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for letting us get to know you
and for sharing that experience.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’d like to get to know
Sister Shirrell Georges.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Georges,
can you tell us how you got the truth?

00:06:00.088 --> 00:06:03.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 11, my mother started to study.

00:06:03.342 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sister studied
with my two sisters and me

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the book
<i>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</i>

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two years later, on November 13, 1971,

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:19.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother, my oldest sister, and I
were baptized.

00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:21.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you start in the full-time ministry?

00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:24.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teenagers, a pioneer couple assisted us

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we temporary, or vacation, pioneered,
as it was called then.

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:32.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led me to want
to regular pioneer after high school.

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:37.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, after graduating,
I started working full-time.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:42.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was at a district convention
where the point was made,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you’re not pioneering, tell Jehovah why.’

00:06:46.134 --> 00:06:49.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I really didn’t have a good reason.

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:52.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I started making plans to work part-time.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was in September of 1980

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:57.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I realized my goal
of regular pioneering.

00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:01.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While pioneering,

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:03.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the opportunity to assist

00:07:03.277 --> 00:07:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Brooklyn Assembly Hall
renovation project on Thursdays.

00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one Thursday that I learned

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an announcement made at Bethel:

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters could now commute.

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after a while,
I turned in my application

00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:19.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started commuting
in November of 1987.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:22.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before commuting, I had met Luther.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:24.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to court, and then later,

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were married
and accepted as a couple to Bethel.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what assignments
have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While commuting,
I worked in the Dry Cleaning Department

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:37.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continued there after marriage.

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:40.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a short time, I worked
with the Brooklyn Warehouse Department.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:44.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Luther and I
received a surprise assignment.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:47.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were asked to assist
at the Jamaica branch,

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting in March of 1995.

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:52.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There I worked in alterations,

00:07:52.367 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
laundry, kitchen, housekeeping,

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:58.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shipping, and the Bethel Office.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 2014, the Jamaica branch
merged with the United States branch.

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:06.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were invited to serve
back in the United States

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:10.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—first at Patterson,
where I worked in Audio/Video Services,

00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:12.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now at Wallkill,
in the Service Department.

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:15.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you too have a demanding schedule.

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:17.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:08:18.894 --> 00:08:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many of the assignments
that Luther has involve traveling.

00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means that we are away
from our congregation,

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes for weeks.

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:28.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also means that we’re not able to get back

00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:32.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our return visits and Bible studies
on a weekly basis.

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical things have you done
to deal with that challenge?

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:38.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve found it helpful
to let the friends know

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:40.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we will be away.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times we would receive a text from them:

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:44.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just saying hi.
Checking on you.

00:08:44.753 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope you’re doing well.”

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:49.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really has helped us
to stay connected.

00:08:49.716 --> 00:08:52.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else we did
was to invite publishers

00:08:52.803 --> 00:08:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go with us on our return visits
and Bible studies.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:08:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, whenever we were away,
they could keep the interest going.

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:01.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good idea.

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:04.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good habits did you form early in life

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help you now
as you support your husband?

00:09:07.442 --> 00:09:09.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up, my mother taught us to be content

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:12.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to share whatever we had.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One <i>Watchtower</i>  article stated:

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:18.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“True contentment comes
from loving and being loved.”

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:21.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We grew up in a loving family,

00:09:21.164 --> 00:09:25.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then learning about Jehovah
and his love as I grew older

00:09:25.293 --> 00:09:28.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to find contentment
in Jehovah’s service.

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whatever assignment I have,
I try to be content

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:35.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and view any differences
as an opportunity for me to learn

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:39.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the various aspects,
unique personalities,

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:43.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and qualities of my brothers and sisters.

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:45.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you look back
on your rich spiritual life,

00:09:45.564 --> 00:09:47.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there a memory
you can share with us?

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 10:22 says:

00:09:50.527 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The blessing of Jehovah
—that is what makes [one] rich.”

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:55.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel as if I have been enriched

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:58.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many ways with so many memories.

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One memory is being able to assist

00:10:01.913 --> 00:10:05.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the former Jamaica branch
for over 19 years.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working together with the brothers

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:09.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was such a unique privilege

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was really encouraging.

00:10:12.174 --> 00:10:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see the brothers exhibit
their faith and loyalty to Jehovah

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:19.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite various challenging circumstances

00:10:19.222 --> 00:10:21.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a true encouragement for us.

00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:23.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made many friends
in that assignment,

00:10:23.643 --> 00:10:25.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we continue
to keep in touch to this day.

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:27.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a nice memory.

00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:29.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing that with us.

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we’d like to talk
to Sister Sunny Cheiky.

00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Cheiky,
can you tell us how you got the truth

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then entered the full-time ministry?

00:10:37.282 --> 00:10:40.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother raised me
and my two brothers to serve Jehovah.

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult for her
because my father left the truth

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:46.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our family when we were very young.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she set a very good example for us.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then because of the encouragement
of young pioneers in our congregation,

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:58.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began regular pioneering
in the Pasadena, California, Congregation

00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:01.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after I graduated from high school in 1962.

00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:04.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did that lead to Bethel service?

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:07.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served in a few other areas
where the need was great

00:11:07.395 --> 00:11:10.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in New Mexico, northern California,

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:12.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special pioneer assignment in Iowa,

00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:15.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then a small congregation in Mississippi.

00:11:15.987 --> 00:11:17.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom was a Brooklyn Bethelite,

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:22.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came down to Mississippi
to dedicate a Kingdom Hall.

00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In May 1981, we met;

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:28.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seven months later, we were married,

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were accepted
to serve as a couple at Bethel.

00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:32.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice.

00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:34.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What assignments have you enjoyed at Bethel?

00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a housekeeper for my first three years,

00:11:37.342 --> 00:11:40.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I’ve been in laundry for 35 years.

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:44.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did have a part-time assignment
in grounds maintenance for a while,

00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:48.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now I joyfully serve full-time
in the Wallkill laundry.

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:50.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you too have a demanding schedule.

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:52.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain one challenge?

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:55.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meeting so many wonderful friends 
in our assignments,

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:57.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to keep in touch with them.

00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But time is so limited,

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:01.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I feel that that can be
overwhelming at times.

00:12:03.034 --> 00:12:06.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what practical thing have you done
to deal with that challenge?

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I love to write cards and send letters,

00:12:08.206 --> 00:12:10.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that’s how I deal with this.

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:14.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be able to keep in touch with my friends
—that really helps a lot.

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:17.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what has helped you to be balanced
despite your busy schedule?

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:22.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved the March 2016 broadcast
that stressed three things.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is count your blessings.

00:12:24.973 --> 00:12:27.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are a part of an amazing organization

00:12:27.309 --> 00:12:31.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is carrying on the most meaningful work
of preaching and teaching.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second is look at the big picture.

00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:36.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I feel stressed out,

00:12:36.484 --> 00:12:39.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to put things in the right perspective

00:12:39.404 --> 00:12:44.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jehovah’s sovereignty first, foremost,
and not focusing on myself—

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:47.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helps me to keep calm.

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third is get enough rest.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without enough rest,
I can’t think straight

00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:56.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even ordinary activities in my routine

00:12:56.838 --> 00:12:58.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seem overwhelming, or too much.

00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:00.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very practical.

00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:03.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, is there a particular experience
you’d like to share with us?

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:06.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was special pioneering in Iowa,

00:13:06.306 --> 00:13:08.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married a brother who was a pioneer

00:13:08.975 --> 00:13:11.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then became an elder,

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:15.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I continued in the congregation
as a regular pioneer.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After several years, he became an apostate,

00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:22.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he tried to encourage me
to go with him; but I refused.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders made great efforts
to help him to recover,

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:31.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was persistent
in carrying out his course.

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:35.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in time, he separated from me
and ended the marriage.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I felt Jehovah’s support in so many ways.

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One in particular was a couple
who would call me often,

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:44.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they would have me to their home,

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:47.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they never wanted me to feel alone.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then another blessing came later
when I moved to Mississippi,

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:55.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I became partners with a sister
who was 20 years older than me.

00:13:55.647 --> 00:13:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had been in the seventh class of Gilead,

00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:01.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she had been special pioneering
for 30 years.

00:14:01.861 --> 00:14:05.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can imagine
she was a tremendous help to me.

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More blessings came later

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I married Tom
and began serving at Bethel.

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:14.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So feeling Jehovah’s support
in a difficult time

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and experiencing his blessings
is unforgettable.

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Cheiky, thank you so much
for sharing that experience with us.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction,
we referenced the example of Phoebe,

00:14:25.343 --> 00:14:27.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Interestingly, our Kingdom song number 137,

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Faithful Women, Christian Sisters,”

00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:38.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is based on the description of Phoebe
at Romans 16:2.

The lyrics of that song remind us
that our Christian sisters

00:14:41.693 --> 00:14:45.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show a faithful spirit we all can imitate,

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:48.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s true of the sisters
we interviewed today.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The song concludes with the words:

00:14:50.869 --> 00:14:55.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Christian sisters, may Jehovah keep you </i>
<i>firm in your conviction,</i>

00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:59.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>your prize is drawing near.” </i>

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:04.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we appreciate the example set
by all of our faithful Christian sisters!

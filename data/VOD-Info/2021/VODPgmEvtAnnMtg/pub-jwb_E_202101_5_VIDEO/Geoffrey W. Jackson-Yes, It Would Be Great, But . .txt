00:00:01 Wouldn’t it be great?
00:00:03 Yes, it would be great.
00:00:05 But we have a lot of questions, don’t we?
00:00:10 The first question is,
00:00:12 Did we hear that correctly
00:00:14 —that not only are we receiving a new publication
00:00:17 but we’re also starting a new method
00:00:21 of conducting Bible studies?
00:00:24 The answer is yes.
00:00:26 But why is that necessary?
00:00:30 Well, to answer that question,
00:00:32 let’s think of a few things that have changed in recent years.
00:00:37 For example, think about the New World Translation
00:00:41 and the revision of the New World Translation.
00:00:44 Was that revised
00:00:46 because the Reference Bible was no longer any good?
00:00:49 No.
00:00:51 We remember the explanation given:
00:00:54 that reading skills of people have changed.
00:00:59 No longer do people enjoy reading
00:01:02 and taking that slow journey
00:01:04 to eventually get to a destination.
00:01:07 But rather, in this modern age, we find that people
00:01:10 are wanting to get to the destination very quickly.
00:01:14 They want clear, simple explanations that give them the meaning quickly.
00:01:20 But what if when the Governing Body were considering
00:01:23 whether or not to revise the New World Translation
00:01:26 had said, ‘But we can’t do this
00:01:30 ‘because the brothers and sisters would have to learn a whole lot
00:01:34 ‘of new vocabulary and all their favorite scriptures
00:01:37 ‘they’d have to memorize again
00:01:39 ‘and they probably wouldn’t be able to find those verses
00:01:42 on the right page in the Bible.’
00:01:45 But the Governing Body didn’t decide that (not to have the revision).
00:01:50 But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed
00:01:54 the revision of the New World Translation.
00:01:56 And haven’t we been happy
00:01:59 using this and getting the benefits from it?
00:02:02 But not only have reading skills changed
00:02:06 but also learning skills,
00:02:09 and that’s shown by some of the adjustments
00:02:12 that have been made to our midweek meeting.
00:02:15 Now we see our midweek meeting is fast-moving, it’s interesting,
00:02:20 and it seems so much easier to learn things about the Bible.
00:02:25 Recently, I was talking to a sister
00:02:28 who has been in the truth for about 65 years,
00:02:31 and she said concerning the midweek meeting,
00:02:34 “I have learned more about the Bible
00:02:37 in the last few years than in the previous 60 years.”
00:02:41 And isn’t that true?
00:02:44 But what if the Governing Body when they were considering this change
00:02:48 had said, ‘Well we can’t make that change
00:02:51 because the older brothers and sisters won’t be able to adapt to it.’
00:02:55 Aren’t we happy that the change was made?
00:02:59 Of course we are, because we can see the beautiful benefits
00:03:04 that have come from that change.
00:03:08 When we think about all these changes that have occurred,
00:03:12 we can see that it fulfills what Jehovah promised.
00:03:15 And if you turn with me, please, to the book of Isaiah
00:03:19 —Isaiah chapter 60.
00:03:22 And let’s remind ourselves of what is said
00:03:25 in the beginning of verse 17.
00:03:28 Here Jehovah promises:
00:03:30 “Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,
00:03:34 “and instead of the iron I will bring in silver,
00:03:38 “instead of the wood, copper,
00:03:41 and instead of the stones, iron.”
00:03:44 Doesn’t this nicely describe the promise
00:03:48 that Jehovah has made to help us to keep improving
00:03:52 the various things that we’re doing with preaching the good news
00:03:55 and also our spiritual feeding programs?
00:03:58 Yes, things continue to improve.
00:04:01 But let’s also remember how verse 16 in the same chapter starts.
00:04:06 It says:
00:04:08 “And you will actually drink the milk of nations.”
00:04:12 We probably remember that The Watchtower
00:04:15 has helped us to understand that this ‘milk of the nations’
00:04:19 involves all the things that are being developed,
00:04:21 including modern technology.
00:04:23 And Jehovah’s people with Jehovah’s blessing
00:04:26 have used many of these modern things
00:04:30 to help us with teaching and preaching.
00:04:33 Yes, as Brother Splane said very accurately,
00:04:37 “Times change, and people’s needs change.”
00:04:42 And that’s very true.
00:04:44 As we’ve seen, reading skills have changed
00:04:48 and learning skills have too.
00:04:50 So for that reason, over the last few years,
00:04:54 our Bible study tools have changed slightly.
00:04:58 We’ve seen how they’ve become simpler and easier to use,
00:05:03 and many of us are using videos along with these publications.
00:05:08 But, of course, sometimes it gets a little complicated
00:05:11 because we’re not quite sure what video to show when.
00:05:15 How refreshing it was when we saw that the digital version
00:05:19 of the Good News  brochure had videos embedded in it!
00:05:23 So you’re able to tap on the video and have the right video at the right time
00:05:28 when you’re conducting a study.
00:05:30 Well, this new publication takes all of this experience
00:05:34 that we’ve gained from trying to enhance our Bible study tools,
00:05:38 and now we have something that will be very easy to use.
00:05:43 But what does the publication look like?
00:05:48 Brother Splane mentioned that it had been field-tested.
00:05:52 Those who have already used it
00:05:54 —what did they say about this new publication?
00:05:57 And how does the Governing Body feel about this new publication?
00:06:01 All those questions are answered in this video.
00:06:08 Jehovah has always given us
00:06:10 the right tool at the right time
00:06:13 to teach others.
00:06:16 And this new book is no exception.
00:06:25 How is this book organized?
00:06:28 Each lesson is divided into three parts.
00:06:32 How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?
00:06:35 You might encourage your student
00:06:37 to read the first part of a lesson in advance
00:06:40 and to note the questions in bold
00:06:42 and the key scriptures.
00:06:45 Begin each study by reading and discussing
00:06:48 the first part together.
00:06:51 Next, consider together
00:06:53 the “Dig Deeper” section.
00:06:56 Begin by reading the introductory statement,
00:06:59 which explains what follows,
00:07:01 and take note of the subheadings
00:07:03 that outline the main points.
00:07:05 Read the scriptures,
00:07:08 watch the provided videos together,
00:07:11 and then discuss how
00:07:13 the scriptures and videos
00:07:14 answer the related questions.
00:07:17 Discuss the artwork with the student.
00:07:21 Then follow with the questions
00:07:23 found in the “Some People Say” section.
00:07:27 Then, read the “Summary”
00:07:30 and discuss the “Review” questions.
00:07:33 Your student can enter the date
00:07:35 the lesson was completed.
00:07:37 Each lesson provides
00:07:39 a “Goal” for the student,
00:07:41 and the “Explore” section
00:07:43 offers additional content
00:07:45 that may be useful depending
00:07:46 on your student’s needs and interests.
00:07:50 Yes, this tool is very different.
00:07:53 Why was it designed this way?
00:07:55 It’s a lot like
00:07:56 the teaching used in our theocratic schools.
00:07:59 It is very interactive.
00:08:01 On the one hand,
00:08:03 the lessons are written in such a way
00:08:05 to really make the student think about what he is learning.
00:08:09 This tool has the ability
00:08:12 to involve the Bible student.
00:08:14 It shows them a video,
00:08:16 and then they have references they can look at.
00:08:19 But the way that it’s designed involves them.
00:08:23 And it’s really going to give them a good foundation.
00:08:28 On the other hand, the teacher can use the viewpoint questions
00:08:32 to draw out how the student really feels
00:08:36 about what he’s learning from God’s Word.
00:08:39 This is the most thoroughly
00:08:40 field-tested publication
00:08:42 that we have ever produced.
00:08:44 From writing the text
00:08:46 to simplifying the text
00:08:48 —polishing it, getting it ready—
00:08:50 it has been produced so that it can be translated
00:08:53 into many languages
00:08:55 so as to help people everywhere.
00:08:58 Yes, this tool is very different,
00:09:01 but is it effective?
00:09:04 Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands
00:09:07 tested the lessons.
00:09:09 What do they say about it?
00:09:11 I love the new layout.
00:09:13 It’s current, and it’s intuitive.
00:09:16 And the way the Bible truths are presented
00:09:19 —it’s very logical and easy to understand.
00:09:22 I think it’s going to be a game changer.
00:09:25 The “Dig Deeper” section is amazing.
00:09:27 It ensures that the teaching
00:09:29 comes directly from the Bible.
00:09:32 Because this part of the study
00:09:34 becomes a conversation,
00:09:35 the students answer right from their hearts,
00:09:38 which allows me to learn a lot more
00:09:40 about how they think and feel.
00:09:43 The new method really helps us
00:09:45 to convince the mind and reach the heart.
00:09:47 Most of all, it helps
00:09:49 both the teacher and the student
00:09:51 to focus on the Scriptures
00:09:52 rather than on the study aid.
00:09:54 We never heard anybody say
00:09:56 “the paragraph says”
00:09:58 because when they did answer the question,
00:10:00 they were expressing what
00:10:01 they really believed.
00:10:04 The lessons are both logical and concise.
00:10:08 The method is highly interactive.
00:10:12 The students not only respond
00:10:14 in their own words
00:10:15 but are also able to come
00:10:16 to the correct conclusions
00:10:18 all by themselves.
00:10:21 It helps me as the teacher to talk less,
00:10:24 and it helps the student
00:10:26 to express himself and to think.
00:10:29 And the videos elicited comments
00:10:31 (sometimes of even a personal nature)
00:10:33 that probably never would’ve come out
00:10:34 had it not been for the videos.
00:10:36 The aim is to get to know Jehovah,
00:10:38 to love Jehovah,
00:10:40 to learn what his will is for us
00:10:41 and to do that will,
00:10:43 and also to draw close to his organization.
00:10:47 I have been in full-time service
00:10:49 for over 50 years.
00:10:51 I conduct several Bible studies.
00:10:54 These lessons cannot be compared with others.
00:10:58 They are more effective and just what
00:11:00 we need for our times.
00:11:05 It equips them to explain to others
00:11:07 what they have learned.
00:11:09 And as a teacher,
00:11:11 that fills me with so much joy
00:11:14 that I am motivated to be zealous
00:11:16 and find more new Bible studies.
00:11:20 We are so excited about this new approach
00:11:22 to teaching Bible truths!
00:11:24 The main points stand out,
00:11:25 the application is clear,
00:11:27 and it’s easy to remember.
00:11:29 And everybody can benefit from it
00:11:31 —from those with little or no education
00:11:33 to those who are highly educated.
00:11:34 Our students are going to love
00:11:36 this new publication.
00:11:37 And we will too, as this will make us
00:11:39 better teachers of God’s Word
00:11:41 so as to make more disciples
00:11:43 before the end comes.
00:11:45 And how do members of the Governing Body
00:11:47 feel about this innovative approach?
00:11:51 This book has the potential to draw many honesthearted ones
00:11:54 into Jehovah’s organization
00:11:56 to serve alongside us in pure worship
00:11:59 and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.
00:12:02 Compared to all the Bible study tools we’ve used in the past,
00:12:06 this is gold.
00:12:08 And that’s what it’s all about —helping that student
00:12:11 build a close relationship with Jehovah.
00:12:14 And unquestionably,
00:12:16 this new publication, this marvelous gift from Jehovah,
00:12:20 will help us accomplish this worthy goal.
00:12:26 We humbly recognize that whatever tool we use,
00:12:30 only Jehovah can make it grow.
00:12:32 So we’re praying that Jehovah will grant success to this new tool
00:12:37 to build and make disciples of Christ.
00:12:41 We are not just preachers.
00:12:44 We are teachers.
00:12:47 We are disciple-makers.
00:12:50 This new book gives us what we need
00:12:53 to help others love Jehovah,
00:12:55 follow Christ,
00:12:57 get baptized,
00:12:59 and Enjoy Life Forever!
00:13:06 What a fantastic new publication!
00:13:09 I’m sure all of us are looking forward to using it.
00:13:13 But you may be thinking:
00:13:16 ‘How big is it? How many pages are there?’
00:13:20 Well, there are 256 pages,
00:13:24 and there are 60 lessons.
00:13:27 Well, you may be thinking:
00:13:29 ‘Will that be overwhelming to many people
00:13:33 ‘when we show them this new publication?
00:13:36 ‘Many of our Bible studies that we start
00:13:40 ‘do lessons 1 and 2, and then by 3, perhaps they stop studying.
00:13:45 ‘So if we’re using a large publication,
00:13:48 ‘could it be that it would be a waste of a publication
00:13:51 ‘if someone isn’t going to continue to study?
00:13:55 ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we also had something else
00:13:59 that would introduce this new study system?’
00:14:02 And that’s exactly what we’re happy to announce:
00:14:06 the release of a new brochure entitled
00:14:09 Enjoy Life Forever —Introductory Bible Lessons.
00:14:14 Now, this new brochure contains within it
00:14:18 the first three lessons of the new publication.
00:14:23 When you look at the back of this brochure,
00:14:26 you’ll notice that it’s designed similarly to the design of our tracts.
00:14:31 It has the questions: “Is it possible to enjoy life forever?
00:14:36 Would you say yes? no? maybe?”
00:14:41 The explanation that’s given below,
00:14:43 along with the scriptures, helps us then
00:14:46 to direct the attention to the first lesson in the brochure.
00:14:50 And this first lesson is entitled “How Can the Bible Help You?,”
00:14:55 the second lesson is “The Bible Gives Hope,”
00:14:59 and the third lesson, “Can You Trust the Bible?”
00:15:04 What a wonderful way to introduce this new publication!
00:15:09 So once we’ve gone through the brochure and finished the three lessons,
00:15:13 if someone shows that they really want to continue
00:15:16 in their Bible study, then we introduce them
00:15:19 to the larger publication and start at lesson 4.
00:15:23 Wow! That’s so exciting, isn’t it?
00:15:26 It will be very easy to use this
00:15:28 and also to use the electronic version,
00:15:31 which has been developed at the same time as the printed version.
00:15:35 With the electronic version in JW Library®,
00:15:38 you’ll be able to just tap the link and it will take you to the videos
00:15:42 or to the verses or to the reference material.
00:15:46 Isn’t that exciting?
00:15:49 I’m sure all of us are looking forward to being able to use this new brochure
00:15:54 and the new publication to start Bible studies.
00:15:58 But there’s still one question left,
00:16:00 Wouldn’t it be great if we can use these publications
00:16:05 to help other persons to become disciples,
00:16:08 yes, and to enjoy life forever?

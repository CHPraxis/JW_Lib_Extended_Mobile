00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.”

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With those words, Jehovah’s angel

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greeted faithful Judge Gideon,

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his reply to those words
might surprise you.

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you open your Bibles?

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Judges 6:13,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s Judges 6:13:

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Gideon said to him:

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pardon me, my lord,

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but if Jehovah is with us,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘why has all of this come upon us?

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where are all his wonderful acts
that our fathers related to us, saying,

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?”

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now Jehovah has deserted us

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given us into Midian’s hand.’”

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is that how you would respond

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an angel of Jehovah
who is speaking to you?

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably not
under normal circumstances.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about in 2020?

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has truly been an incredible year!

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have faced a pandemic—

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pandemic that has robbed us

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our dear loved ones,

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pandemic that has caused us
to face isolation,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be separated from our relatives
and close friends

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that now an epidemic of anxiety

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has settled down across our earth.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times during this year,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe you have felt like Gideon.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe his words have been your words.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have said those things
or felt those things,

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it mean that you’re lacking faith?

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that your love for Jehovah
is disappearing

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that now you’re sort of diminishing
in your relationship with God?

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon was not
the only faithful servant of Jehovah

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who expressed similar thoughts.

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what Habakkuk said?

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Habakkuk chapter 1

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 2 and 3.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk said: “How long, O Jehovah,

00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must I cry for help, but you do not hear?

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long must I ask for help from violence,

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but you do not intervene?

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:38.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:50.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why? Why?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe those words
sound a little bit familiar to you.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers, when we feel overwhelmed

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our circumstances, by our grief,

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our anxiety,

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a question that we need to ask.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a question
that was first recorded in the Bible

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the faithful prophet Elisha.

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would you read it with me?

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s at 2 Kings chapter 2

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 14

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Kings 2:14.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Then he
[Now, this is Elisha. Then he]

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“took the official garment of Elijah
that had fallen off him

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:44.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and struck the waters and said:

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?’

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he struck the waters,

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they were divided
to the left and to the right,

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Elisha went across.”

00:03:57.966 --> 00:03:59.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the question?

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?”

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what did Elisha mean
when he asked that question?

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he saying: “Where is Jehovah?

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why isn’t he doing something?”

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that the sense of the question?

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha was looking for Jehovah.

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was searching for his direction.

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to see the hand of God.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Elisha got the answer to his prayer.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:31.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those waters opened right in front of him

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:34.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he could cross.

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is not the only place
where this question appears in the Bible.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at another place
here in Jeremiah chapter 2,

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 2:5:

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What fault did your forefathers find in me,

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so that they strayed so far from me,

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:04.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they walked after worthless idols
and became worthless themselves?

00:05:04.032 --> 00:05:08.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They did not ask,
[now notice, they did not ask]

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:10.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Where is Jehovah,

00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:13.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“the One who brought us
out of the land of Egypt,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“who led us through the wilderness,
through a land of deserts and pits,

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“through a land of drought
and of deep shadow,

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“through a land where no man travels

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where no humans dwell?”’”

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:33.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted his people to search for him.

00:05:33.103 --> 00:05:36.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted them to ask: “Where is Jehovah?”

00:05:36.398 --> 00:05:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to look for his hand,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seek his help and direction.

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:46.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers,
why is it so urgent for us

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:49.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these critical times
—during a pandemic—

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:52.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be saying, “Where is Jehovah?”

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:56.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we so desperately need

00:05:56.877 --> 00:06:01.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help, the direction,
the support, the comfort

00:06:01.882 --> 00:06:06.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come from our amazing,
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:12.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now you might say:
“Well, is Jehovah really going to help you?

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:14.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m not important. I’m not significant.

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:19.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah really going to be there for me?”

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:22.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at these beautiful words

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:26.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the scripture in Isaiah chapter 57

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:28.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 57,

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:32.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is really a promise
from our God, Jehovah.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57:15 says:

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:41.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is
what the High and Lofty One says,

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:45.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who lives forever and whose name is holy:

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I reside in the high and holy place,

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:51.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[but now notice this]

00:06:51.932 --> 00:06:55.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but also with those crushed

00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:58.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and lowly in spirit,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:01.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to revive the spirit of the lowly

00:07:01.483 --> 00:07:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to revive the heart
of those being crushed.’”

00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:08.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing thought!

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here our God, Jehovah, the Almighty
who dwells in the highest heavens,

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that when we are crushed,
when we are lowly

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:21.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in a figurative sense—
he resides right with us.

00:07:21.503 --> 00:07:24.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautiful! How amazing!

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:25.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what does that mean?

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:27.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that teach us?

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:29.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It teaches us
that we need to ask that question

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:32.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?” every day.

00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:34.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to beg Jehovah for his direction.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:37.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to beg him for his help.

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:40.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we need to do something more.

00:07:40.856 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be on the lookout

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the hand of Jehovah.

00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:50.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Elijah felt completely isolated,

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:52.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was so discouraged,
you remember, he said:

00:07:52.743 --> 00:07:56.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am the only one left.”

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:58.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just poured his heart out to Jehovah.

00:07:58.749 --> 00:08:00.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jehovah do for him?

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you remember,
Jehovah allowed Elijah to see

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a miraculous display of his power.

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:10.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, he felt that wind;

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he felt the earthquake;

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:14.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he felt the fire.

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, the Bible says:
“Jehovah was not in the wind.”

00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:21.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was not in the earthquake.”

00:08:21.271 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was not in the fire.”

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:27.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what came next?

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:31.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A calm, low voice.”

00:08:31.865 --> 00:08:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah.

00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:39.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what do we learn
from that experience?

00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:41.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, brothers, we might be waiting

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some big, bold, dramatic expression
of Jehovah’s hand.

00:08:47.547 --> 00:08:50.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, what do we need to do?

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:54.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to turn up
our “spiritual hearing aids”

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can hear

00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:00.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “calm, low voice” of Jehovah.

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:04.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah’s answer to our prayers

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:07.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might come in a way that we don’t expect.

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:12.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s through the kind gesture or act
of one of our brothers or sisters.

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:16.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s through a text message,
an e-mail, a phone call,

00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:20.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other way
that our brother or sister acts

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:22.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show their kindness.

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s Jehovah’s way

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:27.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving us the help that we need.

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:31.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means
that when we are earnestly praying,

00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re earnestly seeking Jehovah’s help

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—be attentive, be alert,

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:38.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask: “Where is Jehovah?”

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:40.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look for his hand.

00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:43.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s another question, brothers:

00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that help comes,

00:09:46.565 --> 00:09:50.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah does provide
that assistance that you need,

00:09:50.694 --> 00:09:53.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will you be willing to accept it?

00:09:53.697 --> 00:09:58.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Mary came to Jesus
with the perfumed oil, genuine nard

00:09:58.618 --> 00:10:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—remember, so expensive

00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:05.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would cost a year’s wages
for an average laborer—

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would have been so easy for Jesus
to turn her away,

00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:14.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to just say: “Oh, no, Mary,
thank you very much, but I don’t need you.

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:17.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is going to help me,
so you can just go now,

00:10:17.762 --> 00:10:19.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll be fine.”

00:10:19.931 --> 00:10:22.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus didn’t do that.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus willingly accepted the help.

00:10:25.896 --> 00:10:29.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe Jesus understood

00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:31.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had put it into Mary’s heart
to do this

00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:35.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that his body
would be properly prepared for burial.

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:40.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is, Jesus accepted

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:43.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that Mary provided.

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:46.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
what’s the lesson?

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we need to learn from this?

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:51.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a person who always says,

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, no, we’re fine; we don’t need anything;

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:56.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to help us,”

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, “Oh, no, you don’t need to tell me that;

00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I already know Jehovah
will give me the direction I need,”

00:11:03.808 --> 00:11:06.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, then, you may be missing out.

00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:09.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not be seeing or hearing

00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:14.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that Jehovah wants to give us.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:19.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a video and see
how our brothers and sisters in distress

00:11:19.074 --> 00:11:23.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have experienced the help of Jehovah
at a critical time.

00:11:25.872 --> 00:11:28.667 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought that fire was loud.

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:31.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought that you could hear a wildfire,

00:11:31.336 --> 00:11:33.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was just dead quiet.

00:11:33.922 --> 00:11:36.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time we went down the driveway
and around the corner,

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:38.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we stopped and looked back

00:11:38.843 --> 00:11:41.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the back of my parents’ house
was on fire.

00:11:42.806 --> 00:11:46.768 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the pandemic hit, we lost our work.

00:11:46.768 --> 00:11:51.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t go to work,
and we also couldn’t leave our apartment.

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:54.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The situation was very hard.

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:58.113 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Ivan, was charged

00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:00.699 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with organizing extremist activity.

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:03.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was put into pretrial detention

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:05.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for four months.

00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out that I had a tumor in my chest

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:13.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would have to have
a very serious operation.

00:12:14.504 --> 00:12:17.215 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I lost my mom to the coronavirus.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living 3,000 miles apart,

00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:22.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be a long time
before I was able to go home at all,

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:25.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wasn’t able to be there
when it happened.

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:31.813 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Earlier this year, my son, Nathan, died

00:12:31.813 --> 00:12:33.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tragic accident.

00:12:33.815 --> 00:12:35.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was two years old.

00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:39.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I asked Jehovah (the question),

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why is this happening to me?ʺ

00:12:43.575 --> 00:12:47.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were friends there before we got there.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:51.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we got to the place that we knew
we were going to evacuate to,

00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:54.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(because they asked,
“Where are you going to be?”)

00:12:54.127 --> 00:12:57.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were willing to just provide anything
that we needed

00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:01.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we even knew
what it was that we needed

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and especially spiritually.

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:09.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when I didn’t know
that we needed to say a prayer, it was there.

00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those moments, we saw Jehovah’s hand.

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:19.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers would come by and give us food.

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was even a brother that called me

00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:26.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things started to go bad and said,

00:13:26.618 --> 00:13:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think you’re going to need some money.”

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:37.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without saying anything, he came
and left an envelope outside our apartment.

00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:43.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we opened the envelope, we saw
that there was exactly the amount we needed

00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:47.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay the bills and to buy things
that we needed for the apartment.

00:13:50.058 --> 00:13:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had only learned about brotherly love,

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but during that time,
I really understood what it truly means.

00:13:58.692 --> 00:14:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time, brothers
who we did not even know called us,

00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:05.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spent time with us,

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:08.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they prayed with us,

00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spent a lot of their time
encouraging us.

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:16.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time, I saw evidence
of Jehovah’s hand in our lives.

00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really, really struggling one day,
and I had to reach out to Jehovah in prayer

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just try and throw all my burdens on him,

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not two minutes
after I finished that prayer

00:14:27.804 --> 00:14:30.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when an elder reached out to me

00:14:30.223 --> 00:14:33.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave me the best shepherding call
I think I’ve ever had in my life.

00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:37.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And clearly, that was
Jehovah reaching out to me

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:42.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to show me that he understood
how I felt and was there for me.

00:14:42.235 --> 00:14:46.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After intensive care, I felt that I needed
someone to hold my hand,

00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:50.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I understood that Jehovah
would take me by the hand.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister visited me every day,

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:56.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she helped me get dressed,
she brushed my hair,

00:14:56.916 --> 00:15:00.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we went for short walks
along the corridor.

00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I can really see how compassionate
and considerate Jehovah is

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he knows how to support us.

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:09.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows us inside and out.

00:15:09.387 --> 00:15:11.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were going through
this difficult time,

00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:16.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us so much,
and we definitely saw his hand in our lives.

00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:19.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the future,
if any difficulty should occur,

00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are confident
that Jehovah will help us and protect us.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter what we face,

00:15:25.862 --> 00:15:27.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll get worse and worse in this system.

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that Jehovah

00:15:29.657 --> 00:15:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can get us through absolutely anything.

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:32.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen the overwhelming evidence

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:33.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my own life;

00:15:33.828 --> 00:15:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen it for others too.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:38.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whatever Satan throws at us,

00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:39.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t matter,

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:40.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is stronger.

00:15:40.627 --> 00:15:42.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the most powerful ally

00:15:42.003 --> 00:15:44.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could have.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this annual meeting, we have heard so much
about what the Governing Body,

00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:53.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus,

00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:58.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing to strengthen
Jehovah’s people worldwide.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers and sisters,

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:04.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know one thing
that is strengthening the Governing Body

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue on in our work?

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s you.

00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every one of you brothers and sisters
out in the field.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what you’re going through.

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:18.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read your cards and letters.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hear your expressions.

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you’re suffering
through a difficult time.

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet you keep going; you keep enduring;

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:32.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you keep serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:16:32.637 --> 00:16:35.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That not only warms our hearts

00:16:35.223 --> 00:16:40.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it strengthens our own faith
to continue serving Jehovah.

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:44.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are facing a challenging time now.

00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:46.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we face the great tribulation,

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will face even greater challenges.

00:16:50.864 --> 00:16:53.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have times of discouragement

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like Gideon had, just like Habakkuk had,

00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Elijah had.

00:16:59.455 --> 00:17:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will also prove faithful to the end

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as each of those men did.

00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do what?

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:10.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep looking for Jehovah,

00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep searching for his hand,

00:17:13.344 --> 00:17:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep turning up
our “spiritual hearing aids”

00:17:17.932 --> 00:17:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can be attentive to the ways

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will use to help us

00:17:23.104 --> 00:17:25.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to strengthen us and to direct us.

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:28.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, dear brothers and sisters,

00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:30.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep on asking,

00:17:30.236 --> 00:17:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?”

00:00:01 We live in a time of judgment.
00:00:04 We’re not talking about flawed human judgment.
00:00:07 We’re talking about the perfect judgment
00:00:09 that comes from the heavenly Kingdom
00:00:11 in Jesus’ hands.
00:00:14 Jesus spoke of this judgment in his great prophecy
00:00:17 about the “last days” found in Matthew chapters 24 and 25.
00:00:22 After outlining what we could expect to see,
00:00:25 he provided three parables that deal with final judgment.
00:00:30 In Matthew chapter 25,
00:00:32 the first two parables relate to the final sealing
00:00:36 of genuine anointed ones.
00:00:38 These parables will be fulfilled
00:00:40 not long before the great tribulation begins.
00:00:44 Next, in the third parable,
00:00:46 Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.
00:00:50 Let’s read the opening four verses
00:00:52 of what he said starting in verse 31:
00:00:57 “When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him,
00:01:02 “then he will sit down on his glorious throne.
00:01:05 “All the nations will be gathered before him,
00:01:08 “and he will separate people one from another,
00:01:11 “just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
00:01:15 “And he will put the sheep on his right hand,
00:01:17 “but the goats on his left.
00:01:20 “Then the King will say to those on his right:
00:01:23 “‘Come, you who have been blessed by my Father,
00:01:26 “‘inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
00:01:29 from the founding of the world.’”
00:01:32 “Inherit the Kingdom,”
00:01:35 in other words, Paradise,
00:01:37 the earthly realm of the Kingdom.
00:01:39 When is this fulfilled?
00:01:41 After Jesus comes in his glory, he said,
00:01:45 and judges those then living.
00:01:48 Jesus said that this judgment would result
00:01:51 in a figurative separating of people
00:01:53 to his right hand and to his left hand,
00:01:56 like separating sheep from goats.
00:01:59 Jesus calls those at his right hand “righteous.”
00:02:03 However, he calls those separated to his left hand “cursed,”
00:02:07 and he sends them off into everlasting destruction.
00:02:11 Since the first two parables
00:02:14 involve judgment that takes place
00:02:16 before the great tribulation,
00:02:18 what about this third parable?
00:02:21 When does Jesus start to identify the righteous sheep
00:02:25 and the cursed goats?
00:02:28 Back in 1995, The Watchtower  helped us to understand
00:02:33 that the final judgment of the sheep and the goats will be decided
00:02:36 when Jesus comes in his glory during the great tribulation.
00:02:41 Does this mean that the judgment process does not start until then?
00:02:45 The answer is no.
00:02:47 Why can we say this?
00:02:49 Well, let’s illustrate the point.
00:02:51 Think about judgments delivered by a Supreme Court.
00:02:55 When the day arrives for a judgment to be announced,
00:02:59 does this mean that only then the court
00:03:01 starts to consider the evidence at hand?
00:03:04 No.
00:03:05 By that time, the court has already read briefs,
00:03:08 they have prepared and heard oral arguments,
00:03:11 and then they consider the legal background to the case.
00:03:15 This may take considerable time.
00:03:18 No court opinion is considered final
00:03:21 until it is delivered in open court
00:03:24 or released to the public.
00:03:26 What is the point?
00:03:28 Well, if the Supreme Courts of human governments
00:03:30 take time to hear all the facts
00:03:32 and to weigh all the circumstances,
00:03:35 should we be surprised that Jesus
00:03:37 is wisely using his time now
00:03:39 to judge people fairly?
00:03:41 By the start of the great tribulation,
00:03:44 Jesus will know who is goatlike and who is sheeplike.
00:03:48 How so?
00:03:49 Well, consider this: To a degree, even we can see
00:03:52 where people are choosing to stand.
00:03:55 True, the Bible foretold that this would be the case
00:03:58 in Malachi chapter 3.
00:04:01 There we find prophetic words that point ahead
00:04:04 to events in the first century
00:04:06 and in modern times.
00:04:08 Then verse 18 says that we would
00:04:11 “see the distinction between a righteous person and a wicked person,
00:04:15 “between one serving God
00:04:17 and one not serving him.”
00:04:20 If we can see the distinction,
00:04:22 then we can be certain that Jesus is far ahead of us.
00:04:27 What does Jesus see?
00:04:29 Well, we can be sure that he’s carefully watching
00:04:32 the attitudes, actions, and speech of each person.
00:04:37 For example, he sees their response to the good news.
00:04:42 Also, Jesus is observing
00:04:44 whether individuals support his anointed brothers
00:04:47 who will serve with him in the Kingdom.
00:04:50 At Matthew 25:35-40,
00:04:54 Jesus said that his brothers would experience many trials.
00:04:58 And he explained that those whom he judges as sheep
00:05:02 are the ones who assist his brothers.
00:05:05 He also said that he views what is done to them
00:05:09 as being done to him.
00:05:13 While Christ’s brothers will undoubtedly face
00:05:15 trials during the great tribulation,
00:05:18 how are they helped now?
00:05:20 Doing good to Christ’s brothers now
00:05:23 includes working along with them as they strive
00:05:26 to complete the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom.
00:05:29 Jesus takes note of this.
00:05:32 What else does Jesus observe?
00:05:36 At Matthew 12:36, 37,
00:05:39 Jesus stated that a person’s words would also be a basis
00:05:44 for how he or she is judged.
00:05:47 Let’s look at what Jesus said
00:05:49 at Matthew 12:36, 37.
00:05:54 Jesus said: “I tell you that men will render an account on Judgment Day
00:05:59 “for every unprofitable saying that they speak;
00:06:02 “for by your words you will be declared righteous,
00:06:05 and by your words you will be condemned.”
00:06:10 So then, does Jesus hear what we say?
00:06:13 Yes, he does,
00:06:15 including what we have said in preaching the good news.
00:06:20 Now, by using the words “render an account,”
00:06:23 here Jesus was referring
00:06:26 to what a person has said in the past.
00:06:30 That thought is reinforced by the use of the past tense
00:06:34 at Matthew 25:34-40 for the sheep
00:06:41 and 41-45 for the goats.
00:06:45 For example, in verse 40, Jesus says to the sheeplike ones:
00:06:49 “To the extent that you did it [past tense]
00:06:53 “to one of the least of these my brothers,
00:06:56 you did it to me.”
00:06:58 What does this tell us?
00:07:00 It tells us that everyone who desires to be viewed as a righteous sheep
00:07:04 must build up a good record of support for Christ’s brothers—now!
00:07:09 A person must be sheeplike when entering the great tribulation,
00:07:13 and they must remain sheeplike to the very end.
00:07:18 By the time “the Son of man comes in his glory,”
00:07:21 it will be far too late to build up such a good record with him.
00:07:25 Jesus is like the king mentioned
00:07:28 at Proverbs 20:8.
00:07:31 There it says:
00:07:33 “When the king sits on the throne to judge,
00:07:36 he sifts out all evil with his eyes.”
00:07:40 In line with this, we can be certain that Jesus, our heavenly King,
00:07:45 is already sifting and taking note
00:07:48 of who are goatlike in their attitudes, actions, and speech.
00:07:53 For those who continue refusing to serve Jehovah and his Kingdom,
00:07:57 their judgment will be in place as the great tribulation begins.
00:08:02 We can say this because there are no Scriptural indications
00:08:05 of any conversions to pure worship during the great tribulation.
00:08:10 Instead, we read at Revelation 6:16, 17
00:08:15 that those who chose not to obey the good news
00:08:18 will at that time turn to man-made things to try to save them.
00:08:23 They will run to things that they view as mountainlike, or strong,
00:08:27 such as their political and commercial systems.
00:08:30 Revelation 6:16 tells us
00:08:33 that they will cry out to such things saying:
00:08:35 “Fall over us and hide us from the face
00:08:38 “of the One seated on the throne
00:08:40 and from the wrath of the Lamb.”
00:08:44 But these human institutions will have no power to save them.
00:08:48 What will this mean for such ones?
00:08:51 Many goatlike ones will perish
00:08:53 early in the great tribulation
00:08:55 when the governments of this world turn on and destroy false religion.
00:09:00 Many more will perish at the hands of other goatlike people.
00:09:04 Ezekiel 38:21 prophetically states
00:09:08 that “every man’s sword
00:09:10 will be against his own brother.”
00:09:13 Finally, all remaining goatlike ones
00:09:15 will perish by means of the angelic forces at Armageddon.
00:09:21 But as for the sheeplike ones,
00:09:23 the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,
00:09:26 will know each one of them before the start of the great tribulation,
00:09:30 and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah
00:09:33 throughout the great tribulation.
00:09:36 Then, just before Armageddon begins,
00:09:39 Jesus will, in effect, sit down as judge to make the final distinction
00:09:44 between the sheep and the goats out of all people then living.
00:09:49 Notably, in this third parable,
00:09:52 Jesus said that those who were at that time judged as goats
00:09:56 will call him Lord.
00:09:58 But Jesus will make it clear
00:10:00 that they did not support his brothers.
00:10:04 So, then, any persons who were once sheeplike
00:10:07 but who failed to endure to the end
00:10:10 by courageously supporting Christ’s brothers
00:10:13 will be placed among the goats.
00:10:16 Referring to Jesus as Lord will not save them.
00:10:20 It will be too late to do good for Christ’s brothers
00:10:23 who will likely be with Jesus in the heavenly Kingdom by that time.
00:10:27 Of course, the goats will also include those enemies of God
00:10:31 who are still alive out of all the nations.
00:10:34 This final judging serves an important purpose.
00:10:37 What is it?
00:10:39 It will leave no doubt in the eyes of all then living
00:10:43 as to who Jesus’ righteous sheep are
00:10:45 as they prepare to enter the new world.
00:10:49 So, then, strive to keep standing among the righteous
00:10:53 who will be placed at Jesus’ right hand.
00:10:56 God’s Word promises that as long as sheeplike ones remain loyal to Him
00:11:01 and to his appointed King, Jesus,
00:11:04 they will be guided into everlasting life.
00:11:07 Such ones must display courage
00:11:10 by supporting the work of Christ’s brothers,
00:11:12 both now and during the great tribulation.
00:11:16 What kind of courage will be needed?
00:11:19 Courage like that of Onesiphorus.
00:11:23 The apostle Paul mentions this faithful Christian
00:11:27 at 2 Timothy 1:16-18.
00:11:30 We invite you to read what he said about him,
00:11:33 starting in verse 16:
00:11:36 “May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus,
00:11:40 “for he often refreshed me,
00:11:43 “and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains.
00:11:46 “On the contrary, when he was in Rome,
00:11:49 “he diligently looked for me and found me.
00:11:52 “May the Lord grant him to find mercy
00:11:54 from Jehovah in that day.”
00:11:59 Onesiphorus would have been an anointed Christian,
00:12:03 but his example is one for every Christian to imitate.
00:12:07 Just visiting Paul could have cost Onesiphorus
00:12:10 his freedom or his life.
00:12:13 But that did not stop him from finding Paul
00:12:16 and refreshing him, did it?
00:12:19 Qualities such as Onesiphoruslike courage
00:12:21 will be required of all sheeplike ones
00:12:24 during the great tribulation.
00:12:27 So in summary, Jesus is now observing
00:12:30 the actions, attitudes, and speech of all people.
00:12:34 As a thorough Judge,
00:12:36 he will have identified sheeplike ones and goatlike ones
00:12:40 by the start of the great tribulation.
00:12:42 Then, according to Jesus’ parable,
00:12:45 just before Armageddon begins,
00:12:48 Jesus will pass final judgment on all then living on earth,
00:12:53 giving attention to why the righteous sheep
00:12:56 are placed at his right hand.
00:12:58 Will you be found standing among the righteous?
00:13:02 To receive that blessing, don’t be swayed by the things
00:13:05 you see taking place around you in this world.
00:13:08 Don’t be swayed by popular protests.
00:13:11 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:13:14 Don’t be swayed by political promises.
00:13:17 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:13:20 Don’t be swayed as governments say, “Peace and security!”
00:13:24 Remain neutral—no part of it.
00:13:27 But when it comes to obeying God’s laws,
00:13:30 stand firmly on the side of the Kingdom.
00:13:34 Only those who remain no part of the world
00:13:37 will be viewed by Jesus as being sheeplike
00:13:40 when the great tribulation begins
00:13:43 and when it wraps up at Armageddon.
00:13:46 And only those who continue to support Jesus’ brothers
00:13:50 will be placed at Jesus’ right hand
00:13:52 when he makes the final judgment
00:13:54 of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.
00:13:58 Show where you desire to stand

00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:04.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a time of judgment.

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not talking
about flawed human judgment.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re talking about the perfect judgment 

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from the heavenly Kingdom

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ hands.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke of this judgment
in his great prophecy

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the “last days” found
in Matthew chapters 24 and 25.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After outlining what we could expect to see,

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:29.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provided three parables
that deal with final judgment.

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Matthew chapter 25,

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first two parables
relate to the final sealing

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of genuine anointed ones.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These parables will be fulfilled

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not long before the great tribulation begins.

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, in the third parable,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the opening four verses

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what he said starting in verse 31:

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the Son of man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then he will sit down
on his glorious throne.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the nations will be gathered before him,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will separate people
one from another,

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:15.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will put the sheep on his right hand,

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the goats on his left.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the King will say
to those on his right:

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, you who have been blessed
by my Father,

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘inherit the Kingdom prepared for you

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the founding of the world.’”

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Inherit the Kingdom,”

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in other words, Paradise,

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the earthly realm of the Kingdom.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When is this fulfilled?

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jesus comes in his glory, he said,

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judges those then living.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that this judgment would result

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a figurative separating of people 

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his right hand and to his left hand,

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like separating sheep from goats.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus calls those
at his right hand “righteous.”

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he calls those
separated to his left hand “cursed,”

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sends them off
into everlasting destruction.

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the first two parables

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involve judgment that takes place

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation,

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about this third parable?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When does Jesus start
to identify the righteous sheep

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:27.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cursed goats?

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:33.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in 1995,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  helped us to understand

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the final judgment of the sheep
and the goats will be decided 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus comes in his glory
during the great tribulation.

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:45.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean that the judgment process
does not start until then?

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is no.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say this?

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s illustrate the point.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:55.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about judgments
delivered by a Supreme Court.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the day arrives
for a judgment to be announced,

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does this mean that only then the court

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starts to consider the evidence at hand?

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that time,
the court has already read briefs,

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have prepared and heard oral arguments,

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they consider
the legal background to the case.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may take considerable time.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No court opinion is considered final

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:24.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it is delivered in open court

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or released to the public.

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:28.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the point?

00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if the Supreme Courts
of human governments

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take time to hear all the facts

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weigh all the circumstances,

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should we be surprised that Jesus

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is wisely using his time now

00:03:39.364 --> 00:03:41.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to judge people fairly?

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:44.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the start of the great tribulation,

00:03:44.244 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will know who
is goatlike and who is sheeplike.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider this:
To a degree, even we can see

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people are choosing to stand.

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, the Bible foretold
that this would be the case

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Malachi chapter 3.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we find prophetic words
that point ahead

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to events in the first century

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in modern times.

00:04:08.477 --> 00:04:11.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 18 says that we would

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“see the distinction between
a righteous person and a wicked person,

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“between one serving God

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:19.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one not serving him.”

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we can see the distinction,

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can be certain
that Jesus is far ahead of us.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jesus see?

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can be sure
that he’s carefully watching

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:37.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the attitudes, actions,
and speech of each person.

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:42.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he sees
their response to the good news.

00:04:42.052 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Jesus is observing

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether individuals support
his anointed brothers

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:50.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will serve with him in the Kingdom.

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:54.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 25:35-40,

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that his brothers
would experience many trials.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:02.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he explained that those
whom he judges as sheep

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:05.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the ones who assist his brothers.

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:09.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also said that he views
what is done to them

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being done to him.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Christ’s brothers will undoubtedly face

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:18.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trials during the great tribulation,

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are they helped now?

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing good to Christ’s brothers now

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes working
along with them as they strive

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete the preaching
of the good news of the Kingdom.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus takes note of this.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else does Jesus observe?

00:05:36.064 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 12:36, 37,

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:44.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus stated that a person’s words
would also be a basis

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:47.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for how he or she is judged.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:49.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at what Jesus said

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:52.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 12:36, 37.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:59.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “I tell you that men will render
an account on Judgment Day

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for every unprofitable saying
that they speak;

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for by your words
you will be declared righteous,

00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:09.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by your words you will be condemned.”

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, does Jesus hear what we say?

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he does,

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:20.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including what we have said
in preaching the good news.

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by using the words “render an account,”

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here Jesus was referring

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:30.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what a person has said in the past.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That thought is reinforced
by the use of the past tense

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 25:34-40 for the sheep

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:45.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 41-45 for the goats.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in verse 40,
Jesus says to the sheeplike ones:

00:06:49.638 --> 00:06:53.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the extent that you did it [past tense]

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:56.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to one of the least of these my brothers,

00:06:56.186 --> 00:06:58.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you did it to me.”

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this tell us?

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:04.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us that everyone who desires
to be viewed as a righteous sheep

00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:09.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must build up a good record
of support for Christ’s brothers—now!

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:13.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person must be sheeplike
when entering the great tribulation,

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they must remain sheeplike
to the very end.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time
“the Son of man comes in his glory,”

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be far too late to build up
such a good record with him.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is like the king mentioned

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 20:8.

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:33.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the king sits on the throne to judge,

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:40.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sifts out all evil with his eyes.”

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In line with this, we can be certain
that Jesus, our heavenly King,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is already sifting and taking note

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:53.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of who are goatlike
in their attitudes, actions, and speech.

00:07:53.035 --> 00:07:57.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who continue refusing
to serve Jehovah and his Kingdom,

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their judgment will be in place
as the great tribulation begins.

00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:05.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say this
because there are no Scriptural indications

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:10.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of any conversions to pure worship
during the great tribulation.

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we read at Revelation 6:16, 17

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:18.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those who chose
not to obey the good news

00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:23.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will at that time turn to man-made things
to try to save them.

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:27.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will run to things that they view
as mountainlike, or strong,

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:30.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as their political
and commercial systems.

00:08:30.864 --> 00:08:33.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 6:16 tells us

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will cry out to such things saying:

00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:38.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fall over us and hide us from the face

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the One seated on the throne

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:44.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from the wrath of the Lamb.”

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:48.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these human institutions
will have no power to save them.

00:08:48.632 --> 00:08:51.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will this mean for such ones?

00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:53.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many goatlike ones will perish

00:08:53.762 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
early in the great tribulation

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the governments of this world
turn on and destroy false religion.

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many more will perish
at the hands of other goatlike people.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38:21 prophetically states

00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “every man’s sword

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:13.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be against his own brother.”

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:15.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, all remaining goatlike ones

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:20.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will perish by means
of the angelic forces at Armageddon.

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as for the sheeplike ones,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:30.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will know each one of them
before the start of the great tribulation,

00:09:30.507 --> 00:09:33.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah

00:09:33.677 --> 00:09:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the great tribulation.

00:09:36.012 --> 00:09:39.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, just before Armageddon begins,

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will, in effect, sit down
as judge to make the final distinction

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:48.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the sheep and the goats
out of all people then living.

00:09:49.901 --> 00:09:52.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notably, in this third parable,

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that those
who were at that time judged as goats

00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:58.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will call him Lord.

00:09:58.368 --> 00:10:00.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus will make it clear

00:10:00.495 --> 00:10:03.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they did not support his brothers.

00:10:04.374 --> 00:10:07.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, any persons who were once sheeplike

00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:10.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who failed to endure to the end

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by courageously supporting Christ’s brothers

00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:16.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be placed among the goats.

00:10:16.094 --> 00:10:20.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Referring to Jesus as Lord
will not save them.

00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:23.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be too late to do good
for Christ’s brothers

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:27.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will likely be with Jesus
in the heavenly Kingdom by that time.

00:10:27.647 --> 00:10:31.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the goats
will also include those enemies of God

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:34.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are still alive out of all the nations.

00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:37.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This final judging serves
an important purpose.

00:10:37.991 --> 00:10:39.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:43.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will leave no doubt
in the eyes of all then living

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:45.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to who Jesus’ righteous sheep are

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:49.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they prepare to enter the new world.

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:53.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, strive to keep standing
among the righteous

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:56.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be placed at Jesus’ right hand.

00:10:56.885 --> 00:11:01.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word promises that as long
as sheeplike ones remain loyal to Him

00:11:01.765 --> 00:11:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to his appointed King, Jesus,

00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:07.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will be guided into everlasting life.

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such ones must display courage

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:12.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by supporting the work of Christ’s brothers,

00:11:12.734 --> 00:11:16.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both now and during the great tribulation.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of courage will be needed?

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:23.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage like that of Onesiphorus.

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:27.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul mentions
this faithful Christian

00:11:27.082 --> 00:11:30.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 1:16-18.

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:33.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to read
what he said about him,

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting in verse 16:

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:40.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May the Lord grant mercy
to the household of Onesiphorus,

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:43.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he often refreshed me,

00:11:43.014 --> 00:11:46.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he did not become ashamed
of my prison chains.

00:11:46.518 --> 00:11:49.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary, when he was in Rome,

00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:52.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he diligently looked for me and found me.

00:11:52.107 --> 00:11:54.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May the Lord grant him to find mercy

00:11:54.943 --> 00:11:57.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah in that day.”

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:03.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Onesiphorus would have been
an anointed Christian,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his example is one
for every Christian to imitate.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:10.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just visiting Paul
could have cost Onesiphorus

00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:13.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his freedom or his life.

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:16.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that did not stop him from finding Paul

00:12:16.256 --> 00:12:19.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and refreshing him, did it?

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:21.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Qualities such as Onesiphoruslike courage

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:24.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be required of all sheeplike ones

00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:26.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the great tribulation.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in summary, Jesus is now observing

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:34.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the actions, attitudes,
and speech of all people.

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:36.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a thorough Judge,

00:12:36.818 --> 00:12:40.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will have identified
sheeplike ones and goatlike ones

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the start of the great tribulation.

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:45.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, according to Jesus’ parable,

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:48.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before Armageddon begins,

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:53.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will pass final judgment
on all then living on earth,

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:56.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving attention to why the righteous sheep

00:12:56.254 --> 00:12:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are placed at his right hand.

00:12:58.381 --> 00:13:02.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you be found standing
among the righteous?

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To receive that blessing,
don’t be swayed by the things

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:08.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see taking place
around you in this world.

00:13:08.558 --> 00:13:11.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed by popular protests.

00:13:11.645 --> 00:13:14.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:13:14.606 --> 00:13:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed by political promises.

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:13:20.737 --> 00:13:24.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed as governments say,
“Peace and security!”

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:27.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:30.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it comes to obeying God’s laws,

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stand firmly on the side of the Kingdom.

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only those who remain no part of the world

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be viewed by Jesus as being sheeplike

00:13:40.757 --> 00:13:43.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the great tribulation begins

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when it wraps up at Armageddon.

00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:50.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only those who continue
to support Jesus’ brothers

00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:52.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be placed at Jesus’ right hand

00:13:52.352 --> 00:13:54.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he makes the final judgment

00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:00.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show where you desire to stand

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all that you say and do right now.

00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:05.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

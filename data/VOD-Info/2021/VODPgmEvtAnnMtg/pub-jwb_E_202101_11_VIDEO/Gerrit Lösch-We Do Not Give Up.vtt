Some of us have been in the truth
for 40 years,

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
50 years, 60 years, or more.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our life, we may have been confronted

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with various tests, or challenges.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:18.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we did not and “we do not give up”

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:23.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth and our precious relationship
with our heavenly Father.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we do not give up
preaching the Word of God.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 4:16

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the theme scripture
I’ve selected for this talk.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please locate that with me

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:16.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:49.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Therefore, we do not give up,

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but even if the man we are outside
is wasting away,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly the man we are inside
is being renewed from day to day.”

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As it said, “we do not give up,”

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we do not give in
when it comes to temptations.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 3:6 encourages us

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “not give in to fear.”

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 13:6-8 tells the Israelites

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when a false prophet becomes active,

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:25.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you must not give in to him
or listen to him.”

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Sermon on the Mount,
according to an alternate rendering,

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told his listeners to pray to Jehovah

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “not allow us to give in to temptation.”

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On one occasion, Peter encouraged others

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 3:6: “Do not give in to fear.”

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do give ear
when somebody gives us good counsel;

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give serious thought

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when somebody wants to help us;

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give comfort to those in need.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:06.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first century, Paul gave comfort

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the congregation in Corinth.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:15.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find 2 Corinthians 4:1 with me,

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can read it together.

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says there:

00:02:22.162 --> 00:02:24.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:29.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have this ministry
through the mercy that was shown us,

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not give up.”

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who were the “we”?

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The anointed.

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 3:3

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells the Corinthians

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they are the words of Paul)

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are like “a letter of Christ

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“written by [him and his friends]
as ministers,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inscribed . . . with the spirit
of [our] living God.”

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle, then, in verse 5,
humbly acknowledges

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the fact that he and the Corinthians

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘were qualified came from God’

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in verse 6,

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “has . . . adequately qualified
[Christians]

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ministers of a new covenant.”

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:23.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Paul refer to
when he said in verse 1

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have this ministry”?

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He referred to the ministry
of that “new covenant”

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which he was just talking about.

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:37.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow the reading

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:42.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Corinthians 3:5, 6,

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not that we of ourselves
are adequately qualified

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:51.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to consider that anything comes from us,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but our being adequately qualified
comes from God,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who has indeed adequately qualified us

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:04.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be ministers of a new covenant,

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not of a written code, but of spirit.”

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:13.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 3:18, he says

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all of us,
while we . . . reflect like mirrors

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glory of Jehovah.”

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:24.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, who did he refer to
when he wrote “all of us”?

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He meant all of the anointed.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:31.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, verse 1, he says

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“therefore, since we have this ministry

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:36.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the mercy that was shown us.”

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:40.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “therefore”

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refers back to the reason and motivation

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:47.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the anointed not to give up.

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 3, verse 18,
he refers to the anointed

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:53.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being “transformed . . .

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one degree of glory to another,”

00:04:56.984 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
culminating in the glory they receive
when entering heaven.

00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:06.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the anointed are progressing
“from glory to glory,”

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:08.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until going to heaven,

00:05:08.537 --> 00:05:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have a strong motivation

00:05:10.873 --> 00:05:14.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up but to endure,

00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:19.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there is such a precious prize,
or reward, ahead of them.

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understandably, Paul said
in chapter 4, verse 1:

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:30.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, . . . we do not give up.”

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also in 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul wrote:

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:37.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, we do not give up.”

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:41.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third chapter, Paul contrasts

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the old covenant that was “stripped of glory”

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:49.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the new covenant that would
(like verses 10 and 11 say)

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:51.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
excel with greater glory

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:54.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a glory that would remain.

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:58.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 2 Corinthians 3:12 says

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since we have such a hope.”

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope?

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heavenly hope.

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the similarity
with chapter 4, verse 1?

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:14.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said “since we have this ministry.”

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:17.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What ministry was Paul referring to?

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:21.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he referring to the field ministry
in a general sense?

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:23.195 --> 00:06:27.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He referred to the ministry
of the new covenant.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4, verse 7,

00:06:30.744 --> 00:06:33.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he then calls
the ministry of the new covenant

00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:36.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a “treasure.”

00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:40.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since we have this [treasure],” he said.

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:43.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not just any treasure.

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:47.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great incentive
for the anointed in the first century

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:52.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up in view of this treasure
of the new covenant

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that involves progressive glory.

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote: “Therefore, we do not give up.”

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the context of the next verses

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:08.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that Paul was writing
about the heavenly calling

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the new covenant made possible.

00:07:11.994 --> 00:07:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Paul wrote is a strong incentive
for the anointed today

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:20.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to give up.

00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the “great crowd”
of “other sheep”?

00:07:23.964 --> 00:07:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul did not have the great crowd in mind

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:31.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wrote the words
of 2 Corinthians chapters 3 and 4.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the introduction to his letter,

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he referred to “all the holy ones.”

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:43.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22, he says:

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:46.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who anointed us is God.

00:07:46.653 --> 00:07:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has also put his seal on us.”

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the great crowd is a recipient

00:07:54.244 --> 00:07:58.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the radiant blessings
of the ministry of the new covenant.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago, <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:06.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a general application in principle
to the great crowd.

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like the anointed have

00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the treasure of the new covenant
and its ministry,

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd also considers

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:18.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their ministry a treasure.

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The great crowd is also determined
not to give up

00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:24.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in view of the beautiful hope

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:28.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live forever in Paradise on earth.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, no matter what hope,

00:08:31.323 --> 00:08:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have to endure.

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:38.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 4:8

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “we are hard-pressed”

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:43.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some more than others.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:49.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Psalm 90:10.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of us are exempt from the pressures

00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:56.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause discouragement.

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says there:

they quickly pass by, and away we fly.”

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:19.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the pressures of life
and disappointments,

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of us grow weary at times.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we must remember
that God never promised

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would have a problem-free life
in this old system.

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:32.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in the first century,
God’s servants faced adversities,

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including persecution and poverty.

00:09:36.513 --> 00:09:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does allow his servants

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be tempted and tested.

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the time of the end, he also foretold

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“earthquakes,” wars,

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:50.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
increased lawlessness, and “pestilences”

00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:54.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 21:11.

00:09:54.072 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Revelation, he foretold

00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:59.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a figurative horseman
on the “pale horse”

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:02.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would kill a large amount of people.

00:10:02.873 --> 00:10:05.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has happened for decades

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:09.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but started with the Spanish flu
at the end of World War I,

00:10:09.546 --> 00:10:14.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where an estimated 500 million were affected

00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:17.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one third of mankind of that time—

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:20.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and about 50 million died.

00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:24.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan exploits our moments of discouragement

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as a lion takes advantage of an animal
when it is most vulnerable.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will not give up!

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:36.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will not give up if others disappoint us.

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:40.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times,
even the most faithful servants of Jehovah

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have felt weighed down at times.

00:10:44.206 --> 00:10:47.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have grown weary with my sighing,”

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:49.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote David.

00:10:49.586 --> 00:10:53.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All night long I make my couch swim;

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:58.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my tears I make my own divan overflow.”

00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:01.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did David feel that way?

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:04.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of all those
showing hostility to me,”

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:06.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he explained.

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:10.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The hurtful actions of others
caused David such pain of heart

00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his tears flowed freely.

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:17.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, David did not draw away from Jehovah

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of what fellow humans had done to him

00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:23.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and neither do we!

00:11:25.163 --> 00:11:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, the words or actions of others

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause us much pain of heart.

00:11:31.628 --> 00:11:34.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There exists the one speaking thoughtlessly

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:38.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as with the stabs of a sword,”
says Proverbs 12:18.

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:43.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the thoughtless one
is a Christian brother or sister,

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:46.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stab wound can go deep.

00:11:46.393 --> 00:11:49.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The human tendency may be to take offense,

00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:52.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps harboring resentment.

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:54.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is especially true if we feel

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:58.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have been treated unkindly
or unjustly.

00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may find it hard to talk to the offender.

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:06.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might even deliberately avoid him or her.

00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:11.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Weighed down with resentment,
some have given up

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:15.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have stopped coming
to Christian meetings.

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:19.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we avoid
playing into the Devil’s hands

00:12:19.634 --> 00:12:23.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when others disappoint or hurt us?

00:12:23.054 --> 00:12:26.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must try not to harbor resentment.

00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:31.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can hurt us so much
that we start suffering from depression.

00:12:31.688 --> 00:12:35.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of giving in
to depression or aggression,

00:12:35.483 --> 00:12:38.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the initiative to make peace

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or settle matters as quickly as possible.

00:12:42.574 --> 00:12:45.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:13 urges us:

00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:49.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue . . . forgiving one another freely

00:12:49.664 --> 00:12:54.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . if anyone has a cause for complaint
against another.”

00:12:56.338 --> 00:12:59.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not have to fall prey to Satan.

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:03.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are on <i>our </i> side.

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:06.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we find encouragement to endure?

00:13:06.973 --> 00:13:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah deeply cares about those
who may be discouraged.

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:14.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 17:27 shows

00:13:14.022 --> 00:13:17.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he is not far off from each one of us.”

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah comforts and strengthens us

through loving brothers
and through his spirit and his Word.

Reading the Bible daily

00:13:28.745 --> 00:13:32.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating upon it helps.

00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:34.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publications have encouraged us

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Bible through once a year.

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:42.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not make it your resolve
to try such a program?

Nasho Dori, an anointed brother from Albania

‘My goal was to read the Bible

‘for at least one hour each day,

‘which I did for some 60 years

before my eyesight failed.’

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he bragging when saying this?

00:14:06.157 --> 00:14:07.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:14:07.075 --> 00:14:09.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped him not to give up

under the extreme Communist dictatorship.

00:14:14.207 --> 00:14:16.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not necessarily expect you

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:19.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Bible for one hour each day,

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we encourage you to read it through
in one year

00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:28.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to read it slowly enough
that you can meditate on it.

00:14:28.555 --> 00:14:31.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 20 minutes a day
provides ample opportunity

00:14:31.975 --> 00:14:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read and meditate on what you read.

00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:38.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you read so you hear your own voice,

00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:43.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will help you to read slower
and to meditate.

00:14:44.195 --> 00:14:47.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also find encouragement
through his organization

—things we read
in the literature or magazines.

And we greatly benefit
from the congregation meetings.

So do not give up!

Elders, when they shepherd,

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:13.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are also a big help for many to persevere.

00:15:13.892 --> 00:15:18.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publishers in our congregation
do a lot to strengthen us.

00:15:18.396 --> 00:15:22.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Hebrews 10:25, it is God’s will

that we keep “encouraging one another,”

00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and doing so is more urgent now
than ever before.

00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:33.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us always keep in mind the inspired words

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:37.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 2 Thessalonians 3:13:

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:40.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For your part, brothers,

00:15:40.376 --> 00:15:44.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not give up in doing good.”

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:47.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:9 similarly says:

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:51.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for in due time we will reap.”

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we conclude from this?

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:00.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is in the words of our theme text,

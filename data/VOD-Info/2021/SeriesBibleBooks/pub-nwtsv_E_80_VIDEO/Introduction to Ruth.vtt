about 1090 B.C.E.

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:18.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The events related cover a period

early in the time of the Judges.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.918 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The book takes its name

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one of its principal characters,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other main characters

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Naomi and Boaz.

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 1,

00:00:36.057 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a famine moves a man named Elimelech

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take his family from Bethlehem

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the land of Moab.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Moab, Elimelech dies.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His sons, Mahlon and Chilion,

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
marry the Moabite women Ruth and Orpah.

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some ten years later,

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both sons also die.

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naomi, in deep despair,
decides to return to Bethlehem.

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She urges her daughters-in-law
to go back to their families.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Orpah returns “to her people.”

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ruth, however, sticks loyally to Naomi.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the two widows arrive at Bethlehem,

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the barley harvest has just begun.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 2,

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ruth, by chance,
gleans in a field belonging to Boaz,

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:33.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is related to Naomi’s late husband.

00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:37.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recognizing Ruth’s fine qualities,

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:41.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz tells her
to continue gleaning in his fields.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Ruth later tells Naomi
that she had gleaned

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:47.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the fields of a man named Boaz,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naomi says: “The man is related to us.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is one of our repurchasers.”

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 3,

00:01:56.637 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naomi instructs Ruth
to ask Boaz to act as repurchaser.

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:05.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and Ruth
could then raise up offspring for Naomi

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to carry on
the family line of Elimelech.

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz is willing to perform this loving deed.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:17.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he tells Ruth
that Naomi has a closer male relative

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could repurchase her.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:22.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4,

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:25.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz goes to the Bethlehem city gate

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he meets with the other male relative,

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is referred to as “So-and-so.”

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the relative,
in the presence of ten city elders,

00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learns of his obligations,

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:38.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he declines to help.

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:43.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz then publicly accepts
the responsibilities of repurchaser.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:47.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz now marries Ruth,

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:49.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have a son,

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:51.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom the “neighbor women” name Obed.

00:02:54.988 --> 00:02:56.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boaz set a fine example
of obedience to Jehovah.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:05.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did all in his power
to help Naomi and Ruth

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by applying God’s law on repurchase,

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking no shortcuts.

00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book concludes:

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Obed became father to Jesse;

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:18.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesse became father to David,”

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who became a king of Israel

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:22.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an ancestor of the Messiah.

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:26.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you read the book of Ruth,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how Jehovah turns tragedy into triumph,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe how he rewards those

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:34.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who love and obey him,

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note how the book contributes

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:39.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the history of David’s family line,

00:03:39.532 --> 00:03:42.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which produced the King of God’s Kingdom.

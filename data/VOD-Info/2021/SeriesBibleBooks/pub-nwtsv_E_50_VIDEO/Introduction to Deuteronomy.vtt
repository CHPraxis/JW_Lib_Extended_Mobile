An introduction to the book of Deuteronomy.

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy was written by Moses

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the plains of Moab in 1473 B.C.E.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just before the Israelites

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
entered the Promised Land.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The name Deuteronomy means “Second Law,”

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “Repetition of the Law.”

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the book
is also an explanation of the Law.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy urges the Israelites

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love and obey Jehovah

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land he is about to give them.

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book consists primarily

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of four discourses,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a song, and a blessing by Moses.

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first discourse,
found in chapters 1-4,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses reviews
Israel’s history after the Exodus

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and urges the people to remember

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah has done for them.

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, Moses reminds them

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah eliminated
the faithless and cowardly generation

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that, 40 years earlier,
feared the inhabitants of Canaan.

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:08.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second discourse,

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contained in chapters 5-26,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses exhorts the people

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey God’s commandments,

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not out of mere duty,

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because they love him

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all their heart, soul, and strength.

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the ancient world,

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreigners often had no legal rights

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and widows and fatherless children

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced many difficulties.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Israel, however, Jehovah’s Law

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applied to and benefited all,

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including foreigners, widows,

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fatherless children.

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves these individuals,

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:51.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his people should love them too.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 7, Moses tells the Israelites

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will clear away the nations
in the Promised Land,

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are more populous
and mightier than Israel.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 8,
Moses describes Israel’s inheritance

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a good land” with streams of water,

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:17.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wheat, barley, grapevines, fig trees,

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pomegranates, olive oil, and honey.

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is a land filled with false worship.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in chapter 12, the Israelites

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are commanded
to pull down the altars to false gods,

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to shatter the sacred pillars,

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:36.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to burn the sacred poles,

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to cut down the graven images.

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 16, Moses reminds God’s people

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to celebrate the Passover

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the three great festivals:

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Festival of Unleavened Bread,

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Festival of Weeks,

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Festival of Booths.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 18 contains a prophecy
about a future great prophet.

00:03:00.534 --> 00:03:04.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses says:
“Jehovah your God will raise up for you

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from among your brothers a prophet like me.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:10.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must listen to him.”

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third discourse, in chapters 27 and 28,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets out the cursings for disobedience

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the blessings for obedience.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the nation crosses the Jordan River,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the cursings are to be recited on Mount Ebal,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where half of the tribes are to stand.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other tribes
are to stand on Mount Gerizim

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bless the people.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:41.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 29 and 30
contain Moses’ fourth discourse,

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which he makes a covenant with the people,

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling them to choose life

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by obeying Jehovah.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 31,

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:54.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah commissions Joshua
as Moses’ successor.

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:57.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua should “be courageous and strong”

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he leads the nation
into its God-given land.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 32 records the song of Moses,

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which powerfully extols God’s faithfulness

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in contrast
with the Israelites’ unfaithfulness.

00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 33,

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read “the blessing that Moses . . . 

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pronounced on the Israelites
before his death.”

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the final chapter,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses ascends Mount Nebo,

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he is shown the Promised Land.

00:04:26.578 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says:

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have let you see it with your own eyes,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will not cross over there.”

00:04:34.378 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses then dies at 120 years of age,

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah buries him
in a secret location in Moab.

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you read the book of Deuteronomy,

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how Jehovah blesses those who love him,

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:53.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how he withholds his blessing

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who disobey him,

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discern how the principles
behind God’s Law

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:02.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are reflected in the teachings of Jesus

00:05:02.489 --> 00:05:04.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Prophet like Moses,

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is also the King of God’s Kingdom.

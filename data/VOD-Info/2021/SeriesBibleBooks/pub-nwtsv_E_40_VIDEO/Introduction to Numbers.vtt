An introduction to the book of Numbers.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numbers was written by Moses.

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:12.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began the writing
in the wilderness of Sinai

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and completed it on the plains of Moab.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.205 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The narrative covers a period

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:20.749 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of 38 years and 9 months,

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.670 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from 1512 to 1473 B.C.E.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.172 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when Moses finished the writing.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numbers gets its name

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the two times that Moses
numbered the people

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—first at Mount Sinai

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later on the plains of Moab.

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book highlights Jehovah’s ability
to lead his people,

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it underscores the need
to obey God’s appointed representatives,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it illustrates
the importance of strong faith.

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numbers has 36 chapters.

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 1 to 4,

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israelite males 20 years old and up,

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except for the Levites,
are registered for the army.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Levites are set apart
to assist the priests.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 5 to 9 discuss marital faithfulness,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quarantining, and service as a Nazirite.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 10, the Israelites pull away

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the wilderness of Sinai
by their tribal divisions.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 11,
the people complain about the manna,

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a miraculous food provided by Jehovah.

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next chapter,
Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses.

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this, Miriam
is temporarily struck with leprosy

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quarantined for seven days.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 13 and 14,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
twelve Israelite chieftains
—one from each tribe—

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sent to spy out the land of Canaan.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten spies bring back a negative report,

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the people want to return to Egypt.

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For this gross lack of faith,

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites must wander in the wilderness

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 40 years until that generation has died.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua and Caleb were the only spies

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had faith in Jehovah.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were the only spies
who would enter the Promised Land.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they did!

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb inherited the field
and settlements of Hebron.

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:31.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua’s inheritance was
in the mountainous region of Ephraim,

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he died at the age of 110.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 15 to 17 discuss
the various offerings for sins

00:02:41.974 --> 00:02:45.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the rebellion
and execution of Korah,

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dathan, Abiram, and their supporters.

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 21,
the people again complain about the manna,

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling it “contemptible bread.”

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 22 to 24,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moabite King Balak hires Balaam,

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:06.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a greedy non-Israelite, to curse Israel.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah makes Balaam
pronounce blessings.

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 25,

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of God’s people commit
sexual immorality with Moabite women.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This leads to idolatry

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the death of 24,000 Israelites
by a scourge from God.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:31.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next chapter,
Moses takes the second census.

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 27,
the daughters of Zelophehad tell Moses

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have no brother
to carry on the family inheritance.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah directs that in such situations

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a daughter may have that privilege.

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then God commands Moses
to ascend a mountain

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the region of Abarim
to view the Promised Land.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Moses is soon to die,

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells him to appoint Joshua

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:02.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lead Israel into Canaan.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 31 to 36 discuss
the apportioning of Canaan

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other matters as the Israelites

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:13.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepare to cross the Jordan River.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you read the book of Numbers,

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:20.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Jehovah patiently guides his people,

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see why we need to obey those appointed

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:25.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead among us,

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:29.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflect on our need for strong faith

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we approach a far greater Promised Land

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:35.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the new world under God’s Kingdom.

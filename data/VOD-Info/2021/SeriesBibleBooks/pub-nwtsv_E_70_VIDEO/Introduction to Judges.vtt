An introduction to the book of Judges.

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Judges was written
by the prophet Samuel,

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who completed it in about 1100 B.C.E.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:19.498 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Judges covers a period of some 330 years,

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:24.503 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from about 1450 to approximately 1120 B.C.E.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book primarily discusses
the exploits of the judges,

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom Jehovah used
to deliver his people from oppression.

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 1,

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read
that the Israelites do not drive out

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:44.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the pagan inhabitants of the land.

00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,
they subject some of them to forced labor.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 2,

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an angel warns the Israelites

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that because they
have not listened to Jehovah,

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:58.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the remaining people of the land

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will ensnare them in false worship.

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 3 to 16,

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:07.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that the angel’s words
begin to be fulfilled

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the death of Joshua and his generation.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In an often repeated cycle,

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites take up false worship;

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah abandons them to their foes;

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people cry out for help;

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah raises up judges to deliver them.

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:27.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 12 judges are

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Barak,

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:50.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The judges described in this book

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:56.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were men of faith
who led and delivered God’s people,

00:01:56.346 --> 00:02:00.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing Jehovah
as the true Leader and Deliverer.

00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were not judges
in the legal sense of the word.

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:09.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 3,

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:13.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Judges Othniel and Ehud
deliver the Israelites

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from servitude to the kings
of Mesopotamia and Moab.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 4,
a prophetess named Deborah

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:24.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sends for a man of faith named Barak.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She tells him that Jehovah

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will grant him victory over Sisera,

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the chief of the army
of Canaanite King Jabin,

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is oppressing Israel.

00:02:36.094 --> 00:02:38.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives Sisera’s entire army

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the hands of Barak.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:43.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much as one man remains.

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:48.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisera himself is executed
by a woman named Jael.

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:51.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 6 to 8,

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:55.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah uses Judge Gideon and just 300 men

00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:57.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead in delivering Israel

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Midianite oppression.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:04.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 11 and 12 discuss the exploits

00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:06.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Judge Jephthah.

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:03:08.627 --> 00:03:12.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he subdues the Ammonites who, 
along with the Philistines,

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had oppressed Israel for 18 years.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:19.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 13 to 16 describe the exploits

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Judge Samson,

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Nazirite to whom Jehovah gives

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:26.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extraordinary physical strength.

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:29.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samson takes “the lead in saving Israel

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the hand of the Philistines.”

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The events in chapters 17 to 21

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:38.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fit an earlier period of time.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:41.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 17,

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:44.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man in Ephraim named Micah,

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has “a house of gods,”

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hires a young Levite named Jonathan

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as his priest.

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:53.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan, however,
is not of the priestly family.

00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:57.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 18,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of Danites who are on their way

00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:01.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conquer land for their tribe

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:03.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make a stop at Micah’s house.

00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:05.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They steal his gods

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take Jonathan to be their priest.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 19 and 20,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
men of the Benjaminite city of Gibeah

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commit sex crimes
against the concubine of a Levite.

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:21.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Benjaminites fail
to hand over the guilty men,

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:24.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the other tribes war against Benjamin,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
almost wiping out the tribe.

00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:32.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you read the book of Judges,

00:04:32.961 --> 00:04:34.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the harm that can come

00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:37.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those who leave Jehovah,

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:39.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe how merciful God is

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his people repent

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:43.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cry out to him for help,

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see why we can trust Jehovah

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:47.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our Great Judge—

00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver us from all our enemies

00:04:49.853 --> 00:04:52.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his Kingdom.

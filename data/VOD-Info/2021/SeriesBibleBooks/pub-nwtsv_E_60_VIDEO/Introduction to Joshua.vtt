Joshua the son of Nun,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who succeeded Moses as leader of Israel.

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.330 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The book likely covers a period

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.332 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of more than 20 years,

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:23.377 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
starting in 1473 B.C.E.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:26.881 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and ending in about 1450 B.C.E.

when the book was completed.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book of Joshua
can be divided into four sections:

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

the apportioning of it
to the individual tribes,

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Joshua’s final exhortations.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book provides valuable lessons

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the need for courage, faith, and obedience

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially when God’s people
face strong enemies.

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 1 and 2,

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells Joshua
to be courageous and strong,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites prepare
to cross the Jordan River,

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Joshua sends out
two spies who go to Jericho.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spies go to the home
of Rahab, a prostitute.

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:21.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moved by faith in Jehovah,
she hides the spies,

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thereby disobeying the order of the king.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:29.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapters 3 to 6,
Israel miraculously crosses

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jordan River on dry ground,

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though the river is at flood stage.

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Israelites observe the Passover

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and begin to eat the produce of the land.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua then meets a man with a drawn sword.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The man is “the prince of Jehovah’s army.”

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through him, Jehovah tells Joshua
how to conquer Jericho.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:59.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 6 to 12

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 6, Jericho falls.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Rahab
and her father’s household are spared.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 7, Achan is exposed

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:15.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for disobediently taking spoil from Jericho.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is put to death along with his family,

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who no doubt helped to conceal his sin.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know?

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:27.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab and Achan provide contrasting lessons

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in faith and obedience.

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:34.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though a Canaanite, Rahab was saved

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:36.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she obeyed the spies

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed courageous faith in Jehovah.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Achan
was a member of God’s dedicated nation

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and witnessed Jehovah
bringing down the walls of Jericho,

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:51.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was put to death
because of his disobedience,

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lack of faith, and greed.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 8, Ai is conquered

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reduced to “a permanent mound of ruins.”

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:05.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joshua then reads God’s Law to the people.

00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:08.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Half of the nation stands
in front of Mount Gerizim

into making a covenant with them

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he spares their lives.

00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapters 10 to 12 contain a record

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of some of Israel’s God-given victories.

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God even hurls
great hailstones at the Amorites

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:35.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and makes the sun stand still so that Israel

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can “take vengeance on its enemies.”

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:40.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

to bury the bones of Jacob’s son Joseph

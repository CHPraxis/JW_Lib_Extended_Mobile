It felt like a bad dream.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was really zealous in the truth.

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were playing downstairs one day,

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:14.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and Mom came down to tell us

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.413 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she was leaving Jehovah and leaving Dad.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye to Mom,
that was the hardest day of my life.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My mother and father became inactive

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.547 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when I was about four years old.

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.383 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My father was never really around.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.136 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When my mom started to learn the truth,

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my dad said she was forbidden from studying.

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were to go to the meetings,
he would take us out forcibly.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He became verbally and physically abusive
to my mom.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents’ breakup was very tough.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a struggle for my mother
to raise two boys on her own.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:53.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would work two or three jobs,

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serving Jehovah just took a backseat.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my parents divorced,
my mom was very depressed.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did the best she could,

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah didn’t intend for mothers
to fill both roles

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as parents.

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I,
we made a conscious choice

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we weren’t going to make
the same bad choices that Mom did.

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We realized that it was up to us.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:20.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was baptized when I was 15.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thrived spiritually
when we didn’t have the opposition from Dad.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we could go out in service,
go to the meetings freely.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t have to hide our literature
for fear he would rip them up.

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was around 15 years old,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother took us to the meeting,

00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was determined
that this was going to be her last meeting.

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the night of a local needs part.

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the right time.

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:50.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah just opened my mother’s heart wide.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that experience,

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like she was a new woman.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sisters and I have always been a team.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pioneered together; we moved to Cambodia

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as need-greaters together.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re both in special full-time service

00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their husbands in Cambodia,

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ve been serving here in Myanmar Bethel,
along with my husband,

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for just over 11 years now.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mom set a stellar example
for me to follow.

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:18.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her relationship with Jehovah
was always above everything else.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was her example that helped me

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to set and reach spiritual goals.

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering
during my senior year of high school.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In nearly 20 years of full-time service,

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve spent most of that time
at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother had a very strong influence
on my theocratic goals.

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I had the privilege of attending
the first School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and currently we’re serving
in the circuit work.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one needs to be defined
by their negative circumstances.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:53.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:10 says:

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God himself will complete your training.’

00:02:56.613 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be tough at times,
but with Jehovah’s help, you can succeed.

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:05.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds me of what David said
in the 27th Psalm and verse 10;

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:10.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said: “Even if my . . . father [or] mother
abandon me,

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah . . . will take me in.”

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was definitely the case

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my situation.

00:03:17.634 --> 00:03:20.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t define us
by our upbringing or our past.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees our potential.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s up to us.

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah,
we can be anything we want to be.

00:00:03 It felt like a bad dream.
00:00:07 Our family was really zealous in the truth.
00:00:10 We were playing downstairs one day,
00:00:13 and Mom came down to tell us
00:00:14 she was leaving Jehovah and leaving Dad.
00:00:17 Saying goodbye to Mom, that was the hardest day of my life.
00:00:23 My mother and father became inactive
00:00:24 when I was about four years old.
00:00:26 My father was never really around.
00:00:30 When my mom started to learn the truth,
00:00:32 my dad said she was forbidden from studying.
00:00:35 If we were to go to the meetings, he would take us out forcibly.
00:00:39 He became verbally and physically abusive to my mom.
00:00:42 My parents’ breakup was very tough.
00:00:46 It was a struggle for my mother to raise two boys on her own.
00:00:49 She would work two or three jobs,
00:00:53 and serving Jehovah just took a backseat.
00:00:56 When my parents divorced, my mom was very depressed.
00:00:59 She did the best she could,
00:01:01 but Jehovah didn’t intend for mothers to fill both roles
00:01:04 as parents.
00:01:08 My sisters and I, we made a conscious choice
00:01:09 that we weren’t going to make the same bad choices that Mom did.
00:01:13 We realized that it was up to us.
00:01:16 So I dedicated my life to Jehovah
00:01:18 and was baptized when I was 15.
00:01:21 We thrived spiritually when we didn’t have the opposition from Dad.
00:01:25 Now we could go out in service, go to the meetings freely.
00:01:30 We didn’t have to hide our literature for fear he would rip them up.
00:01:34 When I was around 15 years old,
00:01:36 my mother took us to the meeting,
00:01:38 and she was determined that this was going to be her last meeting.
00:01:41 It was the night of a local needs part.
00:01:44 It was the right time.
00:01:46 Jehovah just opened my mother’s heart wide.
00:01:50 After that experience,
00:01:52 it was like she was a new woman.
00:01:55 My sisters and I have always been a team.
00:01:57 We pioneered together; we moved to Cambodia
00:02:00 to serve as need-greaters together.
00:02:01 They’re both in special full-time service
00:02:03 with their husbands in Cambodia,
00:02:06 and I’ve been serving here in Myanmar Bethel, along with my husband,
00:02:09 for just over 11 years now.
00:02:12 My mom set a stellar example for me to follow.
00:02:14 Her relationship with Jehovah was always above everything else.
00:02:18 It was her example that helped me
00:02:21 to set and reach spiritual goals.
00:02:24 I started pioneering during my senior year of high school.
00:02:27 In nearly 20 years of full-time service,
00:02:30 I’ve spent most of that time at Brooklyn Bethel and Warwick with my wife.
00:02:36 My mother had a very strong influence on my theocratic goals.
00:02:39 My wife and I had the privilege of attending the first School for Kingdom Evangelizers,
00:02:44 and currently we’re serving in the circuit work.
00:02:49 No one needs to be defined by their negative circumstances.
00:02:51 First Peter 5:10 says:
00:02:53 ‘God himself will complete your training.’
00:02:56 It might be tough at times, but with Jehovah’s help, you can succeed.
00:03:02 It reminds me of what David said in the 27th Psalm and verse 10;
00:03:05 he said: “Even if my . . . father [or] mother abandon me,
00:03:10 Jehovah . . . will take me in.”
00:03:12 That was definitely the case
00:03:15 in my situation.
00:03:17 Jehovah doesn’t define us by our upbringing or our past.
00:03:20 He sees our potential.
00:03:22 So it’s up to us.
00:03:23 With Jehovah, we can be anything we want to be.

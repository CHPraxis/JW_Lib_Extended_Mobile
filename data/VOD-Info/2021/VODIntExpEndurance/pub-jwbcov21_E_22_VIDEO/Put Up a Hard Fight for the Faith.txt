00:00:01 When I was in my 40’s, I was divorced,
00:00:05 I had three younger kids at home,
00:00:08 I was working three jobs,
00:00:10 and I had drifted away from the congregation.
00:00:13 I had an acquaintance who was telling me
00:00:17 that I was in a cult
00:00:20 and that I needed to look
00:00:23 at some information that he had.
00:00:27 When I was about 30 years old,
00:00:29 a fellow employee saw
00:00:30 that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:32 and was trying to access jw.org.
00:00:34 He told me about someone he knew in another country
00:00:37 who could prove to me that Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:39 didn’t have the truth.
00:00:41 That made me curious,
00:00:43 and little by little, I was persuaded to look
00:00:45 at apostate material.
00:00:48 I was born and raised in the truth,
00:00:51 chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah
00:00:53 at the age of 16,
00:00:56 but I began to associate with people
00:00:57 who had either formerly been associated
00:01:00 with the truth
00:01:01 or were very loosely associated with Jehovah and his organization,
00:01:05 and that’s really where the apostasy began to take root.
00:01:10 As I was reading this literature,
00:01:13 I saw through it to an extent,
00:01:16 but when you’re drifting away,
00:01:18 you’re looking for a reason not to believe.
00:01:22 I began to feed my mind
00:01:24 with different philosophies, different ideas.
00:01:27 I even studied different religions.
00:01:31 And, you know, I told myself that I was doing that academically,
00:01:35 but it started to influence the way
00:01:37 that I thought and felt about things.
00:01:39 Eventually, the elders reached out to me.
00:01:43 I was very combative with those brothers.
00:01:46 I even made the accusation that Noah’s ark was
00:01:50 a fairy tale, that it was part of mythology.
00:01:55 Those apostate doubts that I was reading
00:01:57 kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.
00:02:00 I stopped reading the publications,
00:02:02 I stopped going to the meetings,
00:02:04 and as a result, my spiritual routine was dead.
00:02:07 So I thought I’d try to find truth elsewhere.
00:02:10 And I looked for something out there that was
00:02:12 in accord with what I knew the Bible taught.
00:02:14 But I couldn’t find anything.
00:02:18 One Sunday morning, I rode by the Kingdom Hall,
00:02:21 and I said to myself,
00:02:23 ‘Oh, they’re all in there waiting for Armageddon.’
00:02:26 Immediately when I thought that thought,
00:02:29 I said to myself:
00:02:30 ‘Well, at least they feel good about themselves.
00:02:33 How do you feel?’
00:02:35 And the answer was I felt terrible.
00:02:40 Eventually, by skillful use of the Scriptures and just reasoning with me,
00:02:43 the elders got me to realize
00:02:45 that I had been ‘carried off’
00:02:47 or that I had been ‘taken captive’ by human philosophy,
00:02:51 by the deceptions
00:02:53 and the empty reasoning of men.
00:02:57 I actually said a prayer; I supplicated Jehovah
00:03:00 that he would really show me the way to the truth.
00:03:02 And he took away
00:03:04 this feeling of emptiness, spiritually speaking.
00:03:09 I realized that a relationship with Jehovah
00:03:12 —that’s our most precious possession.
00:03:15 I had to get back.
00:03:17 I started to study the Bible with sincerity.
00:03:20 I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart,
00:03:23 and I wanted it to effect change in my behavior.
00:03:26 Now as I did that, I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.
00:03:30 He began to help me to rebuild that relationship with him.
00:03:35 So I began to use Jehovah’s name.
00:03:38 Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy
00:03:41 and a great pleasure to me.
00:03:43 And the result was that my ministry was very productive.
00:03:45 And it’s an amazing joy
00:03:47 to be able to help someone come to love Jehovah.
00:03:51 I was just so happy
00:03:53 to be back under Jehovah’s wings
00:03:56 and have that peace of mind.
00:03:58 How loving Jehovah is!
00:04:00 He wants to help us.
00:04:01 And what better helper could we have?
00:04:03 He’s the best in the universe.

It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One night, he put a knife to his stomach

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said,
“Will you choose me or the truth?”

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband was cooperative.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would wave goodbye

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we went to the meetings,

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he wasn’t interested at all.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt really jealous

00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I saw families
sitting together at assemblies.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of work

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking care of his mother,

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband gradually started missing
meetings.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in our congregation,
with good intentions,

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed it out to him.

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:51.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way they did this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made him feel misunderstood

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discouraged,

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he put the Bible
and the publications away.

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:03.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had times when I wanted

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to drift away with him.

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:15.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband
with information,

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:18.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that made him worry
that I had turned into a fanatic.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:23.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he was genuinely concerned
for his family

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:26.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thought that I had joined
a weird religion.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One family in the congregation

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often invited us to meals

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and outdoor activities.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think my husband appreciated

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those small acts of kindness.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also tried to show that I appreciated him

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through my speech and conduct.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my children and I applied

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we learned in our lives,

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:53.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he gradually became interested
in the truth.

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words “safeguard your heart”

00:01:56.971 --> 00:01:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caught my eye.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to try and keep my heart

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my children’s hearts

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward Jehovah.

00:02:07.648 --> 00:02:09.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I went out in the ministry

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:11.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with my children,

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would point out various aspects

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.240 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s creation around us.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.242 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And before my husband

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.786 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would come home from work,

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made it a habit to teach them God’s Word.

00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made a conscious effort

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see myself in Paradise with my husband.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthened my resolve

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never leave the truth.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote caring notes to my husband

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I went to the meetings.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was convinced
that he would come back one day,

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did come back.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did not leave Jehovah,

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, right now all five

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of my children are in the truth,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I feel really blessed.

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:12.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family

00:03:12.171 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my husband

00:03:14.548 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the joy and appreciation

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:19.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just keep welling up.

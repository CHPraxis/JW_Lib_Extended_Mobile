Prayer is an important thing.

00:00:04.316 --> 00:00:06.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With everything I do,

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always go to Jehovah in prayer

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask for his guidance.

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:16.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was born on the 26th of March, 1923

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:17.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Panama.

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:22.251 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was baptized in August 1946

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.254 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:28.257 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:32.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in January of 1947.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are a couple of scriptures
that have been most influential in my life.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is Psalm 55:22,

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says:
“Throw your burden on Jehovah,

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will sustain you.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:50.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never will he allow
the righteous one to fall.”

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most trying experiences of my life

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was facing the Selective Service Board.

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I registered as was required by law,

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I received the classification of 1-A

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—fit for military service.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I then spoke

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.550 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Society’s Legal Department,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and I was instructed to appeal the decision

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:15.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I was a regular pioneer.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:20.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had to go to the draft board,

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there I was severely questioned.

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the problems they had

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that I had a part-time job,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they felt that

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interfered with my being classified
as a full-time minister.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because I was conducting

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 12 Bible studies at that time,

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took copies

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all those records
and presented them to the board.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The chairman said to me,

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are you saying that if we were

00:01:50.923 --> 00:01:53.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to talk to all of these people,
they would tell us

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you are conducting Bible studies
with them every week?”

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, “Yes, Sir.”

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While they are deliberating,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am praying hard, “Jehovah, help them

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a proper decision.”

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a few days’ time,

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the classification card came as 4-D.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was classified as a Religious Minister,

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I lifted my thoughts to Jehovah and said,
“Thank you, Jehovah, very much!”

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:24.498 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was in the circuit work in Cuba,

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:28.043 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had a few encounters with soldiers.

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.045 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult to understand

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:31.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the tense atmosphere

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that existed back in those days

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.594 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the freedom that those rebels had

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with shooting people—even Batista’s people.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t give it a second thought.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had just got through
serving a congregation in the hills,

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we took the local bus

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ran around that area.

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:52.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the highway,

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two soldiers stopped the bus

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ordered all the men to get off.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:00.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They started looking
at each of us one by one,

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sending everybody back on the bus.

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They looked at me and said:
“You! Stay there!”

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They pointed a rifle at me
and said, “Who are you?”

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I explained myself,

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they kept pointing the rifle.

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:15.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the soldiers said
to the driver, “Take off!”

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:18.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when you pray hard,

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you remember the scripture
at Proverbs 29:25:

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trembling at men is a snare,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one trusting in Jehovah
will be protected.”

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:34.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The driver said: “No!
He’s a circuit overseer!

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rides with me all the time.”

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:39.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he really defended me
and made me believe

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s angels intervened.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why I say
that I am a slave to prayer.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the most important thing in my life.

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:53.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back to the United States,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was being used

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the Service Department
in the full-time work.

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few years later,

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to give up the full-time work

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:05.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and take care of my family.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.601 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The adjustment I had to make

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a family man was hard

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:14.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because most of my life
was occupied in full-time service.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had to leave matters

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s hands.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started the prison ministry

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:24.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around May of 1974.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives you a measure of satisfaction

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in seeing how the Bible

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:32.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a very strong influence

00:04:32.876 --> 00:04:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on individuals
—to see criminals

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turn their life completely around.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible changes lives,

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why pioneering
has always been in my heart.

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so after my wife died,

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt that the proper thing to do

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to get back into the full-time service.

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:54.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of that,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering again in 1998.

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:03.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God has been good to me,
and at my age of 96,

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:05.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thank Jehovah every day

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the health and strength
that he permits me to enjoy

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:12.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I keep on going.

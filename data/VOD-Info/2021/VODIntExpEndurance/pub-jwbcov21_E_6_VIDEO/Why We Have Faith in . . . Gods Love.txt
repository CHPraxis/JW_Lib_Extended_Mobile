00:00:03 When I went through difficult times during my childhood,
00:00:08 Jehovah was like my Father.
00:00:13 He was my refuge.
00:00:18 The first memory I have of my dad
00:00:21 is when I went to visit him
00:00:24 in the prison where he was being held.
00:00:32 I asked Jehovah so many times for my dad to come back home.
00:00:37 One day,
00:00:39 my mom said, “Dad’s coming home today.”
00:00:42 I went to school, and when I came back, he was there.
00:00:46 I thought that he was finally back for good and that it would be forever.
00:00:56 But soon after that, I heard my mom and my grandmother crying,
00:01:00 and they started to explain that my dad was back in prison.
00:01:07 From then on, I felt hatred, resentment, and anger toward my dad
00:01:11 and also toward Jehovah.
00:01:19 I started to take drugs
00:01:22 and to lead an immoral and violent lifestyle.
00:01:31 One day, a couple of sisters gave me a magazine.
00:01:34 As I was looking through it,
00:01:36 I saw the experience about Dustin.
00:01:42 I began to think about the times
00:01:44 during my childhood
00:01:45 when I would take refuge in Jehovah
00:01:47 and would feel the same way Dustin did.
00:01:49 I would say: “Jehovah is there.
00:01:51 He hasn’t abandoned me.”
00:01:54 Dustin never doubted Jehovah’s love,
00:01:57 right up until the day he died.
00:02:01 That very night, I prayed to Jehovah.
00:02:05 I asked him to forgive me because,
00:02:08 well,
00:02:10 it wasn’t his fault.
00:02:14 That night I poured out all my feelings to Jehovah.
00:02:18 That burden that I felt was finally gone.
00:02:29 I felt Jehovah’s love every step of the way.
00:02:32 He showed it through the brothers who didn’t judge me for what I had done.
00:02:44 It doesn’t matter how many problems we have
00:02:47 or how far we’ve drifted away from Jehovah.
00:02:52 He never abandons us.

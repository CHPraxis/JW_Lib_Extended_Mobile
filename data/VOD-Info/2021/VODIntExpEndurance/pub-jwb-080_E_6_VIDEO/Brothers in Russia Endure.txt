00:00:01 On April 20, 2017,
00:00:04 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation criminalized
00:00:07 the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:12 As of July 4, 2019,
00:00:15 authorities have progressively seized 131 of the properties
00:00:18 owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:21 with an additional 60 properties subject to confiscation.
00:00:24 One of the seized properties
00:00:26 was the former Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.
00:00:30 At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continue
00:00:33 their aggressive attack on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:36 As of August 17, 2020,
00:00:39 there were 42 Witnesses who were in pretrial detention
00:00:42 or sentenced to prison,
00:00:44 32 who were under house arrest,
00:00:47 and 169 who were not allowed to leave their hometown.
00:00:51 All have been charged with organizing,
00:00:53 participating in, or financing the activity
00:00:56 of a so-called “extremist” organization.
00:01:00 At least 380 Witnesses were, at the time, under investigation
00:01:04 —ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.
00:01:09 What has this meant for the individuals affected?
00:01:11 As an example,
00:01:13 on June 3, 2018,
00:01:15 Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.
00:01:19 Local authorities initiated
00:01:21 criminal charges against him,
00:01:23 placing him in pretrial detention for two months.
00:01:26 This detention was extended seven times,
00:01:29 separating him from his wife and family
00:01:31 for a year and five months,
00:01:33 before he was finally tried and sentenced.
00:01:37 On November 5, 2019,
00:01:39 he was sentenced to six years in prison.
00:01:47 Two of our dear young people in Russia,
00:01:49 Brother Yegor Baranov and Sister Darya Dulova,
00:01:52 are courageously facing criminal conviction
00:01:54 and potential long-term imprisonment.
00:01:58 Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.
00:02:01 When the authorities raided her home, Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.

00:02:21 Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah
00:02:25 despite any opposition,
00:02:27 and they put their confidence in him in the assurance
00:02:30 that Jehovah is on their side!

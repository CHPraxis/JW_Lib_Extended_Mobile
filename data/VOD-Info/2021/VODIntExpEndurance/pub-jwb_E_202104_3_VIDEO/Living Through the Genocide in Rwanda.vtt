With us today, we have
Eugene and Odile Nteziryayo.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve graduated
from the 145th class of Gilead,

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they lived through this mayhem.

00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Odile, now, your family is Tutsi,

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this must have certainly
put them in danger.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The killing was happening
all over the country,

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my parents and my brother were killed.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that some religious leaders
were involved

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in killing people in the genocide.

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe how friendly people

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were previously living together

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now started killing their neighbors.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you get contact with the truth?

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after the genocide,
I was taken in by my aunt

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose family were Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I began studying the Bible with them.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in the <i>Live Forever</i>  book.

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a picture of a priest
blessing people in the church,

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he was blessing troops
who were going to kill.

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also I could see
how brothers and sisters in the congregation

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would love and encourage.

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they risked their lives
to take care of one another.

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that’s touching.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Eugene,

00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:00.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your family was not a direct target
of the violence,

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what other hardships did you face?

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The economic situation was very difficult.

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family had no money,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they could not buy food.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember my mom

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I can still see her lying on the bed
in complete despair,

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:23.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing what she could do
for us children.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders asked me to go
to the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I arrived,

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:34.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they handed me 18,000 Rwandan francs.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders told me
that my brothers and sisters from abroad

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered us this gift.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I immediately ran back home,

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found my mom still lying on the bed,

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave her the money.

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still see my mom crying

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the joy

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thankfulness
of what the brothers had done.

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent.

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, looking back at all the injustices
you and your family have suffered,

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Odile, what has helped you
to not become a bitter person?

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The preaching work is very important to me

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the more I talk
about the Bible’s promises,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more they become real to me.

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when I talk
about the resurrection hope

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the condition of the dead,

00:03:25.225 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helps me to feel

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my loved ones are not suffering anymore

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:33.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are waiting to be resurrected.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this makes me feel happy.

00:03:38.322 --> 00:03:41.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that comes to mind is

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:45.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 John 2:6, 7,

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the apostle John repeated
Jesus’ command

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loving one another just as Jesus loved us.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:58.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians during that time
were facing persecution,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now they needed a fresh application
of that scripture in their lives.

00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:05.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all love one another,

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but during difficult moments

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the ones our brothers in Rwanda
went through,

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:14.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they needed that fresh application

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this very commandment of Jesus:

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving one another to the point

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of risking our lives for our brothers.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:32.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being here in Gilead
has reminded me of that fact

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:36.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I really need to love
my brothers and sisters

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:39.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus loved us.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brothers and sisters in Rwanda

00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have given us a wonderful example

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of courage and faith and love.

00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for joining us

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

I was raised with three sisters,
and my mom was in the truth.

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember sitting on the sofa

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just talking about spiritual things
with my mom.

00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she taught us to appreciate
any assignment that we had

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see it as something very special.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering was my life.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.470 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Gilead to me was a way to give to others

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.890 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—to be very busy in service.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah.

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I really want to go to Gilead

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, if it’s possible, to have a wife too.”

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just thought, ‘Boy, are you pushy!’

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, and so—

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave me that.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to Gilead.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to my amazement,

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was the most lovely, spiritual sister,

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a student in the same class, Lois.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I met her and was able to marry her

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one week after Gilead.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arriving as a newlywed couple

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a missionary home with seven other people

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was quite daunting.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we didn’t let that faze us;
we were on our honeymoon.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colombia was a paradise spiritually.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved it so much!

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the kind of life we wanted.

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lois was a great teacher in the ministry.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always enjoyed working with her;
she was actually a great support for me.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Colombia had its risks.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember in the mornings,
sometimes it got to the point when

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would look at Lois and she would look
at me and we’d just say,

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I don’t see you, see you
in the Paradise,” you know?

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colombia became our home.

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We traveled the length and breadth

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the country
in our different assignments.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had been over 20 years in Colombia
when it became very evident

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Lois’s mom would need our care.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:32.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, of course,
would mean leaving our assignment.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:39.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It almost tore my heart apart
to leave Colombia.

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt I was abandoning so many privileges

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my treasured assignment.

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the U.S.A.,

00:02:50.733 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were working as a team,

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could see Lois really organized,

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the best of the situation.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping her mom

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was really the source,

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, of her deep joy.

00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:12.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Helping others was just a way of life

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Lois.

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:19.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter what privilege you have

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what responsibility;

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true happiness

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:28.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always found in giving.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, Lois got very ill.

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lois never cried about her illness

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or felt sorry for herself.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She always was focused on others

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would give of herself, even 

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the pain of illness.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that Lois has passed,

00:03:54.546 --> 00:03:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many times I think of her example,

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just motivates me to carry on.

00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:06.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at the Central America branch

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am surrounded by such a loving family.

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I resolved when

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:17.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went through this situation

00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:21.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with losing my wife to find others

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were in similar situations

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:29.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe sit down for a coffee.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just that fellow feeling

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:34.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of just being able

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show interest and to encourage

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another person is a great joy

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:46.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I personally find one
of the most helpful things

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure trials.

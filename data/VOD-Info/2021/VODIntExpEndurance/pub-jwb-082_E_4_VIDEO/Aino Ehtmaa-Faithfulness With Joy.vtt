When I was young,
my father wrote to me the Bible verse:

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your word is a lamp to my foot,
and a light for my path.”

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “Keep that always in mind.

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember God’s Word and live by it.”

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.713 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1929

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the city of Võru, Estonia.

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family was religious,
and my God-fearing parents

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly cared for me and provided everything
that a child would need.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my father learned the truth,
he gave each of us a Bible,

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we began to study it together.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father was arrested in the summer of 1948.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Estonia was then under the Soviet regime,

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was still working as a schoolteacher.

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The local Department of Education
asked him to come by.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went dressed in summer clothes

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wearing sandals,
but he never came back.

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:21.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At midnight, we heard someone
banging at the door.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We opened it, and soldiers came in

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and demanded our passports.

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We put the passports on the table,
and they just said,

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are under arrest.”

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:43.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pagari Prison in Tallinn
was a place everyone was afraid of,

00:01:43.832 --> 00:01:46.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was afraid too.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that I was taken down the steps

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the basement to a long corridor.

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was nothing in the cell
besides a bench.

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They slammed the door shut,

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:04.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is when I became a little scared.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:08.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I prayed to Jehovah to help me,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a sense of peace came over me.

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:15.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid down on the bench and fell asleep.

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was given a ten-year prison sentence

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an enemy of the State.

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A year later, we were transferred
to Russian prison camps.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spiritual food was hard to get.

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It couldn’t be sent by mail.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the angels somehow still provided for us,

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we always had something.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even a single verse

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a good thought can help in prison.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In any case, God’s Word
should be in our heart.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should never forget it,

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we can only remember one verse.

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:14.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point during my sentence,
I was allowed

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live outside the prison camp.

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:19.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness family took

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
me and two other sisters into their home.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living outside meant that the guard
was not watching us all the time.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:33.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to spend time together,
and we could preach a little.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:35.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even went from house to house.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I moved to a dormitory

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was not enough space.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:49.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it also meant that the literature
could be stored at my place,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if they arrested me,
it wouldn’t be a big deal,

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if the brother was arrested,
it would be much worse.

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They raided my place one night.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put all the literature on the table

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked me where I got it.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “The angels are bringing it to us

00:04:12.272 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeding us all the time.”

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:19.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was sentenced to another two years

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:21.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for possessing literature.

00:04:23.075 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, for the first time,

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:28.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses
were officially banned.

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:30.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a good feeling it was

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be recognized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:36.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really gave me joy.

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:43.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah’s help
in that things were never too hard

00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to bear.

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:47.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If things were getting too difficult,

00:04:47.057 --> 00:04:51.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something would always change
so that I could cope.

00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was always that feeling
that someone was looking after me.

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never felt alone or abandoned.

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:04.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If only we could be faithful all the time,

00:05:04.324 --> 00:05:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we would also be happy.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:10.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes we fail, and so we lose joy.

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:14.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithfulness gives joy.

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:20.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In prison, you can stay faithful
if you don’t leave Jehovah

00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:22.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you don’t forget to pray

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you always remember why you are there.

00:05:26.138 --> 00:05:29.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are there because you are
on Jehovah’s side.

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:33.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not a thief; I was not a killer.

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is worth being in prison for.

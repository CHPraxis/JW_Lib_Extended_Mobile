00:00:02 When I was young, my father wrote to me the Bible verse:
00:00:06 “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light for my path.”
00:00:12 And he said: “Keep that always in mind.
00:00:15 Remember God’s Word and live by it.”
00:00:23 I was born in 1929
00:00:25 in the city of Võru, Estonia.
00:00:28 My family was religious, and my God-fearing parents
00:00:31 lovingly cared for me and provided everything that a child would need.
00:00:38 When my father learned the truth, he gave each of us a Bible,
00:00:42 and we began to study it together.
00:00:48 My father was arrested in the summer of 1948.
00:00:52 Estonia was then under the Soviet regime,
00:00:56 but he was still working as a schoolteacher.
00:00:59 The local Department of Education asked him to come by.
00:01:02 He went dressed in summer clothes
00:01:05 and wearing sandals, but he never came back.
00:01:16 At midnight, we heard someone banging at the door.
00:01:21 We opened it, and soldiers came in
00:01:24 and demanded our passports.
00:01:28 We put the passports on the table, and they just said,
00:01:31 “You are under arrest.”
00:01:38 Pagari Prison in Tallinn was a place everyone was afraid of,
00:01:43 and I was afraid too.
00:01:46 I remember that I was taken down the steps
00:01:48 to the basement to a long corridor.
00:01:52 There was nothing in the cell besides a bench.
00:01:59 They slammed the door shut,
00:02:02 and that is when I became a little scared.
00:02:04 But then I prayed to Jehovah to help me,
00:02:08 and a sense of peace came over me.
00:02:11 I laid down on the bench and fell asleep.
00:02:20 I was given a ten-year prison sentence
00:02:23 as an enemy of the State.
00:02:31 A year later, we were transferred to Russian prison camps.
00:02:36 Spiritual food was hard to get.
00:02:39 It couldn’t be sent by mail.
00:02:42 But the angels somehow still provided for us,
00:02:45 and we always had something.
00:02:50 Even a single verse
00:02:52 or a good thought can help in prison.
00:02:56 In any case, God’s Word should be in our heart.
00:03:00 We should never forget it,
00:03:02 even if we can only remember one verse.
00:03:11 At one point during my sentence, I was allowed
00:03:14 to live outside the prison camp.
00:03:17 One Witness family took
00:03:19 me and two other sisters into their home.
00:03:24 Living outside meant that the guard was not watching us all the time.
00:03:28 We were able to spend time together, and we could preach a little.
00:03:33 We even went from house to house.
00:03:37 Eventually, I moved to a dormitory
00:03:40 because there was not enough space.
00:03:45 And it also meant that the literature could be stored at my place,
00:03:49 because if they arrested me, it wouldn’t be a big deal,
00:03:53 but if the brother was arrested, it would be much worse.
00:04:01 They raided my place one night.
00:04:04 They put all the literature on the table
00:04:07 and asked me where I got it.
00:04:09 I said, “The angels are bringing it to us
00:04:12 and feeding us all the time.”
00:04:15 So I was sentenced to another two years
00:04:19 for possessing literature.
00:04:23 Then, for the first time,
00:04:25 I heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses were officially banned.
00:04:28 What a good feeling it was
00:04:30 to be recognized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!
00:04:33 That really gave me joy.
00:04:39 I saw Jehovah’s help in that things were never too hard
00:04:43 for me to bear.
00:04:45 If things were getting too difficult,
00:04:47 something would always change so that I could cope.
00:04:51 There was always that feeling that someone was looking after me.
00:04:54 I never felt alone or abandoned.
00:05:00 If only we could be faithful all the time,
00:05:04 then we would also be happy.
00:05:06 But sometimes we fail, and so we lose joy.
00:05:11 Faithfulness gives joy.
00:05:15 In prison, you can stay faithful if you don’t leave Jehovah
00:05:20 and if you don’t forget to pray
00:05:22 and if you always remember why you are there.
00:05:26 You are there because you are on Jehovah’s side.
00:05:29 I was not a thief; I was not a killer.
00:05:33 But I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:05:36 and that is worth being in prison for.

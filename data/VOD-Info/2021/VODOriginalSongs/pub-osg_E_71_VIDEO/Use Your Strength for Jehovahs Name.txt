00:00:01 When you were younger, life seemed so simple.
00:00:06 You did your best to do what’s right—
00:00:11 Giving answers and preaching the good news;
00:00:16 You would pray each and ev’ry night.
00:00:21 But as you got older, with this world trying to mold you,
00:00:26 Suddenly it was not so easy to be knocking on those doors.
00:00:30 But as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder,
00:00:35 Never let go of Jehovah. The best is still in store.
00:00:43 You have a treasured place in Jehovah’s house;
00:00:48 He’ll help you out.
00:00:52 And you have so much to offer, so much to do.
00:00:58 Jehovah sees your faith; Know he treasures you.
00:01:11 Now you are older and dealing with changes,
00:01:16 Like all the trials have just begun.
00:01:21 Growing anxious from all of your fears—
00:01:25 Talk to God; he always listens.
00:01:30 And as you get wiser, find the ways you can apply
00:01:35 The truth in your life and feel the joy of sacrifice.
00:01:40 And as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder,
00:01:45 Never let go of Jehovah. The best is still in store.
00:01:52 You have a treasured place in Jehovah’s house;
00:01:58 He’ll help you out.
00:02:02 And you have so much to offer, so much to do.
00:02:07 Jehovah sees your faith; Know he treasures you.
00:02:22 So use your strength for Jehovah’s name.
00:02:27 You won’t regret it; just ask the ones who did it.

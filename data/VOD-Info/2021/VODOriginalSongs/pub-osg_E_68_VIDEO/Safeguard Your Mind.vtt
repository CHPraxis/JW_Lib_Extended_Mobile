I really want to do what’s right,
But there’s a war inside my mind—

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doubting if I measure up,
Wond’ring if I do enough.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lie awake and pray to you,
Because you told me that’s what I should do.

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When anxious thoughts surround me,
Jehovah, Father, you tell me

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really long to do your will,
But I get tired from how I feel,

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:44.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking life is just too tough
And I don’t deserve your love.

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I get up and out the door
And share my hope for the future in store.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I won’t let sadness drown me.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I won’t give up
pushing away

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:41.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Harmful thoughts
that come through the day.

00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No need to stress
and no need to doubt—

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’m glad you gave me a way out.

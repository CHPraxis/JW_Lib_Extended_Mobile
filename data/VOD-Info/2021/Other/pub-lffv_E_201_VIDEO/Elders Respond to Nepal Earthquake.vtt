of our brothers and sisters

who zealously preach the Kingdom good news

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to its more than 27 million residents.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tragically, on April 25,

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyday life
for the people of Nepal changed.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:49.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A 7.8-magnitude earthquake
shook the region

00:00:49.232 --> 00:00:51.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nepal’s residents were now suffering
the effects of the most powerful earthquake

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hit that region in over 80 years.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were caught by surprise

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by this event.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:11.788 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were not prepared

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for destruction of this scale.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But I am happy to say

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:19.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our dear brothers and sisters
are coping with this situation

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with calm spirit
and with true faith in Jehovah.

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One hundred sixty-three homes
of our brothers were damaged,

00:01:27.303 --> 00:01:30.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
91 of which were completely destroyed.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of the devastation,
there was an acute shortage

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of food, water,

00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sanitary shelter.

00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within 24 hours,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local brothers in less affected areas

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neighboring branch offices

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coordinated and began

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:53.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the distribution of relief supplies.

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A local disaster relief committee was formed,

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:20.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a medical team was dispatched

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for the physical and emotional needs

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:25.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those affected.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simultaneously,
attention was given to providing

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much-needed spiritual comfort
and encouragement.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.971 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Immediately after the first tremor,

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:36.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
elders of each congregation

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.575 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
started to contact

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.610 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
each member of their congregation.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there were frequent aftershocks,

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:46.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders and other brothers 
personally went to the house

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of each member
who could not be reached over the phone.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the first tremor hit us
on Saturday afternoon,

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were staying in the tents.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The very next day,
elders visited us.

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:03.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They spoke with us,
inquired about our situation.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are very encouraged.

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are not worried
about clothing and food.

00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:11.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister helped us.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within an hour,
elders came to help and encourage us.

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are visiting us daily;

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:19.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s beautiful; we are happy.

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:23.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On May 1,

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gary Breaux,
a representative of world headquarters,

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:30.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arrived to build up those
who had suffered losses.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:58.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A highlight of the visit
was a special meeting held on May 4,

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was streamed via the Internet

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a Kingdom Hall
to other congregations around the country.

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:07.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this was only nine days
after the earthquake.

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is very clear

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has provided
the needed help

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:14.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritually,

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:16.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentally,

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and physically

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his organization
and through his holy spirit.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My king.

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:26.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
General.

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve starved them out,

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehoiachin still refuses to meet.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Negotiations don’t concern me, General,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your incompetence does.

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finish it,

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you’ll not find me as forgiving as the gods.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:43.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my king.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Jehovah of armies says,

00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Because you did not obey my words,

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘all this land will be reduced to ruins,

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and this land and its inhabitants

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will have to serve the king of Babylon

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 70 years.’

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:25.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where have you been?

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s almost sundown!

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Jeremiah was speaking today, and I, uh

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I stopped by the temple on the way home.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re almost ready.

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were at the temple again today.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:56.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:59.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to look with appreciation upon his temple.”

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:06.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have something for you

00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can always have Jehovah’s words with you.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Papa.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s wrong?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to happen to us?

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What always happens to Jehovah’s faithful servants.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have no fear, Jehovah is our shield.

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dinner’s ready.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see our old neighbor at all?

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I didn’t see him at all today.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:12.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of strange,

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw our neighbor Eli the other day.

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eli is always getting into trouble.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Son, pick a psalm.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light and my salvation.”

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You always choose that one.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hushim.

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:41.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and my salvation.

00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whom should I fear?”

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:30.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay and play?

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to go with Papa.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:35.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come back, do you want to play Noah’s ark?

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:36.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:38.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who will you be?

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be a lion.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:44.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I’ll be an elephant.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiachin has surrendered!

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoiachin has surrendered!

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:04.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Household of Eber, tribe of Judah,

00:05:04.032 --> 00:05:05.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
open up at once!

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you outside! Now!

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:09.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s happened. They’re here.

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gather your things.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:11.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to go.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go?

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go where?

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t live here anymore.

00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hushim, grab our bags.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hate this place!

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go inside.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up! 

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All four—outside!

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Check the back room.

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:04.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the order of the king, you are coming with us.

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:08.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, of the tribe of Judah—

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will receive training

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:18.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the house of the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:20.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is my family.

00:08:20.812 --> 00:08:25.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Princes and nobles belong in the palace.

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:29.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not a prince; he’s just a boy.

00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:35.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:37.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, I will go if it’s a servant you seek.

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:39.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! I’m taking the boy.

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 Wait!

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we say goodbye?

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it quick.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong, my son.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:12.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:16.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel!

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:20.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mishael.

00:10:21.266 --> 00:10:22.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you seen anyone else?

00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:24.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You didn’t think we’d let you come here alone, did you?

00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:26.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azariah!

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:28.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hananiah!

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Chislon and Ahitub.

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:31.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to meet you.

00:10:31.443 --> 00:10:33.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move along.

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where are we going?

00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:40.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The palace, I guess.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Joseph in Pharaoh’s house?

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:44.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, like Joseph in the dungeon.

00:10:44.748 --> 00:10:46.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t seem so bad to me.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:48.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait!

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chislon, look!

00:10:53.798 --> 00:10:55.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t say something, I will.

00:10:56.968 --> 00:10:57.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:10:57.969 --> 00:10:59.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:10:59.012 --> 00:11:00.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move!

00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come back again sometime.

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the Jewish boys that Ashpenaz summoned.

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been chosen

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:16.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you are wise,

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:21.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you are lacking.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:24.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will learn our writing

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our language.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:33.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be given new names,

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:39.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the end of three years,

00:12:39.988 --> 00:12:43.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will serve the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:48.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today,

00:12:48.955 --> 00:12:50.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are foreigners

00:12:55.086 --> 00:12:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—tomorrow, the gods willing,

00:12:59.257 --> 00:13:01.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylonians.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meshach.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look like a Meshach.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:51.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our new names sound like their gods.

00:13:51.017 --> 00:13:52.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New names, new language—

00:13:53.728 --> 00:13:55.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon they’ll want us to worship their gods.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Calm down.

00:13:57.732 --> 00:14:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father had idols, and he worshipped Jehovah.

00:14:01.695 --> 00:14:04.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the same city I did?

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:06.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the center of the world.

00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:09.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll even eat from the king’s table.

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:14.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do Babylonians eat?

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:22.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His servants are given only the best.

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t eat from this food.

00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:35.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you making a big deal out of this?

00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:37.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s unclean.

00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:38.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a problem?

00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our, uh, our God

00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:47.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t allow us to eat such foods.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 You fear your God?

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:56.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.

00:14:56.833 --> 00:15:01.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I am afraid of my lord the king,

00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:05.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has assigned your food and drink.

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:11.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He insists on these selections

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:14.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain your strength and vitality.

00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:18.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if he should see you

00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:20.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking worse in appearance

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:22.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the other youths?

00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:26.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would make me guilty before the king.

00:15:29.783 --> 00:15:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must obey the king.

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:36.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So must you

00:15:37.499 --> 00:15:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you!

00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:47.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When dinner is served, I expect you to be hungry.

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:11.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t speak for us!

00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:16.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right.

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can make your own choice.

00:16:18.373 --> 00:16:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Didn’t you hear him?

00:16:19.582 --> 00:16:21.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have a choice.

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:23.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a new land with new laws.

00:16:25.797 --> 00:16:28.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what if some of the food is unbled?

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:31.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just food!

00:16:31.845 --> 00:16:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah commanded us not to eat blood.

00:16:33.763 --> 00:16:34.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s your interpretation.

00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:39.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must not eat . . . any blood at all.”

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s to interpret in that?

00:16:42.564 --> 00:16:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we should all take a moment and pray.

00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:46.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray.

00:16:47.068 --> 00:16:49.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here.

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:51.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:54.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is in Israel.

00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in Babylon now.

00:16:57.287 --> 00:16:59.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you believe that Jehovah is here too?

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said that we’re his witnesses.

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:09.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will people say about Jehovah

00:17:09.007 --> 00:17:11.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we give in and break his laws?

00:17:12.093 --> 00:17:14.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your meal is ready.

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:38.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear me?

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:17:43.249 --> 00:17:46.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we eat those foods, we’ll disobey our God.

00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:49.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you want to starve?

00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:51.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, of course not,

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:55.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but He forbids us from eating blood

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and food that he calls “unclean.”

00:17:57.972 --> 00:18:01.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, test your servants for ten days,

00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:04.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let us be given some vegetables to eat

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:06.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and water to drink.

00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:09.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vegetables?

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:14.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just give us ten days.

00:18:16.783 --> 00:18:18.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then deal with your servants

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to what you see.

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:40.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten days.

00:18:44.477 --> 00:18:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go, thanks to Jehovah.

00:18:57.865 --> 00:19:01.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to try this meat. It’s amazing!

00:19:09.335 --> 00:19:11.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you seen anything like this before?

00:20:45.848 --> 00:20:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! Really!

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes! Oh, wow!

00:20:51.312 --> 00:20:52.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:02.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz has summoned you.

00:21:21.926 --> 00:21:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, these young men are of royal . . .

00:21:24.303 --> 00:21:26.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know who they are.

00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:40.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been watching you

00:21:42.488 --> 00:21:45.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you.

00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:51.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t bow to our idols,

00:21:52.665 --> 00:21:55.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you pray only to your God,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you are not eating our foods.

00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:04.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They insisted that their God would not . . .

00:22:04.677 --> 00:22:07.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somehow,

00:22:07.221 --> 00:22:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you look healthier than the others. 

00:22:12.351 --> 00:22:14.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue giving them the diet they’ve requested.

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:23.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Belteshazzar,

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:32.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your future is bright.

00:22:34.373 --> 00:22:36.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t waste it.

00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:55.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring in the next group.

00:23:07.907 --> 00:23:10.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The total rations would be fifteen <i>kurru,</i>

00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two <i>p</i><i>ā</i><i>nu,</i>

00:23:11.994 --> 00:23:14.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and five <i>s</i><i>ūtu.</i>

00:23:15.998 --> 00:23:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Correct.

00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much interest

00:23:21.545 --> 00:23:24.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may a merchant charge on money and grain?

00:23:28.135 --> 00:23:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be 40 percent, my lord.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forty percent?

00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you learned only to be a thief

00:23:35.184 --> 00:23:37.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the past three years?

00:23:37.937 --> 00:23:39.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you, Meshach?

00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:42.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rate is 20 percent.

00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:44.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good.

00:23:47.863 --> 00:23:50.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which star of Enlil is brightest

00:23:50.116 --> 00:23:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Urgula constellation?

00:24:04.255 --> 00:24:05.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know?

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:08.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the Lugal star.

00:24:08.926 --> 00:24:10.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Impressive.

00:24:11.637 --> 00:24:13.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a tower that is high

00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:16.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, nonetheless, has no shade.

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:19.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your ziggurat?

00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:26.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hopeless.

00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:34.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can solve the riddle?

00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:37.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is sunlight, my lord.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Correct.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wise men teach that the gods

00:24:41.917 --> 00:24:44.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are responsible for everything.

00:24:46.047 --> 00:24:48.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that’s so,

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:52.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do the good suffer and the evil prosper?

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has been able to answer . . .

00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:06.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you say, O king,

00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:09.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the wise do not always have the food,

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor do the intelligent always have the riches,

00:25:12.823 --> 00:25:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘nor do those with knowledge always have success,

00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:19.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because time and unexpected events

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overtake them all.’

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who wrote those words?

00:25:26.587 --> 00:25:28.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Solomon.

00:25:29.507 --> 00:25:31.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Famed for his wisdom.

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:36.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But its source was his God,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our God, Jehovah.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take them away.

00:25:47.274 --> 00:25:48.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When should we return?

00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You won’t!

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to your families.

00:25:55.282 --> 00:25:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve proven worthless.

00:25:58.202 --> 00:26:02.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, no—not the four of you.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have more to discuss.

00:26:13.217 --> 00:26:15.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know your God,

00:26:15.219 --> 00:26:17.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve proven to be ten times better

00:26:17.388 --> 00:26:19.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than any priest or conjurer that I’ve met.

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:24.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz will arrange

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you to serve in the palace with my wise men.

00:26:28.274 --> 00:26:31.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe your gifts were wasted in Jerusalem,

00:26:31.277 --> 00:26:33.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but here they will be put to use.

00:26:53.424 --> 00:26:56.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The victory in Jerusalem is complete.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:01.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our forces are now preparing to besiege Tyre.

00:27:02.266 --> 00:27:04.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They should remember what happened to Zedekiah.

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:09.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gods are with us!

00:27:23.537 --> 00:27:25.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah,

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:27.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is it?

00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about Jerusalem.

00:27:53.275 --> 00:27:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you going?

00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:56.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see my family.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, we’ve had to make do.

00:28:32.147 --> 00:28:33.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:28:58.757 --> 00:29:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come, eat.

00:29:09.393 --> 00:29:11.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 What’s wrong?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jerusalem.

00:29:19.695 --> 00:29:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tore down the walls;

00:29:23.073 --> 00:29:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they torched its towers.

00:29:34.668 --> 00:29:36.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many died.

00:29:36.295 --> 00:29:41.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they burned down Jehovah’s house!

00:29:44.303 --> 00:29:47.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why didn’t our people listen?

00:29:50.184 --> 00:29:51.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they think Jehovah couldn’t see

00:29:51.977 --> 00:29:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they were doing?

00:29:54.605 --> 00:29:57.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as our temple existed,

00:29:57.608 --> 00:30:00.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our people had hope.

00:30:05.157 --> 00:30:08.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jehovah exists,

00:30:08.243 --> 00:30:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have hope.

00:30:11.872 --> 00:30:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he’s rejected us

00:30:14.958 --> 00:30:18.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of our unrighteousness.

00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:21.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He hasn’t

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not everyone.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told Ezekiel

00:30:27.554 --> 00:30:31.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in his eyes you

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are as righteous as Noah

00:30:35.979 --> 00:30:38.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Job.

00:30:41.902 --> 00:30:44.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that?

00:30:45.781 --> 00:30:47.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did.

00:30:53.372 --> 00:30:57.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah cares so much,

00:30:57.584 --> 00:30:59.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then why are we in exile? 

00:31:04.466 --> 00:31:07.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t we go home?

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can’t we be together?

00:31:11.014 --> 00:31:13.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are home, Son.

00:31:31.118 --> 00:31:33.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have all the answers.

00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:39.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:31:41.378 --> 00:31:44.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be blessed.

00:32:34.056 --> 00:32:36.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:32:38.936 --> 00:32:42.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a dream,

00:32:42.648 --> 00:32:45.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m agitated.

00:32:45.067 --> 00:32:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to know what I dreamed.

00:32:47.069 --> 00:32:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Relate the dream to your servants.

00:32:50.405 --> 00:32:51.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will tell the interpretation.

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:53.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:54.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t make the dream known to me

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:56.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the interpretation,

00:32:56.954 --> 00:32:58.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be dismembered,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your houses will be turned into public latrines.

00:33:02.668 --> 00:33:05.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you do, tell me the dream

00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:07.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the interpretation,

00:33:07.631 --> 00:33:11.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive gifts and a reward

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:13.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and great honor.

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:15.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve got to buy some time

00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:16.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can consult the spirits.

00:33:16.473 --> 00:33:18.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scrolls will tell you what the dreams say.

00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:20.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to come up with a plan.

00:33:20.185 --> 00:33:22.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to tell him the dream!

00:33:22.437 --> 00:33:23.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:33:23.438 --> 00:33:24.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one has ever asked this before.

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:25.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we do it?

00:33:25.607 --> 00:33:26.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we do?

00:33:26.608 --> 00:33:28.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you can buy us some time,

00:33:28.777 --> 00:33:30.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can consult the spirits.

00:33:31.864 --> 00:33:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve agreed to tell me something false

00:33:34.116 --> 00:33:37.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deceitful until the situation changes.

00:33:37.244 --> 00:33:38.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceitful?

00:33:38.704 --> 00:33:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deceitful!

00:33:41.665 --> 00:33:43.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is not a man on earth

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can do what the king demands.

00:33:45.752 --> 00:33:47.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What the king is asking is difficult.

00:33:47.462 --> 00:33:51.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one exists who could tell this to the king except

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:53.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except the gods.

00:34:04.146 --> 00:34:06.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arioch,

00:34:06.106 --> 00:34:07.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seize them!

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down!

00:34:09.735 --> 00:34:10.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down!

00:34:10.193 --> 00:34:11.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kill them!

00:34:12.613 --> 00:34:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry!

00:34:14.865 --> 00:34:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go, go, go!

00:34:16.325 --> 00:34:18.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the order of the king, round them up!

00:34:22.205 --> 00:34:23.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah.

00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:24.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re in danger.

00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:25.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? What happened?

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:26.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t hear everything,

00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:27.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the wise men angered the king.

00:34:27.753 --> 00:34:29.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

00:34:30.422 --> 00:34:33.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah here.

00:34:33.258 --> 00:34:35.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll try to learn more.

00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:42.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes—Chaldean, Egyptian, Jewish

00:34:42.893 --> 00:34:45.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the wise men.

00:34:48.148 --> 00:34:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arioch?

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:52.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, you shouldn’t be here.

00:34:52.736 --> 00:34:55.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is there such a harsh order from the king?

00:34:55.322 --> 00:34:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a dream,

00:34:57.366 --> 00:34:59.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Flee now!

00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:04.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you escape before dawn, you might survive.

00:35:16.593 --> 00:35:20.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me why I asked for them

00:35:20.138 --> 00:35:22.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you haven’t brought them?

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why aren’t the gods talking to them?

00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:28.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want them and all of their families brought here.

00:35:28.855 --> 00:35:33.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to look into the whites of their eyes

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ask them why.

00:35:45.247 --> 00:35:48.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hang them without their skins!

00:35:49.459 --> 00:35:51.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the gods look down on their flesh,

00:35:51.795 --> 00:35:53.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then throw their bodies in the Euphrates.

00:35:54.172 --> 00:35:55.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ashpenaz.

00:35:57.217 --> 00:36:00.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What good are wise men without wisdom?

00:36:01.263 --> 00:36:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing here?

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:04.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to speak with the king.

00:36:04.141 --> 00:36:05.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to go!

00:36:05.726 --> 00:36:08.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, let me speak with him!

00:36:11.481 --> 00:36:14.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, this is Belteshazzar.

00:36:16.528 --> 00:36:18.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king,

00:36:19.197 --> 00:36:22.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:25.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, where is your God? Where?

00:36:32.127 --> 00:36:34.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe that he—

00:36:34.629 --> 00:36:37.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:36:37.799 --> 00:36:39.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, give me time.

00:36:46.475 --> 00:36:48.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have until morning.

00:36:48.935 --> 00:36:51.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do what?

00:36:51.063 --> 00:36:52.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reveal the dream to the king.

00:36:57.569 --> 00:36:58.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how much of the dream

00:36:58.987 --> 00:37:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has Jehovah revealed to you?

00:37:01.865 --> 00:37:03.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, nothing yet.

00:37:06.661 --> 00:37:09.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah revealed

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:12.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would interpret it, right?

00:37:13.794 --> 00:37:15.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not exactly.

00:37:15.337 --> 00:37:16.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:37:16.338 --> 00:37:18.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you know this is even going to happen?

00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:22.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can’t be sure.

00:37:22.886 --> 00:37:23.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d better be sure!

00:37:25.347 --> 00:37:27.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His name is at stake.

00:37:27.432 --> 00:37:28.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he reveals the dream,

00:37:28.767 --> 00:37:30.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it proves that he’s the true God!

00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:32.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If?

00:37:42.948 --> 00:37:44.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do to help?

00:37:47.953 --> 00:37:48.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray.

00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:51.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that Jehovah have mercy on us.

00:38:01.383 --> 00:38:03.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah,

00:38:04.594 --> 00:38:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely you didn’t bring us here just to die.

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:11.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will people say?

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:15.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told them that you

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the God of the heavens,

00:38:17.065 --> 00:38:20.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:38:21.278 --> 00:38:24.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please,

00:38:24.072 --> 00:38:26.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vindicate yourself.

00:39:09.784 --> 00:39:11.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerah!

00:39:29.012 --> 00:39:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have found a man from the exiles of Judah

00:39:31.514 --> 00:39:33.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can make known the interpretation to the king.

00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:36.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know who he is.

00:39:37.437 --> 00:39:39.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you really make known to me

00:39:39.397 --> 00:39:40.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dream that I saw

00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:43.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation?

00:39:54.663 --> 00:39:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a God in the heavens

00:39:56.665 --> 00:39:59.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

00:40:00.502 --> 00:40:03.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:07.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 what is to happen in the final part of the days.

00:40:09.386 --> 00:40:12.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is your dream:

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You saw an immense image.

00:40:41.626 --> 00:40:45.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That image was standing in front of you.

00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:51.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You yourself are the head of gold.

00:40:52.345 --> 00:40:55.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after you another kingdom will rise,

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inferior to you.

00:40:57.767 --> 00:41:00.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then another kingdom,

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a third one, of copper,

00:41:02.397 --> 00:41:04.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will rule over the whole earth.

00:41:05.483 --> 00:41:08.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for the fourth kingdom,

00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be strong like iron.

00:41:12.198 --> 00:41:14.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kingdom will be divided.

00:41:14.826 --> 00:41:16.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the toes of the feet

00:41:16.995 --> 00:41:20.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:41:20.373 --> 00:41:23.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:41:23.668 --> 00:41:26.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and partly fragile.

00:41:26.129 --> 00:41:28.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the days of those kings,

00:41:28.131 --> 00:41:30.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of heaven

00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:32.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will set up a kingdom

00:41:32.594 --> 00:41:34.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will never be destroyed.

00:41:34.596 --> 00:41:36.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this kingdom

00:41:36.598 --> 00:41:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not be passed on to any other people.

00:41:51.154 --> 00:41:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will crush and put an end

00:41:54.157 --> 00:41:57.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all these kingdoms.

00:42:28.483 --> 00:42:33.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it alone will stand forever.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dream is true,

00:42:42.455 --> 00:42:46.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation is trustworthy.

00:43:23.079 --> 00:43:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quick!

00:43:24.581 --> 00:43:26.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring a fine robe

00:43:27.292 --> 00:43:30.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a necklace of gold.

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Burn incense before him.

00:43:54.152 --> 00:43:58.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly your God is a God of gods

00:43:58.364 --> 00:44:00.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Lord of kings

00:44:00.408 --> 00:44:02.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Revealer of secrets.

00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May your God be honored

00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:07.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the honor I give you.

00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:13.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are now ruler over all the province of Babylon.

00:44:17.884 --> 00:44:20.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, these servants

00:44:20.303 --> 00:44:23.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also worship the God in the heavens.

00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:27.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May they too be appointed to administer the province?

00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make the necessary arrangements.

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:38.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have proven far superior

00:44:40.281 --> 00:44:43.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than these so-called wise men.

00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now appoint you their chief prefect.

00:44:55.338 --> 00:44:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you hear Nebuchadnezzar?

00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:00.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he said, “Your God is a God of gods

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 and a Lord of kings.”

00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:06.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered your prayer.

00:45:06.057 --> 00:45:08.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:45:23.366 --> 00:45:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to happen next?

00:45:26.578 --> 00:45:28.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we go back to Jerusalem?

00:45:30.665 --> 00:45:32.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what happens next,

00:45:32.667 --> 00:45:35.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but as long as we stay close to Jehovah . . .

00:45:36.629 --> 00:45:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will always be with us

00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as we have faith in him.

00:45:48.016 --> 00:45:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing in the stars

00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about kingdoms crushing kingdoms.

00:45:52.061 --> 00:45:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:45:59.193 --> 00:46:00.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a trick!

00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how did he know the dream?

00:46:02.905 --> 00:46:04.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amar-Utu!

00:46:05.867 --> 00:46:09.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amar-Utu, what message from the gods?

00:46:09.203 --> 00:46:11.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have examined a sheep’s liver.

00:46:11.748 --> 00:46:13.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your future is bright.

00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:14.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars of Shabatu, the giant,

00:46:14.959 --> 00:46:16.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak only of your grandeur.

00:46:16.294 --> 00:46:18.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m the head of gold.

00:46:18.296 --> 00:46:19.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah said so.

00:46:19.672 --> 00:46:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dream revealed many good things.

00:46:21.591 --> 00:46:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this Belteshazzar, he’s a Jew—

00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:27.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a clever Jew, to be sure,

00:46:27.055 --> 00:46:29.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he couldn’t interpret dreams

00:46:29.057 --> 00:46:30.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he came to Babylon.

00:46:30.642 --> 00:46:33.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He first had to be educated here

00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:37.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given a Babylonian name,

00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:41.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a name that honors our great god Bel.

00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:43.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bel used this young captive

00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:45.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reveal great things to you—

00:46:45.698 --> 00:46:49.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bel,

00:46:49.118 --> 00:46:52.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not Jehovah, who you defeated in Jerusalem.

00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:19.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the tree is my enemies.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is it after the seven times pass over?

00:47:26.823 --> 00:47:31.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it is you again, O great king.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are fools.

00:47:36.749 --> 00:47:38.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last—

00:47:38.835 --> 00:47:43.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar, chief of the magic-practicing priests,

00:47:43.756 --> 00:47:46.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the other wise men are unable

00:47:46.092 --> 00:47:49.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the interpretation known to me.

00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you are able to do so.

00:47:58.062 --> 00:48:00.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Explain to me the visions I’ve seen in my dreams.

00:48:05.486 --> 00:48:08.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you dream?

00:48:13.453 --> 00:48:16.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a tree in the midst of the earth,

00:48:16.956 --> 00:48:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its height, it was enormous

00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:21.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it was enormous.

00:48:21.669 --> 00:48:24.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the tree grew and became strong,

00:48:25.298 --> 00:48:27.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its top—

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And its top reached the heavens,

00:48:29.927 --> 00:48:31.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reached the heavens,

00:48:31.137 --> 00:48:33.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the tree grew and became strong.

00:48:34.265 --> 00:48:35.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . holy one . . .

00:48:35.308 --> 00:48:36.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chop down the tree!

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I saw a watcher . . .

00:48:37.268 --> 00:48:38.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chop down the tree!

00:48:38.853 --> 00:48:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . with a banding of iron

00:48:40.563 --> 00:48:42.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of copper.

00:48:52.408 --> 00:48:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So who’s the tree?

00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O my lord,

00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:22.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may the dream apply to those hating you

00:49:22.104 --> 00:49:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation to your enemies.

00:49:25.817 --> 00:49:27.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The tree that you saw

00:49:27.944 --> 00:49:31.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grew great and became strong,

00:49:31.072 --> 00:49:32.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose top reached the heavens

00:49:32.949 --> 00:49:35.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was visible to all the earth,

00:49:35.493 --> 00:49:38.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which had beautiful foliage, abundant fruit,

00:49:38.454 --> 00:49:40.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and food for all,

00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:43.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell

00:49:43.084 --> 00:49:45.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on whose branches

00:49:45.086 --> 00:49:47.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the birds of the heavens would reside,

00:49:48.506 --> 00:49:51.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is you, O king.

00:49:52.635 --> 00:49:56.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the king saw a watcher, a holy one,

00:49:56.681 --> 00:49:59.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down from the heavens who was saying:

00:49:59.851 --> 00:50:02.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Chop down the tree and destroy it,

00:50:23.374 --> 00:50:26.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but leave the stump with its roots in the ground

00:50:26.419 --> 00:50:29.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with a banding of iron and of copper.

00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:32.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let the dew of the heavens make it wet,

00:50:32.842 --> 00:50:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and let its portion be

00:50:34.844 --> 00:50:36.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the beasts of the field

00:50:36.679 --> 00:50:39.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until seven times pass over it.”

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:44.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interpretation, O king;

00:50:44.562 --> 00:50:47.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is the decree of the Most High.

00:50:47.773 --> 00:50:50.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be driven away from among men,

00:50:50.902 --> 00:50:53.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field,

00:50:54.906 --> 00:50:57.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will be given vegetation to eat

00:50:57.491 --> 00:50:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like bulls,

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become wet

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the dew of the heavens,

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:05.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seven times will pass over you

00:51:05.249 --> 00:51:07.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you know

00:51:07.335 --> 00:51:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Most High is Ruler

00:51:09.378 --> 00:51:11.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the kingdom of mankind

00:51:11.464 --> 00:51:14.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he grants it to whomever he wants.

00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:18.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because they said to leave

00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:20.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stump of the tree with its roots,

00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:22.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your kingdom will be yours again

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after you come to know

00:51:24.769 --> 00:51:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the heavens are ruling.

00:51:30.358 --> 00:51:32.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn away from your sins

00:51:32.735 --> 00:51:34.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by doing what is right

00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:36.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from your iniquity

00:51:36.155 --> 00:51:38.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing mercy to the poor.

00:51:39.492 --> 00:51:43.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be that your prosperity will be extended.

00:51:57.635 --> 00:51:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Belteshazzar know when this will happen?

00:52:00.304 --> 00:52:01.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:52:03.849 --> 00:52:06.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your wise men

00:52:06.852 --> 00:52:09.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubt that his interpretation can be trusted.

00:52:09.689 --> 00:52:12.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the facts:

00:52:12.316 --> 00:52:17.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Egypt’s gods told the Egyptians

00:52:17.321 --> 00:52:19.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would defeat us.

00:52:20.199 --> 00:52:22.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, you destroyed them.

00:52:24.954 --> 00:52:27.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why should the God of the Jews

00:52:28.624 --> 00:52:30.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be given any more credit?

00:52:33.212 --> 00:52:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at what you’ve done.

00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:39.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The gods are with you.

00:52:39.885 --> 00:52:42.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have made Babylon

00:52:42.013 --> 00:52:44.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the greatest kingdom on earth.

00:52:46.976 --> 00:52:51.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belteshazzar wants you to grovel like a slave

00:52:51.897 --> 00:52:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you.

00:52:53.983 --> 00:52:57.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A strong king means a strong kingdom.

00:52:59.321 --> 00:53:00.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us continue with our discussion

00:53:00.573 --> 00:53:02.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the stars of Enlil.

00:53:02.116 --> 00:53:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Lugal star is the brightest star

00:53:04.827 --> 00:53:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Urgula constellation.

00:53:06.495 --> 00:53:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stars are reliable,

00:53:08.998 --> 00:53:11.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike the gods of defeated nations.

00:53:13.127 --> 00:53:14.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to Jerusalem.

00:53:15.796 --> 00:53:17.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you could

00:53:17.548 --> 00:53:19.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was anything left of it.

00:53:35.524 --> 00:53:39.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has Jehovah revealed anything new?

00:53:39.612 --> 00:53:41.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been ten months

00:53:41.614 --> 00:53:44.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:53:44.575 --> 00:53:46.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trust my God.

00:53:46.243 --> 00:53:49.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as we do when we read the stars.

00:53:51.123 --> 00:53:53.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we still shape the message.

00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:56.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be held responsible for the words,

00:53:56.295 --> 00:53:59.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when a wise man speaks lies, well . . .

00:54:03.052 --> 00:54:05.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I spoke only what Jehovah revealed.

00:54:05.346 --> 00:54:08.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you forgotten what happened

00:54:08.265 --> 00:54:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when some couldn’t interpret the dream image?

00:54:10.893 --> 00:54:12.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A death sentence followed.

00:54:12.728 --> 00:54:15.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was a flattering interpretation,

00:54:15.606 --> 00:54:18.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the king was a head of gold.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, you’ve said he’ll go mad,

00:54:22.071 --> 00:54:25.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing has happened.

00:54:25.366 --> 00:54:27.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will happen.

00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:30.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, maybe not.

00:54:30.746 --> 00:54:33.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your words are against the king.

00:54:33.457 --> 00:54:35.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s treason.

00:54:36.293 --> 00:54:39.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no one can protect you from that.

00:55:02.987 --> 00:55:04.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten months.

00:55:05.573 --> 00:55:07.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing has happened.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But your words are against the king.

00:55:12.538 --> 00:55:15.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:55:16.417 --> 00:55:18.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s treason.

00:55:19.628 --> 00:55:22.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no one can protect you from that.

00:56:03.464 --> 00:56:07.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can always have Jehovah’s words with you.

00:56:13.766 --> 00:56:16.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah.”

00:56:16.977 --> 00:56:20.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not hand me over to my adversaries,

00:56:20.064 --> 00:56:23.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for false witnesses have risen up against me,

00:56:23.484 --> 00:56:27.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they threaten me with violence.

00:56:27.446 --> 00:56:32.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where would I be if I did not have faith

00:56:32.117 --> 00:56:34.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I would see Jehovah’s goodness

00:56:34.245 --> 00:56:36.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the land of the living?”

00:56:38.582 --> 00:56:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:56:42.002 --> 00:56:45.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somehow, you look healthier than the others.

00:56:46.757 --> 00:56:49.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue giving them the diet they’ve requested.

00:56:50.552 --> 00:56:52.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know your God,

00:56:52.888 --> 00:56:54.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ve proven

00:56:54.014 --> 00:56:55.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ten times better than any priest

00:56:55.307 --> 00:56:57.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or conjurer I’ve met.

00:56:57.935 --> 00:57:00.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had a dream,

00:57:00.271 --> 00:57:02.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:57:13.534 --> 00:57:16.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered your prayer.

00:57:18.914 --> 00:57:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hope in Jehovah;

00:57:22.126 --> 00:57:25.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“be courageous and strong of heart.

00:57:25.254 --> 00:57:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, hope in Jehovah.”

00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:40.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepare a sacrifice to Bel.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the gods.

00:57:50.946 --> 00:57:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the gods.

00:57:56.535 --> 00:58:00.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This city is the jewel of the world.

00:58:00.205 --> 00:58:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the Ishtar Gate, the gardens,

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:05.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ziggurat so high

00:58:05.919 --> 00:58:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it reaches the gods themselves.

00:58:08.213 --> 00:58:10.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one would question that.

00:58:11.925 --> 00:58:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s odd that only twelve months ago

00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of your servants

00:58:16.013 --> 00:58:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dared to suggest that you’d go insane.

00:58:17.473 --> 00:58:20.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is this not Babylon the Great

00:58:20.726 --> 00:58:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I myself have built for the royal house

00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:28.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my own strength and might

00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the glory of my majesty?

00:58:32.279 --> 00:58:34.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“To you it is being said,

00:58:34.823 --> 00:58:36.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“O King Nebuchadnezzar,

“‘The kingdom has gone away from you,

to whomever he wants.’”

No! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Father!

00:59:14.613 --> 00:59:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father!

00:59:38.887 --> 00:59:40.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you and your wise men

00:59:40.889 --> 00:59:42.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have failed consistently,

00:59:42.683 --> 00:59:44.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you claim Daniel to be a fraud?

00:59:44.351 --> 00:59:45.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a trick.

00:59:45.644 --> 00:59:49.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel conspired against your father.

00:59:49.064 --> 00:59:50.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A trick.

00:59:50.649 --> 00:59:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then how did he make it happen?

00:59:55.946 --> 00:59:58.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he has said has come true,

00:59:58.073 --> 01:00:00.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is quite different from our history with you.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father trusted you,

01:00:02.202 --> 01:00:04.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I trusted you, and you were all wrong.

01:00:04.538 --> 01:00:06.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either you failed or Marduk did.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Either way, . . .

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me:

Who is this God in the heavens, Jehovah?

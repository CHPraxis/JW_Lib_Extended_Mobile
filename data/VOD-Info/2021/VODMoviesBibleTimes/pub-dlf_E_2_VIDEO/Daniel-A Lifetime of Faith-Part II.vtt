Over here!

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail Nebo, Ishtar,

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Marduk—greatest god of all!

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yah!

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call the wise men!

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what that is.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t appear to be an omen.

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:34.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing in the books, is there?

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:36.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are these all the wise men?

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:38.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best in the kingdom.

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, I need to speak to the king!

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The queen mother, my lord.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:52.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a man in your kingdom

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has the spirit of the holy gods.

00:02:57.948 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will tell you the interpretation.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:02.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is this man?

00:03:02.953 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel?

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s Daniel?

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you Daniel?

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am, my lord.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve heard concerning you

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re able to provide interpretations.

00:04:05.057 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you are able to read the writing

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make its interpretation known to me,

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be clothed with purple,

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a gold necklace will be placed around your neck,

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:22.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may keep your gifts.

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give your presents to others.

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, I will read the writing to the king.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:33.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Most High God granted to Nebuchadnezzar

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:35.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the kingdom and greatness

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and honor and majesty.

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when his heart became haughty,

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:48.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his dignity was taken away.

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you, Belshazzar—

00:04:57.818 --> 00:04:59.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have not humbled your heart,

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although you knew all of this.

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead,

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:07.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens.

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:10.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had them bring you the vessels of His house.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:15.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you and your nobles,

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your concubines and secondary wives

00:05:17.504 --> 00:05:19.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drank wine from them

00:05:19.506 --> 00:05:23.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praised the gods of silver and gold

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—gods who see nothing

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hear nothing

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:33.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know nothing.

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:37.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’ve not glorified the God

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whose hand is your breath

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all your ways.

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the hand was sent from Him.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interpretation of the words:

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
MENE:

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has numbered the days of your kingdom

00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:04.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought it to an end.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:16.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
TEKEL:

00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:21.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been weighed in the balances

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found lacking.

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
PERES:

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:34.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your kingdom has been divided

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:38.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given to the Medes

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Persians.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Darius, this is Daniel

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:26.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a Jew taken captive by the Babylonians.

00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you interpret the handwriting from the gods?

00:07:33.682 --> 00:07:35.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not me, O king

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my God—

00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:43.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the God of Israel.

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:46.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could use a satrap

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who understands the captives.

00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:50.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I confess, a satrap

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not as prominent a position

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Belshazzar granted you.

00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:57.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, Daniel refused

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:00.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every gift and honor Belshazzar offered him.

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man without a price.

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t need you as a satrap

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:11.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we need you over them.

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tura,

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pronounce Daniel’s appointment

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:21.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the kingdom.

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want those stealing from the treasury to know

00:08:24.107 --> 00:08:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will now be held accountable.

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:54.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:56.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll make a fine high official.

00:08:58.225 --> 00:09:00.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only with Jehovah’s help.

00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:29.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is the land tax so high?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another revolt?

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:40.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is far more troubling.

00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just collected the land tax from an administrator.

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he pay?

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:47.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, but he refuses to give us “our fees.”

00:09:47.983 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the same problem.

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re calling anything more than the tax extortion.

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s changed?

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:09:57.367 --> 00:09:59.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you offered him anything

00:09:59.202 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make him more reasonable?

00:10:00.912 --> 00:10:02.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He won’t take a shekel of silver.

00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:04.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel claims that what he receives

00:10:04.374 --> 00:10:05.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more than enough.

00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:08.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be so naive!

00:10:08.587 --> 00:10:11.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s putting on a show of integrity for the king.

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t last.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius will tire of him soon enough.

00:10:25.562 --> 00:10:27.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There seems to be a discrepancy in the taxes

00:10:27.564 --> 00:10:30.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
due the treasury, my lord.

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:32.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re brave to say that here.

00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:35.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s hard to hear.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will review the evidence.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:41.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, your time here has given you much wisdom.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been here?

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 70 years.

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:48.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share more with me.

00:10:49.127 --> 00:10:50.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me about the dreams

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:52.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar.

00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:55.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah.

00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He revealed the dreams to me.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have I really been in Babylon over 70 years?

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“I will call to account the king of Babylon

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:48.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that nation for their error.”

—it’s been fulfilled!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this mean for God’s people?

by bringing you back to this place.”

Judah!

00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I must approach Jehovah

00:13:05.347 --> 00:13:09.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to confess the sin of my people.

00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:15.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah,

00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:19.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do hear,

00:13:19.694 --> 00:13:21.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do forgive.

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:25.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

O Daniel,

and understanding.

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:49.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you began your entreaty,

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word went out,

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:52.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to finish off sin.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, Azarel and Hannah are here.

00:14:13.415 --> 00:14:15.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Daniel.

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so good to see you!

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:19.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Epher, come sit with me.

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:22.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have good news!

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the good news?

00:14:29.097 --> 00:14:31.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has long told us

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:35.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will return to Judah.

00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked again at Jeremiah’s prophecy:

00:14:41.443 --> 00:14:43.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:47.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, . . .

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will make good my promise

00:14:50.827 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing you back to this place.’”

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:57.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seventy years.”

00:14:57.417 --> 00:15:00.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means God’s people will return soon.

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:01.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you be sure?

00:15:05.884 --> 00:15:08.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent an angel to tell me.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:09.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An angel?

00:15:10.764 --> 00:15:13.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the city

00:15:13.141 --> 00:15:15.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its temple will be rebuilt,

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:18.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Messiah will finally come!

00:15:19.856 --> 00:15:23.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will get to see the temple rebuilt.

00:15:23.401 --> 00:15:25.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But won’t it be dangerous?

00:15:27.322 --> 00:15:30.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is eager

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:32.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill the needs of his people.

00:15:34.287 --> 00:15:36.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Isaiah

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we ‘won’t bear children for distress,

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:43.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for they’re the offspring

00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:45.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made up of those blessed by Jehovah.’

00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:48.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Jehovah says it,

00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as good as done!

00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:52.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t the land desolate?

00:15:53.431 --> 00:15:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we’ll need skilled builders

00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the restoration work.

00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean you’ll return to Judah?

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:07.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sure hope so.

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:17.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a team of workers maintain the roads.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, conditions will only worsen

00:16:19.624 --> 00:16:21.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the rainy season.

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tura, see that it’s done.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is it that you know so much?

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t take credit, my lord.

00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just . . .

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many great men

00:16:33.012 --> 00:16:35.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who provide the information we need, O king.

00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:38.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:16:39.978 --> 00:16:43.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about that satrap in Susa.

00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:46.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should he be replaced?

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My men have thoroughly investigated,

00:16:48.945 --> 00:16:52.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the satrap has been diverting palace money

00:16:52.156 --> 00:16:53.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his own pocket.

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s—that’s impossible!

00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:57.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t he your nephew, Otanes?

00:16:57.161 --> 00:17:01.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, and I can vouch for his integrity!

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There must be some mistake.

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:07.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can Daniel know his character as I do?

00:17:08.798 --> 00:17:11.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will speak with him and resolve the matter.

00:17:12.844 --> 00:17:14.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We Medes and Persians

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:17.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not as intolerant as these Jews.

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:20.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure we can fix this.

00:17:20.894 --> 00:17:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very well. Settle it quickly.

00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:26.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That will be all.

00:18:03.227 --> 00:18:05.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord, I’m so sorry.

00:18:05.146 --> 00:18:07.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have guests.

00:18:19.452 --> 00:18:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All you Jews do is pray.

00:18:24.624 --> 00:18:26.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not serve the king

00:18:26.626 --> 00:18:28.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way I do without God’s help.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serve the king

00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by intimidating satraps?

00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:35.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve only done what I should.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An outsider has no place telling us

00:18:37.971 --> 00:18:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to conduct business.

00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:43.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I act in the king’s interests.

00:18:44.018 --> 00:18:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve heard how you acted

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Nebuchadnezzar’s interests.

00:18:48.147 --> 00:18:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You made him go insane.

00:18:51.943 --> 00:18:53.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a message from Jehovah.

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Call it what you will,

00:18:56.072 --> 00:18:58.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do not interfere with us.

00:19:00.618 --> 00:19:02.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If it seemed easy

00:19:02.495 --> 00:19:04.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remove a satrap,

00:19:05.248 --> 00:19:07.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of how much easier it will be

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get rid of an old Jew.

00:19:36.237 --> 00:19:37.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an honor to be with you.

00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:39.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why I summoned you?

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, my lord.

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:45.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That satrap whose dismissal Daniel recommended

00:19:45.705 --> 00:19:47.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what’s become of him?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we thoroughly investigated the matter.

00:19:50.626 --> 00:19:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there negligence?

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None.

00:19:53.087 --> 00:19:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any omission of duty?

00:19:54.464 --> 00:19:55.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:19:56.799 --> 00:20:00.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All taxes due the treasury have come to the treasury?

00:20:00.094 --> 00:20:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every shekel of gold and quart (1.08 L) of beer

00:20:02.972 --> 00:20:04.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are accounted for.

00:20:05.683 --> 00:20:09.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel reached a different conclusion.

00:20:09.437 --> 00:20:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, Daniel—

00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:13.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He served the Babylonian kings well, but . . .

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:14.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s so old!

00:20:15.526 --> 00:20:17.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Otanes means is,

00:20:17.028 --> 00:20:19.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Daniel’s age, how reliable is his judgment?

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:22.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His ideas are outdated.

00:20:22.575 --> 00:20:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, he is a Jew.

00:20:25.369 --> 00:20:27.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Katu, we are tolerant of all peoples.

00:20:28.372 --> 00:20:29.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, of course. That’s my point.

00:20:29.707 --> 00:20:31.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, we were just talking about you.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were right.

00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:38.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been a revolt in Susa.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:41.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They demand a new satrap

00:20:41.094 --> 00:20:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one who doesn’t steal from them.

00:20:44.013 --> 00:20:45.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my lord, surely . . .

00:20:45.598 --> 00:20:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough!

00:20:47.016 --> 00:20:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sent my own inspectors—men I trust!

00:20:53.272 --> 00:20:57.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, you’ve distinguished yourself over these men.

00:20:59.904 --> 00:21:04.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine what I could do if you were my prime minister.

00:21:09.747 --> 00:21:11.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we could approach the king.

00:21:11.082 --> 00:21:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s no use.

00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:14.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel’s manipulating him.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need an accusation against Daniel

00:21:16.754 --> 00:21:18.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that Darius can’t ignore.

00:21:18.756 --> 00:21:20.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no one has accused him of anything.

00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:22.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not yet.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assemble a team to comb through our laws.

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:27.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely he’s violated something.

00:21:27.098 --> 00:21:27.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You!

00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:30.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interview merchants, inspectors, officials

00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:33.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whoever will make an accusation against him.

00:21:33.104 --> 00:21:34.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assure the accuser

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:37.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will be generously rewarded.

00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:39.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the Babylonian records.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Search for any scandal that might implicate him.

00:22:08.389 --> 00:22:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is nothing in the records.

00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anything?

00:22:14.353 --> 00:22:17.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a shekel of silver is missing.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when Daniel gets involved,

00:22:19.525 --> 00:22:21.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
corruption and loss go down.

00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep searching.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will speak against him.

00:22:35.208 --> 00:22:37.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They all love him,

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has the king’s trust.

00:22:46.385 --> 00:22:49.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually, the foreign merchants are ignored

00:22:49.055 --> 00:22:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they experience theft.

00:22:52.308 --> 00:22:54.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Daniel stands up for them

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:56.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and investigates.

00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:01.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has thieves return whatever was stolen.

00:23:02.818 --> 00:23:05.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even his friends are spotless.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nebuchadnezzar once forbade anyone

00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:10.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak against their God.

00:23:10.034 --> 00:23:12.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supposedly,

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:14.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this “Jehovah” saved them from the furnace

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:17.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they refused to worship a Babylonian god.

00:23:18.459 --> 00:23:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jews won’t worship other gods?

00:23:22.296 --> 00:23:24.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would seem.

00:23:25.424 --> 00:23:27.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’ve solved our problem.

00:23:29.553 --> 00:23:33.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Katu, Otanes, what favor do you seek?

00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:36.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O King Darius, may you live on forever.

00:23:36.477 --> 00:23:38.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This Babylon of which you are king

00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:40.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is mighty but diverse.

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:45.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and others.

00:23:45.236 --> 00:23:47.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Otanes, I know these things.

00:23:48.197 --> 00:23:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are the rightful king

00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also a foreigner and a newcomer.

00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:54.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people must adapt,

00:23:54.495 --> 00:23:57.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the kingdom could become unstable.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you suggest?

00:24:00.293 --> 00:24:02.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All royal officials,

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prefects, satraps,

00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:06.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
high royal officers, and governors

00:24:06.507 --> 00:24:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have consulted together to establish a royal decree

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to enforce a ban

00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:16.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that for 30 days, whoever makes a petition

00:24:16.058 --> 00:24:17.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to any god or man

00:24:17.935 --> 00:24:20.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except to you, O king,

00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:23.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:24:23.983 --> 00:24:26.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people are not above rebellion.

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:28.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look what happened in Susa.

00:24:32.992 --> 00:24:35.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, O king,

00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:38.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may you establish the decree and sign it

00:24:38.706 --> 00:24:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it cannot be changed,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the law of the Medes and the Persians,

00:24:45.379 --> 00:24:48.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which cannot be annulled.

00:24:58.309 --> 00:24:59.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this time,

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our empire experiences peace and prosperity

00:25:02.521 --> 00:25:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike ever seen before.

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:08.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The recent acts of defiance in Susa,

00:25:08.694 --> 00:25:12.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with similar acts by small groups of radicals,

00:25:12.031 --> 00:25:13.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seek to undermine

00:25:13.324 --> 00:25:15.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our way of life

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a way of life we will sacrifice for nothing.

00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:23.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In honor of the glorious freedom

00:25:23.376 --> 00:25:26.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so kindly granted by the empire

00:25:26.087 --> 00:25:29.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a reminder of its sovereignty,

00:25:29.256 --> 00:25:31.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, Darius the Mede,

00:25:31.384 --> 00:25:33.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make this decree:

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:36.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 30 days, anyone

00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:40.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who makes a petition to any god or man,

00:25:40.726 --> 00:25:42.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except to the king,

00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:44.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not going home to pray, are you?

00:26:12.216 --> 00:26:14.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Azarel,

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know me,

00:26:20.975 --> 00:26:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do my enemies.

00:26:23.602 --> 00:26:27.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray at my window three times a day,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day.

00:26:30.234 --> 00:26:33.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I even appear to compromise,

00:26:35.698 --> 00:26:37.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they think?

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That you stopped praying altogether.

00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:44.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or even worse,

00:26:44.498 --> 00:26:49.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’d trade my worship for my life.

00:26:50.045 --> 00:26:52.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

00:26:52.173 --> 00:26:54.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

00:26:55.134 --> 00:26:57.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:26:57.344 --> 00:26:59.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:04.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

00:27:05.436 --> 00:27:10.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that I keep my faith

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:13.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we all keep our faith—

00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:16.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how this ends.

00:27:36.842 --> 00:27:42.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have something for you.

00:27:46.894 --> 00:27:48.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dinner’s ready.

00:28:02.201 --> 00:28:05.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is my light

“and my salvation.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whom should I fear?”

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hear me, O Jehovah,

“when I cry out.

00:28:31.063 --> 00:28:34.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Show me favor

00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and answer me.

my God of salvation.”

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:14.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:30:16.585 --> 00:30:19.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not sign a ban

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:23.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating that for 30 days any man

00:30:23.592 --> 00:30:26.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who makes a petition to any god or man

00:30:26.178 --> 00:30:27.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except to you, O king—

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:30.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be thrown into the lions’ pit?

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:32.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the matter is well-established

00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:34.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the law of the Medes and the Persians.

00:30:34.436 --> 00:30:37.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s your business?

00:30:38.482 --> 00:30:41.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, who is of the exiles of Judah,

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:43.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has paid no regard to you, O king,

00:30:43.821 --> 00:30:46.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor to the ban that you signed.

00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:50.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But three times a day,

00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:53.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is praying.

00:30:59.378 --> 00:31:00.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel?

00:31:08.887 --> 00:31:11.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t be true.

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:13.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sure?

00:31:14.017 --> 00:31:16.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t even try to deny it.

00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:20.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were there witnesses?

00:31:20.941 --> 00:31:22.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All five of us, my lord.

00:31:22.526 --> 00:31:24.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can attest to it.

00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:26.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he is old.

00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:28.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does he know what he’s doing?

00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:30.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a high official,

00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:33.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely he understands what it means

00:31:33.537 --> 00:31:35.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the king.

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:40.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me be.

00:31:40.377 --> 00:31:41.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we arrest Daniel?

00:31:41.962 --> 00:31:44.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave the matter to me!

00:32:39.311 --> 00:32:42.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel should indeed be made an example of.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll remove him from his post

00:32:44.983 --> 00:32:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expel him from the city tomorrow morning.

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:47.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord . . . 

00:32:48.362 --> 00:32:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All will learn that our laws must be obeyed.

00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:54.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the law actually states that the accused

00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:56.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “thrown into the lions’ pit,” my lord.

00:32:57.579 --> 00:32:59.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see what you’re doing!

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you no shame?

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:04.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The law of the Medes and the Persians

00:33:04.545 --> 00:33:07.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that any ban or decree that the king establishes

00:33:08.382 --> 00:33:10.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot be changed.

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:13.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We only wish the king to receive the honor

00:33:13.804 --> 00:33:16.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he deserves.

00:33:31.363 --> 00:33:33.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take him to the pit.

00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:05.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your God, whom you are continually serving,

00:36:05.142 --> 00:36:07.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will rescue you.

00:36:22.617 --> 00:36:24.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remove the stone!

00:36:32.961 --> 00:36:34.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:36:38.592 --> 00:36:40.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel.

00:36:42.012 --> 00:36:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O king, may you live on forever.

00:36:47.559 --> 00:36:49.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lives!

00:36:49.644 --> 00:36:51.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring him up!

00:36:51.438 --> 00:36:53.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My God sent his angel

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shut the mouths of the lions,

00:36:57.486 --> 00:37:00.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they have not harmed me,

00:37:01.948 --> 00:37:05.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I was found innocent before him;

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.

00:37:19.341 --> 00:37:21.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Armenia is mine.

00:37:21.426 --> 00:37:24.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel let them off too easily.

00:37:24.054 --> 00:37:27.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need their exceptional horses for our cavalry

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few for myself.

00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:35.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine, you take Armenia.

00:37:36.024 --> 00:37:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have my eye on Bactria and its precious stones.

00:37:41.613 --> 00:37:43.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Must you divide up Daniel’s kingdom now?

00:37:44.866 --> 00:37:47.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 Check the back room!

00:37:51.248 --> 00:37:54.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the meaning of this?

00:37:54.167 --> 00:37:55.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are being arrested

00:37:55.627 --> 00:37:57.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for crimes against Darius the king!

00:37:57.462 --> 00:38:00.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king ordered Daniel’s arrest, not ours.

00:38:00.298 --> 00:38:02.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel was arrested

00:38:04.761 --> 00:38:06.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lifted from the pit this morning

00:38:06.847 --> 00:38:08.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—unharmed.

00:38:08.974 --> 00:38:10.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can’t be!

The lions must have already been fed.

00:38:12.936 --> 00:38:14.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they were ill.

00:38:17.149 --> 00:38:19.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lions were ill?

00:38:20.652 --> 00:38:22.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not hungry?

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throw them and their families into the pit,

00:38:32.622 --> 00:38:34.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they can test their theories.

00:38:34.499 --> 00:38:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Darius!

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t do this! I served you!

00:38:38.628 --> 00:38:40.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Don’t do this!

00:38:40.088 --> 00:38:41.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I served you!

00:38:42.716 --> 00:38:43.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! Please!

00:38:46.178 --> 00:38:47.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:38:50.056 --> 00:38:51.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am issuing an order

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in every domain of my kingdom,

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people are to tremble in fear

00:38:57.189 --> 00:38:59.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the God of Daniel.

00:38:59.858 --> 00:39:02.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For he is the living God, and he endures forever.

00:39:02.777 --> 00:39:04.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His kingdom will never be destroyed.

00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:06.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He rescues,

00:39:06.031 --> 00:39:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saves, and performs signs and wonders

00:39:08.742 --> 00:39:11.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the heavens and on the earth,

00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:15.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.”

00:39:15.081 --> 00:39:16.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Darius wrote that?

00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:18.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s sending it to all of his subjects.

00:39:18.877 --> 00:39:20.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were so worried.

00:39:21.171 --> 00:39:22.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you scared?

00:39:23.298 --> 00:39:25.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very scared,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah helps us when we’re scared.

00:39:30.096 --> 00:39:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re scared of going to Jerusalem.

00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:33.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Epher!

00:39:36.186 --> 00:39:38.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re still thinking about it.

00:39:38.897 --> 00:39:41.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about you? Are you going back?

00:39:41.316 --> 00:39:43.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king says we’re all allowed to go.

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:53.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d love to go home,

00:40:05.632 --> 00:40:06.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but

00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:13.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s too late for me.

00:40:23.566 --> 00:40:25.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I don’t want to go either.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh no, no, no, no.

00:40:27.654 --> 00:40:29.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t cry.

00:40:33.326 --> 00:40:35.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you go,

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see a better city than the one I left.

00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:43.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see prophecies fulfilled,

00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city full of people worshipping Jehovah,

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a new temple

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:58.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the most beautiful building on earth.

00:41:21.791 --> 00:41:24.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see our old neighbor at all?

00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:26.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I didn’t him at all today.

00:41:28.048 --> 00:41:31.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw our neighbor Eli the other day.

00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:13.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be blessed.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“One thing

00:42:26.523 --> 00:42:30.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:44:16.925 --> 00:44:19.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel, you need to rest.

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:21.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel, you very precious man.

00:45:21.864 --> 00:45:24.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been sent to you.

00:45:24.993 --> 00:45:28.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:29.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words have been heard from the first day

00:45:29.956 --> 00:45:32.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you gave your heart to understanding

00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:34.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbling yourself before your God.

00:45:34.586 --> 00:45:36.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have come to make you understand

00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:38.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will befall your people

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the final part of the days.

00:45:40.592 --> 00:45:43.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no strength.

00:45:43.303 --> 00:45:45.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no breath left in me.

00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:48.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

Be strong.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong!

Let my lord speak,

for you have strengthened me.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:12.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will tell you the things recorded

in the writings of truth:

00:46:14.792 --> 00:46:16.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

what will be the outcome of these things?

Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

Go on to the end.

00:46:53.122 --> 00:46:54.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will rest,

00:46:54.832 --> 00:46:57.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

at the end of the days.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:22.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we eat those foods, we’ll disobey our God.

You fear your God?

I do.

00:47:29.492 --> 00:47:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

Jehovah

00:47:39.001 --> 00:47:43.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

I know Jehovah.

And if I trust him,

00:48:01.274 --> 00:48:03.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:48:16.122 --> 00:48:20.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:48:21.335 --> 00:48:24.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

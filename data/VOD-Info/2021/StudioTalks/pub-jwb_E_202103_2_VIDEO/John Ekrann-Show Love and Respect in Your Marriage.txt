00:00:01 Jehovah designed marriage
00:00:02 as a beautiful and rewarding relationship
00:00:05 between a husband and a wife.
00:00:07 When a husband and wife
00:00:08 fulfill their God-given roles
00:00:10 and they treat each other
00:00:12 with love and respect,
00:00:13 their marriage is a wonderful and intimate friendship.
00:00:17 A marriage that has good patterns
00:00:20 shaped by Jehovah’s principles
00:00:22 looks like this well-balanced family circle.
00:00:26 But if a married couple over time
00:00:28 has set bad patterns in how they deal with each other,
00:00:32 this is often the result.
00:00:34 Life is going to be a bit rough for them.
00:00:37 Let’s consider what Jehovah says
00:00:39 about the roles of husband and wife
00:00:41 and then discuss how love and respect
00:00:44 are real keys to a happy marriage.
00:00:47 So, what roles did Jehovah give
00:00:50 to the man and woman in marriage?
00:00:52 Well, Jehovah places the husband as head of the family.
00:00:56 Ephesians 5:23 says:
00:00:59 “A husband is head of his wife.”
00:01:02 So that means that the husband makes final decisions for the family.
00:01:06 And his decisions will reflect his love for his wife,
00:01:09 his children, and his understanding of their spiritual,
00:01:13 physical, and emotional needs.
00:01:15 At 1 Corinthians 11:3,
00:01:19 we get a sense, though, of how Jehovah feels about the husband’s role.
00:01:23 And as we read this together, I want you to imagine
00:01:26 Jehovah saying to husbands: ‘Yes, you’re head of the family.’
00:01:30 “But I want you to know that the head
00:01:33 “of every man is the Christ;
00:01:35 in turn, the head of a woman is the man.”
00:01:39 Sounds a lot like a father-in-law speaking to the groom:
00:01:42 “You can marry my daughter,
00:01:44 but you’d better treat her good because you’re responsible to me.”
00:01:49 Well, Jehovah is giving a very clear message for husbands.
00:01:53 Jehovah will hold you accountable to him
00:01:57 for how you treat your wife.
00:01:59 It’s something for us husbands to think about, isn’t it?
00:02:02 Well, what about the role of a wife?
00:02:05 Jehovah assigned wives as a beloved partner to her husband.
00:02:09 And as partners, they can discuss important family matters
00:02:12 and work together to make their marriage a success.
00:02:16 Jehovah placed the woman under the headship of the man,
00:02:20 and as such, her role is to be in subjection to him.
00:02:24 At Ephesians 5:22,
00:02:28 it says: “Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord.”
00:02:33 Subjection —said a certain way, it almost sounds bad:
00:02:37 “You have to be in subjection!”
00:02:40 But is the subjection of a Christian wife to a Christian husband a bad thing?
00:02:44 No.
00:02:46 See, subjection as described in the Bible
00:02:49 is not about being subservient;
00:02:51 it’s about her role in the marriage.
00:02:54 You’re partners, each with a beautiful role to fulfill.
00:02:58 We could illustrate it with watching a couple ice skating.
00:03:02 As they move gracefully across the ice, do you think to yourself,
00:03:07 ‘How come they never let her hold him over her head?’
00:03:10 Well, no.
00:03:12 You look at him; you look at her.
00:03:14 It’s obvious who should hold who over their head.
00:03:18 Well, just as we admire and respect a woman’s role as an ice skating partner,
00:03:23 a husband deeply loves and appreciates
00:03:25 his wife’s role as his partner
00:03:28 as they work gracefully together to make their marriage a success.
00:03:32 Well, now that we’ve briefly reviewed the roles for husbands and wives,
00:03:37 let’s read together a key Scriptural principle
00:03:40 at Ephesians 5:33
00:03:43 that shows how Jehovah wants husbands and wives
00:03:48 to fulfill their roles in marriage.
00:03:50 Ephesians 5:33:
00:03:55 “Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself;
00:03:59 on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.”
00:04:05 Well, the obvious message in this scripture
00:04:07 is that husbands should love their wives
00:04:10 and wives should respect their husbands.
00:04:13 However, there’s another way to look at this scripture
00:04:16 and learn something about husbands and wives.
00:04:19 Jehovah God is telling us what each mate needs.
00:04:23 Men need respect, and women need love.
00:04:28 Now, this is not to say that men don’t need love
00:04:31 and women don’t need to be respected.
00:04:34 However, it does mean that men
00:04:36 tend to emphasize respect and status
00:04:39 and women often emphasize
00:04:42 intimacy, connection, and love.
00:04:45 This perfect principle can help us to understand
00:04:49 why our husband or wife may act or feel a certain way.
00:04:54 Now, this difference in emphasis affects many areas of married life.
00:04:59 Let’s consider three examples
00:05:01 of how this powerful Scriptural principle of love and respect
00:05:06 can give us insight into how a husband and wife
00:05:09 talk to each other,
00:05:12 how they solve problems,
00:05:14 and how they act in the company of others.
00:05:17 Let’s consider our first example:
00:05:18 how they talk to each other.
00:05:20 Now, since a wife’s emphasis
00:05:23 is on being loved,
00:05:25 her conversations often stress friendship
00:05:28 and connection when she talks to her husband.
00:05:31 She’s eager to share the details of her life with him
00:05:34 and in this way become closer to him.
00:05:36 She wants him, in turn, to share with her the details of his day and life.
00:05:41 Husbands, your wife
00:05:44 feels loved when you learn to communicate with her
00:05:47 in a way that tells her you truly care about her.
00:05:52 She places great emphasis on conversation and sharing her life with you
00:05:56 and likewise you sharing your life with her.
00:06:00 For example, a wife
00:06:03 tells her husband about something
00:06:05 that happened to her that day.
00:06:07 He grows impatient with the story and interrupts
00:06:10 or changes the subject or offers a quick solution.
00:06:14 How does she feel?
00:06:16 ‘Why can’t he listen to the whole story?
00:06:19 Has he lost interest in me?’
00:06:22 It’s important that husbands give their wives
00:06:25 their full attention as they speak.
00:06:28 After a long day at work,
00:06:30 his mind may be focused on events that happened to him that day.
00:06:33 And he may without realizing it
00:06:36 feel that the events or conversation of his wife
00:06:39 aren’t on important subjects.
00:06:42 So he may be inclined to play down the events in her life
00:06:45 as unimportant, or trivial,
00:06:47 while events he talks about are substantial and important
00:06:51 because they happened to him.
00:06:53 Well, such a feeling over time can truly discourage a wife.
00:06:57 A husband’s disinterest in her stories
00:07:01 and events of her life feels a lot like disinterest in her.
00:07:07 The advice of Proverbs 20:5 is good for husbands.
00:07:12 It says: “The thoughts of a man’s [or we could say in this case, woman’s] heart
00:07:16 “are like deep waters,
00:07:19 but the discerning man draws them out.”
00:07:23 That’s great advice for husbands.
00:07:26 Husbands, when you draw
00:07:27 your wife out, let her speak from her heart.
00:07:31 That’s an indication of great love
00:07:33 and affection for your dear wife.
00:07:36 Men, on the other hand, often view conversation differently.
00:07:40 A husband comes home, and his wife asks, “How was your day?”
00:07:43 He says: “It was OK. Nothing special.”
00:07:46 But later that night when they’re with a group of friends,
00:07:50 he tells a story about what happened at work.
00:07:52 And she wonders,
00:07:54 ‘Well, why didn’t he tell me that when I asked about his day?’
00:07:58 Well, since a man’s emphasis is on respect,
00:08:02 they often use conversation
00:08:05 to establish respect and status with others.
00:08:08 A husband may feel that his wife already respects him,
00:08:11 so there’s no need to tell her the story.
00:08:15 Wives, you can encourage your husband to share his life with you
00:08:18 by being interested in his work and activities.
00:08:21 If you tell him, “Don’t talk to me
00:08:23 about all that work stuff with me,” he won’t
00:08:26 and you’ll cut yourself off from a part of his life.
00:08:31 Show him that you’re proud of what he does to support the family.
00:08:34 Be interested in what happened to him,
00:08:36 how he feels about things, or challenges that he overcame.
00:08:40 While you may not find his work all that interesting,
00:08:43 remember, it is important to him.
00:08:47 Let’s consider our second example:
00:08:49 how they solve problems.
00:08:52 Now I want you to imagine a husband and wife.
00:08:54 They’re in a car, they’re looking for an address,
00:08:56 and they’re lost.
00:08:58 And the wife suggests that they ask someone for directions.
00:09:02 She’s thinking, ‘Why won’t he ask?’
00:09:06 He’s thinking, ‘Why can’t she just let me find it?’
00:09:10 You see, since the man’s emphasis is on respect,
00:09:14 he’s trying to avoid looking lost to a stranger.
00:09:17 The act of asking someone else for directions
00:09:21 may make him feel like he’s in a lower position.
00:09:25 Finding their way is a challenge to him,
00:09:28 and he wants to show his wife that he can find it on his own.
00:09:31 For the woman, such an idea may not come to mind.
00:09:35 She may view it as a simple interchange between them and a stranger.
00:09:38 They get help and directions, and they find out where they’re going.
00:09:42 At 1 Corinthians 7:33, Jehovah tells us:
00:09:47 “But the married man is anxious . . . ,
00:09:49 how he may gain the approval of his wife.”
00:09:53 Wives, your husband is anxious to have your approval and respect.
00:09:58 But on balance, husbands have to be careful
00:10:01 that an emphasis on respect doesn’t become unreasonable.
00:10:05 It won’t hurt us to ask for directions or help at times.
00:10:09 On the other hand, a wife needs to be careful
00:10:12 that she doesn’t show impatience by her words or tone
00:10:15 as her husband works his way through a problem.
00:10:19 A wife who clearly understands her husband’s desire
00:10:22 to solve problems for the family
00:10:25 will understand his actions and will do her part to support him,
00:10:28 even in the little things around the home.
00:10:31 Now, this support in the little areas of life
00:10:34 builds his confidence in her support
00:10:37 and can be a major factor
00:10:39 in whether a husband takes the lead in larger matters.
00:10:43 Our third and final example:
00:10:45 how they act in front of others.
00:10:49 Have you ever seen a couple where one of them is telling a story
00:10:53 and the other is constantly correcting the details?
00:10:57 or the husband is trying to give some direction
00:11:00 and the wife corrects or challenges the direction?
00:11:04 or the husband is telling others some unflattering story
00:11:07 that hurts his wife’s feelings?
00:11:10 How can Ephesians 5:33
00:11:13 help a wife in these situations?
00:11:16 Well, since a husband’s emphasis is on respect,
00:11:20 he’ll be much more sensitive
00:11:22 to comments his wife may make in front of others.
00:11:26 It can hurt a husband deeply
00:11:29 when his wife openly challenges him in front of others.
00:11:33 Proverbs 31:12
00:11:36 has this advice for wives:
00:11:39 “She rewards him with good, not bad,
00:11:42 all the days of her life.”
00:11:45 So when in public or when others are around
00:11:48 —even close family and children—
00:11:50 try not to openly disagree with him, correct him,
00:11:54 or attempt to take over what he’s doing.
00:11:56 How you speak to your husband in front of others
00:11:59 is a great way to show your deep respect for him.
00:12:03 It also builds respect for him in others, including any children in the family.
00:12:10 Well, how can Ephesians 5:33
00:12:12 help a husband act in front of others?
00:12:16 Well, when in public, husbands will want to act
00:12:19 like the husband at Proverbs 31:28.
00:12:24 It says: “Her husband rises up and praises her.”
00:12:29 It’s common today for husbands to make fun of
00:12:32 or even say demeaning things about their wives.
00:12:35 But since a wife places so much emphasis
00:12:38 on connection and friendship,
00:12:40 she can really be hurt when demeaning remarks are said
00:12:43 to get a laugh; it makes her feel awful.
00:12:47 Husbands, your wife considers you her best friend,
00:12:51 the one she shares everything with.
00:12:53 If you break that trust, she feels unloved and hurt.
00:12:59 Now, the best time to bring matters to each other’s attention
00:13:01 is when you’re in private or, if needed, when you can talk in such a way
00:13:05 that others cannot hear what’s being said.
00:13:09 In this way, a wife shows deep respect for her husband
00:13:14 and the husband shows his love for his wife.
00:13:18 So in review, we’ve considered just three situations
00:13:22 that the principle of love and respect
00:13:25 can help us to have a successful marriage:
00:13:29 how a husband and wife talk to each other,
00:13:31 how they solve problems,
00:13:33 and how they act in the company of others.
00:13:37 A good marriage is hard work.
00:13:39 How is your marriage?
00:13:42 Would you say that you’ve developed good patterns
00:13:45 or bad patterns in dealing with each other?
00:13:48 When was the last time you talked as a couple
00:13:51 about love and respect for each other?
00:13:55 Jehovah’s perfect advice at Ephesians 5:33
00:14:00 can help the marriage of two imperfect people.
00:14:04 In just a few words in this verse,
00:14:06 Jehovah is sharing with us a key principle
00:14:08 of how he designed marriage.
00:14:10 He’s telling us what each needs and places emphasis on.
00:14:15 Husbands put emphasis on being respected,
00:14:19 and wives put emphasis on being loved.
00:14:22 And this principle forms a key part
00:14:25 of the divine pattern for marriage.
00:14:28 If you want your marriage to operate as Jehovah designed,
00:14:33 then work hard to apply his perfect principle
00:14:38 of love and respect in your marriage.

00:00:01 No doubt every one of us at one time or another
00:00:05 has faced a discouraging situation.
00:00:09 Really, no one is immune
00:00:12 from discouragement.
00:00:14 This feeling may last
00:00:15 for a day or two and then subside,
00:00:19 or it might last longer.
00:00:22 What can cause us to be discouraged?
00:00:26 The Watch Tower Publications Index
00:00:29 lists over 20 factors
00:00:32 that can contribute to discouragement.
00:00:35 Some of them are these:
00:00:37 another’s conduct
00:00:39 —what someone did or didn’t do
00:00:40 that disappointed us;
00:00:42 problems in our congregation;
00:00:45 feeling inadequate;
00:00:47 our own personal failures
00:00:50 —what we’ve done or failed to do;
00:00:52 health problems; and loss of privileges.
00:00:56 There are ever so many things
00:00:59 that can cause us to be downhearted.
00:01:04 Even the fact that we are discouraged can be discouraging.
00:01:09 We feel guilty for being discouraged.
00:01:13 Here’s the good news.
00:01:15 We’re in good company.
00:01:17 Some very prominent and faithful servants of Jehovah
00:01:22 mentioned in the Bible have been discouraged.
00:01:26 Moses became so discouraged
00:01:29 over the complaints of the Israelites
00:01:31 that he said to God: “Please kill me right now.”
00:01:36 Rebekah was so distressed
00:01:39 because her son Esau married pagan women
00:01:42 that she told her husband, Isaac:
00:01:44 “I am disgusted with my life.”
00:01:48 Yes, family situations
00:01:51 can cause discouragement.
00:01:55 David was tormented by his sins.
00:01:59 At Psalm 51:3, he wrote:
00:02:02 “I am well-aware of my transgressions,
00:02:07 and my sin is always before me.”
00:02:12 Our mistakes can weigh us down.
00:02:16 Jeremiah felt so discouraged
00:02:19 by the opposition, ridicule, and apathy he met up with
00:02:23 that he told himself:
00:02:25 “I am not going to make mention of [Jehovah],
00:02:28 and I will speak no more in his name.”
00:02:32 Yes, poor results in the ministry can discourage us.
00:02:38 The apostle Paul frankly admitted
00:02:41 at Romans 7:24, 25
00:02:44 that he struggled against sinful tendencies.
00:02:48 At times, he felt miserable over this conflict.
00:02:53 He said: “Miserable man that I am!
00:02:57 Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death?”
00:03:03 Faithful men and women
00:03:05 faced discouraging circumstances in the past,
00:03:10 and so do we.
00:03:13 Discouragement is a part of life in this system.
00:03:17 We should expect it.
00:03:20 Yet, it’s important to consider
00:03:22 how we view discouragement.
00:03:26 Do we view ourselves as helpless victims of discouragement
00:03:31 and let ourselves sink into a quagmire
00:03:34 of despair and self-pity,
00:03:36 or do we view discouragement as an enemy
00:03:40 that we must fight against?
00:03:44 We easily recognize that feelings of pride,
00:03:48 selfishness, envy, and such things are enemies.
00:03:52 We battle against these bad feelings.
00:03:55 We don’t want them to erode our faith
00:03:57 or gain a foothold in our personality.
00:04:01 Yet, sometimes we may yield all too willingly
00:04:06 to discouragement.
00:04:08 Why is this dangerous?
00:04:11 Please read with me Proverbs 24:10:
00:04:16 “If you become discouraged
00:04:19 “in the day of distress,
00:04:21 your strength will be meager.”
00:04:25 Did you note the reason why we must fight discouragement?
00:04:29 What did Proverbs 24:10 tells us will happen
00:04:34 if we allow a “day of distress” to discourage us?
00:04:39 We’ll lose our strength.
00:04:41 Yes, discouragement can drain us
00:04:45 of our spiritual, mental, emotional, and even physical strength.
00:04:51 And what can happen if we lose our strength?
00:04:55 We can lose our enthusiasm for the truth.
00:04:58 We may lose interest in prayer or in personal study.
00:05:03 We could slack off in attending meetings.
00:05:07 We could develop coldness toward our brothers.
00:05:10 Our zeal for evangelizing can weaken.
00:05:15 We may even want to give up.
00:05:18 We don’t want any of those things to happen to us, do we, brothers?
00:05:24 How, then, do we fight and defeat discouragement?
00:05:31 Discouragement is a feeling, an emotion.
00:05:35 What causes feelings or emotions?
00:05:40 An article entitled “Negative Emotions —Can You Overcome Them?”
00:05:45 was published in the October 8, 1992, Awake!
00:05:52 This article didn’t discuss serious cases of depression
00:05:56 that may have a medical or physical cause,
00:05:59 such as a disease,
00:06:01 a reaction to toxins, medications,
00:06:05 nutritional deficiencies,
00:06:07 allergens, hormonal problems,
00:06:10 or bipolar disorder.
00:06:13 Rather, it discussed how to overcome
00:06:16 moments of discouragement
00:06:18 like the temporary “day of distress”
00:06:21 mentioned at Proverbs 24:10.
00:06:25 Under the subheading “We Can Control Our Thinking,”
00:06:30 it stated this:
00:06:32 “Many who work in the field of mental health
00:06:36 “maintain that our feelings
00:06:39 are caused by our thoughts.”
00:06:43 It’s been said that ‘you cannot experience a feeling
00:06:47 without first experiencing a thought.’
00:06:51 So then, feeling discouraged
00:06:55 isn’t always the situation that we face
00:06:58 but the negative thoughts that we have about the situation.
00:07:04 The first step, then, in fighting discouragement
00:07:07 is to identify the negative thoughts.
00:07:12 Sometimes we say that we have a “train of thought.”
00:07:17 It means we have a series of thoughts
00:07:20 that lead to a certain conclusion, or destination, if you will.
00:07:25 Now, imagine yourself
00:07:27 getting on a literal railroad or subway train.
00:07:32 Soon you realize that you’re on the wrong train.
00:07:35 It’s taking you to a place you do not want to go to.
00:07:39 What do you do?
00:07:41 Do you stay on the train all the way to the wrong destination?
00:07:45 Of course not.
00:07:47 No, you get off that train at the very next station.
00:07:52 But what do you do next?
00:07:55 You switch to the right train.
00:07:58 Now, figuratively speaking,
00:08:01 if you realize that your mind is getting on
00:08:05 a train of negative thoughts that are leading to discouragement,
00:08:08 can you get off that train?
00:08:10 Certainly.
00:08:12 But you need to switch to the right train of thought
00:08:16 that will lead you to a peaceful state of mind.
00:08:19 That’s the key.
00:08:22 We need to replace negative thoughts
00:08:25 with positive, upbuilding, spiritual thoughts.
00:08:31 Keeping our thinking on the right track
00:08:34 is an ongoing process.
00:08:36 Notice how the apostle Paul put it
00:08:39 in Ephesians 4:23:
00:08:43 “And you should continue to be made new
00:08:47 in your dominant mental attitude.”
00:08:52 Do you see how Paul confirms that we are in control?
00:08:57 We can change how we think.
00:09:00 And because we’re imperfect,
00:09:02 we have to make these changes continuously.
00:09:06 It’s not a losing battle.
00:09:08 Jehovah has given us powerful weapons
00:09:12 to help us make our minds move in the right direction
00:09:15 —his powerful Word,
00:09:17 his mighty holy spirit,
00:09:19 the power of prayer,
00:09:22 and healthful spiritual food from his organization.
00:09:27 Let’s consider some negative thoughts
00:09:30 that may lead to discouragement.
00:09:33 Then, we’ll consider upbuilding, positive thoughts
00:09:37 that help us fight discouragement.
00:09:41 You had a bad day.
00:09:43 You said or did the wrong thing, and you regret it.
00:09:48 It’s become a “day of distress.”
00:09:52 The thought enters your mind, ‘I’m worthless.’
00:09:56 That’s the “discouragement train.”
00:10:00 Will you continue to stay on this train of thought,
00:10:03 taking you to the state of discouragement?
00:10:07 Remember, you have a choice.
00:10:10 You can reject it.
00:10:12 Instead of giving in to that negative thought,
00:10:16 you could say to yourself:
00:10:18 ‘Wait a minute. Stop!
00:10:21 ‘That’s not right.
00:10:23 ‘Just because I made a mistake
00:10:25 ‘does not make me worthless in Jehovah’s eyes.
00:10:29 ‘He’s told us that he knows that “we are dust”
00:10:32 ‘and that he’s merciful.
00:10:35 ‘And Jesus said that “not one sparrow
00:10:38 ‘that has fallen to the ground is forgotten by God,”
00:10:43 ‘and that “[we] are worth more than many sparrows.”
00:10:48 ‘Yes, Jehovah views me as precious.
00:10:53 ‘I’ll pray about this,
00:10:55 ‘and I’m sure he’ll help me not to make that mistake again.
00:11:00 ‘Tomorrow will be a better day.
00:11:03 Thank you, Jehovah.’
00:11:07 Let’s take a second example.
00:11:10 A brother has said something quite unkind to you.
00:11:15 This has become a “day of distress.”
00:11:19 The thought comes to your mind:
00:11:22 ‘How can a brother behave like that
00:11:25 ‘and still be in good standing?
00:11:28 ‘He’s not a good example.
00:11:31 Why don’t the elders do something about it?’
00:11:34 Now, that’s discouragement speaking,
00:11:38 calling for us to “get on board.”
00:11:41 If we stay on that negative train of thought,
00:11:44 we could lose our spiritual strength.
00:11:48 But we still have a choice.
00:11:52 Will we replace those negative thoughts
00:11:55 with positive ones?
00:11:58 We could get our mind on a positive track
00:12:01 by saying to ourselves something like this:
00:12:06 ‘Well, that was an unkind thing for him to say.
00:12:11 ‘This is not like him.
00:12:13 ‘Maybe my brother just had a bad day.
00:12:17 ‘He’s as imperfect as I am.
00:12:20 ‘I’ve said unkind things too, at times,
00:12:24 ‘and have regretted it.
00:12:26 ‘He’s probably feeling the same way.
00:12:29 ‘I remember Colossians 3:13 says
00:12:33 ‘that we must “continue putting up with one another
00:12:37 ‘“and forgiving one another freely
00:12:41 ‘“even if anyone has a cause for complaint
00:12:45 ‘against another.”
00:12:47 ‘Well, he has given me a cause for complaint.
00:12:53 ‘But it says Jehovah has “freely [forgiven us].”
00:12:59 ‘He has certainly forgiven me countless times.
00:13:03 ‘No, I am not going to allow this
00:13:06 ‘to ruin our relationship.
00:13:09 ‘How can I help my brother?
00:13:12 ‘I’ll pray for him.
00:13:14 ‘And I’ll pray for myself
00:13:16 ‘that I don’t hold feelings of resentment
00:13:19 in my heart.’
00:13:22 Let’s consider a third example.
00:13:25 After years of hard work at your place of employment,
00:13:30 your position has been terminated.
00:13:32 You’ve lost your job.
00:13:34 It’s a “day of distress.”
00:13:36 You’re filled with anxious, negative thoughts:
00:13:40 ‘How will I care for my family?
00:13:43 ‘What will the future bring?
00:13:45 Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to me?’
00:13:51 Where will this train of dark, negative thoughts lead you?
00:13:56 Certainly, discouragement will set in,
00:14:00 and you will become spiritually weak and exhausted.
00:14:05 You still have a choice.
00:14:08 You can replace those negative thoughts
00:14:11 with thoughts such as these:
00:14:13 ‘OK, I’ve lost my job.
00:14:16 ‘What should I do?
00:14:18 ‘Stop serving Jehovah?
00:14:20 ‘No!
00:14:21 ‘Jesus said that we should not be anxious over material things
00:14:26 ‘because Jehovah will provide
00:14:29 ‘if we keep his Kingdom first in our lives.
00:14:33 ‘He also said to keep our lives simple.
00:14:37 ‘You know what?
00:14:39 ‘There are things that we don’t need.
00:14:42 ‘So that’s what we’ll do
00:14:44 ‘—simplify our life and do more in Jehovah’s service.
00:14:49 ‘Jehovah promises never to abandon us.
00:14:52 ‘I’ll throw my burden on him,
00:14:55 and I know he’ll help us make the right decisions.’
00:15:01 Brothers, we’re living
00:15:03 in the last days of this system of things.
00:15:06 We’ll have our days of distress.
00:15:10 Sometimes these come because of our own imperfection
00:15:14 or the imperfection of others.
00:15:17 But we also realize
00:15:19 that the Devil wants to discourage us.
00:15:24 Revelation 12:17 tells us
00:15:27 that Satan’s great anger is directed
00:15:30 toward those “who observe the commandments of God
00:15:34 and have the work of bearing witness concerning Jesus.”
00:15:39 The Devil will try to take advantage
00:15:42 of situations and problems that we face
00:15:45 to fill us with discouraging thoughts and drain us of our strength.
00:15:52 Now we stand at the very threshold of the new world.
00:15:57 Let’s fight discouragement
00:16:00 with all the weapons Jehovah gives us.
00:16:03 Continue to study God’s Word,
00:16:06 making it a part of your daily life.
00:16:09 Pray incessantly to Jehovah for his powerful spirit.
00:16:14 Keep close to his organization.
00:16:19 God has promised to give us the victory.
00:16:22 Fearlessly, we join in repeating Paul’s words
00:16:27 at Philippians 4:13:
00:16:31 “For all things I have the strength
00:16:35 through the one who gives me power.”

My daughter is going to preach,

More required overtime?

OK, that’s it.
That’s all I’ve got.

Let’s get back to work!

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s extra money.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can I do it <i>and</i>  take care of Regina?

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . to your local channel 17,
where news comes first.

Dad, isn’t it Family Worship night?

. . . to affect millions
as economies are . . .

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe a little later, Sweetie.

Violence and looting continue . . .

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to, but I was spent

—again.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Violence and looting continue
despite curfews . . .

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world is such a mess.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:22.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s everything Jesus said it would be.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so good

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spiritually-minded like her mother was.

00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:32.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I expect she’ll stay that way on her own?

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . rise in the wake
of a massive earthquake

with a magnitude of 8.1, which struck . . .

We have a unique opportunity

. . . unrest sweeping across the country.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, our community has been affected
by a soar in gun violence.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of right now, . . .

If it is just like Noah’s day,

I need to show faith like he did.

including a 17-year-old teenager.

Let’s do our family worship.

OK.

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:44.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to show faith in Jehovah

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work hard to save my family.

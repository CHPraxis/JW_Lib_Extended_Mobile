We met at a party when I was in the military.

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was on the dance floor, and I saw Frenchie.

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:11.448 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I was like, ‘Oh!

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to talk to this girl right here.’

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole time we were just smiling
at each other

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this instant attraction.

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was mutual.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, we were living together.

00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a few months go by,

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things are going well,

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I find out I’m pregnant.

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he left.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(though I shouldn’t have been),
but I was shocked.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And truthfully, I was scared,

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, ‘What am I going to do now?’

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like a failure,

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I kept asking myself,
‘How did I let this happen?’

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I had to be there,
and I wanted to be there.

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:06.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t know how.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prayed together
for the first time as a couple.

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a Friday night.

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to have a Bible study.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had us study the chapter

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:25.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on family life and marriage.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I wanted to have our relationship

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be honorable before Jehovah.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:36.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You learn that Jehovah

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The insecurities of every disagreement

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ending in a breakup or a divorce

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of that went away.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to see Jehovah’s training

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in practical ways,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just learning

00:01:58.263 --> 00:02:00.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be a husband

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who respected and cared for his wife.

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:09.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We became partners
—a team, a complement—

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:12.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was only because Jehovah

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:15.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us how to do it.

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though it was difficult at the outset,

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we made that decision
to dedicate our life to do Jehovah’s will,

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we got baptized together.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been married 25 years,

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the insecurities are gone.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on all the blessings that have come

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:41.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just from keeping Jehovah in our life,

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the best feeling in the world.

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:53.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You can go at it on your own,

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll never find the joy,

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll never find the peace,
you’ll never find the security

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from doing it Jehovah’s way.

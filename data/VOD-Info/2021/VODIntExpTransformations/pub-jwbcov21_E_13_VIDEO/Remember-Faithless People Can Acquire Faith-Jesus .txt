00:00:04 The truth came to our home through my mother.
00:00:06 I was never seriously interested in the truth.
00:00:11 Where we grew up, education was very important.
00:00:14 A person needed to make money and live a lavish life.
00:00:18 So that’s the life I chose
00:00:21 —to study, to get higher education—
00:00:23 so that I could have what others had.
00:00:26 Although they could see that I wasn’t interested in the truth,
00:00:29 my mother and brother did not give up on me.
00:00:33 When I came back from school in January,
00:00:36 my mother ordered the Examining the Scriptures Daily  booklet for me.
00:00:41 Year after year, I always had the Examining the Scriptures Daily  booklet
00:00:45 and a Bible.
00:00:47 She made sure that although I wasn’t attending meetings,
00:00:50 at least I had literature.
00:00:55 Besides that, my younger brother, the one I was close to,
00:00:59 decided to take the truth seriously.
00:01:03 When I came back from school,
00:01:05 I saw my brother getting a Bible study of his own,
00:01:08 and I was surprised to see him
00:01:10 studying the Bible and noticed that he had prepared.
00:01:14 He cared about and loved what he was learning.
00:01:18 That’s when I understood that the Bible changes lives.
00:01:22 A scripture that comes to mind
00:01:25 is Hosea 11:4.
00:01:29 There it shows that Jehovah
00:01:32 pulls us with “cords of love” and “kindness.”
00:01:36 In my situation, Jehovah did this.
00:01:40 So I made the decision to be regular at the congregation meetings,
00:01:45 and I finally started studying the Bible with someone in 2007
00:01:49 and got baptized in 2008.
00:01:51 My family really encouraged me;
00:01:55 they never gave up on me.
00:01:57 And I encourage parents
00:01:59 not to give up on their children.
00:02:03 They must continue encouraging them and have the hope
00:02:06 that Jehovah God will draw them to the organization
00:02:10 because they have good hearts.

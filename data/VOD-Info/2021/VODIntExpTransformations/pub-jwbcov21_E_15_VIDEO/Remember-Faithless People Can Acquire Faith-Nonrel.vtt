My family were nonpracticing Catholics,

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:08.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so I was never taught to believe in God.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I accepted
and loved the theory of evolution.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 19, a childhood friend

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had become one
of Jehovah’s Witnesses started to call on me.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked talking to him, but when
he spoke to me about God, I told him,

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, stop talking about God
because I don’t believe in him.”

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up on me.

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked, “Why won’t you,

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just for a moment,
entertain a conversation about God?”

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:50.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This question made me think.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had rejected his arguments
without even listening to them.

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to give the impression

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of being arrogant or stubborn.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Why not let him speak?’

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the book <i>Life</i>—<i>How Did It Get Here?</i>

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>By Evolution or by Creation?</i>

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if a veil
had been lifted from my eyes.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the moment Jehovah

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
introduced himself to me.

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, I understood
that my life has a purpose.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I regret that I didn’t know Jehovah

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the first 20 years of my life.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the most precious thing I have.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am determined to witness

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah to everyone I meet,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:50.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially to those without faith,

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they too can appreciate

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:55.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

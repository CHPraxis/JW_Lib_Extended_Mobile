00:00:01 My family were nonpracticing Catholics,
00:00:04 so I was never taught to believe in God.
00:00:08 I trusted my teachers more than anyone else,
00:00:14 so I accepted and loved the theory of evolution.
00:00:19 When I was 19, a childhood friend
00:00:22 who had become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses started to call on me.
00:00:27 I liked talking to him, but when he spoke to me about God, I told him,
00:00:32 “Please, stop talking about God because I don’t believe in him.”
00:00:37 He never gave up on me.
00:00:40 He asked, “Why won’t you,
00:00:42 just for a moment, entertain a conversation about God?”
00:00:48 This question made me think.
00:00:50 I had rejected his arguments without even listening to them.
00:00:55 I didn’t want to give the impression
00:00:57 of being arrogant or stubborn.
00:01:03 So I thought, ‘Why not let him speak?’
00:01:08 He used the book Life—How Did It Get Here?
00:01:11 By Evolution or by Creation?
00:01:14 It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes.
00:01:18 That was the moment Jehovah
00:01:21 introduced himself to me.
00:01:23 Finally, I understood that my life has a purpose.
00:01:28 I regret that I didn’t know Jehovah
00:01:31 for the first 20 years of my life.
00:01:35 My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt
00:01:38 the most precious thing I have.
00:01:41 I am determined to witness
00:01:43 about Jehovah to everyone I meet,
00:01:45 especially to those without faith,
00:01:50 so that they too can appreciate
00:01:52 the wonderful qualities of our Creator.

Fear and war were normal in my home country.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had many questions:

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do young people have to die?

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:20.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
God did not create us to make war.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The priests in my church always said,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is God’s will.”

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being on the run was dreadful.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than once,
I thought we were going to die.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, we arrived in Germany,

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was convinced that the priests there
could give me some answers.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to several different churches

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but no answers.

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept telling them:
“I’m looking for something.

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what it is,
but I didn’t find it here with you.”

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I thought
I was searching for something

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no one could give me.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, 

00:00:59.288 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a German woman approached me,
speaking in Arabic.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was amazing for me.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never had a good opinion
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think
I could learn anything from her,

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I gave her a chance.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave me logical answers
to all of my questions.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my home country, there are
multiple religious groups and nationalities

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who hate and fight each other.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen that all people
can live in peace with each other

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:38.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they get to know our Father in heaven.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives love and peace.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, I found what I had been looking for.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:55.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I lived a life without rules.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:57.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to get drunk,

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked a lot,
and I became a compulsive gambler.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My behavior was a complete disaster.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife wanted to separate from me.

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:13.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a horrible time.

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife started studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember being doubtful

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very doubtful.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was one thing
that started to make me think.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both my wife and my children
looked more peaceful,

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:34.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more joyful, happier.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why I even accepted a Bible study.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize that Jehovah
loves each one of us as an individual.

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:47.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That gave me real hope for the future.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I was studying in the Bible

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to understand

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that doing Jehovah’s will
is in our best interests.

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:01.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really helped me to quit my bad habits,

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treat my family better,

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show due respect to my wife.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah hadn’t searched for me,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I hadn’t come to know him,

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would no longer be a family.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today we are, indeed, a happy family,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a united family

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—united more than ever.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:32.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.

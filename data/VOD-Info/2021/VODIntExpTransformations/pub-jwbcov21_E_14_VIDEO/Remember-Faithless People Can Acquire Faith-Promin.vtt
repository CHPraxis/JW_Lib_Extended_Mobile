During my high-school years,

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:06.902 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would work at a shipyard

00:00:06.902 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a third-class welder.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:10.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was difficult.

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:14.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the summertime,
it was real hot on the water.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just said: “Wow!

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I’m going to have to do this
for 30 or 40 years,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got to find something better.”

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that period of time, “successful” meant

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a good job, a lot of money, comfort.”

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I went through college in four years

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:32.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got an accounting degree.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I would get a transfer,
I would get promoted.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went from Africa to Belgium,

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Belgium to Scotland,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Scotland back to the U.S.,

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then from the U.S. to Singapore.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was really a big jump

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nice cars, a driver,

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting a whole lot of money in the bank.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And every time
I would reach one of these goals,

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I would sit at the table and say:

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now—now we’re going to be happy.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to finally start
to be able to enjoy this.”

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it was like something fleeting.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just wasn’t there.

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The emptiness was growing bigger.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was getting— 
The hole was getting larger.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just perplexed.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t know where to go
to find any kind of joy or happiness.

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, my daughter,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had a baby shop.

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sold baby clothes
and small baby furniture.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and her husband ran the shop.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they hired this young girl

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with the store
and to help with their children.

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when she wasn’t busy
with the store and with the children,

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she’d pull open her Bible
and she would be reading her Bible.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they asked this young girl,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know anybody

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could study with the two kids?”

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said, “I have the perfect people,
the perfect couple.”

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:57.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they set up a study

00:01:57.638 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the following week
on one night during the week.

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my daughter called me and said:
“Dad, can you come to this Bible study?

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I don’t know these people.

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:10.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you just need to be there
to make sure it’s on the up-and-up.”

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I came to that first Bible study,
and I watched it.

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just sat there amazed!

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the study was over,
I asked them, I said,

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would y’all be interested
in studying with me?”

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, in the world,
you may hit these goals,

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then very quickly after that,

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:34.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you go way down
and then you stay way down.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth brings you constant joy.

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like it.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just complete satisfaction,

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just know now
you’re doing the right thing.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s just changed our whole life now
and our whole attitude.

00:02:48.313 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are just so very content and happy.

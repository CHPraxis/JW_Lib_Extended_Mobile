00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our parents loved us,

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did it in the wrong way.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would often turn violent,
so we learned that way of life.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that ever since I was young,

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid of coming home one day
and not finding my parents together.

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:25.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because as far back as I remember,
they have always argued with each other.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we grew up with those values
and those ways of thinking

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that led us to become
a group that was known and feared

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the area
because of our violent, immoral lifestyle

00:00:38.517 --> 00:00:40.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was devoted to drugs.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had no rules!

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were people
that you should stay away from.

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one of those regular mornings
when we were home alone.

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it became our hideout
—the place we would meet.

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had skipped school,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our parents didn’t know.

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:07.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was with Federico
and Raffaele when two sisters,

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
rang the doorbell.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had them come in,
so we could make fun of them.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:18.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a matter of fact, that’s what we did.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that Maria
and the sister that was with her

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were two very sincere and genuine people.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed courage
as they brought us the truth.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was surprised that they were so kind,
despite that my tone of voice was mocking.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really appreciated their kindness.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t let anything stop her,
not even the way we looked.

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really touched
by the conversation with Maria,

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:52.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I thought I would never see her again.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would ever come back to people like us?

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maria didn’t give up.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She came back with an older pioneer brother
who wasn’t scared of us

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with courage started to preach.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really started
to change my life and make progress.

00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, I started to speak

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:21.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what I
was learning with all my friends.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What surprised me was my mother’s reaction.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wasn’t happy at all.

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She reacted really violently.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They thought that I was going mad

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I was being brainwashed.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:44.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that they
would do everything to remind me

00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the strong friendship that was between us.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would put pressure on me emotionally.

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make a choice.

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I did love them
and was close to them,

00:02:57.614 --> 00:03:00.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made the drastic decision to tell them

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from then on I would no longer
be staying in their company.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:09.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This situation made me really intrigued.

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I ended up studying with Francesco.

00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His determination really made me think.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was obvious
that the things he was telling us

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually real—it was the truth.

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:26.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, the strength
it took to go forward with this

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his determination to leave his friends—
was surely what made

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us seriously interested
in the message he was preaching.

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:39.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would blame it on the truth
because it was taking my friend away from me

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a friend with whom
I used to do the things I liked.

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, inside I knew that even though
I told him he had gone mad,

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that inside
there must have been something powerful

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he was so convinced,

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we could all sense his conviction.

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I realized
that there was really something there.

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To my surprise, one after the other,

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of my friends started studying the Bible.

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I studied,
I realized that it was the truth.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:16.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It used to be hatred
that always motivated my choices.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I act according to love,
and this makes me feel good.

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:25.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can now say that thanks to Maria

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Francesco,
Jehovah tried to draw me to Him.

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe it’s been a miracle from Jehovah.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth helped me cultivate the qualities

00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:37.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of peace and joy

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the personality that has made it possible

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to have the family I never had.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest satisfaction I have in life
is to have a relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:50.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see someone

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:54.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like we used to be,
I feel motivated to speak to them.

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:57.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The patience that Maria showed
motivates me to be patient.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite our reputation,
Maria did not give up.

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed us

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:12.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in Jehovah’s eyes,
no one is beyond recovery

00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:14.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no one.

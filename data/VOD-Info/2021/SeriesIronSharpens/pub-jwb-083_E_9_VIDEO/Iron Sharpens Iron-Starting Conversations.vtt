Hi, I’m Taylor,
and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”

00:00:13.742 --> 00:00:14.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re going to practice

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.871 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how to start a conversation

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.914 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that could lead to a witness.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for many, this can be terrifying.

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:24.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as soon as we see someone
that we’d like to talk to,

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can start to think to ourselves:
‘What am I going to say?

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How am I going to give a witness?’

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, ‘How are they going to react?’

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can become
so overwhelmed with anxiety or nerves,

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:43.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking about how the conversation will end,
that we never even start.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s something
that we must keep in mind.

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal is simply

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:52.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to <i>start </i> a conversation.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’ve started a conversation,

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve succeeded—we’ve reached our goal!

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we can just relax
and see if it leads to a witness.

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The September 2018

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook</i>

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:11.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows us how we can start a conversation

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Jesus did with the Samaritan woman
in John chapter 4.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we see someone
that we would like to talk to,

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to keep these three steps in mind:

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 1: Be friendly.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.
Just be friendly.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we could be nervous.

00:01:32.446 --> 00:01:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can say a quick prayer
to Jehovah to give us courage,

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then we can give a friendly greeting.

00:01:38.202 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we can mention something
that’s happening right then and there:

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe the weather,
a long line at the grocery store,

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their nice car,
or another genuine compliment.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:52.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus started his conversation,
in verse 7,

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Samaritan woman, he simply said

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and no doubt in a friendly way):
“Give me a drink.”

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 2:

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:05.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the conversation progress naturally.

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:07.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t rush it.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the conversation ends before we are able
to give a witness, it’s OK.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We accomplished our goal.
We started a conversation.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re ready to try again.

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:20.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if the conversation continues on,

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can look for an opportunity
to take step 3:

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make a simple expression of our faith.

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven verses after Jesus
started the conversation

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Samaritan woman,
he then witnessed to her.

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said he had water
that imparts everlasting life.

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But between those two points,
he didn’t lecture her.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let her talk and express herself,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he listened to what she had to say.

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:52.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So with those three steps in mind,
now it’s our turn.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our turn to practice

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:58.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting a conversation
that could lead to a witness.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, tied in with us, we have

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Taís and Carolina
who have joined us for a demonstration.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So where are you going to try
to start your conversation today?

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are in a department store.

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are in a Portuguese congregation,

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s common to hear people speak
Portuguese when we are out shopping.

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve heard the three steps
that we want to try.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, let’s see what could happen
if we rush the conversation.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, tudo bem?</i>

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:28.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you speaking Portuguese.

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you from?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, </i>I’m from Rio de Janeiro.

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m from São Paulo.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been here?

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just three months.

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:38.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so hard to adjust, isn’t it?

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, the Bible helped me so much
when I moved here.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to keep you from your shopping,
but you can read

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible in Portuguese on our website,

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has articles
that I know you will find comforting.

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so time-out.

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Taís, we know
you rushed that on purpose,

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how did it make you feel when you did?

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it didn’t feel right
to start witnessing so quickly.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I saw that she wasn’t expecting it.

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:02.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Carolina, how about you?
How did it make you feel?

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:08.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It started OK,
but then it got awkward real fast.

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, maybe you can show us

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:15.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it’s like when the conversation
will progress more naturally.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:17.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi, tudo bem?</i>

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard you speaking Portuguese.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are you from?

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Oi,</i> I’m from Rio de Janeiro.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, nice.
I’m from São Paulo.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recognized your accent.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Taís.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:30.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m Carolina.
Nice to meet you.

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:32.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
How long have you been here?

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only three months.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for me it’s been three years,

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the first was the hardest.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we finally have work.

00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we are still looking for a place to live.

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And immigration has been harder
than we thought.

00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
I’m so sorry.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have family with you?

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to leave our son with my mother.

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:57.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss him so much.

00:04:57.901 --> 00:04:59.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow, that’s so hard.

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:02.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to keep trusting in God.

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:04.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my case, it’s what got me through.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know, but I still worry when I don’t know
what He will do for us.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so let’s stop there.

00:05:10.998 --> 00:05:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really nice, thank you.

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:16.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Taís, where do you feel
the conversation is at at this point?

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:20.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I felt like I found a good time
to say something about my faith.

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now she’s saying how she feels.

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice, excellent.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Carolina, how about you?

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:28.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a nice conversation.

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:31.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when she mentioned God,
it was not awkward.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:35.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, sisters, for letting us
learn from your conversation.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:39.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found that helpful, and I hope you did too.

00:05:39.818 --> 00:05:44.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make it your goal to start conversations
with those three steps:

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be friendly, converse naturally,

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:51.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and find the right time
to express your faith.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Practice at home or with a friend,

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see for yourself
how “iron sharpens iron.”

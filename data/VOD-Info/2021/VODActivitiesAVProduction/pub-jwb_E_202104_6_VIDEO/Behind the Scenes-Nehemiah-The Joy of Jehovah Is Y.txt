00:00:11 In Nehemiah’s day, the Jews joyfully embarked
00:00:14 on a massive building project.
00:00:16 With Jehovah’s direction and help,
00:00:18 they were able to finish the work
00:00:20 in just 52 days.
00:00:22 You look like you’ve been working.
00:00:25 During the production of the film
00:00:27 Nehemiah: “The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold,”
00:00:30 the walls of Jerusalem were built once again,
00:00:34 but this time at the Mount Ebo studios in Brewster, New York.
00:00:41 A variety of skills were needed to produce this drama
00:00:46 with many volunteers coming together,
00:00:49 using their time, energy, and abilities
00:00:52 to create an accurate teaching tool.
00:00:55 And they found great joy in their work.
00:01:15 Good planning was needed right at the start of production.
00:01:21 Every day began with a Scriptural discussion
00:01:24 and prayer.
00:01:29 The costume and makeup departments
00:01:31 prepared the actors to appear on set.
00:01:41 Assistance was provided to help actors
00:01:43 feel more comfortable in front of the cameras.
00:01:50 And action!
00:01:54 Brothers, please.
00:01:56 Have they attacked anyone yet?
00:01:58 They must have.
00:01:59 No! But they will.
00:02:01 While the production team was filming in one studio,
00:02:05 sets were being prepared in another.
00:02:11 To add to the realism, detailed props were made
00:02:14 —many using 3D printing.
00:02:21 With all of these researched and crafted costumes,
00:02:24 sets, and props combined,
00:02:27 environments were designed to accurately recreate the time period.
00:02:35 But even more was needed to convey what it was like
00:02:38 to live in Jerusalem during Nehemiah’s day.
00:02:41 For example, there were many animals on set.
00:03:11 Even after principal filming was completed,
00:03:15 sets built in the studio were extended
00:03:17 using advanced visual effects.
00:03:21 Digital construction work was done
00:03:24 by the visual effects team.
00:04:06 Yes, building is a legacy of God’s people.
00:04:13 Nehemiah was one of many who throughout history
00:04:16 devoted their energies to supporting the work of building.
00:04:22 In a similar way, the production team that made
00:04:25 Nehemiah: “The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold,”
00:04:29 joyfully worked hard to produce a film
00:04:32 that helps build love and appreciation
00:04:35 in the hearts of God’s people.

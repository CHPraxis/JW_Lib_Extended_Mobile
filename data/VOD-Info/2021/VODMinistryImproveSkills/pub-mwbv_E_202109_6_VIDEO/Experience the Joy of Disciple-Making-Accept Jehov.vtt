I’ve tried everything
to get Jade to a meeting . . .

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every Thursday and Sunday,
and I think

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I think you’d really enjoy it.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t promise anything.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be nice if you could come.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might just text her,
actually, just to remind her.

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, yeah, excellent.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried bringing
other people on the study?

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . well, maybe not everything.

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:12.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hi.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Abigay.

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.
Hi, Abigay.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, let me kill that.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a long time since I hear them!

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that band?

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know them?

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to see them all the time
before I became a Witness.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No way!
You like that kind of music?

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t believe me?

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, this bag, it’s so big!

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t find anything.

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:56.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abigay?

00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:03.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, when I was young . . .

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were in a band?

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:13.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The sun shines so sweet.”

00:02:13.112 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I love that song!

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually have that vinyl.

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll be gone next week.

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll have someone else
take care of the study, OK?

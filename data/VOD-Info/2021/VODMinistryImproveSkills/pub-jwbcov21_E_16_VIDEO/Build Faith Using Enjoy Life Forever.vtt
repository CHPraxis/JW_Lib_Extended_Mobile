00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:03.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, good.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Point 6,
“What Jehovah does for his friends.”

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, can you tap that link

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:11.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah Has Done So Much For Me”?

00:00:14.078 --> 00:00:16.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 14,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things that happened in the past

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:21.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like everything
that happened in my life

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my fault.

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:31.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from the Bible that God says

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will take my right hand,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will fortify me,
that he will really help me

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it blew me away!

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:50.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She mentioned a Bible passage

00:00:51.536 --> 00:00:54.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:00:55.373 --> 00:01:00.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read that at Isaiah 41:10, 13,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please?

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:11.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:19.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:22.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And 13: “For I, Jehovah your God,

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:26.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:27.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will help you.’”

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Cassie,

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:31.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to these verses,
what does Jehovah promise to do

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:33.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of his friends?

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help us when we’re down or scared.

00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:39.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look a little closer, though.

00:01:39.297 --> 00:01:41.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will fortify . . . ,

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:42.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will help . . . ,

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will really hold on . . .”

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—does that sound like a Friend who can help

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a Friend who wants to help?

00:01:52.937 --> 00:01:56.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought of God, Jehovah,

00:01:56.274 --> 00:01:58.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Jehovah
would make a good Friend?

00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:12.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10, Jehovah
stretches out his hand to you.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His right.

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 13,
he takes your hand.

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:21.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one?

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My right.

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:25.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, come here.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is Jehovah

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:33.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beside you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holding your hand?

00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:39.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is he—

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In front.

00:02:42.534 --> 00:02:44.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his right hand

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking your right hand.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s facing you

00:02:51.168 --> 00:02:53.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pull you up and out.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cassie, what has Jehovah
pulled you out of?

00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:03.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:05.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um,

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:12.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopelessness.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a direct result
of friendship with Jehovah.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:19.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It grows stronger

00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:21.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we talk to him.

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at that in the next section, OK?

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:35.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, Gene,

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:40.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last review question is,
How can Jesus’ death benefit you?

00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:46.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose I should say
that it means forgiveness from my sins,

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God is not going to forgive me.

00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you feel that way?

00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:52.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t feel; I know.

00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made better choices in my business
than I did at home.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:58.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gene,

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scroll down to where it says “Explore”

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:09.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and click under
“Can Jehovah forgive even serious sins?”

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:10.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, got it.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read the second paragraph, please?

00:04:12.717 --> 00:04:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:19.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Some people have committed gross sins
and wonder

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:21.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whether God can forgive them.

00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:23.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happily, the Word of God says:

00:04:23.938 --> 00:04:26.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:28.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from <i>all</i>  sin.’

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins

00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:35.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we have a proper, repentant attitude.”

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.

00:04:40.373 --> 00:04:43.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through the ransom, Jehovah forgives our sins

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:46.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even serious ones—
and he draws us to him.

00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:51.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ron, why should anyone get a free pass?

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:52.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s not free.

00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:56.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the scripture link to Isaiah 1:18?

00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:57.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see it.

00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:58.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it, please?

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, now, and let us set matters straight
between us,’ says Jehovah.

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Though your sins are like scarlet,
they will be made as white as snow;

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:09.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘though they are as red as crimson cloth,

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:12.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will become like wool.’”

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So forgiveness of our sins is possible

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we “set matters straight.”

00:05:20.084 --> 00:05:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you, Gene,

00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think that means?

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to do what’s right.

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m trying.

00:05:31.388 --> 00:05:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s good.

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also involves how we feel.

00:05:35.017 --> 00:05:37.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should feel sorry.
I am.

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:39.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s a good sign, Gene.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lastly, let Jehovah help you with the step
that’s the hardest for many of us.

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help you forgive yourself.

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for me.

00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:04.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ron, I think I’m going to need
a little more time to process this.

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:06.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all do.

00:06:07.887 --> 00:06:09.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go ahead and conclude with a prayer,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll specifically ask Jehovah
to strengthen your faith in the ransom

00:06:14.644 --> 00:06:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his forgiveness.

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:20.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, when you pray,
you can beg him for the same thing.

00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:23.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:06:23.737 --> 00:06:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say a prayer.

00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our heavenly Father . . .

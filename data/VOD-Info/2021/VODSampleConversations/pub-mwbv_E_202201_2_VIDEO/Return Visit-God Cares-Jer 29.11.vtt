Hey, Rob, it’s good to see you again.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I mentioned last week,
I’m Joel, and this is Tom.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been able to find work?

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, yeah.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part-time, but at least it’s a start.

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Great!
I’m glad to hear it.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last time we spoke,
I left you with the question,

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does God help us
to cope with present problems?

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have any ideas?

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:34.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, family helps.

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true.

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family members help
and support one another,

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God provides additional help.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note what the Bible says
at Jeremiah 29:11.

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you can identify another way

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God helps us to deal with problems.

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:50.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:52.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom, would you please read
that verse for us?

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“‘For I well know the thoughts

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I am thinking toward you,’
declares Jehovah,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you find anything in that verse

00:01:12.468 --> 00:01:14.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might help you
to cope with problems?

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thoughts of peace.”

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:19.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, exactly.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:22.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s also important
when we’re dealing with problems.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something else in the verse.

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever heard the expression,
“There’s light at the end of the tunnel”?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean?

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That things are going to get better.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:36.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So looking back at the verse,
what does God offer us?

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A future and a hope.”

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:41.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even when trials arise,
the Bible is a reliable guide.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson 1 of this brochure
entitled <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discusses the Bible’s practical value.

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:56.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of a free Bible study course.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ll read it,
I’d be happy to leave it with you.

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure!
It sounds interesting.

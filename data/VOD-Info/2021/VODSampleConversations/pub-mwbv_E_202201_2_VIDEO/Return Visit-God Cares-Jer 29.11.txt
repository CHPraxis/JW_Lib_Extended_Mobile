00:00:06 Hey, Rob, it’s good to see you again.
00:00:08 As I mentioned last week, I’m Joel, and this is Tom.
00:00:11 Have you been able to find work?
00:00:13 Actually, yeah.
00:00:14 It’s part-time, but at least it’s a start.
00:00:22 Great! I’m glad to hear it.
00:00:24 The last time we spoke, I left you with the question,
00:00:27 How does God help us to cope with present problems?
00:00:30 Do you have any ideas?
00:00:32 Well, family helps.
00:00:34 That’s true.
00:00:36 Family members help and support one another,
00:00:39 but God provides additional help.
00:00:41 Please note what the Bible says at Jeremiah 29:11.
00:00:45 See if you can identify another way
00:00:47 that God helps us to deal with problems.
00:00:49 OK.
00:00:50 Tom, would you please read that verse for us?
00:00:52 Yeah.
00:00:54 It says: “‘For I well know the thoughts
00:00:57 “that I am thinking toward you,’ declares Jehovah,
00:01:00 “‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,
00:01:04 to give you a future and a hope.’”
00:01:08 Thank you.
00:01:10 So did you find anything in that verse
00:01:12 that might help you to cope with problems?
00:01:15 “Thoughts of peace.”
00:01:17 Yes, exactly.
00:01:19 That’s also important when we’re dealing with problems.
00:01:22 There’s something else in the verse.
00:01:24 Have you ever heard the expression, “There’s light at the end of the tunnel”?
00:01:28 Yeah.
00:01:28 What does it mean?
00:01:30 That things are going to get better.
00:01:32 Right.
00:01:33 So looking back at the verse, what does God offer us?
00:01:37 “A future and a hope.”
00:01:39 Exactly.
00:01:41 But even when trials arise, the Bible is a reliable guide.
00:01:45 How so?
00:01:47 Lesson 1 of this brochure entitled Enjoy Life Forever!
00:01:51 discusses the Bible’s practical value.
00:01:54 It’s part of a free Bible study course.
00:01:56 If you’ll read it, I’d be happy to leave it with you.
00:01:59 Sure! It sounds interesting.

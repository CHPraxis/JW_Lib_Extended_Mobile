00:00:04 Hi, Mia. It’s nice to see you again.
00:00:07 As I mentioned last week, I’m Kiara, and this is Anna.
00:00:11 The last time we spoke, I left you with the question,
00:00:14 Why can we trust the Bible?
00:00:16 Right, I remember.
00:00:19 If the Bible is trustworthy,
00:00:21 then it should be in harmony with established scientific facts, right?
00:00:26 Yeah, I can agree with that.
00:00:28 If you have just a minute, I’d like to show you a brief video
00:00:31 that illustrates the Bible’s scientific accuracy.
00:00:34 It’s called The Earth Hangs Upon Nothing.
00:00:37 OK.
00:00:39 During the time when the Bible was written,
00:00:43 many people had mistaken ideas about the shape of the earth.
00:00:49 A theory written after the Bible was completed
00:00:52 was that the universe emerged from a cosmic egg
00:00:56 and that the earth was supported by various creatures.
00:01:01 In contrast, about the year 1473 B.C.E.,
00:01:05 Moses wrote that the earth is suspended “upon nothing.”
00:01:09 And around the year 732 B.C.E.,
00:01:12 the prophet Isaiah wrote that the earth is a circle, or sphere.
00:01:17 These Bible writers contradicted ideas that were popular at the time.
00:01:22 It was some 200 years after Isaiah’s day
00:01:26 that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras
00:01:28 may have proposed that the earth is a sphere.
00:01:31 And more than 3,000 years passed
00:01:33 from Moses’ writings
00:01:35 until scientists such as Isaac Newton
00:01:37 realized that the earth
00:01:39 seemed to hang upon nothing.
00:01:42 Now, keeping those points in mind,
00:01:45 let’s read what the Bible said some 3,500 years ago.
00:01:50 Anna, would you please read for us Job 26:7?
00:02:00 It says: “He stretches out the northern sky
00:02:03 “over empty space,
00:02:05 suspending the earth upon nothing.”
00:02:08 Thank you so much.
00:02:11 Based off of what we learned in the video,
00:02:13 why do you think it’s surprising that the Bible says
00:02:16 that the earth is suspended “upon nothing”?
00:02:19 Well, people didn’t believe that at the time.
00:02:22 Exactly.
00:02:23 That point always amazes me!
00:02:25 So if we can trust the Bible in scientific matters,
00:02:30 in what other areas is the Bible trustworthy?
00:02:39 The video we showed you is part of a free Bible study course
00:02:43 with the use of this brochure.
00:02:45 If you’ll read it, I’d be happy to leave it with you.
00:02:48 And next time, we’ll discuss some of the questions that the Bible answers.
00:02:53 They can be found in lesson 1.
00:02:54 OK, sure. It sounds interesting.

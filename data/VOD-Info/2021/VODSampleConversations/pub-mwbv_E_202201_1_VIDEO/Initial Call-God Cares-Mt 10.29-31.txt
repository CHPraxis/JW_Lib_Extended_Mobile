00:00:05 When tragedies strike,
00:00:07 many people have a hard time believing that God cares about us.
00:00:11 Have you ever felt that way?
00:00:18 Honestly? Yeah.
00:00:21 I want to believe he cares,
00:00:23 but he hasn’t done much for me; that’s for sure.
00:00:25 Last year my father had a heart attack,
00:00:28 and I just lost my job.
00:00:30 I’m sorry to hear that.
00:00:32 How’s your father recovering?
00:00:34 He’s OK now.
00:00:35 We were really worried about him for a while.
00:00:37 I’m glad he’s improving.
00:00:39 When we face problems,
00:00:41 it helps to know that someone cares.
00:00:44 How do we know that God cares about us as individuals?
00:00:48 Please note Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:29-31.
00:00:53 Tom, would you please read that for us?
00:00:55 Sure.
00:00:57 “Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value, do they not?
00:01:02 “Yet not one of them will fall to the ground
00:01:05 “without your Father’s knowledge.
00:01:07 “But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
00:01:11 So have no fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.”
00:01:21 Thank you.
00:01:22 So how detailed is God’s knowledge of us?
00:01:28 He numbers the hairs of our head?
00:01:30 Yes. Impressive, right?
00:01:32 Yeah.
00:01:34 So if God numbers even the hairs of our head,
00:01:37 would it make sense that he cares about us
00:01:40 and knows when we’re going through a hard time?
00:01:42 It seems logical.
00:01:44 But now the question is,
00:01:46 How does God help us to cope with present problems?
00:01:49 I’d like to discuss that the next time we talk.

We’re making brief visits on our neighbors

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discuss how the Bible can help us today.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:13.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you view the Bible?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some would say it’s a book of human wisdom,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others say myths and legends.

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others view it as God’s Word.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are your thoughts?

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:28.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm. That’s a good question.

00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of the Bible as a good book,

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t say
that I really know what’s in it.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have said the same.

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to show you a verse that gives
four ways that the Bible can help us.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Susan, would you please read Romans 15:4?

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “For all the things
that were written beforehand

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through the comfort
from the Scriptures

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might have hope.”

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you notice the four specific ways

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible can help us?

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives instruction, endurance,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comfort, and hope.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which of these do you feel
that we need the most right now?

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:11.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:13.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would say “hope”

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this world is in a real mess.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:18.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I agree.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is needed more than ever.

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:24.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible can give us real hope.

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:27.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May I return in a few days
and show you an example of this?

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

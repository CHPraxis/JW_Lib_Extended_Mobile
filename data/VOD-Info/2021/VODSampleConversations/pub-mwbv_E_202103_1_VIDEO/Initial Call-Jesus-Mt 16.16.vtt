Today, I’ve been discussing
with people the identity of Jesus Christ.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are your thoughts about Jesus?

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think he was a good man.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He certainly was.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he was
the greatest man who ever lived.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible identifies him
as being much more than that.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider what we read here at Matthew 16:16.

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus has just asked his disciples
who they believe he is.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice their response:

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Simon Peter answered: ‘You are the Christ,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of the living God.’”

00:00:49.153 --> 00:00:53.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to this verse, who was Jesus?

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Jesus just a good man, or more?

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More.

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says he was the Son of God.

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we might wonder,

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Since Jesus is the Son of God

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and a perfect Son at that—
why did he die?’

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe we can discuss
the Bible’s answer the next time we talk.

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’d like that.

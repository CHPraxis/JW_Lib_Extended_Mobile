Matthew 9:35 explains

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Jesus set out on a tour

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of all the cities
and villages [of Galilee], . . .

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching the good news of the Kingdom.”

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, rather than slowing down

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward the end of his earthly ministry,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expanded his efforts

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:34.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach more people.

00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way,

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Service Committee,

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction of the Governing Body,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is expanding

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accelerating
the life-saving preaching work

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right up to the end.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way the Service Committee
accomplishes this

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is through the service departments

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:01.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in each branch office.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with the Bible principle

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “let all things take place decently
and by arrangement,”

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the service departments coordinate
the preaching work.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a behind-the-scenes look

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at how the work
of the Service Department in each branch

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefits us.

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Field Ministers Desk

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:30.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coordinates the assignments
of special full-time servants

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who take the lead

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:35.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the preaching work.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Globally,

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.619 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there are over 45,000

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
special full-time servants in the field,

00:01:40.412 --> 00:01:42.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
serving in the circuit work,

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as special pioneers,
and as field missionaries.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body knows that they need

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practical assistance
to carry out their assignments.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, the Field Ministers Desk

00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:54.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looks after their spiritual
and physical needs.

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This desk helps to find suitable housing

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also ensures
that they receive shepherding

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouragement,
especially when they’re facing

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenges in their assignment,

00:02:05.813 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as health issues or family emergencies.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to reach as many people as possible,

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Preaching Needs Desk

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oversees a wide range of matters
involving the preaching work

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the entire branch territory.

00:02:24.415 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Preaching Needs Desk

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is involved in establishing

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
special preaching campaigns.

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:31.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They start by considering

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:33.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there is sufficient interest

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and resources to justify a campaign.

00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:39.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes a campaign is supported 
from within the branch territory,

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes

00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a request is made for international support.

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:47.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been privileged to share

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:48.397 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in four different special

00:02:48.397 --> 00:02:49.940 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
preaching campaigns.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their own way,
they each had a life-changing impact on me.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really nice to witness to people
who had never heard about Jehovah before 

00:02:57.364 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had never spoken to Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One young man I met was my age.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was all alone in the refugee camp.

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His entire family had died

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his home country when
their house was hit by a bomb.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to share
the Bible’s promise of a resurrection

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and introduce him to the congregation,
where he began attending meetings.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a special experience
I will never forget.

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:22.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Preaching Needs Desk
also coordinates arrangements

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.768 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:28.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When thinking of possible locations,

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers look for cities
with dense populations and areas

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with significant pedestrian,
or foot, traffic.

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:37.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they find an area with good potential, 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capable brothers are assigned
to coordinate the work.

00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is similar to the way
that harbor witnessing is arranged.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some areas,

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:48.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are hundreds
or even thousands of volunteers,

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so good coordination is extremely important.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More workers are needed in the harvest,

00:03:56.298 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it’s encouraging to see Jehovah’s people

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eagerly respond to the call

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share in public or harbor witnessing,

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:04.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
support special preaching campaigns,

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or serve where the need is greater.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this unique time in history

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:16.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when all of God’s people
are exerting themselves

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach the good news in all the earth,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the service departments appreciate

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the privilege
to help organize this great work

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:31.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is accomplishing.

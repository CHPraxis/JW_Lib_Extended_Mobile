Jehovah invites each of us

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dig into his Word and draw closer to him.

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we’re convinced
that Jehovah is blessing

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ongoing work
to improve our study tools.

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was in 2013, for example,

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:31.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the organization released
an exciting new tool: 

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>JW Library® </i>

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:36.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a digital library with the Bible,

00:00:36.223 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publications, audio, and video

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that goes where we go.

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:45.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Writing Committee
of the Governing Body

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directs and approves updates to <i>JW Library,</i>

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:52.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including new and improved features.

00:00:52.907 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After an update,
we might not notice a new feature

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or know how to take full advantage of it.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we asked the brothers who work
with the programming of <i>JW Library </i>

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show us how we can make
the best use of it.

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve all had trouble trying to remember
a point related to a scripture

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a recent talk or our Bible reading.

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap a Bible verse.

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Create a new note.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enter text in the note in the study pane.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.303 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try this:

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Make some notes directly in your Bible.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next time you’re preparing a talk
or conducting a Bible study,

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:06.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those explanations or illustrations
will be right at your fingertips.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we have a note open,
let’s talk about Tags.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good tag identifies
what the note is about

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps you find the note again.

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A tag can really be anything

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:55.988 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that would help you find this gem

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:57.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the future.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some like to make tags
for Family Worship topics,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illustrations they want to remember,

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or reminders to dig deeper at a later time.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can use emojis in your notes and tags

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:12.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make them stand out.

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you planning on getting a new device?

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to worry
about losing your notes and highlights.

00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use the Backup and Restore feature

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to save your notes.

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can back up to a cloud service

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or email the file to yourself

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then restore it to your new device.

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you just want to keep
your notes safe,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to make a backup regularly,
maybe once a week.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:21.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have <i>JW Library</i> 
on more than one device.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They use one device to take notes

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then send a backup
from there to other devices.

00:04:27.538 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note that when you restore a backup
on a second device,

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will replace any notes you have there.

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for those excellent tips

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to get
the most from <i>JW Library.</i>

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know I’ll be able
to put many of them to good use.

00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If <i>JW Library</i>
is one of your study tools,

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we encourage you
to become skilled with it.

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:08.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you don’t have to use
every feature of <i>JW Library,</i>

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can learn and practice the ones

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:15.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help you study God’s Word
and teach others.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:18.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah continue to bless us

00:05:18.338 --> 00:05:22.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we make every effort
to dig into his Word

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw closer to him.

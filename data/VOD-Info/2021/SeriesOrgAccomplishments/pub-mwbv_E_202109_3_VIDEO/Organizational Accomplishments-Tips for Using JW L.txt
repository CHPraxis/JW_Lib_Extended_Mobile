00:00:10 Jehovah invites each of us
00:00:12 to dig into his Word and draw closer to him.
00:00:16 That’s why we’re convinced that Jehovah is blessing
00:00:19 the ongoing work to improve our study tools.
00:00:24 It was in 2013, for example,
00:00:27 that the organization released an exciting new tool:
00:00:31 JW Library®
00:00:33 —a digital library with the Bible,
00:00:36 publications, audio, and video
00:00:39 that goes where we go.
00:00:42 The Writing Committee of the Governing Body
00:00:45 directs and approves updates to JW Library,
00:00:49 including new and improved features.
00:00:52 After an update, we might not notice a new feature
00:00:56 or know how to take full advantage of it.
00:00:59 So we asked the brothers who work with the programming of JW Library
00:01:04 to show us how we can make the best use of it.
00:01:38 We’ve all had trouble trying to remember a point related to a scripture
00:01:42 from a recent talk or our Bible reading.
00:01:46 Tap a Bible verse.
00:01:48 Create a new note.
00:01:50 Enter text in the note in the study pane.
00:01:54 Try this:
00:01:56 Make some notes directly in your Bible.
00:01:58 The next time you’re preparing a talk or conducting a Bible study,
00:02:02 those explanations or illustrations will be right at your fingertips.
00:02:40 While we have a note open, let’s talk about Tags.
00:02:45 A good tag identifies what the note is about
00:02:48 and helps you find the note again.
00:02:51 A tag can really be anything
00:02:54 that would help you find this gem
00:02:55 in the future.
00:02:57 Some like to make tags for Family Worship topics,
00:03:01 illustrations they want to remember,
00:03:03 or reminders to dig deeper at a later time.
00:03:06 And you can use emojis in your notes and tags
00:03:10 to make them stand out.
00:03:45 Are you planning on getting a new device?
00:03:47 You don’t have to worry about losing your notes and highlights.
00:03:51 Use the Backup and Restore feature
00:03:53 to save your notes.
00:03:55 You can back up to a cloud service
00:03:57 or email the file to yourself
00:04:00 and then restore it to your new device.
00:04:10 And if you just want to keep your notes safe,
00:04:13 remember to make a backup regularly, maybe once a week.
00:04:17 Some have JW Library  on more than one device.
00:04:21 They use one device to take notes
00:04:23 and then send a backup from there to other devices.
00:04:27 Note that when you restore a backup on a second device,
00:04:30 it will replace any notes you have there.
00:04:47 Thank you, brothers, for those excellent tips
00:04:50 on how to get the most from JW Library.
00:04:53 I know I’ll be able to put many of them to good use.
00:04:57 If JW Library is one of your study tools,
00:05:01 we encourage you to become skilled with it.
00:05:04 While you don’t have to use every feature of JW Library,
00:05:08 you can learn and practice the ones
00:05:10 that help you study God’s Word and teach others.
00:05:15 May Jehovah continue to bless us
00:05:18 as we make every effort to dig into his Word
00:05:22 and draw closer to him.

00:00:10 In November 2019,
00:00:13 the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:15 reported an amazing milestone.
00:00:19 Content on jw.org
00:00:21 was now available in 1,000 languages.
00:00:26 We thank Jehovah for this accomplishment.
00:00:29 He guides us with his holy spirit
00:00:31 to “make disciples of people of all the nations.”
00:00:35 But it didn’t stop at 1,000.
00:00:38 More than 20 languages have been added
00:00:41 since that 2019 report.
00:00:44 Translating media into over 1,000 languages
00:00:48 is an incredible amount of work,
00:00:51 and it requires close cooperation
00:00:53 across many parts of our organization.
00:00:57 Translation teams work under the direction
00:00:59 of the Writing Committee of the Governing Body.
00:01:02 Additionally, the Publishing Committee of the Governing Body supports their work
00:01:07 by building remote translation offices
00:01:10 and equipping them with the tools they need.
00:01:14 These remote translation offices are established
00:01:17 where people speak the language being translated.
00:01:21 In this video report, we’ll see how this is done
00:01:25 using adaptable methods
00:01:27 that make wise use of our donations.
00:01:31 But most important, we’ll see the good results
00:01:34 when people are able to learn about Jehovah
00:01:37 in their own language.
00:01:40 Living where the language we translate
00:01:42 is spoken
00:01:42 has helped us to improve
00:01:43 the way we translate our publications.
00:01:46 We are now able to interact directly with the native speakers
00:01:49 when we go in the ministry and attend meetings and assemblies.
00:01:54 The other benefit is
00:01:56 that the commuter volunteers
00:01:57 who come and help daily at the RTO
00:02:00 were born and raised right here.
00:02:03 This fact makes these brothers and sisters
00:02:05 a precious part of the translation team
00:02:09 because they write in a way that is clear and easy to understand.
00:02:13 The remote translation offices arrangement
00:02:16 has proved to be very effective.
00:02:19 Over time, the Worldwide Design/Construction Department,
00:02:22 working under the direction of the Publishing Committee,
00:02:26 worked to simplify new RTOs
00:02:29 and adjust existing ones.
00:02:32 A small RTO can be established
00:02:34 in a Kingdom Hall,
00:02:36 like this one in Easter Island,
00:02:38 or at an Assembly Hall,
00:02:41 like here in Guatemala.
00:02:43 These flexible solutions make the best use of dedicated funds.
00:02:49 The translation office was built very quickly
00:02:51 with red bricks,
00:02:53 which made it possible for us to move in within four months.
00:02:59 We never expected that we could be given
00:03:02 such a beautiful place as this
00:03:05 —constructed in record time!
00:03:08 In about six months, they constructed
00:03:11 the residence building,
00:03:13 the offices,
00:03:15 and the recording studio.
00:03:17 In Bangalore, India, rented space in this commercial building
00:03:22 is used as a support RTO.
00:03:24 As a result,
00:03:25 support for translation-only RTOs can be fairly simple.
00:03:29 This also means that the space requirements
00:03:32 for a translation-only RTO reduces significantly.
00:03:35 The team takes the translated text from the translators
00:03:38 and then they can work it into a design format
00:03:40 that can be used for printing or for distribution over the Web
00:03:44 and can also be read on the  JW Library® app
00:03:47 or can be heard as an audio recording.
00:03:49 For a number of years, there were just a handful of RTOs;
00:03:54 today, there are over 400 worldwide.
00:03:59 That tremendous growth is possible
00:04:01 in part because of the way we now build
00:04:05 and equip RTOs.
00:04:07 Isn’t it wonderful to be part of Jehovah’s people
00:04:10 who make such great efforts
00:04:12 to reach as many people as possible, regardless of language?
00:04:17 Since the language used in the publications is
00:04:20 easy to understand,
00:04:22 I really enjoy doing my personal study.
00:04:25 This has made it possible
00:04:27 to know our Father, Jehovah, better,
00:04:29 and it has also helped me to teach others about Jehovah,
00:04:33 who are also making Jehovah their Friend.
00:04:37 At Isaiah 65:13, Jehovah says:
00:04:42 “Look!
00:04:43 “My servants will eat,
00:04:45 “but you will go hungry.
00:04:47 “Look!
00:04:48 “My servants will drink,
00:04:50 but you will go thirsty.”
00:04:53 Jehovah’s promise to feed his people
00:04:56 will not go unfulfilled.
00:04:58 It’s the Publishing Committee’s privilege to assist in that feeding.
00:05:02 We pray for Jehovah’s blessings on our efforts to provide
00:05:06 remote translation offices wherever they are needed
00:05:09 to support God’s people.

In November 2019,

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reported an amazing milestone.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Content on jw.org

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was now available in 1,000 languages.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah for this accomplishment.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He guides us with his holy spirit

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples
of people of all the nations.”

00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it didn’t stop at 1,000.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 20 languages have been added

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since that 2019 report.

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translating media into over 1,000 languages

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an incredible amount of work,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it requires close cooperation

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across many parts of our organization.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation teams work under the direction

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:02.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, the Publishing Committee
of the Governing Body supports their work

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by building remote translation offices

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and equipping them with the tools they need.

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These remote translation offices
are established

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:21.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people speak
the language being translated.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this video report,
we’ll see how this is done

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using adaptable methods

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make wise use of our donations.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most important,
we’ll see the good results

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when people are able to learn about Jehovah

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own language.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living where the language we translate

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is spoken

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped us to improve

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way we translate our publications.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:49.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now able to interact directly
with the native speakers

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we go in the ministry
and attend meetings and assemblies.

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The other benefit is

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the commuter volunteers

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who come and help daily at the RTO

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were born and raised right here.

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This fact makes these brothers and sisters

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a precious part of the translation team

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:13.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they write in a way
that is clear and easy to understand.

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The remote translation offices arrangement

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has proved to be very effective.

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, the Worldwide
Design/Construction Department,

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:26.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working under the direction
of the Publishing Committee,

00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:29.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
worked to simplify new RTOs

00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:32.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and adjust existing ones.

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A small RTO can be established

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a Kingdom Hall,

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:38.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one in Easter Island,

00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:41.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at an Assembly Hall,

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like here in Guatemala.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These flexible solutions
make the best use of dedicated funds.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The translation office was built very quickly

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with red bricks,

00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which made it possible for us
to move in within four months.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never expected that we could be given

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a beautiful place as this

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—constructed in record time!

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.754 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In about six months, they constructed

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the residence building,

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the offices,

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the recording studio.

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:22.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bangalore, India,
rented space in this commercial building

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is used as a support RTO.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:25.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
support for translation-only RTOs
can be fairly simple.

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This also means that the space requirements

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:35.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a translation-only RTO
reduces significantly.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The team takes the translated text
from the translators

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they can work it
into a design format

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:44.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can be used for printing
or for distribution over the Web

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can also be read on the <i> JW Library</i>® app

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:49.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or can be heard as an audio recording.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a number of years,
there were just a handful of RTOs;

00:03:54.755 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today, there are over 400 worldwide.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That tremendous growth is possible

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in part because of the way we now build

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:07.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and equip RTOs.

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:10.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it wonderful
to be part of Jehovah’s people

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who make such great efforts

00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach as many people as possible,
regardless of language?

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the language
used in the publications is

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:22.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
easy to understand,

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy doing my personal study.

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.246 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This has made it possible

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:29.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to know our Father, Jehovah, better,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it has also helped me
to teach others about Jehovah,

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also making Jehovah their Friend.

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:42.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah 65:13, Jehovah says:

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My servants will eat,

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but you will go hungry.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look!

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:50.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My servants will drink,

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will go thirsty.”

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:56.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promise to feed his people

00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:58.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not go unfulfilled.

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the Publishing Committee’s privilege
to assist in that feeding.

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray for Jehovah’s blessings
on our efforts to provide

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:09.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remote translation offices
wherever they are needed

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support God’s people.

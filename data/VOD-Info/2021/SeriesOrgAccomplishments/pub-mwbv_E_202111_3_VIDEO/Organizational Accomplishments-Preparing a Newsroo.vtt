We have heard from many of you
how much you’ve really appreciated JW News

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a source of accurate information.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast with much of the misinformation

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
posted on the Internet and social media,

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people serve
as “a pillar and support of the truth,”

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as 1 Timothy 3:15 says.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just what does it take
to prepare a Newsroom report?

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, under the direction
of the Coordinators’ Committee

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body,

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Office of Public Information, or OPI,

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepares articles for the JW Newsroom.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they work closely
with Public Information Desks, or PIDs,

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our branch offices.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following report,
some of these brothers

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share a behind-the-scenes look

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at how articles in the last few years

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been written and published on JW News.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:11.050 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From the late 1960’s

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the late 1990’s,

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Italian brothers were condemned

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imprisoned for refusing military service.

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A recent survey revealed
that more than 14,000 brothers

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from that group are still alive.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were sentenced to a total
of almost 10,000 years in prison.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought that their experiences could make

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a potential story
for the Newsroom section of jw.org,

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with comments from secular sources,

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we promptly notified OPI.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:43.540 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we received that proposal,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we agreed with their assessment.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when we go into action.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll talk about the angle
back and forth with the PID

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until we have something
that we know will work not only for Italy

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for our worldwide audience on jw.org.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we interviewed some brothers
who had been imprisoned the longest.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:04.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to face many challenges,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also recalled
how their loyalty was a great witness,

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for some prison guards

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who eventually became

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:14.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses as well.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This additional information was confirmed
and then added to the story.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we sent the draft to OPI.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once the initial article
is written by the branch,

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s still quite a bit of work
that has to be done.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll edit the article, select the photos,
write the captions,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send it through proofreading,

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:40.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then, lastly, the article is sent back
to the Coordinators’ Committee

00:02:40.014 --> 00:02:42.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their final review and approval.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.227 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after the article was posted

00:02:45.227 --> 00:02:46.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:48.272 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the Italy PID

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
informed their local reporters,

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 50 media outlets in Italy
covered this story

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wrote articles about this topic.

00:02:57.322 --> 00:03:00.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our hope was
that by publicizing this information,

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would not only be encouraging
to our brothers and sisters

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it would have a positive impact

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:10.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on fair-minded officials in other countries

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where our brothers are still dealing
with this issue of neutrality.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.509 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The year 2019 was the 25th anniversary

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the genocide in Rwanda,

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:20.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so because of that,

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:22.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there was greater interest

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:25.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the scholarly community, in particular,

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what happened during the genocide.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that OPI
was responsible for doing

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to collect experiences of people

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were our brothers and sisters;
who saw the violence;

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who survived
and helped others to survive,

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes at the risk of their own lives.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.951 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our office assisted OPI

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in preparing the article in two ways:

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first of all,
ensuring that the release was accurate

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:52.711 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and second, ensuring that the article

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
gave consideration to the perspective

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:57.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who went through the genocide.

00:03:57.674 --> 00:04:01.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of the brothers have been able to read
that story on JW News,

00:04:01.386 --> 00:04:03.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s encouraged them

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they see the courage and the faith
that our brothers displayed in Rwanda.

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:10.896 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
OPI has the privilege

00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:13.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of assisting the brothers in Russia.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.902 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We prepare news items on JW News.

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:20.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once a trial begins,
then the team works together

00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare a JW News item.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to do lots of research
on the brother’s

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the sister’s personal case history.

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:28.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were they raided?

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were they put in pretrial detention?

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can introduce the brother or the sister
to the brotherhood,

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they can pray for them.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we’ve put together the material,

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we send it to the Public Information Desk.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:42.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the day of the verdict,

00:04:42.094 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we post a <i>Breaking News  </i>update

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to immediately alert the brotherhood.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you make the best use of JW News?

00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:55.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for opportunities to share news items
with your Bible students and others.

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:57.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of these reports show
how Jehovah’s people

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrate love for one another.

00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another way is by praying
for our brothers and sisters

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:07.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we read about in the Newsroom.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:12.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope you continue to use the Newsroom
to stay informed, to be encouraged,

00:05:12.332 --> 00:05:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remain united with God’s organization

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:18.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“a pillar and support of the truth.”

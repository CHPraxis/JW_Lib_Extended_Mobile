00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a child, I dreamed

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of becoming a ballerina.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trained as a ballet dancer from childhood.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:16.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taught to give complete obedience
to the artistic director,

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
absolute loyalty to the dance company,

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to put ballet before everything else
in my life.

00:00:25.087 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finally realized there’s no way
to get ahead in this world

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without compromise.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just can’t be done.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such a life is empty and unsatisfying.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is, once you get into that,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you get lulled in by that glamour and glitz.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, down the road
when you finally see the trap

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you got into,
it’s very hard to get out.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I always tell young people, you know,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it doesn’t matter how good everything
seems; it doesn’t matter how great.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:06.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s always a string attached—always.

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:10.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one day,
you’re going to wake up and it’s a rope.

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can’t cut a rope that easily

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—meaning you can’t get out of the situation

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once Satan has you trapped in it.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:21.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it happens without you even realizing it.

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ballet is discipline,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to figure out a way

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take that skill

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:31.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transfer it into my everyday life.

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took some time,
but I finally figured it out,

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s not a waste.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s good.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I had to learn
was to get out of my comfort zone.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were in Bethel until 1987.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jack had a job lined up when we left Bethel,
and that was good.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t get a job
because of my physical health issues.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I probably was in bed for about five months.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I started feeling better,

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:03.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s when I realized
how bad the medical bills were getting.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just dragged myself out of bed
and went and looked for a part-time job.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, through all of this,
Jack and I just kept praying.

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew Jehovah would take care of us.

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No question about that.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I did get a job at a law firm.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a good job.

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually lasted there 30 years.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely Jehovah blessed me,

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I believe what he was blessing
were my efforts.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t quit, and I refused to compromise.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started seeing
that I was really learning this new skill

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was getting good at it,

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s when I sat down and I said:
“Well, Jehovah, I have this new skill.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be able to use it for you.”

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:46.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing led to another, and I became

00:02:46.103 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a commuter Bethelite
for the Legal Department.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d say that about 11 years
after I had left Bethel,

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:56.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working and all of a sudden,
I got sick again with the same thing

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—complete rapid loss of weight
and all the weakness came back.

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:03.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was eventually diagnosed
as having celiac disease.

00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:08.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once I changed my diet,
I just started getting better and better.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:10.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I stayed with the law firm until 2014,

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then my husband and I retired
and moved to another part of the country.

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:18.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, currently,
I’m a remote Bethel consultant.

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you slave for the world,
you really are a slave.

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:24.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you slave for Jehovah,

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my opinion, you’re not slaving at all.

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You couldn’t have a better partnership

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:33.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than you and Jehovah,
and that’s how I view it.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re never going to experience
Jehovah to the full

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unless you put yourself out there
for him to use.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had a wonderful life

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of extraordinary spiritual privileges.

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:50.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no career in the world
that is ever going to come close to that.

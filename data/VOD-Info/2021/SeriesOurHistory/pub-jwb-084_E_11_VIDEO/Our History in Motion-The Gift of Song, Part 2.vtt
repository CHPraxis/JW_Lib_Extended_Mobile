In the previous episode,

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we explored the early history
of our songbooks,

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it ended with a twist.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the most part, we stopped singing

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at congregation meetings in the late 1930’s.

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For how long?

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:32.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publications in the archive

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveal that it was from 1938 to 1944.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And though brothers and sisters
did sing at conventions,

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they really missed singing together

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:46.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at congregation meetings.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did we start again?

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a time of rapid progress

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—new methods were tried;
meeting formats changed.

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to 1944.

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re at the United Announcers’
Theocratic Assembly

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Buffalo, New York, U.S.A.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The clock above the arena floor

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reads 4:30 in the afternoon.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother F. W. Franz steps up to give a talk

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called “Song of Kingdom Service.”

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “It is proper

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pleasing to God for His earthly servants

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lift their voices in literal song.”

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he’s speaking,
Brother Nathan Knorr steps forward

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hands him a red booklet.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Brother Franz announces

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the release of the <i>Kingdom Service Song Book.</i>

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He explains that this book will be used

00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for singing at congregation meetings.

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crowd is overjoyed!

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Singing was once again a part

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:03.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our meetings.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since then, we’ve received
several new songbooks

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:14.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—each one a gift from Jehovah.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Songs from the 1950 and 1966 songbooks

00:02:31.338 --> 00:02:34.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used terms from the more recently released

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</i>

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The topics and lyrics were more up-to-date,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and any songs with false religious teachings
were removed.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the <i>Kingdom Service Song Book</i>  forward,

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the names of the composers and lyricists
were not published.

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:57.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All credit was given to Jehovah.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By 1984,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
musical arrangements were simplified.

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even added chords, so it was easier

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to play the songs on guitar and piano.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We produced records, cassettes, CDs,

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and digital files
so that you could sing along

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:19.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Kingdom Hall, at home, or in the car.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people had so much music to enjoy

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in printed or recorded form.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:30.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that wasn’t always the case everywhere,

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which takes us back
to where we started in Part 1

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:40.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that secret recording from Siberia.

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During World War II,

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers in the former Soviet Union

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced extreme opposition.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine yourself there.

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have almost no printed literature.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much of it is just copied by hand.

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could be subjected
to forced labor and exile

00:04:01.303 --> 00:04:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if caught with a copy of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only songbook
available to them in Russian

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the 1928 songbook.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:14.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that they didn’t receive
the 1984 songbook,

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 1966 songbook,

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 1950 songbook,

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:22.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the 1944 songbook.

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you do?

00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:27.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you stop singing?

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they?

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:33.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sang what they already had
in their minds and hearts.

00:04:33.293 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made copies of the 1928 songbook,

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters kept singing

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the darkest of times.

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they did this for decades

00:04:48.976 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they were finally able

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:55.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lift their voices publicly in song
once again.

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:01.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly what happened

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the first international convention

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the former Soviet Union in 1992.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last, thousands of our brothers

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could sing together.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would they sing,

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they didn’t have a current songbook?

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:22.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Special brochures with lyrics were made

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that everyone could sing along.

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:37.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why is singing

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so important to Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because singing to Jehovah

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:45.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeps us close to him.

00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:49.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Singing Bible truths
embeds them in our heart,

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:52.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and singing praises shows our appreciation

00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:57.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Creator of music, Jehovah,

00:05:57.085 --> 00:05:59.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the gift of song.

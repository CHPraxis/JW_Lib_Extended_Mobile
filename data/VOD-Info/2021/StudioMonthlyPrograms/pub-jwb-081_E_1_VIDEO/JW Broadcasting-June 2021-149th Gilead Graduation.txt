00:00:01 Welcome to the June 2021 program of JW Broadcasting®!
00:00:25 The 149th class of Gilead
00:00:28 graduated on January 16, 2021.
00:00:32 The students were able
00:00:33 to take full advantage of the school
00:00:35 despite the pandemic
00:00:37 and the extra efforts to remain safe.
00:00:41 How will they use their training in this time of the end?
00:00:45 How did they personally benefit from the school?
00:00:48 Let’s find out in Part 1 of this historic graduation program.
00:00:55 This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead
00:00:58 at a most unique time in world events.
00:01:02 The Bethel family is fully aware of what transpired.
00:01:06 But since this program
00:01:09 will be broadcast to our global brotherhood,
00:01:12 let me remind all of you of what transpired.
00:01:18 You are well aware of the unique time in world events
00:01:22 —a global pandemic!
00:01:25 What makes this class so unique?
00:01:29 A normal class of Gilead consists of some 50 students.
00:01:34 The 149th class is made up of just 25.
00:01:39 Your class is abnormal.
00:01:43 But why?
00:01:45 You know why.
00:01:47 But let me share your experience with the worldwide brotherhood.
00:01:53 Those who had been invited to attend this class of Gilead
00:01:56 had begun to arrive at the Watchtower Educational Center at Patterson, New York.
00:02:01 The 25 students in this class
00:02:03 actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.
00:02:08 And as we all know,
00:02:10 it was at that time that the coronavirus
00:02:14 was declared to be a global pandemic.
00:02:18 Most travel was shut down.
00:02:21 The rest of their classmates could not come.
00:02:25 Because of government restrictions on educational facilities,
00:02:28 the 149th class had to be postponed.
00:02:34 You students were stuck at Patterson, New York, with no classes in session.
00:02:39 Commendably, many of you were able to work remotely
00:02:44 for your home branch office in the interim.
00:02:48 Finally, here in New York,
00:02:51 government agencies allowed for educational facilities
00:02:54 to again conduct classes if physical distancing could be maintained.
00:03:00 With just 25 of you,
00:03:02 that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.
00:03:06 So we have only 25 “abnormal” students
00:03:11 who will graduate today.
00:03:14 To clarify,
00:03:16 it is the number of students
00:03:19 that makes this class “abnormal.”
00:03:22 But I am told by your instructors that, individually,
00:03:27 you are very “normal.”
00:03:31 In fact, they are very impressed with your spirituality
00:03:35 and your Christian personalities.
00:03:38 You have excelled in your studies and classroom participation.
00:03:43 It’s a delight to be with you on this very special day.
00:03:48 What else, though, makes this an “abnormal” Gilead graduation?
00:03:53 You were not able to invite family members and close friends
00:03:57 to be here in person with you for this exciting event.
00:04:02 However, the Teaching Committee made arrangements for you
00:04:05 to tie in a number of these ones
00:04:08 for a streamed recording of the program.
00:04:13 And the good news is
00:04:15 that the entire program is being recorded and will be posted
00:04:19 as a future JW Broadcasting monthly program
00:04:23 in all of the approved languages.
00:04:27 We have a few statistics to share about the 149th class.
00:04:32 Of the 25 students, 8 are married couples;
00:04:36 7 are single brothers,
00:04:40 and there are 2 single sisters in the class.
00:04:43 I guess they’re still single.
00:04:48 All were serving at a Bethel branch facility
00:04:50 or at a remote translation office before attending school.
00:04:56 The students are from 14 different countries
00:05:00 and speak 29 different languages.
00:05:04 Their average age is 41.
00:05:06 That’s a good age.
00:05:08 Forty-four years ago, I was 41.
00:05:13 Their average years  in full-time service is 20.
00:05:17 In the Bible, Gilead referred to a territory in Israel.
00:05:21 And that name, “Gilead,”
00:05:24 was derived from a Hebrew word that meant “witness heap.”
00:05:30 When the school was first inaugurated in 1943,
00:05:34 “Gilead” was an appropriate name.
00:05:37 One of the instructors described the purpose of the school,
00:05:40 saying that it was “to instill in the students
00:05:44 a more intense desire to share in the evangelizing work.”
00:05:49 And for decades,
00:05:51 thousands of missionaries were sent out
00:05:54 to open up new territories around the world.
00:05:58 A “heap of witness” was given during that period of time.
00:06:03 However, in 2011,
00:06:05 the Governing Body adjusted the specific purpose of Gilead.
00:06:09 Instead of focusing on opening up new territories for preaching,
00:06:14 the purpose of the curriculum changed.
00:06:18 As we mentioned previously,
00:06:20 this entire class was already serving
00:06:24 at a Bethel facility
00:06:26 or a remote translation office.
00:06:29 The goal of Gilead now
00:06:32 is to bolster such ones so as to strengthen
00:06:36 and stabilize God’s people in the respective territories
00:06:39 to which they will be assigned.
00:06:42 Then, what about the all-important evangelizing work?
00:06:46 Who is assisting with the “heap of witness” worldwide?
00:06:52 That’s now the focus of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.
00:06:58 Each Branch Committee selects qualified pioneers
00:07:01 who are willing to be transferred to another part of the country
00:07:06 that needs help with the preaching work.
00:07:09 By using the large pool of zealous local pioneers,
00:07:14 the “heap of witness” is still being given
00:07:18 where the need is greater.
00:07:21 These local ones are already adapted to the culture,
00:07:24 climate, and living conditions in their countries
00:07:28 and, often times, they already know the language
00:07:31 where there is the greatest need.
00:07:34 However, the 25 of you in this class of Gilead
00:07:38 are expected to strengthen
00:07:41 and stabilize God’s people where you are assigned.
00:07:46 Well, what does that entail?
00:07:49 For you brothers,
00:07:51 in time, it may mean that you will be given more responsibility.
00:07:56 But your training has given you another way
00:07:59 to stabilize fellow believers in your assignment.
00:08:03 And this applies to all 25 of you,
00:08:07 whether brothers or sisters.
00:08:09 You have been elevated while here at Gilead.
00:08:13 In fact, in the territory of Gilead, in the Bible,
00:08:17 the elevation changes dramatically.
00:08:22 In the Jordan Valley,
00:08:24 Gilead was 690 feet,
00:08:27 or 210 meters below sea level.
00:08:32 But traveling east to the domelike mountainous region of Gilead,
00:08:36 the elevation rises
00:08:38 to over 3,300 feet,
00:08:43 or 1,000 meters.
00:08:46 You students came to Gilead below sea level.
00:08:50 But with daily Bible study and lectures,
00:08:54 you have been elevated.
00:08:58 Throughout the past five months, your faith has grown.
00:09:02 Your spirituality has been enhanced.
00:09:06 Your Christian personality has been refined.
00:09:10 You have been elevated.
00:09:13 You will be going out to your assignment,
00:09:16 not so much for a “heap of witness,”
00:09:19 but as a “heap of example.”
00:09:22 In this way,
00:09:24 you will strengthen and stabilize
00:09:27 those you work with at the branch
00:09:30 and those you associate with in your congregations.
00:09:37 Find Deuteronomy 8:17, 18.
00:09:48 Never forget that your power and strength,
00:09:52 your spiritual wealth,
00:09:54 does not originate with you.
00:09:57 It is Jehovah who has made this transformation in you.
00:10:03 Read with me, Deuteronomy 8:17, 18:
00:10:09 “If you should say in your heart,
00:10:11 “‘My own power
00:10:13 “‘and the strength of my own hand
00:10:16 “have produced this wealth for me,’
00:10:18 “remember that it is Jehovah your God
00:10:22 “who gives power to you to make wealth,
00:10:25 “in order to carry out his covenant
00:10:28 “that he swore to your forefathers,
00:10:30 as it is today.”
00:10:35 Today, you will graduate from the 149th class of Gilead.
00:10:40 But you will strengthen and stabilize those in your assignment
00:10:44 if you “remember
00:10:47 “that it is Jehovah your God
00:10:50 who gives power to you.”
00:10:56 For decades, we have been reminded to read God’s Word daily.
00:11:01 It was even painted on the side of the factory building
00:11:05 in Brooklyn for decades.
00:11:09 Brother David Splane is going to take that a step further
00:11:14 with his theme
00:11:16 “Enjoy Your Bible Reading.”
00:11:20 The Bible is a wonderful book.
00:11:24 It’s a book that we should just enjoy reading.
00:11:28 So for this talk, I thought I’d give a couple of suggestions
00:11:31 for adding to our reading pleasure.
00:11:34 Here’s the first:
00:11:36 Don’t pass quickly over the details.
00:11:40 Stop and investigate,
00:11:42 and at times you’ll be very glad you did.
00:11:46 Now, let’s take an example.
00:11:48 You’re reading in the book of 1 Chronicles.
00:11:50 Now, there are a lot of names in 1 Chronicles,
00:11:53 and you come across the name Heman.
00:11:56 If you are just interested in covering material,
00:11:59 you’d probably pass over it and go on to the next verse.
00:12:01 But you’re not in a rush,
00:12:03 and you notice a cross reference beside the name.
00:12:06 It refers you to 1 Chronicles 6:33.
00:12:10 So you decide to investigate, and in doing so,
00:12:13 you learn something heartwarming about Jehovah.
00:12:16 Let’s do that.
00:12:18 At 1 Chronicles chapter 6 (I’ll give you a moment)
00:12:22 and verse 33,
00:12:26 it says:
00:12:28 “These are the men who served with their sons:
00:12:32 “Of the Kohathites, Heman the singer,
00:12:36 son of Joel son of Samuel.”
00:12:41 So this Heman was Samuel’s grandson.
00:12:45 Now, what do we know about his family’s situation?
00:12:49 Well, his father, Joel, and his uncle, Abijah, were judges.
00:12:53 But they had a terrible reputation.
00:12:56 They’d rule in your favor if you could pay enough.
00:12:58 But if you were poor, forget it.
00:13:01 And the whole country knew about it.
00:13:04 At one point, the Bible says
00:13:06 that “all the elders of Israel . . . came to Samuel”
00:13:10 and said they didn’t want Joel and Abijah as judges anymore.
00:13:14 They wanted a king;
00:13:17 Jehovah was furious.
00:13:20 And He couldn’t have been too happy with Joel and Abijah either.
00:13:24 Now, can you imagine the effect that this corruption had
00:13:29 on the reputation of Heman’s family? the shame?
00:13:33 But like Hezekiah,
00:13:35 Heman didn’t allow his father’s bad example to paralyze him.
00:13:39 Heman developed his own personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:13:44 How do we know?
00:13:46 We followed a few clues.
00:13:48 We followed a few cross references,
00:13:50 and we came to 1 Chronicles 25:5.
00:13:54 Let’s do that.
00:13:55 First Chronicles 25:5
00:14:00 and, again, we’re trying to find something more about Heman.
00:14:04 It says: “All of these were sons of Heman,
00:14:08 “a visionary of the king in matters pertaining to the true God to his glory;
00:14:13 “thus the true God gave Heman
00:14:16 14 sons and 3 daughters.”
00:14:19 Did you see it?
00:14:21 “A visionary of the king.”
00:14:24 What was a visionary?
00:14:26 It was a kind of prophet.
00:14:27 Now, let’s see.
00:14:29 Samuel was a prophet, and now Heman was a prophet.
00:14:34 Do you see what’s heartwarming?
00:14:37 Jehovah was dealing with Heman in much the same way
00:14:41 that he had dealt with his grandfather.
00:14:43 Jehovah does not hold the sins
00:14:46 of the fathers against the sons.
00:14:49 That is something very, very nice to remember.
00:14:52 And can you see where this example would help some people you know?
00:14:56 Some even in full-time service have a hard time with it
00:15:00 because they had a rough family background
00:15:03 and they may feel that they’re worthless.
00:15:06 Mary is a case in point.
00:15:08 I’m going to call her Mary.
00:15:10 Now, Mary’s father was so violent
00:15:13 that at times Mary, her mom, and her siblings
00:15:17 had to get up in the middle of the night and run for their lives.
00:15:20 And to the neighbors, they were “that” family.
00:15:23 To make it worse, they were poor.
00:15:26 So all this made Mary feel worthless
00:15:30 —until—
00:15:32 until the day when she started studying with the Witnesses.
00:15:36 She developed her own relationship with Jehovah,
00:15:39 and she accepted him as her Father.
00:15:42 And today, Mary is a pioneer.
00:15:45 How does she feel about her life?
00:15:47 Here’s what she wrote:
00:15:49 “Jehovah is constantly looking for those who want a friendship with him.”
00:15:54 And here’s a touching point:
00:15:56 “He’s even looking into the hearts of children.”
00:16:00 Isn’t that nice?
00:16:02 Now, there are two lessons here.
00:16:04 As Heman’s example shows,
00:16:06 our family background doesn’t define who we are.
00:16:09 Jehovah will deal with us as individuals.
00:16:12 And a second example, one for the elders, is be like Jehovah.
00:16:16 Treat each member of the family as an individual.
00:16:20 Don’t lump them all in together.
00:16:23 Now to our second point:
00:16:25 We can make our Bible reading more enjoyable
00:16:28 if we try to fill in the blanks.
00:16:30 And that’s something that our Bible dramas do.
00:16:32 They fill in the blanks for us.
00:16:34 Now let’s illustrate: Let’s consider the example
00:16:37 of Queen Esther and the king’s son.
00:16:40 Now, you remember the story.
00:16:42 King Ahasuerus, who is understood to be Xerxes I,
00:16:46 was displeased with Queen Vashti, and he decided he was going to replace her.
00:16:51 So a call went out into the whole Persian Empire
00:16:56 for the most beautiful women to be brought to the palace,
00:16:59 and Esther was among them.
00:17:02 Now, the women were placed under the care of a man named Hegai,
00:17:06 and his job was to get them ready to meet the king.
00:17:10 Well, when we read Esther 2:9,
00:17:14 we smell trouble.
00:17:16 Let’s read it, and you see if you can figure out
00:17:19 what trouble is looming here
00:17:22 —Esther 2:9.
00:17:26 Remember, we’re trying to fill in the blanks.
00:17:28 We’re trying to imagine.
00:17:30 “Now the young woman [Esther]
00:17:32 “was pleasing to him [Hegai]
00:17:35 and won his favor.”
00:17:39 Now, this is a competition.
00:17:42 Keep that in mind. This is a competition.
00:17:44 “So he promptly arranged
00:17:46 for her beauty treatments and her [her] diet.”
00:17:49 Wait a minute.
00:17:51 That’s another detail we’ll have to pursue sometime.
00:17:53 Esther was Jewish.
00:17:55 She was trying to hide the fact that she was Jewish,
00:17:57 and there were so many things the Jews couldn’t eat.
00:18:00 How did she handle that?
00:18:01 But that’s for another day.
00:18:02 Let’s carry on.
00:18:04 And talking about Hegai, it says:
00:18:06 “He assigned to her seven selected young women from the king’s house.
00:18:10 “He also transferred her
00:18:14 and her young attendants to the best place in the house of the women.”
00:18:19 Do you smell trouble?
00:18:21 Do you see the problem?
00:18:23 Preferential treatment.
00:18:25 This is a competition.
00:18:27 There’s probably a lot of jealousy going on among the candidates.
00:18:30 And now Hegai is doing everything in his power
00:18:33 to help Esther to win the king’s heart.
00:18:36 How do you suppose that went down?
00:18:38 It could have led to big trouble.
00:18:40 And here’s another factor.
00:18:42 What about the king’s wives?
00:18:44 Now, there was only one queen, but Ahasuerus had many wives.
00:18:48 Some say he had 330 wives.
00:18:51 Now, when Vashti was deposed,
00:18:54 who do you suppose expected to become the queen?
00:18:59 The number two wife.
00:19:01 And yet, instead of going into the harem and choosing someone,
00:19:04 they went outside the palace —even to women who didn’t have royal blood.
00:19:09 How do you suppose that went down?
00:19:12 And now think about this:
00:19:14 Some scholars believe that although Vashti
00:19:18 was deposed as queen, she didn’t leave the palace.
00:19:21 She just couldn’t ever see the king again.
00:19:24 If she was still there, as some scholars believe,
00:19:27 was she plotting in the background?
00:19:30 This could have been a very difficult situation.
00:19:34 But Esther 2:15 tells us something very interesting about Esther.
00:19:39 We’re going to read just the end of verse 15
00:19:43 of Esther chapter 2, at the end of verse 15.
00:19:47 It says: “All the while
00:19:49 “Esther was winning the favor
00:19:51 of everyone who saw her.”
00:19:54 Esther avoided the land mines.
00:19:58 What does that tell us?
00:19:59 She was not only a very beautiful woman,
00:20:01 but she had a beautiful godly personality
00:20:04 —a winning personality.
00:20:06 Well, we said this was about Esther and the king’s son.
00:20:11 Who is the king’s son—the heir?
00:20:14 Well, we met him at the convention this past summer.
00:20:17 He was the man who was so nice to Nehemiah
00:20:20 —Artaxerxes.
00:20:22 And if the historians have their facts straight,
00:20:25 Artaxerxes would have been only three years old
00:20:28 when Esther married his father.
00:20:32 Now, history tells us that as kings of Persia go,
00:20:36 Artaxerxes had a very nice personality.
00:20:39 He was mild, peaceable, kind
00:20:41 —so unlike his father, who had a terrible temper.
00:20:45 We have to ask, Did Esther have anything to do
00:20:49 with the pleasant disposition of Artaxerxes?
00:20:52 Maybe she did.
00:20:53 Who knows?
00:20:55 We’re using our imagination.
00:20:57 We’re trying to fill in the blanks.
00:20:59 Well, we haven’t discussed anything earthshaking here,
00:21:03 and that isn’t the point of this talk.
00:21:05 But if you investigate the details and fill in the blanks,
00:21:10 it’ll contribute to the pleasure you derive from reading the Bible.
00:21:14 And if Bible reading is a pleasant experience for you,
00:21:17 you’ll have no trouble to arrange a schedule
00:21:21 of daily Bible reading.
00:21:23 Enjoy!
00:21:27 Thank you, Brother Splane.
00:21:29 We enjoyed your presentation,
00:21:32 and we look forward to enjoying
00:21:35 our Bible reading even more.
00:21:38 Next on our program, we will hear from Brother Seth Hyatt,
00:21:43 a helper to the Service Committee.
00:21:46 He has the catchy theme for us
00:21:49 “What Do You Want Me to Do for You?”
00:21:52 Brother Hyatt, please.
00:21:56 I know you agree.
00:21:58 Your Gilead training has been a gift
00:22:02 —a gift from Jehovah, Jesus Christ,
00:22:06 and “the faithful and discreet slave.”
00:22:10 Have you thought about how you’re going to share your gift
00:22:15 and allow others to benefit from your training
00:22:19 when you return to your assignment?
00:22:22 It’s a good question.
00:22:24 When we get back to the busyness of a routine,
00:22:27 perhaps the stress and anxieties
00:22:30 of increased responsibility,
00:22:33 sharing a gift may be the last thing on your mind.
00:22:37 So it’s good to think about it now.
00:22:40 What will help you to strengthen,
00:22:45 encourage, motivate,
00:22:48 and instruct those who you oversee
00:22:52 —your workmates, your brothers and sisters in the congregation?
00:22:57 We can learn much from the way Jesus dealt with people.
00:23:02 Like you, Jesus was entrusted
00:23:05 with a beautiful gift.
00:23:07 Unlike you and me,
00:23:10 Jesus had some amazing abilities.
00:23:14 For example, he could read hearts.
00:23:17 The Scriptures describe an occasion
00:23:20 when Jesus responded to a man’s thoughts,
00:23:24 rather than to his words.
00:23:26 Do you think Jesus’ ability
00:23:29 to know what his audience was thinking
00:23:31 and feeling enhanced his effectiveness
00:23:35 as he shared his gift?
00:23:38 Of course.
00:23:41 But interestingly, the Scriptures reveal
00:23:44 that Jesus dignified people
00:23:46 in the way he communicated with them.
00:23:49 He often asked meaningful questions
00:23:53 and listened attentively to the answers
00:23:57 before he shared his gift.
00:24:01 For a few minutes this morning,
00:24:04 let’s consider two occasions when Jesus did just that.
00:24:09 In doing so, we’ll get some pointers
00:24:13 that will assist you
00:24:16 to be effective in sharing your gift of Gilead training.
00:24:20 The first account is found in the Bible book of Mark chapter 10.
00:24:25 Let’s turn there together.
00:24:27 Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 35:
00:24:34 “James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
00:24:37 “approached him and said to him:
00:24:39 “‘Teacher, we want you to do for us
00:24:43 “whatever we ask of you.’
00:24:46 “He said to them:
00:24:48 “‘What do you want me to do for you?’
00:24:53 “They replied: ‘Grant us to sit down,
00:24:56 one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.’”
00:25:03 The parallel account in Matthew
00:25:05 reveals that James and John
00:25:08 did not approach Jesus on their own.
00:25:12 They had their mother do it for them.
00:25:15 Do you think,
00:25:17 as this woman approached Jesus,
00:25:21 he knew what she wanted?
00:25:25 Probably.
00:25:27 How did he deal with her?
00:25:30 Did he interrupt her? reprimand her?
00:25:33 No.
00:25:35 Instead, he asked a question:
00:25:39 “What do you want me to do for you?”
00:25:44 The second account is just a few verses down
00:25:48 —Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 46.
00:25:52 Here we learn about a blind beggar
00:25:55 named Bartimaeus.
00:25:58 He sat by the road, and when he heard that Jesus was passing by,
00:26:02 he called out: “Son of David, Jesus,
00:26:06 have mercy on me!”
00:26:08 The crowd tried to quiet him,
00:26:11 but Bartimaeus called out even more loudly.
00:26:15 “Jesus stopped
00:26:17 and said: ‘[Bring] him to me.’”
00:26:22 Now Bartimaeus had an audience
00:26:25 with the Son of God.
00:26:29 How did Jesus address Bartimaeus?
00:26:33 In verse 51: “Jesus said to him:
00:26:37 “‘What do you want me to do for you?’
00:26:41 “The blind man said to him: ‘Rabboni,
00:26:45 “let me recover my sight.’
00:26:48 “And Jesus said to him: ‘Go.
00:26:51 “Your faith has made you well.’
00:26:54 “And immediately he recovered his sight,
00:26:57 and he began to follow Jesus on the road.”
00:27:03 “What do you want me to do for you?”
00:27:07 The same question is in both accounts
00:27:09 but very different situations.
00:27:14 Why do you think Jesus asked this question?
00:27:18 Well, he accomplished
00:27:20 at least four things.
00:27:23 What were they?
00:27:25 Well, first of all,
00:27:27 he dignified his audience
00:27:30 by encouraging communication.
00:27:35 Number two,
00:27:37 he allowed his audience to reveal
00:27:40 what was in his or her heart
00:27:44 to put it on the table, as it were.
00:27:50 In his dealings with James and John,
00:27:53 the question actually protected Jesus
00:27:57 and gave him an opportunity
00:28:00 to give those two apostles
00:28:02 a valuable lesson in modesty:
00:28:06 ‘This matter of giving the right and left places
00:28:09 in the Kingdom is not mine to give.’
00:28:14 Finally, in the case of Bartimaeus,
00:28:17 would you agree that the question
00:28:20 provided an opportunity to strengthen Bartimaeus’ faith
00:28:24 and to give him effective assistance,
00:28:28 allowing Bartimaeus to articulate his desire?
00:28:33 “What do you want?”
00:28:35 And then to experience the immediate realization
00:28:39 would have left no doubt in Bartimaeus’ mind
00:28:42 that he had been considered.
00:28:44 And how did it affect him?
00:28:47 Well, the account says: “He began to follow [Jesus]
00:28:51 on the road.”
00:28:53 It’s a beautiful example
00:28:56 of asking a question
00:28:59 that helps you to share your gift.
00:29:05 When I was a newly appointed circuit overseer,
00:29:08 the elders in a congregation that I was serving
00:29:11 expressed concern about a sister
00:29:14 who was missing meetings.
00:29:16 They asked me if I would be willing to make a shepherding visit.
00:29:19 Of course, I was happy to do that.
00:29:22 The arrangements were made.
00:29:24 Another elder accompanied me,
00:29:27 and I shared all of the appropriate verses
00:29:31 about meeting attendance.
00:29:33 The sister listened,
00:29:36 and as we were leaving, she looked me in the eye,
00:29:39 and she said, “You don’t have a clue.”
00:29:45 At the time, I thought she was being disrespectful.
00:29:49 But as I thought about it,
00:29:52 I came to wish that instead of showing up
00:29:55 with all the appropriate verses,
00:29:58 I had showed up with all of the appropriate questions.
00:30:03 “What do you want me to do for you?”
00:30:07 “How may I help?”
00:30:09 “What’s been happening in your life?”
00:30:13 Those kinds of questions
00:30:16 allow you to render meaningful assistance.
00:30:20 I learned from that experience.
00:30:23 I hope you can learn from my mistake.
00:30:27 Don’t make the mistake of thinking
00:30:29 you know what a person wants or needs.
00:30:33 Jesus did know, and he still asked.
00:30:40 Questions
00:30:42 —they dignify the audience;
00:30:45 they allow your listener to reveal what is in his or her heart.
00:30:50 It may protect you,
00:30:53 and it allows you to render meaningful assistance.
00:30:57 Approach your assignment
00:31:00 the way Jesus approached his.
00:31:03 “What do you want me to do for you?”
00:31:06 If you do,
00:31:08 not only will you effectively share your gift,
00:31:12 you will be a gift wherever you serve.
00:31:18 Thank you, Brother Hyatt,
00:31:20 for opening our eyes to Jesus’ question:
00:31:23 “What do you want me to do for you?”
00:31:29 You will now enjoy Brother Alex Reinmueller,
00:31:32 a helper to the Publishing Committee, with the “inspiring” subject
00:31:37 “Let Jehovah Inspire You.”
00:31:43 Have you ever had an important decision suddenly thrust on you?
00:31:47 You thought you knew the right thing to do.
00:31:50 But as soon as you decide, you start having second thoughts
00:31:53 —maybe even regrets— and now you can’t stop thinking,
00:31:58 ‘Did I do the right thing?’
00:32:00 This tendency to repeat a thought
00:32:03 over and over again is called rumination.
00:32:06 And when those thoughts make us feel anxious,
00:32:09 it can be bad for our health.
00:32:11 Some of you students
00:32:13 made tough decisions before you came to this class.
00:32:16 Thank you for that.
00:32:18 And everyone right now is faced
00:32:20 with challenging decisions every day.
00:32:23 So, what can we do
00:32:25 to stop anxious rumination once it starts?
00:32:29 Well, open your Bibles with me to Psalm 37:5,
00:32:33 and notice the advice that is given to us here:
00:32:38 “Commit your way to Jehovah;
00:32:42 “rely on him,
00:32:44 and he will act in your behalf.”
00:32:47 Now, the word for “commit” here
00:32:50 literally means “to roll, or remove, something from our life.”
00:32:54 So as the footnote says,
00:32:56 we need to “roll [our] way
00:32:58 [our concerns, our anxieties] upon” Jehovah.
00:33:02 When we ruminate anxiously,
00:33:05 we’re holding on to our problem,
00:33:08 but the Bible says that through prayer,
00:33:10 we have to take the problem off our shoulders
00:33:13 and put it on Jehovah’s.
00:33:15 In other words, we no longer act as if the burden is ours.
00:33:20 We need to leave it in his hands.
00:33:23 It sounds so simple, but at times, it’s hard to do.
00:33:28 So, what can help us when we have trouble letting go?
00:33:32 Well, our suggestion today
00:33:35 is to let Jehovah inspire you with awe.
00:33:39 Now, to inspire someone means to make them feel
00:33:43 that they want to do something and can do it.
00:33:46 And it may be that Jehovah gave us the emotion of awe
00:33:50 for that very purpose.
00:33:52 You may be wondering now, How can awe help me?
00:33:56 Well, open your Bibles again,
00:33:59 this time to Genesis chapter 28.
00:34:02 And let’s look at an example together
00:34:05 that illustrates how this can work.
00:34:08 In verse 10,
00:34:10 we catch up with the patriarch Jacob.
00:34:13 He’s on the road.
00:34:14 Notice it says: “Jacob departed from Beer-sheba
00:34:19 and kept going toward Haran.”
00:34:21 Why was he going there?
00:34:24 Well, the main reason was to get away from his brother, Esau.
00:34:27 Why?
00:34:28 Because Jacob had just made a tough decision.
00:34:32 And Esau was mad.
00:34:34 You know the story.
00:34:36 For most of his life, Esau despised the family birthright,
00:34:41 and that upset Jacob very much.
00:34:44 So at some point, he purchased the birthright from him.
00:34:48 Years go by, and then one day,
00:34:51 their father, Isaac, is getting ready to bless Esau as the firstborn.
00:34:56 Can you picture the scene?
00:34:58 What was Jacob going to do?
00:35:02 It’s not possible today to know all the factors
00:35:05 that influenced Isaac, Rebekah, and Jacob back then.
00:35:09 But the fact is,
00:35:11 Jacob’s decision put a strain on the whole family.
00:35:15 Esau began plotting to kill his brother,
00:35:19 and that’s why Jacob was on the road.
00:35:22 Do you think he might have been ruminating
00:35:25 a bit that day on what happened?
00:35:27 Did he perhaps have second thoughts?
00:35:30 Was he asking himself: ‘Did I do the right thing?
00:35:34 ‘Was it OK to fool my father?
00:35:37 What does Jehovah think of me now?’
00:35:40 Those would have been reasonable questions.
00:35:43 Of course, we don’t know what Jacob was thinking.
00:35:46 But if he was having second thoughts,
00:35:49 what happened next
00:35:51 must have helped him to stop ruminating on them.
00:35:54 Notice what we read in verses 11 and 12:
00:35:58 “In time
00:36:01 “he came to a place
00:36:03 “and prepared to spend the night there because the sun had set.
00:36:06 “So he took one of the stones of that place
00:36:09 “and set it to rest his head on and lay down there.
00:36:13 “Then he had a dream, and look!
00:36:17 “there was a stairway set on the earth,
00:36:19 “and its top reached up to the heavens;
00:36:23 “and there were God’s angels ascending
00:36:26 and descending on it.”
00:36:29 Now, this heavenly ladder
00:36:32 may have looked like a rising flight of stones
00:36:35 like the one you see here in this illustration.
00:36:38 Jacob could see now that he was not alone.
00:36:43 He was a small part
00:36:45 of an awesome organization.
00:36:48 And there is communication
00:36:50 between the different parts of that organization.
00:36:53 Angels minister in some important way
00:36:57 between Jehovah and humans who have his approval.
00:37:01 And there was more.
00:37:03 Let’s continue in verse 13:
00:37:05 “And look!
00:37:07 “there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he said:
00:37:12 “‘I am Jehovah the God of Abraham
00:37:15 “‘your father and the God of Isaac.
00:37:18 “‘The land on which you are lying,
00:37:20 “‘to you I am going to give it
00:37:23 and to your offspring.’”
00:37:26 How comforting those words must have been to Jacob!
00:37:31 Jehovah wasn’t displeased with him.
00:37:34 Quite the contrary.
00:37:35 He promised to bless Jacob in a marvelous way.
00:37:40 Jehovah apparently used this awesome experience
00:37:44 to help Jacob to let go of any anxiety he might have had.
00:37:49 As long as he continued to do his best,
00:37:52 Jacob could trust Jehovah to do the rest.
00:37:56 What a relief!
00:37:58 Notice his reaction in verse 17:
00:38:02 “And he grew fearful and added:
00:38:05 “‘How awe-inspiring this place is!
00:38:09 “‘This can only be the house of God,
00:38:12 and this is the gate of the heavens.’”
00:38:16 Jacob’s relief here is almost palpable.
00:38:19 He is no longer conflicted.
00:38:21 The vision inspires him
00:38:23 to make a vow of loyalty to Jehovah forever.
00:38:27 You can read what he did and said
00:38:29 in the latter part of this chapter.
00:38:32 Now, verse 17
00:38:35 uses the same Hebrew word twice.
00:38:38 The first time it’s translated as “fearful,”
00:38:42 the second time as “awe-inspiring,”
00:38:46 and that may be
00:38:48 because awe is a surprising emotion.
00:38:52 It’s a wonderful mix
00:38:54 of inspiration and fear.
00:38:57 You sense you’re in the presence of someone
00:39:00 or something greater than yourself,
00:39:03 but it makes you feel small in a good way.
00:39:07 Awe can humble you, and that shifts your thinking.
00:39:11 It helps you to see things as they are
00:39:15 and not as you expect them to be.
00:39:17 It’s the kind of fear Proverbs 1:7 says
00:39:21 “is the beginning of knowledge,” or wisdom,
00:39:25 and that may be why at times
00:39:28 Jehovah evokes awe in us.
00:39:31 Like Jacob,
00:39:33 people often say they feel more centered
00:39:36 and spiritual after an awesome experience.
00:39:39 Awe seems to pull us out of ourselves.
00:39:43 It connects us on a deeper level with Jehovah,
00:39:47 and it reconnects us with what is most important
00:39:52 —Jehovah’s sovereignty,
00:39:54 his creation, and his people.
00:39:58 Now, getting away from Esau did not end Jacob’s problems.
00:40:03 There were other times in his life
00:40:05 when he again became very anxious and afraid,
00:40:09 but true to his word,
00:40:12 Jehovah was always there.
00:40:15 As long as Jacob was faithful,
00:40:17 Jehovah made sure he would succeed.
00:40:21 Twenty years later, when Jacob returned to Canaan with his family,
00:40:26 Jehovah sent out a company of angels to greet him.
00:40:30 How awesome was that!
00:40:34 Well, what does all of this mean then for you and me?
00:40:38 Psalm 89:7 says
00:40:41 that Jehovah is “awe-inspiring
00:40:44 to all [those] around him.”
00:40:48 If you’ve ever hiked in Banff National Park
00:40:53 or walked in Muir Woods
00:40:57 or felt goose bumps as you looked up into the night sky,
00:41:01 you know what awe feels like.
00:41:04 You’ve experienced
00:41:06 Jehovah inspiring you.
00:41:09 So the next time you need to get out of your head,
00:41:13 remember awe.
00:41:15 Take a walk in the woods;
00:41:17 sing your favorite Kingdom song.
00:41:20 Awe may be the most underutilized way we know
00:41:24 to help us to stop ruminating on anxious thoughts
00:41:28 and fully commit our way to Jehovah.
00:41:33 Don’t let your problems stress you out.
00:41:36 Do your research, pray for guidance,
00:41:40 make the best decision you can,
00:41:42 and then let Jehovah
00:41:46 inspire you with awe.
00:41:51 We enjoyed that presentation, Alex.
00:41:54 Now we have one of the Gilead instructors,
00:41:57 Brother Trent Lippold,
00:41:59 with the somewhat cryptic theme
00:42:03 “Mark Your Meribah.”
00:42:06 Brother Lippold, what do you mean by that?
00:42:10 He did not miss the sign the first time,
00:42:13 but the second time, it meant his life.
00:42:17 He was Moses.
00:42:19 Our lives are full of signposts
00:42:21 —figurative markers for lessons,
00:42:24 memories, experiences.
00:42:26 Some good, some bad.
00:42:28 Some signposts we erect;
00:42:30 others are put up for us.
00:42:32 In either case, they should help us
00:42:36 to continue in life successfully.
00:42:38 For instance, consider a lesson
00:42:41 —a signpost— in the life of Moses.
00:42:45 It happened shortly after the crossing of the Red Sea,
00:42:48 and it’s recorded in Exodus chapter 17.
00:42:50 At a place called Rephidim,
00:42:52 the Israelites gathered and there was Moses
00:42:55 by a crag with his staff
00:42:58 and with a quarreling nation.
00:43:01 The events there at Rephidim
00:43:03 provided a significant lesson for Moses
00:43:06 —something to remember for future circumstances.
00:43:09 And so he marked that spot.
00:43:12 How did he do it?
00:43:14 He changed the name from Rephidim,
00:43:17 which means “Refresh,”
00:43:19 to Meribah, which means “Quarreling.”
00:43:23 Little did Moses know
00:43:25 that that name would ring in his ears.
00:43:28 Thirty-nine years later, at a place called Kadesh,
00:43:32 Moses was again near a crag with his staff
00:43:37 and with a quarreling nation before him.
00:43:40 And based on the events that happened there,
00:43:44 look at what is recorded at Numbers 20:12, 13.
00:43:50 At Numbers 20:12, 13, we read:
00:43:54 “Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron:
00:43:57 “‘Because you did not show faith in me
00:44:00 “‘and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel,
00:44:04 “‘you will not bring this congregation
00:44:07 “into the land that I will give them.’
00:44:10 “These are the waters of Meribah,
00:44:13 “where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah,
00:44:16 so that he was sanctified among them.”
00:44:19 Moses is taught a lesson here.
00:44:21 It’s unclear who exactly named the place Meribah,
00:44:25 but Moses did record that these were “the waters of Meribah”
00:44:30 —an unforgettable signpost in Moses’ life.
00:44:33 What it meant to Moses was very clear.
00:44:37 So, what now?
00:44:39 What would Moses do following this?
00:44:42 Well, from verse 14 (if we were to read it),
00:44:44 we would see that Moses carried on with his assignment.
00:44:47 He continued to lead the Israelites.
00:44:49 He led them against the Kings Sihon and Og.
00:44:52 He began to see Jehovah’s mighty arm of power
00:44:54 as they drew closer and closer to the Promised Land.
00:44:58 And in his enthusiasm,
00:45:00 Moses makes one request of Jehovah.
00:45:03 He turns to him, and we can read his words
00:45:06 at Deuteronomy 3:25, 26.
00:45:10 Moses’ words in verse 25, he writes:
00:45:14 “‘Please let me pass over and see the good land
00:45:18 “that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous region and Lebanon.’
00:45:24 “But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you,
00:45:29 “and he would not listen to me.
00:45:32 “Rather, Jehovah said to me, ‘Enough from you!
00:45:36 Never speak to me again about this matter.’”
00:45:41 “Jehovah was still furious with me because of you.”
00:45:46 Meribah—that’s what Moses was referring to.
00:45:51 The signpost was clear for Moses.
00:45:53 How would Moses respond to this?
00:45:58 What would he do?
00:46:00 Well, Moses carried on.
00:46:02 He got back to work, back to business.
00:46:05 He wasn’t finished.
00:46:06 He continued to lead and shepherd the nation.
00:46:09 He prepared Joshua to be his successor.
00:46:12 And he worked along until Jehovah
00:46:15 came to Moses and said to him,
00:46:17 “Moses, it’s time to go to the mountain.”
00:46:20 In other words, it was time for Moses’ death.
00:46:23 Read, please, Jehovah’s words to Moses
00:46:26 at Deuteronomy 32:51, 52.
00:46:30 Beginning in verse 51 of Deuteronomy chapter 32,
00:46:35 we read Jehovah’s words:
00:46:37 “Because both of you [that is, Moses and Aaron]
00:46:42 “were unfaithful to me among the Israelites
00:46:46 “at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh
00:46:49 “in the wilderness of Zin,
00:46:51 “because you did not sanctify me before the people of Israel.
00:46:55 “You will see the land from a distance,
00:46:57 but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.”
00:47:03 Jehovah draws Moses’ attention back to Meribah.
00:47:08 What effect did this have on Moses
00:47:12 when Jehovah referred to Meribah again?
00:47:15 Well, think of this:
00:47:17 After Jehovah’s refusal
00:47:20 to reconsider his judgment on Moses,
00:47:22 Moses continued fully dedicated to his assignment.
00:47:25 In fact, the details make up the book of Deuteronomy.
00:47:30 If you look at what happened
00:47:32 shortly before Jehovah’s words here in chapter 32,
00:47:35 we find that Moses recited a beautiful song of praise to Jehovah
00:47:40 following Jehovah’s words.
00:47:43 In chapter 33, we find Moses here
00:47:45 giving a blessing for the nation of Israel.
00:47:48 Do you see what happened to Moses?
00:47:51 Moses marked the lessons and experiences in his life,
00:47:54 like Meribah.
00:47:56 He was not paralyzed or broken by disappointment.
00:48:00 Rather, his resolve to serve Jehovah faithfully
00:48:05 was strengthened.
00:48:07 What helped Moses?
00:48:10 How did he do it?
00:48:12 Consider at least two things that may have helped Moses.
00:48:15 Number one: Moses’ intimate friendship with Jehovah.
00:48:20 For example, why would Moses
00:48:24 even ask Jehovah
00:48:26 to reconsider his judgment on him?
00:48:29 Because Moses knew Jehovah intimately.
00:48:32 He knew him to be “a God merciful and compassionate”
00:48:35 and “abundant in loving-kindness.”
00:48:38 And when Jehovah refused to reconsider,
00:48:42 Moses did not say a word.
00:48:45 Why?
00:48:47 Because Moses knew that Jehovah
00:48:49 was also a God ‘perfect in his activity
00:48:52 and that all his ways are justice.’
00:48:55 You see, from Moses’ example, we see
00:48:57 that the more intimate our friendship is with Jehovah,
00:49:00 the more intimately he can teach us and train us.
00:49:04 And thus, like Moses, it will be easier to get past disappointment
00:49:09 and continue in our assignment faithful and joyful.
00:49:14 Consider a second thing that may have helped Moses,
00:49:17 and that was Job.
00:49:19 Remember, Moses wrote the book of Job
00:49:23 around 1473 B.C.E., around the same time as the events
00:49:26 that took place at Meribah of Kadesh.
00:49:30 The words are fresh in his mind.
00:49:34 Moses knew how Jehovah dealt with Job.
00:49:38 For example, at Job 38:3, Jehovah said to Job:
00:49:43 “Brace yourself, please, like a man; I will question you.”
00:49:47 Moses knew how Job responded to his problems
00:49:51 and to Jehovah’s correction.
00:49:53 For example, at Job 40:4, Job said to Jehovah:
00:49:57 “I put my hand over my mouth.”
00:50:00 And Moses also knew the final outcome
00:50:03 of the matters with Job.
00:50:06 Therefore, Moses was able to see
00:50:09 his own difficulties and his own disappointments
00:50:13 through the prism of universal sovereignty,
00:50:16 and that gave Moses perspective.
00:50:19 So take advantage of the inspired words of God
00:50:23 at your disposal.
00:50:25 Meditate deeply on the experiences
00:50:27 of Jehovah’s faithful servants
00:50:29 —like Job and like Moses.
00:50:33 These examples will give you perspective
00:50:36 and allow you to move on joyfully.
00:50:40 Brothers and sisters, the simple truth is that
00:50:43 in our life of service to God,
00:50:45 we may be treated unfairly
00:50:48 and we will likely be disappointed at times.
00:50:51 Our expectations may not be met,
00:50:54 and we will respond poorly at times.
00:50:57 Mark the moment as a lesson in life—a Meribah.
00:51:02 And if —as was the case with Moses—
00:51:04 Jehovah marks it for you, be grateful.
00:51:08 Do not be paralyzed or broken by disappointment.
00:51:12 Like Moses, fix in mind what you have to do.
00:51:16 Allow the experience or the lesson
00:51:18 to strengthen your resolve to serve Jehovah faithfully and joyfully.
00:51:23 You can—if you mark your Meribah.
00:51:31 And now we know what you meant by the theme
00:51:34 “Mark Your Meribah.”
00:51:37 And speaking of “Mark,” we will now listen to Mark Noumair,
00:51:42 another Gilead instructor,
00:51:44 with the theme “From Strength to Strength.”
00:51:49 It’s all yours, Brother Noumair.
00:51:53 Today, it’s a privilege to address you
00:51:57 —a very precious group of people.
00:52:00 Your journey to this day has not been an easy one.
00:52:04 In this talk, we want to focus on a specific journey
00:52:09 —the one that began when you were invited to Gilead
00:52:12 up to your first day in class.
00:52:15 Because of the lockdown, that journey brought you unexpected trials
00:52:20 unknown to previous classes of Gilead.
00:52:23 Along the way, you said many prayers
00:52:25 and even shed some tears.
00:52:28 But instead of giving into despair (we’re so proud of you),
00:52:32 you became stronger.
00:52:35 Your journey can be compared
00:52:37 to the journey of a Levite,
00:52:40 as described in Psalm 84.
00:52:42 Let’s open our Bibles to Psalm 84.
00:52:47 We’re going to review the man’s musings
00:52:50 as he traveled from his home to Jehovah’s temple
00:52:54 —Psalm 84.
00:52:56 And as we do, we will learn what it means
00:52:59 to find strength in Jehovah
00:53:02 and what will help you to continue to go
00:53:04 “from strength to strength.”
00:53:07 So we can begin at verse 5:
00:53:12 “Happy are the men
00:53:14 who find their strength in you.”
00:53:18 Now, what does this mean?
00:53:21 To find strength means you have to be looking for it.
00:53:25 So we look to Jehovah for strength.
00:53:28 How do we do that?
00:53:30 We do that by prayer and focus.
00:53:35 When we pray, we pray to Jehovah for his holy spirit
00:53:40 and focus on him.
00:53:42 He gives us strength.
00:53:44 Now, at first, this strength may be just enough
00:53:47 to start a difficult journey,
00:53:49 such as you started when you received your invitation to Gilead.
00:53:54 But as the journey continues, you’ll become stronger
00:53:59 if you take the right approach.
00:54:01 Well, what is that approach?
00:54:04 Well, let’s read on, and we’ll go to verse 6:
00:54:09 “When they pass through the Baca Valley,
00:54:12 “they make it into a place of springs;
00:54:15 and the early rain clothes it with blessings.”
00:54:20 There were many routes to travel to get to Jerusalem,
00:54:24 but this Levite speaks of traveling
00:54:26 through the Baca Valley,
00:54:29 and that’s not the scenic route.
00:54:32 The Baca Valley was a dry,
00:54:34 desolate, parched area.
00:54:37 In fact, the word “baca” comes from a Hebrew word to “weep.”
00:54:41 It seems that the baca plant exuded a type of milky sap,
00:54:45 giving the appearance of tears, which added to the gloominess
00:54:49 of this parched land.
00:54:51 There may also have been literal tears shed
00:54:54 as ones made their long journey to Jerusalem.
00:54:58 But notice, notice what this Levite was able to do
00:55:03 as he walked through this valley.
00:55:06 There, he says in verse 6:
00:55:08 “They make it into a place of springs;
00:55:11 and the early rain clothes it with blessings.”
00:55:16 You see, this Levite was so focused
00:55:18 on the joy that he would have worshipping at the temple
00:55:22 that, as he walked through the dry, desolate Baca Valley,
00:55:27 this scenery along the way looked attractive to him.
00:55:31 He was able to look at this dried up valley with eyes of faith
00:55:36 and make it into a place of water springs.
00:55:39 Now, how was that possible?
00:55:42 Well, it’s like when a brother once described
00:55:45 his trip to the house of a sister he was courting.
00:55:49 It involved getting on dirty buses, crowded subways,
00:55:53 and walking past dingy apartments.
00:55:56 But to him, the whole trip was a beautiful scene
00:56:00 because it was taking him to visit her.
00:56:05 Similarly, the Levite of Psalm 84
00:56:08 could see past the gloominess around him
00:56:11 and see Jehovah’s blessings ahead.
00:56:14 He was energized by thinking
00:56:17 about his privilege of actually serving at Jehovah’s temple
00:56:21 to the point where even the Baca Valley was beautiful to him,
00:56:25 because it led to the place
00:56:28 he most wanted to be.
00:56:31 And with that in focus, notice what happens.
00:56:35 Let’s read verse 7:
00:56:39 “They will walk on from strength to strength;
00:56:44 “each one appears before God
00:56:47 in Zion.”
00:56:50 Now, what does that mean —“strength to strength”?
00:56:54 Though the Levite may have entered the valley of tears
00:56:57 weak under the weight of his problems,
00:56:59 love for true worship fueled every step taken.
00:57:04 He knew his service would be noticed by Jehovah,
00:57:08 who would bless his whole-souled effort to serve him.
00:57:12 That was the initial strength from Jehovah that he had.
00:57:17 But when he finally arrived at the temple,
00:57:21 the joy of actually appearing
00:57:24 before Jehovah God —that joy—
00:57:27 and having his approval and blessing
00:57:29 empowered him and it energized him
00:57:33 to walk from the strength that Jehovah initially gives
00:57:37 to even greater strength.
00:57:40 In other words, it made him an even stronger person
00:57:43 than he was before beginning the journey.
00:57:49 Now, for you students,
00:57:52 your journey to Gilead was different from others.
00:57:55 You did not take the scenic route.
00:57:58 But in Jehovah’s strength,
00:58:01 you were able to look beyond the four walls of quarantine,
00:58:05 beyond the lockdown,
00:58:07 beyond the start of class being postponed.
00:58:10 You looked beyond the dry, parched ground of the Baca Valley,
00:58:14 and you saw Jehovah’s blessing on his people.
00:58:18 As the Governing Body gave faithful and discreet direction
00:58:22 to the worldwide brotherhood, you were right here.
00:58:25 You watched it personally.
00:58:28 So though you may have arrived here weakened by your personal trials
00:58:33 after walking through your figurative Baca Valley,
00:58:36 in Jehovah’s strength you came out stronger
00:58:41 and ready to appear —to appear before Jehovah God
00:58:45 to be trained by his organization.
00:58:49 And then, it was finally announced
00:58:53 that the school would start in August.
00:58:57 And I remember —I remember the day
00:59:00 when you walked into the classroom for the first time,
00:59:04 and you sat in your seats,
00:59:06 and you opened up your student binder.
00:59:08 You put your Bible on the desk,
00:59:11 and as you looked up, your eyes revealed,
00:59:14 ‘I made it to my journey.’
00:59:19 And class began, day after day.
00:59:23 It is noteworthy that, in Jehovah’s strength,
00:59:26 not one of you —not one of you missed a day of class.
00:59:30 That is to your credit.
00:59:32 You wanted to learn every day.
00:59:34 You took advantage of every opportunity.
00:59:37 Thank you for the zeal that you showed.
00:59:41 So, yes, remember the lessons from class.
00:59:45 We know you will.
00:59:48 But, also, remember the lesson from your journey
00:59:52 as you take on new assignments in the future.
00:59:56 See past the challenges along the way;
00:59:59 see past the disappointments; see past the tears.
01:00:03 Turn your Baca Valley into a spring,
01:00:07 and you will become stronger for it.
01:00:10 You can do this through prayer.
01:00:14 You can do this by praying to Jehovah
01:00:17 for his spirit and focusing on him.
01:00:21 Remember that the end goal
01:00:23 is not the assignment in itself.
01:00:27 The assignment is just a means to experience your real goal
01:00:32 of having and maintaining Jehovah’s blessing.
01:00:35 If you prayerfully keep that in focus,
01:00:38 Jehovah will completely change your outlook
01:00:41 regarding the challenges in front of you.
01:00:45 The parched land becomes streams of water.
01:00:47 The tears of pain become tears of joy.
01:00:50 You will see Jehovah make you walk on
01:00:54 “from strength to strength”
01:00:56 —from the initial strength Jehovah gives
01:00:59 to becoming an ever stronger servant of his.
01:01:03 He will empower you not only to walk through the valley of hardships
01:01:08 but you will be that much more ready
01:01:11 for whatever work lies ahead.
01:01:13 You will be in a much better position
01:01:16 to appear before Jehovah your God
01:01:19 and enjoy his favor.
01:01:22 So in conclusion,
01:01:25 take the Baca Valley route through all your challenges.
01:01:29 There is a wise saying:
01:01:31 “A calm sea never made a good sailor.”
01:01:35 Likewise, don’t trade hardships for comfort,
01:01:39 because you will feel a closeness to your heavenly Father
01:01:42 in a way that you never would have experienced
01:01:45 if you hadn’t walked from “strength to strength”
01:01:49 through the valley of Baca.
01:01:53 That was so encouraging!
01:01:55 Soon, Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation
01:01:59 will be available on jw.org.
01:02:03 We know that you’re eager to see the presentation in its entirety.
01:02:08 To conclude,
01:02:09 let’s visit Ireland.
01:02:11 The land is known as the Emerald Isle
01:02:14 for its variety of lush green landscapes.
01:02:18 It stretches from the Cliffs of Moher
01:02:21 to the gentle valleys of Healy Pass
01:02:24 to the Mourne Mountains in the north.
01:02:27 The white wool of sheep spot these grassy hills and valleys,
01:02:32 but it was a different kind of sheep
01:02:35 that brought C. T. Russell in 1891.
01:02:39 It was the first stop in his tour of Europe.
01:02:43 He traveled here some seven times
01:02:45 over a period of 20 years
01:02:47 and was often met by large crowds.
01:02:51 Today, people are still seeking truth in Ireland.
01:02:54 They desire to serve Jehovah
01:02:55 with their whole heart
01:02:57 and find a way to symbolize their dedication
01:03:00 in line with COVID-19 guidelines.
01:03:03 Our brothers and sisters make efforts
01:03:06 to reach everyone with the good news,
01:03:08 including those who speak the traditional Irish language.
01:03:13 Out of the millions here, a relatively small percentage
01:03:16 speak Irish as their native tongue.
01:03:19 They’re usually found in close-knit communities
01:03:21 that value traditional culture.
01:03:24 Despite the challenges, local publishers find success preaching.
01:03:29 This includes our brothers and sisters in the Castlebar Irish Pregroup,
01:03:34 who were excited to have a share in the global campaign
01:03:37 in November 2020.
01:03:40 Adding to the excitement, the campaign featured
01:03:43 the very first Irish-language Watchtower.
01:03:47 Since young ones are required to learn Irish in school,
01:03:50 they are eager to apply their language skills in the ministry.
01:03:55 Their enthusiasm spurs others on.
01:03:58 The brothers and sisters
01:03:59 in the Castlebar Irish Pregroup
01:04:01 send their love and greetings
01:04:03 to the worldwide brotherhood.
01:04:06 From the World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:04:09 this is JW Broadcasting!

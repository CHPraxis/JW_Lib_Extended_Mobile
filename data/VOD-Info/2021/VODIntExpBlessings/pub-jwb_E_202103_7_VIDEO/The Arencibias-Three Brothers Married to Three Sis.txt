00:00:19 It was summertime, and a group
00:00:21 of brothers and sisters made arrangements
00:00:24 during vacation time to go to the beach.
00:00:26 And so during that time,
00:00:30 heading to the beach is where I met her.
00:00:32 I had met her sisters, but I had not met her.
00:00:36 My grandparents and my aunt
00:00:38 were a very important part
00:00:39 in raising me and my sisters.
00:00:43 They learned the truth first, in Ecuador.
00:00:45 We always lived close by.
00:00:47 I always went to visit them.
00:00:51 And they helped my parents in guiding me into the truth.
00:00:58 The first three or four years of our marriage,
00:01:00 we were about an hour and a half away from our family.
00:01:02 That was really hard on me because I’m close to my sisters.
00:01:06 So it was kind of hard being so far— To me that was really far.
00:01:09 I knew early on that one of the most important things
00:01:13 that I needed in a mate is someone who loves Jehovah.
00:01:17 And they always say—
00:01:18 I remember my parents (and at the meetings) always said,
00:01:21 “Find someone who loves Jehovah more than they love you.”
00:01:23 And it’s easy to say that,
00:01:26 but then you find someone
00:01:28 and you realize that she loves Jehovah more than she loves you.
00:01:31 She has demonstrated it through our entire marriage.
00:01:34 When it comes to Jehovah, he’s first.
00:01:36 I think that is the key to a successful marriage.
00:01:41 I think the biggest challenge we went through in our marriage
00:01:44 was our first year in the circuit work.
00:01:46 It was hard enough moving 3,000 miles away from everyone
00:01:49 and starting a new type of life.
00:01:51 Two months later, my grandfather dies;
00:01:54 six months right after that, my mother dies.
00:01:56 So after her mom died, my mom passed away.
00:02:00 It was one right after the other.
00:02:04 That was a difficult time for us
00:02:09 —all the pain and suffering
00:02:11 from losing our moms and loved ones.
00:02:15 Many times we felt that we could not continue.
00:02:20 It was overwhelming.
00:02:25 The period of time was eight months
00:02:29 and ten days between the death of Mimi’s mom and my mom.
00:02:42 The threefold cord is a routine in which Jehovah is included
00:02:45 in the marriage
00:02:47 —from reading the Bible together,
00:02:49 to going in the ministry together,
00:02:51 to doing everyday things together.
00:02:54 And as you do this, Jehovah is present in your marriage.
00:02:59 We always think that it’s our Bible reading.
00:03:02 Actually, we don’t think—we realize
00:03:04 that our Bible reading is very important for us.
00:03:06 We pick a book; we start reading it, and we know
00:03:09 that is what keeps us together.
00:03:14 We were both already pioneering before we got married.
00:03:16 And when we got married,
00:03:18 we just figured out a way to continue pioneering together
00:03:22 to make sure to start our spiritual careers together.
00:03:27 So we have to always depend on Jehovah,
00:03:29 which is the best Person to always depend on.
00:03:32 We spent a lot of time by ourselves,
00:03:35 driving from city to city and from state to state.
00:03:38 We had plenty of time to reflect, to talk,
00:03:41 and to draw close to each other
00:03:43 —to not only rely on Jehovah but also to be closer between us
00:03:48 and to spend more time
00:03:51 talking about the visits,
00:03:54 talking about the friends, and talking about how we feel.
00:03:57 I think that at the end it was the toughest assignment,
00:04:01 but it was the most rewarding
00:04:03 of all the assignments we had had
00:04:05 in all these years in the traveling work.
00:04:07 Because it’s the three of us and Jehovah’s an equal part of our marriage,
00:04:12 it doesn’t matter what we go through
00:04:14 —whether it’s Peter or I that’s having a little bit of a struggle—
00:04:17 because Jehovah is there.
00:04:19 He’s going to keep us united and strong.
00:04:21 And also, it’s not just in the things we do while we worship.
00:04:26 Yes, we worship together,
00:04:28 but it’s also all the other things that we do Jehovah’s way.
00:04:32 We’re best friends, and we enjoy spending time together
00:04:34 outside of service and the meetings.
00:04:37 We like doing fun things outside. We like the outdoors.
00:04:42 When we’re facing a difficult challenge, we will go to Jehovah in prayer together
00:04:46 and specifically pray, “Jehovah, help us with this challenge.”
00:04:51 Our assignments have helped us
00:04:53 to always be with each other because we have the same goals in mind.
00:04:56 We’re working together
00:04:58 for the same purpose.
00:05:00 So the same schedule —spiritual schedule—
00:05:03 has really helped us to go through these challenging periods in our life.
00:05:08 Knowing that Jehovah is our Creator, the Sovereign Being
00:05:13 —he’s the one who should tell us what to do.
00:05:15 And there is an arrangement, and when you follow his arrangement,
00:05:18 there’s happiness; there’s success.
00:05:22 We’re in an imperfect world,
00:05:25 but his arrangement works, and we have felt it.

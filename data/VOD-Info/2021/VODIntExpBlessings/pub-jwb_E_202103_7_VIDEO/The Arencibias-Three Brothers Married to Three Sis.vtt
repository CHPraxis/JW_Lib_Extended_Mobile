00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:21.750 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was summertime, and a group

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters made arrangements

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during vacation time to go to the beach.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so during that time,

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heading to the beach is where I met her.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had met her sisters, but I had not met her.

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:38.601 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My grandparents and my aunt

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:39.977 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were a very important part

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:43.272 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in raising me and my sisters.

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned the truth first, in Ecuador.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always lived close by.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always went to visit them.

00:00:51.405 --> 00:00:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they helped my parents
in guiding me into the truth.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.247 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first three or four years of our marriage,

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:02.333 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were about an hour and a half away from our family.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was really hard on me
because I’m close to my sisters.

00:01:06.128 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was kind of hard being so far—
To me that was really far.

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:13.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew early on
that one of the most important things

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I needed in a mate
is someone who loves Jehovah.

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they always say—

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:21.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember my parents
(and at the meetings) always said,

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find someone
who loves Jehovah more than they love you.”

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:26.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s easy to say that,

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then you find someone

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:31.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you realize that she
loves Jehovah more than she loves you.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She has demonstrated it
through our entire marriage.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to Jehovah, he’s first.

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that is the key
to a successful marriage.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think the biggest challenge
we went through in our marriage

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was our first year in the circuit work.

00:01:46.627 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard enough
moving 3,000 miles away from everyone

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting a new type of life.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two months later, my grandfather dies;

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
six months right after that, my mother dies.

00:01:56.136 --> 00:01:58.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after her mom died, my mom passed away.

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:02.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was one right after the other.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a difficult time for us

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all the pain and suffering

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:15.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from losing our moms and loved ones.

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:20.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times we felt
that we could not continue.

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:23.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was overwhelming.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The period of time
was eight months

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ten days between the death
of Mimi’s mom and my mom.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The threefold cord is a routine
in which Jehovah is included

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the marriage

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from reading the Bible together,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to going in the ministry together,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to doing everyday things together.

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you do this,
Jehovah is present in your marriage.

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always think that it’s our Bible reading.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, we don’t think—we realize

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our Bible reading
is very important for us.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pick a book;
we start reading it, and we know

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is what keeps us together.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were both already pioneering
before we got married.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we got married,

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just figured out a way
to continue pioneering together

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure
to start our spiritual careers together.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to always depend on Jehovah,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is the best Person to always depend on.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spent a lot of time by ourselves,

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:38.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
driving from city to city
and from state to state.

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had plenty of time to reflect, to talk,

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to draw close to each other

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to not only rely on Jehovah
but also to be closer between us 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to spend more time

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:54.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about the visits,

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talking about the friends,
and talking about how we feel.

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that at the end
it was the toughest assignment,

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:03.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was the most rewarding

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all the assignments we had had

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all these years in the traveling work.

00:04:07.726 --> 00:04:12.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it’s the three of us
and Jehovah’s an equal part of our marriage,

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:14.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t matter what we go through

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’s Peter or I
that’s having a little bit of a struggle—

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is there.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to keep us united and strong.

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:26.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, it’s not just
in the things we do while we worship.

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:28.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we worship together,

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:31.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also all the other things
that we do Jehovah’s way.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re best friends,
and we enjoy spending time together

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside of service and the meetings.

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We like doing fun things outside.
We like the outdoors.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re facing a difficult challenge,
we will go to Jehovah in prayer together

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and specifically pray,
“Jehovah, help us with this challenge.”

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our assignments have helped us

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to always be with each other
because we have the same goals in mind.

00:04:56.942 --> 00:04:58.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re working together

00:04:58.026 --> 00:05:00.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same purpose.

00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:03.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the same schedule
—spiritual schedule—

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has really helped us to go through
these challenging periods in our life.

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:13.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing that Jehovah is our Creator,
the Sovereign Being

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:15.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he’s the one who should tell us what to do.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there is an arrangement,
and when you follow his arrangement,

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s happiness; there’s success.

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in an imperfect world,

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his arrangement works,
and we have felt it.

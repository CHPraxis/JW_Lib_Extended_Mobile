00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:06.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started pioneering in 1978,
straight out of school.

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:08.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after 17 years,

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:12.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to stop because I could no longer meet
the hour requirement.

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one of the conventions, I saw

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:19.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some sisters interpreting the program
into sign language.

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:23.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I thought
that even if I couldn’t continue pioneering,

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could do something more
in Jehovah’s service

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning sign language,
and so I started to do that.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I was deeply grateful to Jehovah

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all he had done for me,

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I resumed pioneering again

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in September 2009.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I had the added blessing

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of now pioneering in the sign-language field.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day I met Cecilia.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She suffers from a genetic syndrome called

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usher Syndrome, which causes deafness

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:58.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with tunnel vision

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can, over time, lead to blindness.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of that disability,

00:01:04.502 --> 00:01:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made her extremely shy.

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:10.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was very difficult
to communicate with her.

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started studying with her

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in October 2009,

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very quickly
she started attending meetings.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:23.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would fetch her for the meetings
and then drop her off at home afterward.

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:26.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived about five minutes
from the Kingdom Hall,

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she was thirty minutes away.

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I quickly realized

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:35.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would also need to put in effort

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:38.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the meetings
in order to make progress.

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia lived close

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:43.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where she could catch a taxi

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
up to the train line,

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it would be two train journeys

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it would take her, each way,

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an hour and a half to two hours.

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:59.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also lived in a notoriously unsafe area

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:01.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of gang violence.

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:04.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew that Cecilia was

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong-willed enough and independent enough,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of her timidity and reticence,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to get herself to the meetings.

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:18.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia was attending meetings regularly.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:20.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But instead of a skirt,

00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:23.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
she wore pants to the meetings.

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:25.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I chatted to Nancy,

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:28.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sister who at the time was accompanying me

00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to her study most weeks,

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could try
and figure out a way of helping her

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the change she needed to make.

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:37.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took about a year

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:41.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of gently showing pictures

00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reviewing the Bible principles,

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but eventually she did get the point.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:48.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the weekends
that she was staying over,

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.275 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I went into her room,

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.735 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and on her bed, neatly laid out,

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:54.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was a skirt and top

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ready for the meeting.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:59.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thanked Jehovah at that point

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:03.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, finally,
our patience had been rewarded.

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:06.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all of our meetings on a Saturday

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a lunch break in between
when we would associate,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we noticed that Cecilia
was isolating herself.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reinforce for Cecilia

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:20.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the principle at Acts 20:35,

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:24.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friend came up with the good idea
of helping her

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:27.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bake cookies the day before the meeting.

00:03:27.145 --> 00:03:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia shyly offered the cookies
to each person there

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the lunch break,

00:03:33.318 --> 00:03:35.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it elicited such a warm response

00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the brothers and sisters
and friends there.

00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:41.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really drove home the point for Cecilia,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was beautiful to see her, after that,
come out of her shell.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2014,

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:53.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia gave her first student talk,

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:57.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in that month
she also started publishing.

00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:00.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There have been challenges, particularly

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with learning sign language
but even more so

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:08.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in getting to understand the deaf culture

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the way that they think—
and also financial hardships.

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:16.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the challenges and the sacrifices

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were far outweighed by the blessings.

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:23.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A day that’s etched in my memory

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the day that she told me
she wanted to get baptized.

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cecilia has really become
like a daughter to me,

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:35.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m so proud of the enormous strides
that she made in the truth.

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:40.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In October 2015, she was baptized,

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I cried with joy that day.

00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:46.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been pioneering now for 28 years.

00:04:46.725 --> 00:04:50.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And over that time,
particularly since I started again

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:52.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and with Cecilia),

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:57.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many, many, many brothers and sisters
in the congregation helped me.

00:04:57.152 --> 00:05:00.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They accompanied me to her study;

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they became friends with her;

00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:04.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they took over when I went away.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could never have done it on my own.

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Above all,

00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:12.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped me to cultivate qualities

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:16.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like patience, self-control,

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:18.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, compassion.

00:05:18.173 --> 00:05:22.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really wonderful to play a small part

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such a privilege—
to help Cecilia

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become part of Jehovah’s family.

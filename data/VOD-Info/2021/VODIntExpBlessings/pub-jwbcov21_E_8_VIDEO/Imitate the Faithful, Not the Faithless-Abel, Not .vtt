I arrived in a new city
during the rainy season.

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It rained all day every day
for a whole month.

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time,
there were only three publishers there.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first sister I met
was my new pioneer partner.

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:19.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first,
I felt as if the people in this territory

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoke a different language.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:25.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I tried to talk to some people
about the Bible, they did not like it

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When government officials

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
noticed that we had shared
some tracts with the people,

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they began to watch us
and followed us for about three months.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt overwhelmed by all of this
and became very anxious.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had few return visits
or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt lost.

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what to do or where to go.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I often wondered,
‘Father, why did you send me here?’

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like I had gone
from being on a mountain peak

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I studied the Bible

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how Jehovah
cared for his servants in the past.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read how Jehovah
told Jacob throughout his life:

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I will be with you wherever you go.’

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:21.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pictured Jehovah
telling me the same thing:

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just go,
and I will always be there to help you.’

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be balanced, to feel peace,
and to have courage

00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go out in the ministry.

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:38.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, Jehovah helped me 
to find a very good Bible student.

00:01:38.035 --> 00:01:42.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an absolutely wonderful
and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our small group joins
congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This arrangement is a valuable source
of spiritual food for me.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get together for meals
and association as well.

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The experiences on JW Broadcasting®

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me feel that I am not alone.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I always smile
and wave goodbye at the end.

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:04.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderful to be here.

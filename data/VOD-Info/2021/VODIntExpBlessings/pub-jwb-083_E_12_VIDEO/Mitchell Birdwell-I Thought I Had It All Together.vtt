My name is Mitchell Birdwell.

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:06.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally thought I had it all together.

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a perfect little family

00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a son and a daughter,
and my wife was regular pioneering.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was serving as an elder.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working as a custom home builder,

00:00:15.786 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had just finished building

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my dream house.

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I ever wanted, I had.

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned to go
to a construction project

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Japan as an international volunteer,

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that project changed everything.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:35.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I got over there, I realized

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that everybody on the site
was a regular pioneer.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really began to have an impact on me.

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to justify it personally by saying:
‘You know, I’m doing OK.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m doing what I should be doing.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re just overachievers.’

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, my interpreter approached me,

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said, “Well, let’s interview

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the committee today.”

00:00:59.163 --> 00:01:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only had one question
that was burning in my heart.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could they be balanced
and be regular pioneers?

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked the question.

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked me to turn to Matthew 6:33,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I go to read it.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says, “No, read it out loud.”
So I read it out loud.

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says, “Read it again.”
So I read it for the second time.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he says: “The Scriptures are clear.

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:27.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you truly ‘seek first the Kingdom,
these other things will be added.’”

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That had a major impact on me.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was just standing there
with my Bible and my thoughts.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt so little.

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, I couldn’t sleep.

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept playing that over and over in my head,

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why don’t I believe?’

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember as a kid, we used to play the game
where you lean back and people catch you.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never liked that game.

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s serving Jehovah
—you’ve got to lean back.

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know he will catch you

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you don’t know how, though,
and you don’t know when.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the next day,
the chairman shows up

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:10.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to speak to me privately.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says, “May I analyze a day in your life?”

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:18.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he describes
my life in detail accurately.

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “You start off,
the phone is ringing.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All day long you’re busy

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with elders’ activity,
the RBC, and your business.”

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:30.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “You come home from work,
your children are trying

00:02:30.254 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to communicate with you,
but you’re so busy.

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because maybe it’s late at night
(about 10:00 p.m. at night),

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you’re down, and it’s time
to spend some time with your wife,

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you fall asleep.”

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:43.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he just stopped
and asked me a question.

00:02:43.642 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says,

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you only spend tired time

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with your wife and your children?”

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from that moment, I started thinking,

00:02:57.656 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What can I do personally
to start making some adjustments?’

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to find a way to get involved

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in full-time service as a family.

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do feel

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have a lot

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers
and sisters in the organization

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:16.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who maybe can’t pioneer, but they’ve given
Jehovah everything they have.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s all he asks—give me your best.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, when we got back,
we started making adjustments,

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it wasn’t easy.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gave up a lot of things

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we thought were important to us.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regular pioneering opened up
a lot of doors for us as a family.

00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:38.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter and her husband

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:42.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are construction servants
with the LDC Department.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son and his wife

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:50.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he’s a regular pioneer
and also serving as a remote Bethelite..

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, we’re serving
as construction servants

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the LDC Department.

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get to serve Jehovah

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this assignment as a couple.

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pinch ourselves sometimes thinking,
‘What a life we get to live!’

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even with our children,
to this day, we still discuss this.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:13.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say that for them it was
the best decision we ever made as a family

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—giving up the stuff
to serve Jehovah full-time.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as I look back, it was that decision,

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:23.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that scripture at that moment

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that defining moment—
that started it all.

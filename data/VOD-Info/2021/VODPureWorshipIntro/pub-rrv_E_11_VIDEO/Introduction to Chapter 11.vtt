‎Jehovah has appointed “the faithful 
and discreet slave” to be a watchman. 

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:10.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, in Bible times, 
a watchman might blow a horn

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:14.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or sound an alarm 
to warn of approaching danger. 

00:00:14.326 --> 00:00:18.706 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But watchmen often did 
more than just warn people.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, Jehovah appointed Ezekiel 
as a watchman. 

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read with me Ezekiel 33:7,

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and see what Jehovah told him to do. 

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As for you, son of man,

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have appointed you 
as a watchman to the house of Israel;

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and when you hear 
a word from my mouth

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you must warn them from me.” 

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:44.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The chapter you’re about to consider 
in the Pure Worship book

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:47.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is based on that scripture 
and has the title

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Have Appointed You as a Watchman.” 

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you discuss this material,

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you’ll learn what else 
is required of a watchman,

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and you’ll gain insight 
into Jehovah’s personality. 

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look for the answers 
to these questions:

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What motivates Jehovah 
to appoint watchmen? 

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What twofold message 
do the watchmen deliver? 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what is your role 
in supporting pure worship?

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, it can be a challenge

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to do the work 
that Jehovah has assigned to us. 

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But please be assured 
that “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎appreciates your help and support. 

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And you can be sure 
that Jehovah appreciates your hard work,

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎your endurance, and your loyalty. 

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:40.788 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The material you’re 
about to discuss will give you courage,

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it will help you 
to do your part in upholding pure worship.

‎Jehovah asked the prophet Ezekiel 
to do some strange things. 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, on one occasion

00:00:08.946 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel sat speechless for a week. 

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.911 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then he suddenly got up 
and shut himself in his house. 

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When he came out again,

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he picked up a brick
and etched it with a drawing. 

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel’s actions were unusual,

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but they conveyed an important message

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.174 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that has meaning for us today.

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:32.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 6 of the Pure Worship book

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discusses Ezekiel’s unusual actions. 

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:39.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is entitled “The End Is Now Upon You.” 

00:00:39.518 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That statement is found at Ezekiel 7:3,

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.399 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the theme scripture for this chapter:

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The end is now upon you,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and I will unleash 
my anger against you,

00:00:50.237 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and I will judge you 
according to your ways

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and call you to account 
for all your detestable deeds.”

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this material,

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers 
to these three questions:

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The events that Ezekiel acted out

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:12.176 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎remind us of what momentous events
that God’s Word foretold for our future? 

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How does the way Ezekiel carried out

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his commission to preach Jehovah’s warnings

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎affect your view of the ministry? 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why might the prophecies 
that we consider in this chapter

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎move you to reexamine your priorities?

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:32.738 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Allow what you learn 
in this chapter to affect you

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as you set priorities for yourself. 

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May the choices you make 
help you to give Jehovah

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the pure worship 
he so richly deserves.

‎In the preceding chapter,
we saw an overview

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:06.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of what Ezekiel’s temple vision 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎meant for the Jews 
held captive in Babylon.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this chapter, 
we’ll discuss some specific lessons

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the vision conveyed to the Jews. 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’ll help us understand
the vital message

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the temple vision has for us today

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.336 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and in the future.

00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Read with me, please,
the theme scripture

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at Ezekiel 43:12:

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.220 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“This is the law of the temple. 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The entire territory all around

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“the top of the mountain is most holy. 

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Look!

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:41.854 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is the law of the temple.” 

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When you study this chapter,

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“This Is the Law of the Temple,”

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers to these questions:

00:00:49.778 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What practical lessons 
did the exiled Jews

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎likely draw 
from Ezekiel’s temple vision? 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what ways does the temple vision 
apply in our own time? 

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you look over the diagram 
of Ezekiel’s visionary temple,

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what lessons would you like 
to apply in your own worship?

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel’s vision of the temple reminds us

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah is the Grand Instructor. 

00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Using vivid, detailed word pictures,

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he teaches us so much

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we need to know 
about serving him acceptably. 

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:28.233 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As the world’s moral standards 
continue to decline,

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:31.862 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we must remember 
that Jehovah’s lofty standards

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎do not change. 

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He required that the Israelites 
render him pure worship,

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:41.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he requires the same of us today.

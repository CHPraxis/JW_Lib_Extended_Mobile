‎Do you enjoy serving Jehovah

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:06.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎along with his united, 
spiritually clean people? 

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No doubt you do. 

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.199 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What you’re experiencing 
is a modern-day miracle,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎one foretold by the prophet Ezekiel.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That prophecy is stated 
in the title of chapter 9,

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Give Them a Unified Heart.” 

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s found at Ezekiel 11:19:

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And I will give them a unified heart,

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.137 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and I will put a new spirit in them;

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and I will remove the heart of stone 
from their bodies

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and give them a heart of flesh.”

‎This chapter of the Pure Worship book

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will help you to answer these questions:

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What was Babylonian captivity 
like for the Jews,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:54.533 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and why did Jehovah 
eventually liberate his people? 

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How was the Christian congregation corrupted,

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what happened that was similar
to the Babylonian captivity of the Jews? 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What promises of restoration 
did Jehovah make through Ezekiel,

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:09.423 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how have they been fulfilled

00:01:09.423 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on true Christians during the last days? 

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How can we show that we appreciate

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the way that Jehovah 
has restored pure worship in our time?

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:23.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s our hope that this material

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:33.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and deepen your desire
to invite others to join us

00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in giving Jehovah pure worship.

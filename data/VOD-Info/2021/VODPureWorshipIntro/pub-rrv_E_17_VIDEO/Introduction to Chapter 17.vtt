‎We live in momentous times. 

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very soon now, 
we’ll face the greatest demonstration

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of God’s destructive power
ever seen on earth. 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What can we expect to happen? 

00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thankfully, 
Jehovah does not leave us in the dark.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 17 of the Pure Worship book

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is about the final attack that will be made

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:26.755 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on Jehovah’s people

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎during the great tribulation. 

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:31.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The enemy and leader of the attack

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is named in the title of the chapter

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Am Against You, O Gog.” 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That title is drawn from Ezekiel 38:3. 

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read that with me:

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Say, ‘This is what 
the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘“Here I am against you, O Gog,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎head chieftain of Meshech and Tubal.”’”

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers to these questions:

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:03.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s the identity of Gog of Magog? 

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When, why, and how
will Gog attack Jehovah’s people?

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What is the spiritual land,
and how can you beautify it?

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.720 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brothers and sisters, 
we have no reason to fear

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the approaching tribulation. 

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah tells us what to expect,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he’ll be with us 
every step of the way

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as long as we continue 
to uphold pure worship in our life. 

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Never forget this:

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No enemy could ever prevail

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎against the Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

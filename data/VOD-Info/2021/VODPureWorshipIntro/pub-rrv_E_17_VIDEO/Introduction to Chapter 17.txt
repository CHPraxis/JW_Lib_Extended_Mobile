00:00:01 ‎We live in momentous times.
00:00:04 ‎Very soon now,  we’ll face the greatest demonstration
00:00:08 ‎of God’s destructive power ever seen on earth.
00:00:11 ‎What can we expect to happen?
00:00:14 ‎Thankfully,  Jehovah does not leave us in the dark.
00:00:18 ‎Chapter 17 of the Pure Worship book
00:00:22 ‎is about the final attack that will be made
00:00:24 ‎on Jehovah’s people
00:00:26 ‎during the great tribulation.
00:00:29 ‎The enemy and leader of the attack
00:00:31 ‎is named in the title of the chapter
00:00:34 ‎“I Am Against You, O Gog.”
00:00:37 ‎That title is drawn from Ezekiel 38:3.
00:00:42 ‎Please read that with me:
00:00:45 ‎“Say, ‘This is what  the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:
00:00:49 ‎“‘“Here I am against you, O Gog,
00:00:51 ‎head chieftain of Meshech and Tubal.”’”
00:00:55 ‎As you study this chapter,
00:00:57 ‎look for the answers to these questions:
00:01:00 ‎What’s the identity of Gog of Magog?
00:01:03 ‎When, why, and how will Gog attack Jehovah’s people?
00:01:07 ‎What is the spiritual land, and how can you beautify it?
00:01:11 ‎Brothers and sisters,  we have no reason to fear
00:01:14 ‎the approaching tribulation.
00:01:16 ‎Jehovah tells us what to expect,
00:01:19 ‎and he’ll be with us  every step of the way
00:01:22 ‎as long as we continue  to uphold pure worship in our life.
00:01:26 ‎Never forget this:
00:01:28 ‎No enemy could ever prevail
00:01:31 ‎against the Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

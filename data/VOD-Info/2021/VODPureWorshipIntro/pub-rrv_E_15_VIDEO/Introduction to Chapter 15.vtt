‎Jehovah loves people,

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:06.277 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he also holds us accountable

00:00:06.277 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for our actions. 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How does Jehovah feel
about those who claim to worship him

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but betray him by their conduct?

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How will he determine 
who survives the great tribulation?

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why will Jehovah, a God of love,

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.128 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎execute millions of people? 

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those questions are answered in section 4

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Pure Worship book.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Based on Ezekiel 39:25, it’s entitled

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Zealously Defend My Holy Name.”

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The depth of Jehovah’s feelings
are vividly conveyed

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the first chapter of this section. 

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It has the title

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Bring an End to Your Prostitution.” 

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That title is drawn from Ezekiel 16:41:

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:55.242 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They will burn your houses with fire
and execute judgment on you

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“before the eyes of many women;

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and I will bring 
an end to your prostitution,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and you will stop giving payment.” 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for these key points:

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why is comparing false religion
to a prostitute

00:01:11.592 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎an effective illustration?

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What do the prostitutes

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.974 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of Ezekiel chapters 16 and 23 

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎teach us about Jehovah’s feelings
regarding false worship? 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What lies ahead for false religion,

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what action should we take now?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s so comforting to know

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.823 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah has
a strong emotional attachment

00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:36.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to those who serve him! 

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But that special relationship brings with it

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:42.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a serious responsibility. 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Never would we want 
to hurt Jehovah’s feelings!

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May this chapter 
strengthen your resolve to give Jehovah

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:54.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the pure worship 
that rightly belongs only to him.

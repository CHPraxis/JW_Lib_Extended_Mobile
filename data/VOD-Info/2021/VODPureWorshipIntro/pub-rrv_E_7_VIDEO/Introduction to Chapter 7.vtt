‎The Israelites had to deal 
with pressure from relatives

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who did not serve Jehovah,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Israel was surrounded 
by rich and powerful nations.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:15.035 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When the Israelites relied on Jehovah,

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:18.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he protected them from their enemies. 

00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Often, though, 
his people allowed themselves

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to be corrupted by their neighbors. 

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:27.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How did Jehovah respond?

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Chapter 7 has the title

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:34.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Nations ‘Will Have to Know
That I Am Jehovah.’”

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:39.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That declaration appears repeatedly
throughout Ezekiel’s prophecy. 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The theme scripture for this chapter
contains a similar thought. 

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.068 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read Ezekiel 25:17 with me:

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I will execute on them 
great acts of vengeance

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“with furious punishments,

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and they will have to know
that I am Jehovah

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when I bring my vengeance on them.”

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We can learn much 
by examining the way that the Israelites

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎interacted with the surrounding people

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—including many who were related to them—

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the way that Jehovah responded. 

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So when you prepare this material,

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers to these questions:

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why should it not surprise us

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:25.314 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if family members 
oppose our worship of Jehovah? 

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎About what should we remain confident

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even if powerful governments persecute us? 

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What lesson can we learn 
from the inhabitants of Tyre?

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:41.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And how can we show 
that we know Jehovah?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.668 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter, ask yourself, 

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.880 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘How can I use the key points 
discussed to encourage someone,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘such as a Bible student,

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.636 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to prepare for opposition?’ 

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s so important 
that all of us remain loyal to Jehovah! 

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Only then can we give him pure worship.

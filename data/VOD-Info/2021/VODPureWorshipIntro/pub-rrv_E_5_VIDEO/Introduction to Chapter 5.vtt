00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:06.026 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah loved and cared for the Israelites

00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as his “treasured possession.” 

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how did they respond to God’s love? 

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By worshipping false gods

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the very temple that bore his name! 

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They broke Jehovah’s heart

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.465 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and brought reproach upon his name. 

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why did Israel sink so low? 

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What can we learn 
from Ezekiel’s prophecy

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about Jerusalem’s destruction? 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those questions are answered

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.856 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in section 2 of the book

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:48.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Pure Worship of Jehovah
—Restored At Last!

00:00:48.527 --> 00:00:50.529 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This section is based

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:53.657 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on Ezekiel 5:11 and is entitled

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:58.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“It Was My Sanctuary That You Defiled.”

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:01.290 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first chapter of this section focuses

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.961 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on apostate Judah’s spiritual and moral decline. 

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel knew the Mosaic Law well. 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He knew what was involved 
in giving Jehovah pure worship,

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he saw things happening
at the temple in Jerusalem

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would shock
any faithful worshipper of Jehovah.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn, please, to Ezekiel 8:9,

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.404 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and read along with me:

00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“He said to me: 
‘Go in and see

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:40.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the evil, detestable things 
that they are doing here.’”

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.210 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This passage sets
the scene for chapter 5,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“See the Evil, Detestable Things
That They Are Doing.” 

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you study this chapter,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:58.055 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎look for the answers 
to the following questions:

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What does Jehovah 
rightly expect of his worshippers,

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how can you live up
to his expectation? 

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what ways did the Israelites

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎become spiritually unclean,

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but how can you keep spiritually clean? 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And why are you determined

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to stay morally clean?

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you consider this material,
ask yourself,

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘What temptations must I resist

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.259 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if I’m to remain spiritually clean?’ 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please be assured

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.098 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah will give you
the strength you need 

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to reject any temptation

00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or to overcome any unclean habit. 

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Only if we remain clean

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can we give Jehovah what he deserves

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:58.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—our pure worship.

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to teach your children about Jehovah. 

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:10.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many of you likely use 
the pictures and videos supplied

‎by the faithful slave

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.912 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about our loving God. 

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:21.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But pictures can also help us
understand deeper truths about Jehovah.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please read with me

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.340 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ezekiel 1:5, 6, and 10:

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Within it were what looked like 
four living creatures,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and the appearance 
of each one was like that of a human. 

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Each one had four faces and four wings. 

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Their faces had this appearance:

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Each of the four had a man’s face

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“with a lion’s face on the right,

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“a bull’s face on the left,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and each of the four had an eagle’s face.” 

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These verses are discussed 
in the chapter entitled

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.912 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Who Are ‘the Living Creatures 
With Four Faces’?” 

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As you consider this material, 
look for these key points:

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why do the faces of a man, a lion,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.922 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a bull, and an eagle

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎especially reflect Jehovah’s strength 
and mightiness? 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what ways are you already benefiting

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from expressions 
of Jehovah’s outstanding attributes? 

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.770 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why can we conclude 
that the four faces of the cherubs

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when viewed together 
represent all of Jehovah’s attributes? 

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How does this vision 
of Ezekiel assure you

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that you are never 
beyond the reach of Jehovah’s love?

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:40.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If possible, answer as often 
as you can during the study. 

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:43.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Your answers will encourage 
your brothers and sisters. 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But they’ll do more. 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They’ll tell Jehovah 
how you feel about him,

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.590 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they’ll strengthen your resolve

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to give Jehovah pure worship.

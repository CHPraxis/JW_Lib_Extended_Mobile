00:00:01 ‎Can you imagine  seeing a valley full of human bones
00:00:05 ‎that slowly assemble themselves;
00:00:08 ‎grow sinew, muscle, and skin;
00:00:11 ‎and then come to life?
00:00:14 ‎It must have made the hair  on Ezekiel’s neck stand up.
00:00:19 ‎But Jehovah gave this vision  not to frighten us but to give us hope.
00:00:25 ‎That hope is expressed  in the title of chapter 10,
00:00:29 ‎“You Will Come to Life.”
00:00:31 ‎The statement is recorded at Ezekiel 37:5:
00:00:36 ‎“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says to these bones:
00:00:41 ‎‛I will cause breath to enter you, and you will come to life.’”
00:00:46 ‎This chapter will help you answer these intriguing questions:
00:00:51 ‎Why did the exiles in Babylon  say that their bones were dry?
00:00:57 ‎In what way was  the modern-day “Israel of God”
00:01:00 ‎in a deathlike situation?
00:01:03 ‎How did “the Israel of God”  experience a gradual restoration,
00:01:07 ‎and when did they “come to life”?
00:01:10 ‎How do you feel about being part
00:01:13 ‎of the “extremely large army”  that Ezekiel’s prophecy foretold?
00:01:18 ‎You are living proof
00:01:21 ‎that the prophecy we’re about to discuss
00:01:24 ‎has been fulfilled.
00:01:26 ‎The Governing Body  considers it a privilege
00:01:28 ‎to serve along with you  in the large army of loyal ones
00:01:33 ‎who give Jehovah pure worship.

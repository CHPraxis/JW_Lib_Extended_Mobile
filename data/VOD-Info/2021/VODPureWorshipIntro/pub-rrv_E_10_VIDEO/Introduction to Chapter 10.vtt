‎Can you imagine 
seeing a valley full of human bones

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that slowly assemble themselves;

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎grow sinew, muscle, and skin;

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then come to life? 

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:19.415 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It must have made the hair 
on Ezekiel’s neck stand up.

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:24.420 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But Jehovah gave this vision 
not to frighten us but to give us hope.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That hope is expressed 
in the title of chapter 10,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“You Will Come to Life.” 

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:36.640 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The statement is recorded
at Ezekiel 37:5:

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
says to these bones:

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‛I will cause breath to enter you,
and you will come to life.’”

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:51.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This chapter will help you answer
these intriguing questions:

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why did the exiles in Babylon 
say that their bones were dry?

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In what way was 
the modern-day “Israel of God”

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.459 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in a deathlike situation? 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:07.713 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How did “the Israel of God” 
experience a gradual restoration,

00:01:07.713 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and when did they “come to life”? 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.510 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do you feel about being part

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the “extremely large army” 
that Ezekiel’s prophecy foretold?

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You are living proof

00:01:21.477 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the prophecy we’re about to discuss

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎has been fulfilled. 

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Governing Body 
considers it a privilege

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to serve along with you 
in the large army of loyal ones

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:36.408 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who give Jehovah pure worship.

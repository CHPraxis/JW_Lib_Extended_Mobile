‎Israel is shattered

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.361 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—her unity torn by apostasy. 

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She defiled pure worship
and defamed God’s name

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and is suffering the consequences. 

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.123 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Amid the despair,
Jehovah moves Ezekiel

00:00:19.123 --> 00:00:23.794 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to utter a series of prophecies
that offer hope.

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:28.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These prophecies are discussed
in section 3 of the Pure Worship book.

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Based on Ezekiel 20:41,

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the title of the section is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will . . . Collect You Together.”

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.728 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Prophecies about the Messiah

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are among the most thrilling facets
of Jehovah’s purpose.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They’re the basis of our hope,
and they’re the focus of chapter 8,

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which is entitled

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I Will Raise Up One Shepherd.”

00:00:55.534 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That title is based on Ezekiel 34:23:

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I will raise up 
one shepherd over them,

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“my servant David, 
and he will feed them.

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:14.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He himself will feed them
and become their shepherd.”

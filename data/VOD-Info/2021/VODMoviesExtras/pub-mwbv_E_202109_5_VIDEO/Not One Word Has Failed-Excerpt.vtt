Jericho fell, and Rahab
and her family were spared.

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:10.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had decreed
that everything in the city be destroyed,

00:00:10.197 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though all the silver and gold
were to be delivered to his treasury.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one was to take anything for himself.

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Achan, what is it?

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you looking so smug?

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are rich, dear one!

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rich?

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you talking about?

00:00:57.077 --> 00:00:59.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See for yourselves!

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give that to me!
That’s mine!

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have done well, my husband!

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:11.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took it
from the rich, selfish, ungodly Canaanites!

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did anyone see you?

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.
I was careful.

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sure?

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:17.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one could possibly know.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Father, this will give us
a good start in the Promised Land.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:27.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But—
We must hide all of these treasures.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, keep them hidden!

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What no one sees, no one knows.

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Agreed?

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh-huh.

00:01:36.617 --> 00:01:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come then!
Let us hide all of it.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we attacked the city of Ai,
we suffered defeat.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah then revealed

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone had taken something
that was to be destroyed

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:11.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had stolen gold and silver
meant for Jehovah’s treasury.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next morning,
Jehovah had all Israel come near,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tribe by tribe, family by family,

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:22.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
household by household, man by man.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, Jehovah revealed
the disobedient man.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son.

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:32.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, honor Jehovah the God of Israel

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make confession to him.

00:02:38.554 --> 00:02:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me, please, what you have done.

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:43.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not hide it from me.

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:48.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a fact,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am the one who sinned
against Jehovah the God of Israel.

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw among the spoil of Jehovah

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an official garment from Shinar

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such a good looking one—

00:03:03.412 --> 00:03:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And?

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:06.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes,

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:10.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 200 shekels of silver—

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and one gold bar

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weighing 50 shekels.

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:21.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Achan, why did you take them?

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I desired them,
so I took them.

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:30.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at me.

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:34.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not hear the same words we all heard?

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The instructions were clear

00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the city was to be devoted to destruction.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you not aware
that it and everything in it

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
belonged to Jehovah?

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:49.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I was.

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet you stole these things?

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:01.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this garment
from Shinar mean to you?

00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was—
You have to see it, Joshua.

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is beautiful.

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is one whole piece.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:12.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The finest material.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:13.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fit for a king<b>.</b>

00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never seen such brilliant colors.

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enough, my son, enough!

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell me, where is it?

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:28.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is hidden in the ground inside my tent,

00:04:28.914 --> 00:04:31.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the money underneath it.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:35.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go, Ishbak!
See if these words are true!

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nedabiah, go and find his family.

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:42.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Achan,

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you not know
that Jehovah would see you?

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t think of that.

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:51.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had no need of these things.

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:54.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have a bull and a donkey and a flock.

00:04:55.983 --> 00:05:00.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I—I don’t know what to say<b>.</b>

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:02.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a fact,

00:05:02.906 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have sinned
against Jehovah, the God of Israel.

00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:24.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why have you brought disaster upon us?

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will bring disaster
upon you on this day!

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:32.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nedabiah, take them away.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah warned that willful disobedience

00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings bad consequences.

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:45.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Achan’s case shows that in this way too,

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s word never fails.

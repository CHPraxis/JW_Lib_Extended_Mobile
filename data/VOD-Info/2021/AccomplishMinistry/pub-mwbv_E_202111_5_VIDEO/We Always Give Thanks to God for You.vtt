We feel blessed to be part of a brotherhood

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that imitates our generous God, Jehovah.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:13.534 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Year after year,

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you diligently give of your time,

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
energy, and financial resources
to support one another,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both locally and globally.

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has asked me
to convey their sincere appreciation

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all that you do.

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel as did the apostle Paul

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wrote at 2 Thessalonians 1:3:

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are obligated always to give thanks

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to God for you, brothers . . . ,

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:44.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because your faith is growing exceedingly

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the love of each and every one of you

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is increasing toward one another.”

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:55.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the 2021 service year
had its challenges,

00:00:55.326 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of the disasters threatened
the bond of faith and love we all share.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your generous donations have played

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a part in strengthening that bond.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.462 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The article series

“How Your Donations Are Used”

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has highlighted tangible ways

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your donations continue

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support our brotherhood.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note just a few:

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Funds are being used to provide
JW Boxes in many Kingdom Halls

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Internet access is limited,

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:25.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping hundreds of thousands
to access spiritual food.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the support of your donations,

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:30.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have obtained legal victories,

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowing many of our brothers who are part

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

to worship freely.

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of us have benefited
from the increased use

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of video streaming and conferencing
for our meetings and conventions.

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to thank you all personally

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what you’ve done
to support these initiatives.

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We especially appreciate
that we have the resources available

to help our brothers when disaster strikes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hundreds of thousands
have received relief aid.

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To date, more than 25 million dollars

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been approved to be spent on this relief.

This will include

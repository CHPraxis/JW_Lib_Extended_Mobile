00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:05.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you struggling to provide
for yourself or your family?

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:08.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many today lack the basic necessities,

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as food, clean water, adequate housing.

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this causes some to question
whether God really cares about humans.

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as Jehovah’s people, we are different.

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah
cares for all of his creation.

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we all know

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is a test of our faith
when things get difficult.

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is,
How can we build our faith

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we are strong and so that it
can help us get through difficult times?

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way is by examining how Jehovah

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides for his animal creation.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that helpful?

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that examination gives us confidence

00:00:51.363 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will care for us as well.

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example, in the following video,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Jehovah provides food
for a massive sea creature.

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The largest animal alive on earth today

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also the largest that has ever lived

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the blue whale.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales can grow to be

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 30 meters (98 feet) long

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weigh up to 180 tons.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:38.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its heart alone may weigh
several hundred kilograms.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does such a large creature
find enough to eat?

00:01:47.962 --> 00:01:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blue whale migrates great distances

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find tiny crustaceans

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known as krill.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a blue whale

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finds a school of krill,

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it accelerates toward the krill

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and opens its giant mouth.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may engulf
hundreds of kilograms of krill

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each lunge

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:19.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
amounting to several tons per day.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales eat a lot.

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah provides for them,

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will provide for us.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is the sea, so great and wide,

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teeming with countless living things,

00:02:53.861 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both small and great.”

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we are amazed at the way Jehovah

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides for all of his animal creation,
including the sea creatures.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:10.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes this well

00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you look at Psalm 104:27, 28

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 104:27, 28:

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All of them wait for you
to give them their food in its season.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you give them, they gather.

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you open your hand,
they are satisfied with good things.”

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:37.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, meditating on this
aspect of creation builds our faith.

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:39.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, from the video,

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you remember the size of this creature?

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
if you had the assignment

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed just one blue whale?

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just make sure
that one whale has enough to eat every day.

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that?

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we start?

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d have to hire teams of people

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and figure out how to get the food
and how to move the food

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the blue whale is swimming
(after we figure out where it’s swimming).

00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:06.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, it would be a full-time job!

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would be to feed just one whale,
and there are thousands of them.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, Jehovah has it
all arranged day after day.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t even think about it.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice here in verse 27,

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:23.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “all of them wait
for [Jehovah] to give them their food.”

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it doesn’t mean that the whale
just kind of floats on the top of the water

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waits for food to jump in its mouth.

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:30.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it swims; it looks for the food.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it finds it, it goes after it.

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah provides it.

00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:41.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 28, it says:
“What [he] give[s] them, they gather.”

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you cannot imagine
that blue whale thinking: ‘Come on, really?

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:50.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m 180 tons, and you’re
going to feed me with a little crustacean?

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Couldn’t we have just worked out
that I eat a couple of big tuna every day?’

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they gather what Jehovah gives them.

00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 28 goes on to say

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “they are satisfied
with” Jehovah’s provisions.

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:05.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you notice
the comment in the video?

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:12.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Jehovah provides for them,

00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:15.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will provide for us.”

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, meditating on creation
can build our faith

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strengthen our faith—
in Jehovah’s support.

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note the four lessons that we learn

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from how Jehovah cares for his creation.

00:05:29.057 --> 00:05:33.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is that if Jehovah has the desire

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:37.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for animals
and provide for their needs,

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:40.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think that Jehovah has the desire

00:05:40.068 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for you and your family?

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:47.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Jesus
expressed at Matthew 6:26,

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:51.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he explained
how Jehovah cares for His creation,

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the small birds, and he said:

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are you not worth more than they are?”

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:01.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if Jehovah feels compelled
to care for his animal creation,

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:04.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be assured that he feels compelled

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:06.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for you and your family.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second lesson is that we do not need

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:13.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be unduly anxious about tomorrow.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:18.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we can confidently ask
Jehovah for our daily needs.

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Matthew 6:31, 32

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:26.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:31, 32.

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:30.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “So never be anxious and say,

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:32.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘‘‘What are we to eat?’

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:36.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or, ‘What are we to drink?’
or, ‘What are we to wear?’

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all these are the things
the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:45.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your heavenly Father knows
that you need all these things.”

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah knows we need them.

00:06:47.427 --> 00:06:52.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows exactly what we need,
and he promises to provide it.

00:06:52.432 --> 00:06:54.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Jehovah has the capacity

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:59.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed a 180-ton blue whale,

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:03.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think he has the capacity
to feed you and me and our families?

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:05.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we do the best that we can,
and then we trust in Jehovah to do the rest.

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:13.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like it mentioned
there in Psalms with the animal creation,

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:18.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we “wait” on Jehovah
and we “are satisfied with” what he provides.

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point is that Jehovah
will not abandon us when we face trials.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Hebrews chapter 13
and the latter part of verse 5

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 13:5.

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:35.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I will never leave you,

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

00:07:38.353 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:43.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will care for us
even through our hard times.

00:07:43.775 --> 00:07:45.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can that help us?

00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:48.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that can help us to make good decisions

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:50.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good decisions regarding our employment,

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:53.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
care for our family, worship of Jehovah.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We well remember
Jesus’ words at Matthew 6:33,

00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:00.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he says:
“[Seek] first the Kingdom . . .

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these other things
will be [given] to you.”

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, our fourth point:

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises that he will abundantly care

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of our needs in the future.

00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:19.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think of that beautiful promise
at Isaiah 65:22,

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:22.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says: “For the days of my people

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be like the days of a tree.”

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:30.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the blue whale 
is thought to live 80 to 90 years,

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah keeps providing for it.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He does not have
a limited supply of provisions.

00:08:35.827 --> 00:08:39.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that gives us confidence
that it’s not beyond Jehovah’s ability

00:08:39.956 --> 00:08:44.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill his promise
and care for us through all eternity.

00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Jehovah’s Word and his creation

00:08:48.715 --> 00:08:53.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

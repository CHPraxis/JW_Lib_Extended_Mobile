00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good day, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:22.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next session will begin
with a music-video presentation.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video shows the beauty of creation

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the beauty of our worldwide brotherhood,

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:31.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both of which bring glory to Jehovah.

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch and listen.

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:35.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our opening song is an opportunity

00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:38.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of us to give praise to Jehovah.

00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:42.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s sing song number 2,
entitled “Jehovah Is Your Name.”

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:45.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 2.

00:13:40.715 --> 00:13:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we examine the things Jehovah has made,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see his marvelous qualities,

00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:49.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can we learn even more?

00:13:49.474 --> 00:13:51.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following six-part symposium

00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show how meditating on creation

00:13:54.354 --> 00:13:58.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can strengthen our faith
in Jehovah’s promises.

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:00.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:04.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the first talk entitled

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:10.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith—Stars.”

00:14:17.627 --> 00:14:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In each of the parts of this symposium,

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:22.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the speaker will help us to see

00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only the wonder of creation

00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:29.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also the thunder of creation.

00:14:29.848 --> 00:14:34.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will hear Jehovah’s words
like thunder—loud and clear.

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:38.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Nehemiah 9:6 with me,

00:14:39.858 --> 00:14:42.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the faith-strengthening effect

00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:47.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that creation has on the angels above.

00:14:47.824 --> 00:14:50.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah 9:6:

00:14:50.326 --> 00:14:53.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You alone are Jehovah;

00:14:53.413 --> 00:14:57.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you made the heavens,
yes, the heaven of the heavens

00:14:57.751 --> 00:15:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all their army,
the earth and all that is on it,

00:15:02.505 --> 00:15:05.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the seas and all that is in them.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you preserve all of them alive,

00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:12.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the army of the heavens
are bowing down to you.”

00:15:12.182 --> 00:15:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that verse
extols Jehovah as the Creator.

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:19.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice the expression

00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heaven of the heavens”?

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:25.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:15:25.445 --> 00:15:30.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that refers to the complete extent
of the physical heavens

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the atmospheric heavens,
the heavens of outer space.

00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the top
of the heavens’ outer space, that rim,

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:41.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is the heaven of the heavens
—the highest heavens.

00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:46.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we look at the heavens,
what do we see?

00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:48.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we feel?

00:15:48.468 --> 00:15:53.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that verse,
did you notice it mentions (first time)

00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the heavens and all their army”?

00:15:56.017 --> 00:16:00.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s referring
to the physical army of the heavens

00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:03.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the stars, the planets, the galaxies.

00:16:03.107 --> 00:16:05.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice in the last sentence

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:08.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is another “army of the heavens”?

00:16:08.196 --> 00:16:11.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that refers to the holy angels of God.

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:17.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just contemplating the physical creation,

00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angels are moved
to bow down or worship Jehovah.

00:16:24.003 --> 00:16:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contemplating the creation
can have a similar effect on us.

00:16:29.008 --> 00:16:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, each talk of this symposium will discuss

00:16:31.886 --> 00:16:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how meditating on an aspect of creation

00:16:36.307 --> 00:16:40.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will build our faith in Jehovah’s promises.

00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a video about the stars,

00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:49.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we will have
a faith-strengthening application

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:52.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our resurrection hope.

00:16:58.162 --> 00:17:02.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sun is considered an average star.

00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:11.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, the energy from the sun

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:15.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reaches the earth is thousands of times

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world’s total energy use.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:28.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our unaided eyes,

00:17:28.443 --> 00:17:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might see about 3,000 stars

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:33.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a dark night

00:17:37.493 --> 00:17:40.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many in a fuzzy band.

00:17:40.914 --> 00:17:43.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Milky Way galaxy

00:17:45.835 --> 00:17:48.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is where our sun
is just one of perhaps

00:17:48.922 --> 00:17:52.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
200 to 400 billion stars.

00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:00.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Astronomers think the Milky Way galaxy

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:05.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is clustered together
with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a massive structure called a supercluster

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:15.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that together with an estimated
two trillion galaxies

00:18:15.615 --> 00:18:18.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make up the known physical universe.

00:18:24.332 --> 00:18:26.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Countless stars

00:18:26.459 --> 00:18:29.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spread over unfathomable distances,

00:18:29.337 --> 00:18:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
releasing immense amounts of energy

00:18:32.256 --> 00:18:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be impossible to grasp for us

00:18:36.052 --> 00:18:38.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not for Jehovah.

00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He counts the number of the stars;

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:44.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he calls all of them by name.

00:18:44.185 --> 00:18:48.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.”

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:59.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a two-minute video about the stars,

00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:02.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see the awesome wonder,

00:19:02.328 --> 00:19:05.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but do we hear the thunder?

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we hear the clear, undeniable application

00:19:10.378 --> 00:19:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah, our Creator?

00:19:13.923 --> 00:19:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I invite you
to turn with me to Isaiah 40:26, please.

00:19:18.928 --> 00:19:23.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we come to appreciate about Jehovah

00:19:23.057 --> 00:19:25.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by pondering the magnitude

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the magnificence of the stars?

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:34.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at Isaiah 40:26,
Jehovah says to look at the stars.

00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:39.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Lift up your eyes to heaven and see.

00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:43.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who has created these things [the wonder]?

00:19:43.453 --> 00:19:47.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is the One who brings
out their army by number;

00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:49.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he calls them all by name.

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:54.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because of his vast dynamic energy
and his awe-inspiring power,

00:19:54.714 --> 00:19:57.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not one of them is missing.”

00:19:58.468 --> 00:20:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the video we saw,

00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it estimated that there are

00:20:03.139 --> 00:20:06.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two trillion galaxies in outer space,

00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:09.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each with billions of stars.

00:20:09.771 --> 00:20:12.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do the math.

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:16.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many names of inanimate objects

00:20:16.027 --> 00:20:18.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does Jehovah have in his memory?

00:20:19.614 --> 00:20:23.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many can he possibly contain?

00:20:25.661 --> 00:20:28.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice
that at the end of that verse,

00:20:28.456 --> 00:20:31.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “not one of them are missing”?

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is said that there are
a billion, trillion stars.

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:39.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I have to ask you,

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would Jehovah remember your name?

00:20:42.804 --> 00:20:45.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your loved one’s name?”

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:47.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Not one of them is missing.”

00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:50.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not one star goes missing to Jehovah.

00:20:51.771 --> 00:20:54.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how about our dead loved ones?

00:20:54.607 --> 00:20:56.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they go missing?

00:20:57.985 --> 00:21:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My favorite verses
when a faithful servant of Jehovah dies

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Romans 14:7-9.

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:07.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 8, it says:

00:21:07.578 --> 00:21:09.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we live

00:21:09.831 --> 00:21:11.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or] if we die,

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:15.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we belong to Jehovah.”

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The status with Jehovah
does not change at death.

00:21:18.548 --> 00:21:23.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That person did not go missing.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about those of us
who have loved ones

00:21:26.597 --> 00:21:28.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who at the time of their death,

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:32.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had not come to learn
about or put faith in Jehovah?

00:21:32.812 --> 00:21:34.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about that?

00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:39.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about this:
If Jehovah had the ability, the power,

00:21:39.652 --> 00:21:43.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create those huge stars and galaxies,

00:21:43.114 --> 00:21:46.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can recreate all

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:49.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all—those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:21:49.954 --> 00:21:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find John 5:28, 29.

00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s verify that so that all of us,

00:21:54.917 --> 00:21:57.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether the dead loved one

00:21:57.128 --> 00:22:00.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was previously a faithful Witness or not,

00:22:00.339 --> 00:22:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us, can entertain
the hope of the resurrection.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29:

00:22:08.806 --> 00:22:11.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:22:11.517 --> 00:22:14.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming in which all

00:22:14.687 --> 00:22:18.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[all] those in the memorial tombs
will hear his voice and come out,

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who did good things
to a resurrection of life,

00:22:25.072 --> 00:22:28.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those who practiced
[you see, even] vile things

00:22:28.492 --> 00:22:31.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:22:31.913 --> 00:22:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they’ll be restored to life
and they’ll have the opportunity

00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:39.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come to love the One who gifted them

00:22:39.837 --> 00:22:42.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the miracle of a resurrection.

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:47.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in our video,
right at the end (on screen),

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a quotation of Psalm 147:4, 5.

00:22:50.932 --> 00:22:54.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 4, it says
that ‘Jehovah counts all the stars’

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:57.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the billions, trillions, or more of them.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:23:02.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that he named each one
—the billions or trillions of them.

00:23:02.526 --> 00:23:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is amazing indeed.

00:23:05.655 --> 00:23:09.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’d like to learn
another lesson from the book of Job.

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:12.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Job 14, please,
we’re going to read verses 13 and 15.

00:23:15.456 --> 00:23:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a star burns out,

00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it does not go missing to Jehovah.

00:23:21.003 --> 00:23:24.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt he remembers its name,

00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:26.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he is not motivated to resurrect

00:23:26.926 --> 00:23:29.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that star back to light

00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:34.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it can again
twinkle in a dark night sky.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about humans?

00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:40.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were created in the image

00:23:40.189 --> 00:23:43.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus.

00:23:43.484 --> 00:23:46.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Job 14:13,

00:23:46.112 --> 00:23:48.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job says:

00:23:48.114 --> 00:23:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O that in the Grave you would conceal me,

00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:56.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that you would hide me
until your anger passes by,

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:01.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you would set a time limit
for me and remember me!”

00:24:01.127 --> 00:24:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in verse 14, it’s obviously
talking about the resurrection.

00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:08.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would Job, in effect,
just become a burned-out star?

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:11.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:24:11.512 --> 00:24:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike a burned-out star,

00:24:13.848 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah yearns—he longs—to call back
each human to life

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:23.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can again see
that starlike twinkle in their eyes.

00:24:23.774 --> 00:24:25.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now verse 15:

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You [that’s Jehovah] will call,
 and I will answer you.”

00:24:31.657 --> 00:24:35.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, from the grave, “I will answer you.”

00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:39.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will long for the work of your hands.”

00:24:39.123 --> 00:24:44.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah has the memory
to bring back people.

00:24:44.128 --> 00:24:47.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has the power to bring back people,

00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:52.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has the longing
to bring back people to life.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends, observe the stars.

00:24:57.725 --> 00:25:02.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have faith that you will see
your resurrected loved ones.

00:25:04.732 --> 00:25:08.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, Brother Patrick LaFranca,
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:12.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will continue this symposium with his talk,

00:25:12.323 --> 00:25:16.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith—Oceans.”

00:25:23.959 --> 00:25:26.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever stood on the ocean shore,

00:25:26.754 --> 00:25:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the salt spray,

00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:31.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching the breakers dash against the rocks

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:35.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or run up onto the sandy beach
then withdraw?

00:25:35.554 --> 00:25:38.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many enjoy spending hours at the ocean.

00:25:38.474 --> 00:25:40.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never stop marveling

00:25:40.476 --> 00:25:44.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at its beauty and its immense size.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, many fear

00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:49.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the destructive power of the ocean.

00:25:49.693 --> 00:25:53.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like other natural forces,
the ocean can act like a powerful giant

00:25:53.948 --> 00:25:56.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sometimes goes on a rampage.

00:25:56.951 --> 00:26:01.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can man do to stop
the wall of water of a tsunami

00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:04.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from approaching the coastline?

00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:08.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The power of storm waves
is almost unbelievable.

00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:12.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have been known to throw
boulders weighing 7,000 pounds

00:26:12.758 --> 00:26:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over a wall 20 feet high.

00:26:16.637 --> 00:26:19.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we trust that Jehovah in the future

00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:22.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will bring the oceans
and other natural forces

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into perfect balance?

00:26:25.271 --> 00:26:30.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how the oceans
give loud and clear evidence

00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s wisdom and power.

00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:38.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions of cubic meters of water

00:26:38.617 --> 00:26:42.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circulate continually around our planet.

00:27:05.478 --> 00:27:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Near the poles, water that is colder,

00:27:08.564 --> 00:27:11.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saltier, and denser sinks,

00:27:11.901 --> 00:27:16.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
creating a flow almost 100 times

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:18.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that of the Amazon River.

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:22.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This drives a massive circulation of water

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:26.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may take 1,000 years to complete

00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:29.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the global ocean conveyor belt.

00:27:31.712 --> 00:27:36.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This enormous system distributes heat,

00:27:37.134 --> 00:27:40.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which helps to stabilize the weather

00:27:47.937 --> 00:27:50.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and transport great quantities

00:27:50.314 --> 00:27:52.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of nutrients around the world

00:27:54.276 --> 00:27:56.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that life

00:27:56.487 --> 00:27:58.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may flourish in abundance.

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:19.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion

00:28:19.718 --> 00:28:22.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understands them perfectly.

00:28:24.598 --> 00:28:27.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You rule over the raging of the sea;

00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:31.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when its waves surge, you calm them.”

00:28:34.775 --> 00:28:36.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw in our video,

00:28:36.944 --> 00:28:41.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the oceans are essential
to sustain life on the earth.

00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:43.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, however, greedy men

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have trashed them with pollution.

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:50.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Global warming has caused
ocean levels to rise,

00:28:50.374 --> 00:28:52.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
threatening coastal areas.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experts are concerned that the natural forces
are so out of balance

00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:01.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that soon the planet
will no longer sustain life.

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:06.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, friends, if Jehovah had
the wisdom and power

00:29:06.473 --> 00:29:09.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create the earth’s oceans,

00:29:09.268 --> 00:29:14.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his time comes to bring
all natural forces back into perfect balance,

00:29:14.273 --> 00:29:18.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly cause us
to live in harmony with them.

00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:22.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though the oceans might appear
to be uncontrollable,

00:29:22.823 --> 00:29:27.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that Jehovah is vastly more powerful.

00:29:27.453 --> 00:29:32.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note how Psalm 93:4 describes his power,

00:29:33.751 --> 00:29:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 93:4:

00:29:36.211 --> 00:29:38.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Above the sound of many waters,

00:29:38.922 --> 00:29:42.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“mightier than the breaking waves of the sea,

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:46.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is majestic in the heights.”

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the great sea may lift up
its powerful waves to heaven,

00:29:50.768 --> 00:29:54.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is no match for our majestic,
Almighty God.

00:29:56.565 --> 00:30:01.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s powerful ability
to perfectly control the oceans

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:03.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us great confidence

00:30:03.572 --> 00:30:06.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is also perfectly capable

00:30:06.241 --> 00:30:09.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of protecting us, his people.

00:30:09.578 --> 00:30:14.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Jeremiah 5:22, notice how Jehovah

00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds his people of his power.

00:30:17.586 --> 00:30:20.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 5:22:

00:30:20.923 --> 00:30:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do you not fear me?’ declares Jehovah,

00:30:23.967 --> 00:30:26.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Should you not tremble before me?

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘It is I who placed the sand

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:32.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘as the boundary for the sea,

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:36.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘a permanent regulation
that it cannot pass over.

00:30:36.522 --> 00:30:40.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Although its waves toss,
they cannot prevail;

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:45.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although they roar,
they still cannot pass beyond it.’”

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Almighty God placed the sand

00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:52.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the boundary for the sea.

00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:55.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when its furious waves pound against sand,

00:30:55.541 --> 00:30:59.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sand absorbs their impact
and the force vanishes.

00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:04.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since Jehovah controls
the literal roaring sea

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:06.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from going beyond its boundaries,

00:31:06.844 --> 00:31:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can he not also protect his people

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the wicked sea of humanity threatens us

00:31:12.433 --> 00:31:14.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with its violent storms?

00:31:15.936 --> 00:31:20.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s control over vast waters
was well demonstrated

00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he protected the Israelites

00:31:23.152 --> 00:31:27.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by allowing them to cross
the Red Sea on dry land.

00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:30.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Red Sea has an average depth

00:31:30.534 --> 00:31:33.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of over 1,600 feet.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is estimated that at the point
where the Israelites crossed it,

00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:42.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the depth of the sea was as much as 50 feet.

00:31:42.963 --> 00:31:47.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine being an Israelite
walking through this corridor

00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:49.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with walls of water on each side of you

00:31:49.803 --> 00:31:53.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 50 feet high.

00:31:53.056 --> 00:31:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Jehovah used
those same walls of water to collapse,

00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drowning their enemies, the Egyptians.

00:32:01.106 --> 00:32:04.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah controlled those vast waters

00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver an entire nation
from a world power.

00:32:09.323 --> 00:32:11.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you recall the account

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:15.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Mark 4:37-39

00:32:15.412 --> 00:32:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when God empowered his Son, Jesus,

00:32:18.373 --> 00:32:21.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to control the sea and the wind?

00:32:22.085 --> 00:32:26.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus and the disciples
were crossing the Sea of Galilee in a boat,

00:32:26.507 --> 00:32:30.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great windstorm caused the sea to rage,

00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:33.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it threatened to fill up their boat.

00:32:33.013 --> 00:32:35.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus do?

00:32:35.015 --> 00:32:39.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He commanded the wind and the sea
with the words, “Hush!

00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:41.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be quiet!”

00:32:41.522 --> 00:32:45.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the raging wind and sea calmed down.

00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:49.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on this occasion, Jesus showed
what he will do

00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:52.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as King of God’s Kingdom
during the millennium.

00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:55.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will control forces of nature.

00:32:55.577 --> 00:32:59.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be no need to fear the ocean.

00:33:00.207 --> 00:33:02.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, disastrous storms

00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:06.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are becoming more frequent and severe.

00:33:06.338 --> 00:33:09.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What used to be considered extreme

00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:14.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—massive floods, killer droughts,
and monster snow storms—

00:33:14.221 --> 00:33:16.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the new normal.

00:33:16.682 --> 00:33:20.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many experts now put the blame
on human activity

00:33:20.227 --> 00:33:23.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has affected the oceans and the climate.

00:33:23.814 --> 00:33:28.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, men continue to ruin
the earth today.

00:33:28.402 --> 00:33:30.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s the good news.

00:33:30.404 --> 00:33:33.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the millennium,
by means of his Kingdom,

00:33:33.282 --> 00:33:38.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wise Creator will undo
all the damage done by humans.

00:33:38.078 --> 00:33:42.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything will function in harmony
with Jehovah’s principles,

00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:46.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will learn how to properly care
for this beautiful planet.

00:33:46.962 --> 00:33:51.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, everything will be brought back
into proper balance,

00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:55.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the climate and the oceans.

00:33:56.471 --> 00:34:01.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While some men today fear that the earth
will be destroyed because of man’s abuse,

00:34:01.184 --> 00:34:04.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us this comforting promise

00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:08.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 104:5,

00:34:08.442 --> 00:34:11.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 104:5:

00:34:14.364 --> 00:34:18.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He has established the earth
on its foundations;

00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:21.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it will not be moved from its place

00:34:21.288 --> 00:34:24.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forever and ever.”

00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:27.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the beautiful, deep, and dark blue ocean

00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will roll on forever.

00:34:29.838 --> 00:34:33.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Creator will make sure of that.

00:34:33.216 --> 00:34:35.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By our observing the oceans

00:34:35.594 --> 00:34:37.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditating on what we see,

00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:42.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can build our faith that soon
we will enjoy Jehovah’s creation

00:34:42.726 --> 00:34:45.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forever without fear.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:34:50.108 --> 00:34:53.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:34:53.737 --> 00:34:58.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith—Forests.”

00:35:04.748 --> 00:35:07.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would we do without forests?

00:35:07.918 --> 00:35:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Forests help to sustain
our supply of fresh water,

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they purify the air,

00:35:14.383 --> 00:35:17.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forests convert carbon dioxide

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into life-sustaining oxygen.

00:35:20.138 --> 00:35:25.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, forests are vital to our existence.

00:35:25.143 --> 00:35:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, scientists warn
that we’re in danger of losing

00:35:28.772 --> 00:35:31.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious resource.

00:35:31.066 --> 00:35:33.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This causes some people to wonder

00:35:33.318 --> 00:35:37.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether God cares
about what’s happening to the forest.

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may even ask, ‘Will the loss of forests

00:35:41.284 --> 00:35:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affect God’s ability to fulfill his promise
to make the earth a paradise?’

00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:50.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer to that question

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is absolutely not!

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has everything under control.

00:35:57.384 --> 00:35:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will strengthen your faith

00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:04.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Designer of the forest.

00:36:09.229 --> 00:36:12.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trees can grow very strong

00:36:12.899 --> 00:36:15.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and withstand powerful forces.

00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:25.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if they didn’t decompose after they die,

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trees and leaves would pile up

00:36:28.248 --> 00:36:31.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their nutrients locked away inside.

00:36:31.293 --> 00:36:33.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, they do decompose.

00:36:33.879 --> 00:36:35.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:36:37.632 --> 00:36:41.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most animals cannot eat
fallen wood and leaves,

00:36:43.764 --> 00:36:45.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but fungi can.

00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:50.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They break down the dead plant tissues,

00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:52.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making them softer.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beetles and termites

00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:59.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bore through the wood,
exposing more surface area

00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:01.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and spreading the fungi inside,

00:37:02.824 --> 00:37:05.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which soften it further
so that other insects

00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:07.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can enjoy the feast.

00:37:08.914 --> 00:37:12.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earthworms aerate the soil

00:37:12.167 --> 00:37:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull nutrients down
where they can be used by other plants.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decomposers have been called

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:25.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:37:28.725 --> 00:37:31.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They recycle organic matter
so that it is available

00:37:31.978 --> 00:37:34.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support new life.

00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:38.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through this process,

00:37:38.068 --> 00:37:42.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made it possible for us
to enjoy earth’s lush beauty

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—generation after generation.

00:37:48.078 --> 00:37:51.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let the fields
and everything in them rejoice.

00:37:51.498 --> 00:37:54.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At the same time let all the trees

00:37:54.376 --> 00:37:57.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the forest shout joyfully.”

00:38:01.842 --> 00:38:03.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazing!

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you ever look at a forest
in the same way again?

00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:12.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what the decomposition
and recycling of organic matter

00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means for us and our future.

00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:19.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those beetles, termites, and earthworms

00:38:19.484 --> 00:38:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the unsung heroes of the natural world—

00:38:22.612 --> 00:38:26.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will keep on doing their job
throughout eternity.

00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:30.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect for a moment:

00:38:30.036 --> 00:38:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah had the wisdom to create forests

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can replenish themselves,

00:38:36.501 --> 00:38:40.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely he knows how to undo the damage

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:42.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that man has done to the earth.

00:38:43.842 --> 00:38:48.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hasn’t revealed all the details
of how he is going to restore the earth,

00:38:48.513 --> 00:38:52.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can be confident
that he will fulfill his promise

00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:55.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make “all things new.”

00:38:55.353 --> 00:38:56.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 37:10, 11, 29.

00:39:01.693 --> 00:39:03.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture contains a promise

00:39:03.987 --> 00:39:08.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding man and the earth.

00:39:08.074 --> 00:39:13.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 37:10, 11, 29

00:39:13.038 --> 00:39:14.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reads:

00:39:14.748 --> 00:39:18.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just a little while longer,
and the wicked will be no more;

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:23.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will look at where they were,
and they will not be there.

00:39:23.381 --> 00:39:26.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the meek will possess the earth,

00:39:26.301 --> 00:39:29.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:39:29.054 --> 00:39:32.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the abundance of peace.

00:39:32.224 --> 00:39:34.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,

00:39:34.726 --> 00:39:38.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will live forever on it.”

00:39:39.105 --> 00:39:41.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring!

00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:44.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who are righteous and meek

00:39:44.152 --> 00:39:46.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be on the earth forever,

00:39:46.154 --> 00:39:49.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that earth will be a paradise.

00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:54.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are at least two requirements

00:39:54.412 --> 00:39:56.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah to accomplish this.

00:39:56.915 --> 00:39:59.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s already taken care
of the first requirement.

00:39:59.751 --> 00:40:02.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw proof of that in the video.

00:40:02.462 --> 00:40:04.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created the forest

00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:08.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an amazing rejuvenation system.

00:40:08.885 --> 00:40:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in spite of man’s prolonged misuse
of the forest,

00:40:13.014 --> 00:40:15.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has already put in place

00:40:15.433 --> 00:40:18.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mechanism to undo

00:40:18.103 --> 00:40:21.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the damage that man has done.

00:40:22.315 --> 00:40:25.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t the marvelous design of the forest

00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:30.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build your faith in Jehovah’s promise
of a paradise?

00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:33.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second requirement
to make the earth a paradise

00:40:33.618 --> 00:40:36.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described in verse 10

00:40:36.162 --> 00:40:39.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Psalm 37 that we just read.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:40:41.042 --> 00:40:45.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the wicked will be no more.”

00:40:45.463 --> 00:40:49.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only will Jehovah undo
the damage that men have done

00:40:49.843 --> 00:40:53.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will also remove
the source of the problem.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:56.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greedy men who exploit and misuse

00:40:56.725 --> 00:41:00.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious resource will be gone.

00:41:00.228 --> 00:41:03.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, we have no reason to fear

00:41:03.565 --> 00:41:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that humans will continue to ruin the earth

00:41:06.276 --> 00:41:10.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it reaches the point of no return.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows what is going on.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Revelation chapter 11,

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 18.

00:41:19.748 --> 00:41:23.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture assures us
that Jehovah cares about our planet

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is his planet,

00:41:26.463 --> 00:41:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it confirms

00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:33.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is going to hold men accountable
for their actions.

00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:37.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 11:18 says:

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:42.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the nations became wrathful,
and your own wrath came,

00:41:42.145 --> 00:41:45.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the appointed time came
for the dead to be judged

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:49.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to reward your slaves the prophets
and the holy ones

00:41:49.402 --> 00:41:52.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those fearing your name,
the small and the great,

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:56.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to bring to ruin

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:59.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those ruining the earth.”

00:41:59.954 --> 00:42:04.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is not going to let wicked men

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:07.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ruin his beautiful creation.

00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:10.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing can stop Jehovah

00:42:10.256 --> 00:42:13.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from carrying out his purpose for the earth.

00:42:14.344 --> 00:42:18.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our examination of the forest
has strengthened our faith

00:42:18.056 --> 00:42:22.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will accomplish
everything that he has in mind to do.

00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:27.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words of faithful Job
reflect our conviction

00:42:27.273 --> 00:42:29.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that promise will come true.

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:32.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As recorded at Job 42:2,

00:42:32.779 --> 00:42:36.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job was moved to declare regarding Jehovah:

00:42:36.157 --> 00:42:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that you are able
to do all things

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:43.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that nothing you have in mind to do

00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is impossible for you.”

00:42:46.876 --> 00:42:49.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jehovah have in mind to do?

00:42:49.754 --> 00:42:54.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One thing is to transform the earth
into a paradise

00:42:54.342 --> 00:42:57.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with rich, abundant forests

00:42:57.846 --> 00:43:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—forests that will continue to help sustain
our supply of fresh water,

00:43:02.058 --> 00:43:04.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to purify our air,

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The video that we just watched

00:43:10.733 --> 00:43:14.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quoted Psalm 96:12, which declares:

00:43:14.446 --> 00:43:18.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let all the trees of the forest
shout joyfully.”

00:43:19.284 --> 00:43:24.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By their very existence,
forests praise their Creator.

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can add our joyful shouts of praise

00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:30.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those of the forest.

00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:35.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, may we continue to use creation

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our faith,

00:43:37.969 --> 00:43:39.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if we do that,

00:43:39.971 --> 00:43:43.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will see
the restored life-sustaining forests

00:43:43.808 --> 00:43:46.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring happiness to perfect humans

00:43:46.102 --> 00:43:50.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise to their Creator, Jehovah,
forever.

00:43:51.691 --> 00:43:54.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Leonard Myers,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:58.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

00:43:58.323 --> 00:44:03.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith
—Wind and Water.”

00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think of events
that will soon happen,

00:44:13.296 --> 00:44:16.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the great tribulation
and Armageddon,

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t you agree that we need
to build our faith now?

00:44:19.886 --> 00:44:23.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if you turn with me
to Ezekiel chapter 38

00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you may want to put a marker there),

00:44:25.475 --> 00:44:29.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 14 and 15 describe the time
when God’s people will experience

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:34.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an all-out assault by those determined
to destroy pure worship.

00:44:34.776 --> 00:44:37.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 14 mentions that Gog

00:44:37.612 --> 00:44:39.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—or, as we know, a coalition of nations—

00:44:39.822 --> 00:44:42.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will come against God’s people.

00:44:42.116 --> 00:44:45.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And though verse 18 states that on that day

00:44:45.203 --> 00:44:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s “great rage will flare up”
against his enemies,

00:44:48.998 --> 00:44:52.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question is,
Will you and I remain confident

00:44:52.919 --> 00:44:56.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s promise to rescue his people?

00:44:56.464 --> 00:45:00.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can build our faith
by considering another aspect of creation,

00:45:00.426 --> 00:45:04.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the awesome power of wind and water.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please allow the following video
to strengthen your faith.

00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:25.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail

00:45:26.327 --> 00:45:30.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—though it is made of ice,
it is very different from snow.

00:45:36.212 --> 00:45:39.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail usually forms in warm weather

00:45:39.674 --> 00:45:42.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when turbulent air produces thunderstorms

00:45:42.969 --> 00:45:45.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with powerful updrafts.

00:45:46.598 --> 00:45:50.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those updrafts can pull a piece of dust

00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:54.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ice high into the cloud,
where water freezes around it.

00:45:55.023 --> 00:45:58.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each trip up into the cloud
adds a layer of ice

00:45:58.693 --> 00:46:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waits

00:46:00.737 --> 00:46:02.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it becomes

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:05.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a hailstone that is heavy enough to fall.

00:46:11.122 --> 00:46:14.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hailstorms can be powerfully destructive.

00:46:18.713 --> 00:46:21.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One deadly storm dropped hailstones

00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:23.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
weighing more than one kilogram (2 lbs) each.

00:46:27.555 --> 00:46:31.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used hail to demonstrate his power

00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:33.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and defend his people,

00:46:33.353 --> 00:46:36.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as during
the seventh plague against Egypt.

00:46:38.316 --> 00:46:40.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Joshua fought the Amorites,

00:46:40.902 --> 00:46:43.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused a great hailstorm,

00:46:43.488 --> 00:46:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more Amorites died from the hailstones

00:46:46.783 --> 00:46:48.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than in battle.

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hail is also mentioned among the elements

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will use in the future

00:46:56.209 --> 00:46:58.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against those who attack his people.

00:47:00.004 --> 00:47:03.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you seen the storehouses of the hail,

00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which I have reserved
for the . . . day of battle and war?”

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the video showed,
wind and water in the form of hail

00:47:13.935 --> 00:47:17.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are powerful and can
at times be very destructive.

00:47:17.689 --> 00:47:22.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a report in <i>Awake!</i>
magazine some years ago reported

00:47:22.193 --> 00:47:25.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times humans are hurt
—even killed—

00:47:25.988 --> 00:47:29.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by hailstones weighing
as much as one and a half pounds

00:47:29.659 --> 00:47:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as big as five inches in diameter.

00:47:33.329 --> 00:47:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s larger than this ball.

00:47:36.332 --> 00:47:40.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there are scientific reports
of even larger hailstones.

00:47:40.962 --> 00:47:45.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we know, Jehovah can use wind
and water to fight for his people.

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, he is the Source
of these natural forces,

00:47:49.011 --> 00:47:51.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can control them perfectly.

00:47:51.848 --> 00:47:54.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 147,

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:57.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice that together
—Psalm 147—

00:47:57.729 --> 00:48:00.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll look at verses 17 and 18

00:48:00.648 --> 00:48:04.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the assurance that Jehovah
is the Source of these natural forces,

00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 147:17:

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:12.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He hurls down his hailstones
like morsels of bread.

00:48:12.118 --> 00:48:14.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who can withstand his cold?

00:48:14.287 --> 00:48:17.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He sends out his word, and they melt.

00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:22.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes his wind blow,
and the waters flow.”

00:48:22.044 --> 00:48:25.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice to whom
these natural forces belong?

00:48:25.506 --> 00:48:29.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17 speaks of “<i>his </i> hailstones.”

00:48:29.177 --> 00:48:33.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 18 says: “He makes <i>his</i>  wind blow.”

00:48:33.306 --> 00:48:37.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the Source,
and he can control them.

00:48:37.268 --> 00:48:39.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He proved this in the past.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the examples
given in the video?

00:48:42.523 --> 00:48:45.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was the account in Joshua chapter 10

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:48.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Israelites
were fighting the Amorites.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:52.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11 states that “while [the Amorites]
were fleeing from Israel . . . ,

00:48:52.116 --> 00:48:54.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah hurled great hailstones

00:48:54.619 --> 00:48:57.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the sky on them . . . ,
and they perished.

00:48:57.622 --> 00:49:00.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, more died from the hail

00:49:00.416 --> 00:49:03.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than from the sword of the Israelites.”

00:49:03.503 --> 00:49:07.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah can create
such powerful elements and control them,

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that should build our faith.

00:49:09.884 --> 00:49:14.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should convince us that he’ll be able
to use these powerful elements

00:49:14.013 --> 00:49:18.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the future when he defends
his people at Armageddon.

00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:22.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The video partially quoted
a scripture that emphasizes that point.

00:49:22.563 --> 00:49:26.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it together—Job chapter 38,

00:49:26.567 --> 00:49:29.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 38,

00:49:29.946 --> 00:49:34.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice with me verses 22 and 23.

00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:37.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 38:22:

00:49:37.954 --> 00:49:41.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have you entered
the storehouses of the snow,

00:49:41.332 --> 00:49:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or have you seen
the storehouses of the hail,

00:49:44.627 --> 00:49:47.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which I have reserved
for the time of distress,

00:49:47.296 --> 00:49:50.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the day of battle and war?”

00:49:50.466 --> 00:49:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that Jehovah
says he ‘has storehouses of hail

00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:57.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reserved for the day of battle’?

00:49:57.223 --> 00:50:01.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 135:7 mentions ‘storehouses of wind.’

00:50:02.979 --> 00:50:06.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these verses, Jehovah speaks
of things he’s reserved under his control

00:50:06.899 --> 00:50:09.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for special purposes.

00:50:09.402 --> 00:50:13.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this knowledge
of Jehovah’s storehouses build our faith?

00:50:15.324 --> 00:50:18.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re attacked during
the great tribulation by God’s enemies,

00:50:18.536 --> 00:50:21.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how powerful
or threatening they may seem,

00:50:21.706 --> 00:50:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can’t possibly survive Jehovah’s anger.

00:50:25.334 --> 00:50:28.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if we go back
to Ezekiel chapter 38

00:50:28.921 --> 00:50:31.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and glance at verse 22,

00:50:31.257 --> 00:50:35.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see things Jehovah will use
against those enemies of pure worship.

00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:38.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides pestilence, fire, and sulfur,

00:50:38.389 --> 00:50:40.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what else Jehovah will use.

00:50:40.516 --> 00:50:43.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the middle of the verse, it says:

00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:46.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will rain down a torrential downpour

00:50:46.647 --> 00:50:49.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hailstones.”

00:50:49.191 --> 00:50:51.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah will use water.

00:50:51.819 --> 00:50:54.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He may use hailstones of undisclosed size

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy those wicked humans.

00:50:57.825 --> 00:51:02.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, during that time,
will we need to fear the natural elements?

00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:04.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:51:04.332 --> 00:51:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Peter 2:9 assures us:

00:51:07.376 --> 00:51:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows how to rescue people

00:51:10.046 --> 00:51:12.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of godly devotion out of trial.”

00:51:12.632 --> 00:51:15.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will perfectly control
the natural elements

00:51:15.801 --> 00:51:18.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so his people are not harmed.

00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:22.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This knowledge about the awesome power
of wind and water

00:51:22.808 --> 00:51:25.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should make us powerful by faith.

00:51:25.603 --> 00:51:30.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should build our faith not only in
Jehovah’s ability to protect us in the future

00:51:30.483 --> 00:51:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in his protection now.

00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:37.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, we have no reason to fear bans

00:51:37.114 --> 00:51:39.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or threats from worldly governments.

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:41.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The One who controls the storehouses

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:44.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the wind and hail is our Helper.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Hebrews 13:6,

00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:50.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not need to “be afraid.”

00:51:50.127 --> 00:51:53.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s true now,
and it will be true in the future

00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:55.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah brings the natural elements

00:51:55.841 --> 00:51:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his disposal against our enemies.

00:51:58.928 --> 00:52:03.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his assurance
at the end of Ezekiel chapter 38;

00:52:03.099 --> 00:52:05.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice verse 23:

00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will certainly magnify myself
and sanctify myself

00:52:09.772 --> 00:52:13.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and make myself known
before the eyes of many nations;

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:18.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will have
to know that I am Jehovah.”

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a thrilling time that will be!

00:52:21.033 --> 00:52:24.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As these enemies are defeated,
they will know that it is

00:52:24.578 --> 00:52:28.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God who is bringing
destruction upon them.

00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:31.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May our anticipation of that happy outcome

00:52:31.669 --> 00:52:35.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our study of creation build our faith now

00:52:35.381 --> 00:52:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we confidently look forward
to Jehovah’s complete victory.

00:52:41.887 --> 00:52:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Robert Luccioni,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:52:44.807 --> 00:52:47.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:52:47.184 --> 00:52:51.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith
—Sea Creatures.”

00:52:58.112 --> 00:53:02.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you struggling to provide
for yourself or your family?

00:53:02.658 --> 00:53:05.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many today lack the basic necessities,

00:53:05.578 --> 00:53:09.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as food, clean water, adequate housing.

00:53:09.665 --> 00:53:14.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this causes some to question
whether God really cares about humans.

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:17.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as Jehovah’s people, we are different.

00:53:17.548 --> 00:53:22.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah
cares for all of his creation.

00:53:22.344 --> 00:53:24.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we all know

00:53:24.346 --> 00:53:28.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it is a test of our faith
when things get difficult.

00:53:28.768 --> 00:53:31.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is,
How can we build our faith

00:53:31.937 --> 00:53:36.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we are strong and so that it
can help us get through difficult times?

00:53:37.568 --> 00:53:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way is by examining how Jehovah

00:53:40.196 --> 00:53:42.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides for his animal creation.

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that helpful?

00:53:45.201 --> 00:53:48.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that examination gives us confidence

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will care for us as well.

00:53:50.539 --> 00:53:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example, in the following video,

00:53:53.209 --> 00:53:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Jehovah provides food
for a massive sea creature.

00:54:02.218 --> 00:54:05.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The largest animal alive on earth today

00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:11.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is also the largest that has ever lived

00:54:13.562 --> 00:54:15.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the blue whale.

00:54:22.988 --> 00:54:24.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales can grow to be

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 30 meters (98 feet) long

00:54:27.284 --> 00:54:30.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and weigh up to 180 tons.

00:54:32.206 --> 00:54:35.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its heart alone may weigh
several hundred kilograms.

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:41.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does such a large creature
find enough to eat?

00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:47.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The blue whale migrates great distances

00:54:47.429 --> 00:54:51.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find tiny crustaceans

00:54:51.809 --> 00:54:53.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
known as krill.

00:54:53.853 --> 00:54:55.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a blue whale

00:54:55.896 --> 00:54:58.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
finds a school of krill,

00:54:58.983 --> 00:55:01.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it accelerates toward the krill

00:55:01.026 --> 00:55:03.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and opens its giant mouth.

00:55:05.906 --> 00:55:09.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may engulf
hundreds of kilograms of krill

00:55:09.118 --> 00:55:13.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each lunge

00:55:13.164 --> 00:55:16.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
amounting to several tons per day.

00:55:18.794 --> 00:55:21.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blue whales eat a lot.

00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:27.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah provides for them,

00:55:33.058 --> 00:55:35.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will provide for us.

00:55:44.236 --> 00:55:47.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is the sea, so great and wide,

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teeming with countless living things,

00:55:50.618 --> 00:55:53.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both small and great.”

00:55:57.917 --> 00:56:00.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we are amazed at the way Jehovah

00:56:00.377 --> 00:56:04.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides for all of his animal creation,
including the sea creatures.

00:56:04.882 --> 00:56:07.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes this well

00:56:07.092 --> 00:56:12.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you look at Psalm 104:27, 28

00:56:12.097 --> 00:56:14.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 104:27, 28:

00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All of them wait for you
to give them their food in its season.

00:56:20.689 --> 00:56:23.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you give them, they gather.

00:56:23.609 --> 00:56:28.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you open your hand,
they are satisfied with good things.”

00:56:28.906 --> 00:56:33.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, meditating on this
aspect of creation builds our faith.

00:56:33.953 --> 00:56:36.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, from the video,

00:56:36.247 --> 00:56:39.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you remember the size of this creature?

00:56:39.416 --> 00:56:42.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine
if you had the assignment

00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:44.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed just one blue whale?

00:56:44.922 --> 00:56:48.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just make sure
that one whale has enough to eat every day.

00:56:48.342 --> 00:56:49.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that?

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we start?

00:56:51.262 --> 00:56:53.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d have to hire teams of people

00:56:53.264 --> 00:56:56.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and figure out how to get the food
and how to move the food

00:56:56.558 --> 00:57:00.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where the blue whale is swimming
(after we figure out where it’s swimming).

00:57:00.813 --> 00:57:03.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, it would be a full-time job!

00:57:03.023 --> 00:57:07.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that would be to feed just one whale,
and there are thousands of them.

00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, Jehovah has it
all arranged day after day.

00:57:11.448 --> 00:57:13.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t even think about it.

00:57:13.826 --> 00:57:15.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You notice here in verse 27,

00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:20.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that “all of them wait
for [Jehovah] to give them their food.”

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it doesn’t mean that the whale
just kind of floats on the top of the water

00:57:23.419 --> 00:57:25.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waits for food to jump in its mouth.

00:57:25.713 --> 00:57:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it swims; it looks for the food.

00:57:27.715 --> 00:57:29.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it finds it, it goes after it.

00:57:29.883 --> 00:57:32.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah provides it.

00:57:33.262 --> 00:57:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 28, it says:
“What [he] give[s] them, they gather.”

00:57:38.267 --> 00:57:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you cannot imagine
that blue whale thinking: ‘Come on, really?

00:57:42.104 --> 00:57:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m 180 tons, and you’re
going to feed me with a little crustacean?

00:57:46.984 --> 00:57:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Couldn’t we have just worked out
that I eat a couple of big tuna every day?’

00:57:51.196 --> 00:57:54.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they gather what Jehovah gives them.

00:57:54.825 --> 00:57:56.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 28 goes on to say

00:57:56.827 --> 00:58:00.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “they are satisfied
with” Jehovah’s provisions.

00:58:00.622 --> 00:58:02.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:05.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you notice
the comment in the video?

00:58:05.794 --> 00:58:08.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Jehovah provides for them,

00:58:08.964 --> 00:58:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will provide for us.”

00:58:12.051 --> 00:58:15.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, meditating on creation
can build our faith

00:58:15.346 --> 00:58:19.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strengthen our faith—
in Jehovah’s support.

00:58:19.558 --> 00:58:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note the four lessons that we learn

00:58:22.478 --> 00:58:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from how Jehovah cares for his creation.

00:58:25.814 --> 00:58:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is that if Jehovah has the desire

00:58:30.152 --> 00:58:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for animals
and provide for their needs,

00:58:34.156 --> 00:58:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think that Jehovah has the desire

00:58:36.825 --> 00:58:39.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for you and your family?

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:44.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Jesus
expressed at Matthew 6:26,

00:58:44.124 --> 00:58:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he explained
how Jehovah cares for His creation,

00:58:48.045 --> 00:58:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the small birds, and he said:

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:54.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are you not worth more than they are?”

00:58:54.093 --> 00:58:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, if Jehovah feels compelled
to care for his animal creation,

00:58:58.138 --> 00:59:01.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can be assured that he feels compelled

00:59:01.141 --> 00:59:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for you and your family.

00:59:04.937 --> 00:59:07.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second lesson is that we do not need

00:59:07.272 --> 00:59:10.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be unduly anxious about tomorrow.

00:59:10.651 --> 00:59:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we can confidently ask
Jehovah for our daily needs.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Matthew 6:31, 32

00:59:20.452 --> 00:59:23.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 6:31, 32.

00:59:23.622 --> 00:59:27.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “So never be anxious and say,

00:59:27.042 --> 00:59:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘‘‘What are we to eat?’

00:59:29.086 --> 00:59:33.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or, ‘What are we to drink?’
or, ‘What are we to wear?’

00:59:33.507 --> 00:59:37.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all these are the things
the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your heavenly Father knows
that you need all these things.”

00:59:42.182 --> 00:59:44.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah knows we need them.

00:59:44.184 --> 00:59:49.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows exactly what we need,
and he promises to provide it.

00:59:49.189 --> 00:59:51.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Jehovah has the capacity

00:59:51.608 --> 00:59:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feed a 180-ton blue whale,

00:59:55.988 --> 01:00:00.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you think he has the capacity
to feed you and me and our families?

01:00:00.659 --> 01:00:02.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

01:00:02.077 --> 01:00:06.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we do the best that we can,
and then we trust in Jehovah to do the rest.

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like it mentioned
there in Psalms with the animal creation,

01:00:10.461 --> 01:00:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we “wait” on Jehovah
and we “are satisfied with” what he provides.

01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point is that Jehovah
will not abandon us when we face trials.

01:00:21.597 --> 01:00:26.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Hebrews chapter 13
and the latter part of verse 5

01:00:27.311 --> 01:00:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 13:5.

01:00:29.646 --> 01:00:32.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I will never leave you,

01:00:32.065 --> 01:00:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will never abandon us.

01:00:37.112 --> 01:00:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will care for us
even through our hard times.

01:00:40.532 --> 01:00:42.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can that help us?

01:00:42.534 --> 01:00:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that can help us to make good decisions

01:00:44.953 --> 01:00:47.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good decisions regarding our employment,

01:00:47.164 --> 01:00:50.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
care for our family, worship of Jehovah.

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We well remember
Jesus’ words at Matthew 6:33,

01:00:54.838 --> 01:00:57.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he says:
“[Seek] first the Kingdom . . .

01:00:57.257 --> 01:01:01.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these other things
will be [given] to you.”

01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:05.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, our fourth point:

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:08.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promises that he will abundantly care

01:01:08.227 --> 01:01:11.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all of our needs in the future.

01:01:11.271 --> 01:01:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We think of that beautiful promise
at Isaiah 65:22,

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:19.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says: “For the days of my people

01:01:19.196 --> 01:01:22.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be like the days of a tree.”

01:01:22.324 --> 01:01:26.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the blue whale 
is thought to live 80 to 90 years,

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:28.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah keeps providing for it.

01:01:28.997 --> 01:01:32.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He does not have
a limited supply of provisions.

01:01:32.584 --> 01:01:36.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that gives us confidence
that it’s not beyond Jehovah’s ability

01:01:36.713 --> 01:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill his promise
and care for us through all eternity.

01:01:41.718 --> 01:01:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Jehovah’s Word and his creation

01:01:45.472 --> 01:01:50.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give us irrefutable proof
of his constant, loving care

01:01:50.435 --> 01:01:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—proof that he cares for us today,

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:56.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proof that he will care for us
through our difficult days,

01:01:56.191 --> 01:02:00.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and proof that he will care for us
through all eternity.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may all of us continue to build our faith,

01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:09.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fortify our trust in Jehovah,
become powerful by faith.

01:02:09.663 --> 01:02:12.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need that faith now,

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:16.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we most definitely
will need it to face what is to come.

01:02:17.504 --> 01:02:20.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Brother Ron Curzan,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:02:20.757 --> 01:02:24.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present
the final talk of this symposium,

01:02:24.011 --> 01:02:28.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use Creation to Build Your Faith
—Our Bodies.”

01:02:35.272 --> 01:02:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you tired of being tired?

01:02:38.358 --> 01:02:41.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you sick of being sick?

01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:46.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us are feeling the impact
of living in this old system of things.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we do?

01:02:48.702 --> 01:02:50.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we try to improve our health

01:02:50.704 --> 01:02:54.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or find some relief by medical means

01:02:54.124 --> 01:02:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by improving our diet,

01:02:56.752 --> 01:02:59.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exercise, and getting more rest.

01:02:59.504 --> 01:03:01.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the bottom line is,

01:03:01.548 --> 01:03:04.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are infected with sin,

01:03:04.176 --> 01:03:06.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with sin comes sickness

01:03:06.595 --> 01:03:09.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the effects of aging.

01:03:09.931 --> 01:03:14.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s promise after promise,
but are they really true?

01:03:14.603 --> 01:03:17.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no pill, medicine,

01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:20.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
diet, or exercise program

01:03:20.233 --> 01:03:22.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can give us complete relief

01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:25.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—removal of sickness

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:30.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, what we really want
and what we need, perfect health.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is a promise
recorded in God’s Word

01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:36.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that does give us confidence.

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:40.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this together
at Isaiah chapter 33.

01:03:40.462 --> 01:03:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Isaiah chapter 33,

01:03:42.464 --> 01:03:45.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice the reassuring words from Jehovah

01:03:45.425 --> 01:03:48.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the prophet Isaiah in verse 24.

01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:50.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there it says:

01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:55.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And no resident
[no one] will say: ‘I am sick.’

01:03:55.686 --> 01:03:59.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people dwelling in the land
will be pardoned for their error.”

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So sin will be removed in God’s new world.

01:04:04.653 --> 01:04:06.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you believe that?

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we really put faith in Jehovah’s promise?

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:12.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:16.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not just another empty promise
by a human.

01:04:16.373 --> 01:04:19.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This comes from our Creator, Jehovah.

01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:22.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he can guarantee it.

01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:25.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can we do today

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:29.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build up our faith in those promises?

01:04:29.386 --> 01:04:31.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as highlighted in this symposium,

01:04:31.763 --> 01:04:34.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can take the time and stop

01:04:34.224 --> 01:04:36.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at Jehovah’s creation.

01:04:36.727 --> 01:04:38.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s do that right now.

01:04:38.729 --> 01:04:41.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine the human body

01:04:41.273 --> 01:04:44.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its amazing ability to repair itself.

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video.

01:04:54.745 --> 01:04:56.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our bones

01:04:56.204 --> 01:04:58.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are amazing.

01:04:59.875 --> 01:05:02.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They support our bodies,

01:05:02.794 --> 01:05:05.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protect our organs,

01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:10.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and store almost all

01:05:10.427 --> 01:05:11.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the body’s calcium

01:05:11.928 --> 01:05:13.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a mineral essential

01:05:13.764 --> 01:05:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our health.

01:05:17.267 --> 01:05:19.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For their weight,

01:05:19.519 --> 01:05:22.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bones are very strong.

01:05:24.524 --> 01:05:27.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The feet of a track and field jumper

01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:31.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may experience forces
of several times his body weight.

01:05:35.744 --> 01:05:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bones can compress and bend,

01:05:40.373 --> 01:05:44.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes they break.

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:49.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A fractured bone
can heal well if properly set.

01:05:50.884 --> 01:05:55.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inflammation brings
organic building blocks to the area,

01:05:55.222 --> 01:06:00.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soft tissue grows
between the broken pieces.

01:06:02.395 --> 01:06:06.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The soft tissue
is replaced with harder tissue.

01:06:07.984 --> 01:06:10.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The body replaces the harder tissue

01:06:10.737 --> 01:06:15.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with new bone until the repair is complete.

01:06:21.414 --> 01:06:23.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In children,

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:26.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the break may heal
without leaving a trace.

01:06:27.087 --> 01:06:30.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave every bone in our body

01:06:30.423 --> 01:06:34.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this incredible ability to heal.

01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:40.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way

01:06:40.225 --> 01:06:43.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am wonderfully made.”

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:52.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was an amazing video.

01:06:52.362 --> 01:06:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned a lot
about what happens on the inside.

01:06:55.365 --> 01:06:58.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We take it for granted
that when we get a cut or broken bone,

01:06:58.827 --> 01:07:02.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our body automatically heals itself.

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:04.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King David was very impressed

01:07:04.332 --> 01:07:08.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the way that he was made
and the way the human body works.

01:07:08.461 --> 01:07:11.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did not have the modern technology

01:07:11.715 --> 01:07:13.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knowledge that we have today

01:07:13.717 --> 01:07:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an X-ray machine or a microscope—

01:07:16.052 --> 01:07:19.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he observed Jehovah’s creation,

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew that we were designed
in an awe-inspiring way.

01:07:24.144 --> 01:07:28.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what he says at Psalm 139

01:07:28.857 --> 01:07:31.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 139:14—

01:07:31.693 --> 01:07:34.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you feel the same way.

01:07:34.237 --> 01:07:37.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“I praise you

01:07:37.198 --> 01:07:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because in an awe-inspiring way
I am wonderfully made.

01:07:42.078 --> 01:07:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your works are wonderful,
I know this very well.”

01:07:48.209 --> 01:07:52.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what helped David
to build a strong faith in Jehovah

01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:55.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his promises for the future?

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:56.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you read there?

01:07:56.801 --> 01:07:59.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “I know this very well.”

01:07:59.804 --> 01:08:02.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David took the time to stop

01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:05.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and observe Jehovah’s creations.

01:08:05.644 --> 01:08:09.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what helped him
to put faith in Jehovah.

01:08:09.272 --> 01:08:11.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he took the time,

01:08:11.816 --> 01:08:14.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be distracted
by other things going on around him,

01:08:14.486 --> 01:08:16.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to observe Jehovah’s creations.

01:08:16.821 --> 01:08:18.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what inspired him,

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:22.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what motivated him
to give praise to Jehovah.

01:08:22.285 --> 01:08:24.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to do the same.

01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:27.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are far
from the perfect health and life

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:30.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had intended for the future.

01:08:30.043 --> 01:08:34.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even so,
we are made in an awe-inspiring way.

01:08:34.214 --> 01:08:36.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to continue living.

01:08:36.508 --> 01:08:38.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s plain to see.

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:40.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we saw in the video,

01:08:40.053 --> 01:08:43.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our bodies are amazing in that they
can continue to repair themselves

01:08:43.848 --> 01:08:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even without a conscious thought.

01:08:46.726 --> 01:08:49.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But therein lies a problem.

01:08:49.562 --> 01:08:51.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could be so busy with our lives

01:08:51.773 --> 01:08:56.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t stop
and take that time to have a thought:

01:08:56.528 --> 01:08:59.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why did Jehovah make this?

01:08:59.114 --> 01:09:01.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he create me the way he did?’

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:05.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’re busy thinking
about how we’ll care for our families,

01:09:05.578 --> 01:09:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay the bills,
or maybe take care of our health.

01:09:08.748 --> 01:09:12.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like David, we need to stop, pause,

01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:16.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think deeply about what Jehovah has made.

01:09:16.089 --> 01:09:20.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t miss out on an opportunity
to be inspired, like David,

01:09:20.427 --> 01:09:24.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the inspiring creations around us.

01:09:24.597 --> 01:09:28.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:
If Jehovah could create our bodies

01:09:28.393 --> 01:09:31.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the ability to repair themselves,
like we saw in the video,

01:09:31.771 --> 01:09:34.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly heal all infirmities.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:37.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can reverse the aging process,

01:09:37.485 --> 01:09:40.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can prevent sickness in his new world.

01:09:41.948 --> 01:09:46.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While on earth, Jesus proved
with the power he was given from Jehovah

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:51.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could cure “every sort of disease
and every sort of infirmity.”

01:09:51.958 --> 01:09:55.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every sort” meant everything

01:09:55.295 --> 01:09:57.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from healing the blind, the lame,

01:09:57.797 --> 01:10:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those with epilepsy, leprosy

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:04.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raising the dead to life.

01:10:04.054 --> 01:10:09.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly is an amazing thing to ponder.

01:10:09.059 --> 01:10:12.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that must have been
an amazing thing to see back then.

01:10:12.103 --> 01:10:16.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what Jesus did
was just a preview on a small scale

01:10:16.316 --> 01:10:20.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what he will do
in the future worldwide on a large scale

01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under God’s Kingdom arrangement
during the Millennium.

01:10:25.075 --> 01:10:28.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will finally see
that promise we read in Isaiah

01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

01:10:31.164 --> 01:10:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:10:32.165 --> 01:10:35.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus will use his kingly power

01:10:35.001 --> 01:10:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring about perfect health
—yes, lasting health.

01:10:39.756 --> 01:10:43.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promises fill us with hope.

01:10:43.176 --> 01:10:47.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fill us with confidence
that every sort of disease and illness

01:10:47.597 --> 01:10:49.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—anything that we’re going through now—

01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:51.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is only temporary,

01:10:51.726 --> 01:10:55.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that permanent perfect health

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is soon to come.

01:10:57.607 --> 01:11:01.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium has considered examples
ranging from the heavens

01:11:01.986 --> 01:11:06.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the way to the inner workings
of our amazing bodies.

01:11:06.908 --> 01:11:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah left his imprint
on all of his creations.

01:11:10.912 --> 01:11:14.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The evidence is clearly seen; it’s evident.

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:17.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What must we do today

01:11:17.043 --> 01:11:21.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build our faith and confidence
in Jehovah’s promises?

01:11:21.589 --> 01:11:26.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Romans 1:20 has to say.

01:11:29.305 --> 01:11:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in verse 20,

01:11:31.641 --> 01:11:33.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 1:20:

01:11:33.977 --> 01:11:36.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen

01:11:36.771 --> 01:11:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the world’s creation onward, [why?]

01:11:40.024 --> 01:11:43.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because they are perceived
by the things made,

01:11:43.736 --> 01:11:46.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even his eternal power and Godship,

01:11:46.447 --> 01:11:49.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they are inexcusable.”

01:11:49.576 --> 01:11:52.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s focus in on the word “perceived.”

01:11:52.579 --> 01:11:56.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that the study note
says that “perceived” means

01:11:56.124 --> 01:11:59.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than just seeing something
with our literal eyes.

01:11:59.377 --> 01:12:02.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means “grasping [or understanding]

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with [our] mind.”

01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:06.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible translation says:

01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:10.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God’s qualities are
‘visible . . .  to the eye of reason.’”

01:12:10.221 --> 01:12:11.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s interesting.

01:12:11.848 --> 01:12:14.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we see Jehovah’s creations,

01:12:14.475 --> 01:12:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take the time, like David did,
to stop and think deeply.

01:12:18.855 --> 01:12:22.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate on what we can learn
from that creation

01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:25.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what it tells us about our Creator, Jehovah.

01:12:25.069 --> 01:12:29.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens
when we perceive Jehovah’s wisdom,

01:12:29.616 --> 01:12:33.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his power, his justice,
his love in creations?

01:12:33.119 --> 01:12:36.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It strengthens our faith
in his promises now

01:12:36.539 --> 01:12:39.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as in the future.

01:12:39.083 --> 01:12:42.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we always be inspired and stay inspired

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah’s awe-inspiring creations,

01:12:45.465 --> 01:12:48.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thus we will always be inspired

01:12:48.051 --> 01:12:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our Almighty God and Creator, Jehovah!

01:12:53.264 --> 01:12:55.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers,
for helping us think deeply

01:12:55.892 --> 01:12:59.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the things Jehovah has made
and the things he will do.

01:12:59.187 --> 01:13:03.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What wonderful blessings
we have to look forward to!

01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:08.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now invite you to sing song number 148,

01:13:08.279 --> 01:13:11.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “Jehovah Provides Escape.”

01:13:11.324 --> 01:13:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 148.

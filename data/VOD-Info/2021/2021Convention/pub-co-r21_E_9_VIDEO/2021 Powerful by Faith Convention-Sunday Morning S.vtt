Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our next music-video presentation
is about to begin.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch it, please reflect
on how you can imitate

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the faith of your brothers and sisters.

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy the presentation.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:51.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this session
of our “Powerful by Faith!” Convention,

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:54.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which corresponds
to the Sunday morning session

00:09:54.114 --> 00:09:56.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your printed program.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme is Jesus’ promise

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:04.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded at Matthew 21:21,
which says in part:

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:08.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:14.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to sing together
song number 137,

00:10:14.801 --> 00:10:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Faithful Women, Christian Sisters.”

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:22.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 137.

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, some consider women

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being inferior to men and of little worth.

00:13:10.393 --> 00:13:12.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How untrue!

00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:16.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see in this eight-part symposium,

00:13:16.316 --> 00:13:20.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is much that we can learn
from women of faith.

00:13:20.612 --> 00:13:24.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each speaker will introduce
the one to follow.

00:13:24.157 --> 00:13:28.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, let’s give our attention
to Brother Kenneth Cook,

00:13:28.328 --> 00:13:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:32.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he presents the talk entitled

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Sarah.”

00:13:45.512 --> 00:13:49.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our life experience,
there are many people we do not forget

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—both good and bad.

00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:54.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those we delight to call to mind,
or remember,

00:13:54.729 --> 00:13:58.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the people most important
and most loved to us.

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:02.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is true of Jehovah as well.

00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:06.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows everyone who has ever lived
—righteous and unrighteous—

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will resurrect millions of them.

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:12.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what he finds the greatest delight in

00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is remembering those with strong faith
who became his friends,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including many faithful women.

00:14:20.797 --> 00:14:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His Word is filled with accounts of women
who had strong faith.

00:14:25.802 --> 00:14:29.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This symposium will consider
faithful women from the past

00:14:29.973 --> 00:14:32.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with various backgrounds.

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will learn why they needed faith,

00:14:34.853 --> 00:14:36.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they showed faith,

00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:40.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how all of us can imitate their faith.

00:14:40.942 --> 00:14:45.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with the faithful woman, Sarah.

00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:47.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah needed faith.

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:48.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:51.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because like her husband, Abraham,

00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:54.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah accepted a nomadic lifestyle

00:14:54.205 --> 00:14:57.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah directed them to do so.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:59.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:8 says of Abraham

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:03.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “by faith [he] . . . obeyed
by going out to a place

00:15:03.798 --> 00:15:06.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that] he was to receive
as an inheritance . . . ,

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although not knowing where he was going.”

00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:15.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was true for Abraham
was true for Sarah as well.

00:15:15.435 --> 00:15:19.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Along with Abraham, she complied
with Jehovah’s direction

00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:23.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she left the prosperous city of Ur.

00:15:23.485 --> 00:15:26.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She no doubt had
to leave behind her relatives

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:29.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as material advantages.

00:15:29.574 --> 00:15:34.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Genesis 12:1
that Abraham was told:

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:39.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go out from your land
and away from your relatives.”

00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:42.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such moves are never easy.

00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:44.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, moving is known to be

00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:48.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the most stressful things
that people must do at times,

00:15:48.092 --> 00:15:50.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when it involves moving away

00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from friends and relatives.

00:15:53.473 --> 00:15:57.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Sarah needed faith, and she had it.

00:15:57.811 --> 00:16:00.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She cooperated with her husband’s direction,

00:16:00.897 --> 00:16:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which meant accepting
a completely different way of life.

00:16:05.401 --> 00:16:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her obedience revealed
her strong faith in Jehovah.

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:12.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the challenges that Sarah faced.

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:21.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in Ur was comfortable.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all the modern conveniences.

00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:28.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah gave us
an assignment we never expected

00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one that meant saying goodbye
to the life we loved.

00:16:33.304 --> 00:16:35.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather than look behind,

00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:38.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and I looked ahead.

00:16:38.268 --> 00:16:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had seen Jehovah’s hand in our lives,

00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:43.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we knew he would be with us

00:16:43.815 --> 00:16:46.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the journey.

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was in ways that surprised us

00:16:50.405 --> 00:16:53.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ways we never could have imagined.

00:16:53.074 --> 00:16:55.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah did more than help us;

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he fulfilled his every promise.

00:17:03.877 --> 00:17:08.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As accurately depicted in that video,
how did Sarah show faith?

00:17:08.548 --> 00:17:11.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed faith by looking ahead.

00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also reflected on what Jehovah
had already done for them.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham and Sarah had seen
Jehovah’s hand in their lives.

00:17:19.475 --> 00:17:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were his friends.

00:17:21.477 --> 00:17:24.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had obeyed before,
and Jehovah had confidence

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:27.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their obedience now.

00:17:27.108 --> 00:17:29.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a woman of strong faith,

00:17:29.277 --> 00:17:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah trusted that Jehovah would continue
to be with them in their new assignment.

00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She willingly gave up the comforts
and conveniences of Ur,

00:17:38.494 --> 00:17:41.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her faith in God did not go unrewarded.

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:46.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, she received a blessing
that she never could have anticipated.

00:17:46.794 --> 00:17:51.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah’s faith in Jehovah
led to the birth of Isaac.

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:54.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made this blessing especially remarkable

00:17:54.427 --> 00:17:59.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is described for us at Hebrews 11:11, 12.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read those verses.

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:03.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11

00:18:03.561 --> 00:18:06.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists a number of faithful servants of God.

00:18:06.564 --> 00:18:10.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah is mentioned along with Abraham.

00:18:10.109 --> 00:18:12.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read starting in verse 11,

00:18:12.695 --> 00:18:16.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the focus is on faith:

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith also Sarah received power
to conceive offspring,

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even when she was past the age,

00:18:23.247 --> 00:18:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since she considered Him faithful
who made the promise.

00:18:27.543 --> 00:18:31.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this reason, from one man
who was as good as dead,

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:36.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there were born children,
as many as the stars of heaven in number

00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:41.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as innumerable
as the sands by the seaside.”

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:44.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what remarkable blessing

00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:47.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did Sarah receive as a result of her faith?

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “power to conceive offspring,

00:18:50.358 --> 00:18:54.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when she was past the age,” it said.

00:18:54.237 --> 00:18:57.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how specifically did she show faith?

00:18:57.532 --> 00:19:01.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed faith
because “she considered Him faithful

00:19:01.285 --> 00:19:03.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had made the promise.”

00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:06.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah had faith in Jehovah’s promise

00:19:06.124 --> 00:19:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Abraham would become the father to many.

00:19:08.876 --> 00:19:12.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abraham needed faith, but so did Sarah.

00:19:12.005 --> 00:19:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because they both had such faith,
verse 12 says:

00:19:15.925 --> 00:19:19.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this reason, . . .
there were born children.”

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some might say,
‘But I recall from the Scriptures

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Sarah laughed when she heard
that she would give birth?’

00:19:25.643 --> 00:19:26.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True.

00:19:26.644 --> 00:19:29.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was that because she lacked faith?

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read a moment ago
that Sarah considered Jehovah faithful.

00:19:34.777 --> 00:19:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, she trusted him.

00:19:36.946 --> 00:19:38.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happened?

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, evidently, the thought
of giving birth at her age

00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:43.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
struck her as being so unusual

00:19:43.494 --> 00:19:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she could not hold back
from laughing to herself.

00:19:47.123 --> 00:19:49.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while she was only all too human,

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:53.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was undeniably a woman of strong faith.

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:57.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Years later, Sarah’s faith
in Jehovah’s promise concerning Isaac

00:19:57.884 --> 00:20:00.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved her to speak up when 5-year-old Isaac

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was persecuted, or bullied,

00:20:02.472 --> 00:20:04.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by 19-year-old Ishmael.

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:08.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She saw a real threat
to the well-being of Isaac,

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:12.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her faith reminded her
that Isaac was more than just her son.

00:20:12.857 --> 00:20:16.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was assigned a key role
in Jehovah’s purpose.

00:20:16.152 --> 00:20:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she mustered up courage
and spoke up in his defense.

00:20:21.157 --> 00:20:24.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strong faith helps us to do many things.

00:20:24.911 --> 00:20:29.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,
take note of how a husband and wife

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show faith like that of Abraham and Sarah.

00:20:40.802 --> 00:20:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saying goodbye

00:20:42.804 --> 00:20:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is never easy.

00:20:46.724 --> 00:20:50.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though we were excited
about our new LDC assignment,

00:20:51.187 --> 00:20:54.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was going to take us farther
than we’d ever been.

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:08.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just a new routine;

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a whole new way of life!

00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:26.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With each new move and project,

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thought about Sarah.

00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:33.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She focused on the good things ahead

00:21:34.063 --> 00:21:36.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not on what she’d left behind.

00:21:38.526 --> 00:21:40.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what we tried to do.

00:22:15.855 --> 00:22:18.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so good to us.

00:22:49.013 --> 00:22:52.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t always know
where the next project would take us,

00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:56.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we did know that Jehovah would be with us

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:01.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every step of the way.

00:23:06.572 --> 00:23:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As demonstrated in that video,

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:11.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can strengthen our faith

00:23:11.285 --> 00:23:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by meditating on Jehovah’s goodness
to his people in the past

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his goodness to his people today.

00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to meditate
on how Jehovah has helped you

00:23:23.172 --> 00:23:26.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’ve made sacrifices in his service.

00:23:26.968 --> 00:23:29.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the sister in the video stated,

00:23:29.428 --> 00:23:33.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Sarah focused on the good things ahead

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:36.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not on what she had left behind.’

00:23:37.228 --> 00:23:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show faith like that of Sarah’s

00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:43.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we support the decisions that are made

00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:45.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by God’s organization today.

00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:47.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate Sarah’s faith,

00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:51.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow Jehovah’s direction closely.

00:23:51.742 --> 00:23:54.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are obedient to Jehovah’s direction,

00:23:54.996 --> 00:23:58.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then as Hebrews 13:17 states,

00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:01.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers may carry out
their responsibilities

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:04.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with joy and not with sighing.”

00:24:04.922 --> 00:24:06.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For married sisters, this means

00:24:06.924 --> 00:24:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
displaying a Sarah-like spirit
in their marriage.

00:24:10.386 --> 00:24:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Christian wife respects
and supports her husband

00:24:14.557 --> 00:24:17.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in doing Jehovah’s will.

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:19.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter wrote that such a spirit

00:24:19.603 --> 00:24:22.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has “great value in the eyes of God.”

00:24:22.648 --> 00:24:26.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of the many ways
in which sisters today

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:29.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
display faith like Sarah’s?

00:24:29.113 --> 00:24:31.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, many Christian women of strong faith

00:24:31.907 --> 00:24:35.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are supportive of their husbands
in the circuit work.

00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:38.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many others leave family behind

00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when accepting an assignment
from Local/Design Construction

00:24:41.917 --> 00:24:45.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:47.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many sisters serving at Bethel

00:24:47.965 --> 00:24:51.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do so far away from their families.

00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:55.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is true of single sisters as well.

00:24:55.181 --> 00:25:00.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these, and many more,
show Sarah-like faith

00:25:00.019 --> 00:25:02.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by trusting in Jehovah’s loving care

00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making themselves available
in his service.

00:25:06.776 --> 00:25:11.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident that Jehovah sees
these acts of faith.

00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:13.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 13:16 says

00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “God is well-pleased
with such sacrifices.”

00:25:17.286 --> 00:25:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So see their example,
and imitate their faith.

00:25:23.584 --> 00:25:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Mantz,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:25:27.296 --> 00:25:31.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
in this symposium,

00:25:31.175 --> 00:25:34.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Rahab.”

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two Israelite men
sneak into the city of Jericho.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The men are spies.

00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:53.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They take refuge in a place
where they feel no one will notice them

00:25:53.572 --> 00:25:56.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the home of a prostitute, Rahab.

00:25:56.367 --> 00:25:58.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And little does Rahab know

00:25:58.369 --> 00:26:01.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the visit
of these two men will affect her life.

00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:05.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone recognizes the spies,
and they notify the king.

00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king sends men
to take the spies into custody.

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:12.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the king’s men bang on the door,

00:26:12.174 --> 00:26:15.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab is confronted
with a life-or-death decision

00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a decision that will affect her livelihood

00:26:18.848 --> 00:26:22.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lives of everyone in her family.

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:25.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will she take a stand for Jehovah’s people,

00:26:25.062 --> 00:26:28.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or will she side with the king of Jericho?

00:26:28.899 --> 00:26:31.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:34.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine the challenges that Rahab faced

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what helped her
to make a life-saving decision.

00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:43.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jericho was doomed.

00:26:43.664 --> 00:26:45.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People were scared.

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:48.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Israelite men showed up at my door,

00:26:48.294 --> 00:26:50.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was barely time to think.

00:26:51.213 --> 00:26:53.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew what was at stake.

00:26:54.508 --> 00:26:58.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as a young girl,
I had heard all the stories.

00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:00.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wasn’t like the other gods.

00:27:00.473 --> 00:27:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:05.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given his people victory
over the Amorites.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:12.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I helped these men,
I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:16.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in my life,

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:19.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was standing with Jehovah’s people

00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:21.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jehovah’s side.

00:27:22.953 --> 00:27:27.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spies were probably
the first Israelites that Rahab had ever met.

00:27:35.466 --> 00:27:37.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, she was convinced

00:27:37.468 --> 00:27:42.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if she helped the two men,
Jehovah would help her.

00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:44.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did she feel that way?

00:27:44.391 --> 00:27:47.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:49.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 31.

00:27:49.647 --> 00:27:54.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we find the answer
to that question in a single word.

00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:57.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:31 says:

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Rahab the prostitute

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“did not perish
with those who acted disobediently,

00:28:02.743 --> 00:28:07.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she received
the spies in a peaceable way.”

00:28:07.748 --> 00:28:11.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Rahab took a decisive stand

00:28:11.418 --> 00:28:15.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on her faith
in what she had heard about Jehovah

00:28:15.005 --> 00:28:17.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he had delivered
his people at the Red Sea

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he had given them
victories over nearby kings.

00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:24.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in Joshua chapter 2

00:28:24.473 --> 00:28:28.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the significant sequence of events.

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:31.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had already hidden
the spies on her roof

00:28:31.939 --> 00:28:34.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the king’s men arrived.

00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after sending the king’s men away,

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she went back up to the roof
to talk to the spies.

00:28:40.573 --> 00:28:43.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There she explained to them
the reasons for her faith,

00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:48.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she expressed confidence
that Jehovah is the true God

00:28:48.706 --> 00:28:51.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah would give his people

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
victory over Jericho.

00:28:54.503 --> 00:28:58.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only then did she ask
the spies for protection

00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:01.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for herself and her family.

00:29:01.594 --> 00:29:06.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Rahab’s faith
was not based on the promise of a reward.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:11.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, her faith
was based on her firm conviction

00:29:11.437 --> 00:29:15.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is the almighty God.

00:29:15.399 --> 00:29:19.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab’s faith gave her courage
to hide and protect the spies.

00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:21.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then her faith moved her

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obey the spies’ unusual instructions.

00:29:25.409 --> 00:29:27.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:29:27.745 --> 00:29:30.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how a young Bible student

00:29:30.247 --> 00:29:33.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows faith like that of Rahab.

00:29:37.254 --> 00:29:39.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no doubt about it.

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:42.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had found the truth.

00:29:44.136 --> 00:29:47.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did I feel so anxious?

00:29:59.068 --> 00:30:02.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew how Mom felt about the holidays.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:21.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They displease him.

00:30:29.431 --> 00:30:32.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some changes in my life were easy to make.

00:30:41.902 --> 00:30:45.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I really needed Jehovah’s help
for what I had to do next.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:54.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my mom so much.

00:30:56.542 --> 00:31:00.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I explained that I wouldn’t celebrate
the holidays anymore,

00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:04.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell that she was hurt.

00:31:10.514 --> 00:31:13.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was doing the right thing

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed that Jehovah
would help her understand.

00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:23.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is going to be
a holiday season like no other

00:31:23.193 --> 00:31:27.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like this 36 megapixel DSLR camera kit
for just $399.

00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:31.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or would you believe this 65” 4K UHD
Smart TV is only $849?

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hurry in before it’s gone because these . . .

00:31:53.849 --> 00:31:57.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I admit I was surprised when she said
she wanted to learn more.

00:31:57.811 --> 00:32:00.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing!

00:32:00.147 --> 00:32:03.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, I had found the truth,

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:06.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now maybe my family would find it too.

00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:16.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Rahab, this Bible student

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:18.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had already identified the true God.

00:32:18.624 --> 00:32:22.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was convinced
that she had found the truth.

00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:25.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now she needed to act on that faith,

00:32:25.756 --> 00:32:30.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was blessed
when she took a stand on Jehovah’s side.

00:32:31.553 --> 00:32:34.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of us must ask ourselves,

00:32:34.515 --> 00:32:39.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I standing firmly on Jehovah’s side?’

00:32:39.144 --> 00:32:43.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you feel that you
don’t have enough knowledge to take a stand.

00:32:43.482 --> 00:32:48.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, imitate Rahab and do not hesitate.

00:32:49.112 --> 00:32:52.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What little knowledge Rahab had about Jehovah

00:32:52.074 --> 00:32:54.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was enough to give her faith

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:59.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that moved her
to take prompt, obedient action.

00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:04.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Rahab had to do more than protect
the spies and follow their instructions.

00:33:04.044 --> 00:33:07.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 2:25

00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:12.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
states that Rahab was
“declared righteous by [her] works.”

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:15.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she was a prostitute

00:33:15.305 --> 00:33:19.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a work that is not in harmony
with Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:33:19.643 --> 00:33:23.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Canaanites didn’t view
prostitution as something bad.

00:33:23.397 --> 00:33:26.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in order to be accepted

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:29.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of Jehovah’s clean worshippers,

00:33:29.027 --> 00:33:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had to abandon her immoral way of life.

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:39.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise today, all who want
to please Jehovah must abandon

00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:44.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any lifestyles or conduct
that displeases him.

00:33:44.084 --> 00:33:46.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This includes sexual immorality,

00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:49.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
idolatry, theft, drunkenness,

00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:53.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and customs that are not in harmony
with the Scriptures.

00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:58.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab and her family certainly were grateful

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that her faithful actions
led to their salvation.

00:34:02.686 --> 00:34:07.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that wasn’t all that Jehovah
did to bless this woman of strong faith.

00:34:07.524 --> 00:34:11.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also had the privilege
of becoming an ancestress

00:34:11.028 --> 00:34:14.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:17.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, may all of us

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imitate the faith of Rahab.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may that faith move us to action

00:34:23.373 --> 00:34:27.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to abandon immoral conduct
and false religious customs,

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:32.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take our stand for Jehovah
and his pure worship,

00:34:32.341 --> 00:34:35.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue to grow in knowledge of God,

00:34:35.177 --> 00:34:40.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to draw closer to him
as our loving, heavenly Father.

00:34:40.182 --> 00:34:43.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we show faith like that of Rahab,

00:34:43.101 --> 00:34:47.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will enjoy
Jehovah’s favor and blessing forever.

00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kenneth Flodin,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:55.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the next talk of this symposium,

00:34:55.906 --> 00:34:59.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Hannah.”

00:35:07.668 --> 00:35:11.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the third talk of this convention,
Brother Noumair asked:

00:35:11.213 --> 00:35:15.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Have you experienced financial setback?

00:35:16.635 --> 00:35:21.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Has your child faced peer pressure
[and, we could add, bullying] in school?

00:35:22.057 --> 00:35:25.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a life-threatening disease?’

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to continue that list:

00:35:29.147 --> 00:35:32.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you face scorn from workmates?

00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:35.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a personality issue with someone?

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:38.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do family members taunt you?

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we deal with various trials,

00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:44.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might recall the words of Paul.

00:35:44.955 --> 00:35:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“The way I am aiming my blows

00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:51.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so as not to be striking the air.”

00:35:51.253 --> 00:35:55.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how do we counteract
the adversities of this system?

00:35:55.632 --> 00:35:58.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find 1 Samuel chapter 1.

00:35:58.969 --> 00:36:02.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah had two adversities,

00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:06.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were like boom! boom!
—a one-two punch—

00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:09.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
designed to drop her for the count.

00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is in verse 2 of chapter 1:

00:36:15.527 --> 00:36:18.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Elkanah] had two wives;

00:36:18.488 --> 00:36:21.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one was named Hannah,
and the other was named Peninnah.”

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s polygamy.

00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:27.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Peninnah loathed, she hated, Hannah.

00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was the second problem?

00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:33.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It continues:
“Peninnah had children,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Hannah had no children.”

00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:37.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah was barren.

00:36:37.716 --> 00:36:39.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that culture,

00:36:39.718 --> 00:36:43.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was a bitter reproach for a woman.

00:36:44.681 --> 00:36:49.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what was
devious, uncouth Peninnah really like?

00:36:49.603 --> 00:36:52.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 6:

00:36:52.105 --> 00:36:55.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moreover, her rival wife
taunted her relentlessly

00:36:55.442 --> 00:36:57.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to upset her.”

00:36:57.444 --> 00:36:59.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did this on purpose

00:36:59.446 --> 00:37:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because Jehovah had not given her children.”

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:04.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look at the end of verse 7:

00:37:04.451 --> 00:37:09.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her rival would taunt her so much
that [Hannah] would weep and not eat.”

00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:13.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you watch the following artwork,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine Hannah’s distressing circumstance

00:37:17.005 --> 00:37:20.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then how faith turned it all around.

00:37:22.844 --> 00:37:26.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t sleep or eat.

00:37:26.431 --> 00:37:30.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt my hopes and dreams slipping away.

00:37:30.977 --> 00:37:34.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even if no one else really understood me,

00:37:34.272 --> 00:37:36.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Jehovah would.

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:38.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him everything.

00:37:41.488 --> 00:37:44.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that the “God of justice”

00:37:44.116 --> 00:37:47.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would set all matters right in his own time

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in his own way.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:54.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered my prayer
in such a wonderful way.

00:37:54.793 --> 00:37:59.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never forgot
where this incredible blessing had come from.

00:38:00.966 --> 00:38:04.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no rock like our God.”

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:12.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the grief on Hannah’s face
in that first picture?

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the next piece of art,
she’s peaceful and tranquil,

00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:20.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she’s voicing her faith
in Jehovah, her Rock.

00:38:20.861 --> 00:38:24.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From despair to calmness of heart,

00:38:24.656 --> 00:38:26.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did that happen?

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 10 and 11,

00:38:29.995 --> 00:38:33.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she demonstrated faith in several ways.

00:38:33.415 --> 00:38:35.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can do the same as we face

00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:37.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our own boom! boom!
—one-two punch—

00:38:37.878 --> 00:38:40.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of trials and frustrations of life.

00:38:40.672 --> 00:38:42.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 10:

00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:45.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Hannah was extremely bitter,

00:38:45.552 --> 00:38:49.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she began to pray to Jehovah

00:38:49.681 --> 00:38:52.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weep uncontrollably.”

00:38:52.475 --> 00:38:54.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was “extremely bitter,”

00:38:54.686 --> 00:38:56.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she prayed.

00:38:56.938 --> 00:39:01.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She cried “uncontrollably,”
but she prayed to Jehovah.

00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:06.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your agonizing circumstances,
no matter how agitated,

00:39:06.156 --> 00:39:11.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
find a quiet place (if only in your mind)

00:39:11.161 --> 00:39:13.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:39:15.415 --> 00:39:19.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how else did Hannah show her faith?

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:24.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in that very prayer,
she did ask Jehovah for a blessing.

00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:27.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she also promised
to give him something in return.

00:39:27.928 --> 00:39:31.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11:

00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “And she made this vow:

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah of armies,

00:39:36.436 --> 00:39:39.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘if you look
upon the affliction of your servant

00:39:39.231 --> 00:39:43.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and remember me
and you do not forget your servant

00:39:43.318 --> 00:39:47.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and give to your servant a male child,

00:39:47.072 --> 00:39:50.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will give him to Jehovah
all the days of his life,

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:53.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no razor will touch his head.’”

00:39:53.328 --> 00:39:58.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, she was going to give her son

00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:02.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a Nazirite from birth
to serve Jehovah all his days

00:40:02.462 --> 00:40:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a sterling example of faith.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what else
likely strengthened Hannah’s faith?

00:40:11.179 --> 00:40:14.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Examples of faithful women
who came before her

00:40:14.975 --> 00:40:17.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with similar circumstances.

00:40:17.435 --> 00:40:22.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Rachel and her sister Leah?

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:25.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were both married to Jacob.

00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:28.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Hannah, Rachel had no children.

00:40:28.113 --> 00:40:31.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were issues
between the two because of this.

00:40:31.408 --> 00:40:34.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you see,
Hannah could look back on that example

00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:39.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see how Jehovah helped
faithful Rachel to prosper.

00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:41.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It bolstered her faith.

00:40:42.502 --> 00:40:46.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s another way
that Hannah showed faith?

00:40:46.131 --> 00:40:48.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, despite being distraught

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so distraught that she “would weep”
and could “not eat”—

00:40:52.137 --> 00:40:55.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she continued her spiritual routine.

00:40:55.265 --> 00:40:59.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 7 says that she would go
to the tabernacle faithfully

00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:02.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“year after year.”

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:04.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 13 through 16,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was misjudged by the high priest,

00:41:06.985 --> 00:41:10.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she continued her spiritual routine.

00:41:10.447 --> 00:41:13.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we said at the outset,

00:41:13.491 --> 00:41:17.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the punches that life throws at us
are different from Hannah’s,

00:41:17.912 --> 00:41:22.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we too can have
the same strong faith that she did.

00:41:23.418 --> 00:41:25.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the following dramatization,

00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:28.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though the trial is different,

00:41:28.089 --> 00:41:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how the sister
shows faith like that of Hannah.

00:41:39.392 --> 00:41:42.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could tell from the doctor’s voice

00:41:42.604 --> 00:41:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the news wasn’t good.

00:42:02.582 --> 00:42:06.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t expect my health
to worsen so quickly.

00:42:32.821 --> 00:42:37.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to act like everything was fine

00:42:39.202 --> 00:42:41.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I was fine,

00:42:47.252 --> 00:42:49.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I wasn’t.

00:42:59.597 --> 00:43:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Praying to Jehovah,

00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:07.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just knowing he would listen and understand

00:43:08.398 --> 00:43:10.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what got me through.

00:43:15.447 --> 00:43:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one really knew what I was going through,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even my friends.

00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:42.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like Hannah

00:43:42.223 --> 00:43:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—totally misunderstood.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:50.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she had faith
that Jehovah would set matters straight.

00:43:54.944 --> 00:43:59.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did for Hannah and for me.

00:44:01.826 --> 00:44:03.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:44:03.786 --> 00:44:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reminded me that I wouldn’t have to deal
with this illness alone.

00:44:13.254 --> 00:44:16.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister’s circumstances were different,

00:44:16.174 --> 00:44:21.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she drew strength
from Hannah’s strong faith in Jehovah.

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:23.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what the circumstances or trial,

00:44:23.765 --> 00:44:28.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can we imitate the example of that faith?

00:44:28.394 --> 00:44:30.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are many different ways,
but let’s review a few.

00:44:30.897 --> 00:44:32.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 5:9

00:44:32.899 --> 00:44:37.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Satan tries to beat us up
and knock us down,

00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:39.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re not alone.

00:44:39.113 --> 00:44:42.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are others
who experience the same trials

00:44:42.408 --> 00:44:44.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Peter 5:9:

00:44:47.372 --> 00:44:52.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But take your stand against him,
firm in the faith,

00:44:52.377 --> 00:44:56.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the same kind of sufferings
are being experienced

00:44:56.756 --> 00:45:00.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the entire association
of your brothers in the world.”

00:45:00.718 --> 00:45:03.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on Jehovah’s dealings
with other faithful ones,

00:45:03.805 --> 00:45:06.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both in the past and in the present day.

00:45:07.642 --> 00:45:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at 1 Samuel 1:12,
it says that Hannah

00:45:11.354 --> 00:45:15.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“prayed for a long time before Jehovah.”

00:45:15.441 --> 00:45:17.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can gain relief

00:45:17.443 --> 00:45:22.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through fervent, persistent,
and specific prayers.

00:45:22.115 --> 00:45:25.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians chapter 4 says:
“Persevere in prayer.”

00:45:25.952 --> 00:45:28.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray to Jehovah,

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leave it with him,
confident that he will help.

00:45:33.418 --> 00:45:36.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And recall
that “Hannah was extremely bitter.”

00:45:36.796 --> 00:45:39.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was crying “uncontrollably.”

00:45:39.465 --> 00:45:43.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after she
poured her feelings out to Jehovah,

00:45:43.177 --> 00:45:45.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 18 says:

00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:50.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[She] went on her way and ate,
and her face was no longer downcast.”

00:45:51.436 --> 00:45:54.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after Jehovah acted in her behalf,

00:45:54.022 --> 00:45:58.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah remembered that
and she went back to Jehovah in prayer

00:45:58.067 --> 00:46:02.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed the beautiful prayer
in 1 Samuel chapter 2.

00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, like Hannah, even if discouraged,

00:46:07.827 --> 00:46:12.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to maintain a good spiritual routine.

00:46:12.123 --> 00:46:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we allow distress to paralyze us,

00:46:16.753 --> 00:46:21.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect we become
a stationary punching bag for Satan.

00:46:21.758 --> 00:46:24.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay nimble on your feet spiritually

00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:28.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—active in your theocratic routine.

00:46:28.014 --> 00:46:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Paul, aim your blows;
do not strike the air.

00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:35.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fight back against Satan and his tactics.

00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:38.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do all these things,

00:46:38.483 --> 00:46:42.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our bond with Jehovah will grow ever stronger

00:46:42.862 --> 00:46:47.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah will reward our faith

00:46:47.825 --> 00:46:50.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like he did for Hannah.

00:46:51.287 --> 00:46:54.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Brother Harold Corkern,
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:46:54.916 --> 00:46:57.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will present the next talk of this symposium,

00:46:57.877 --> 00:47:02.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!
—The Captive Israelite Girl.”

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 11th century B.C.E.,

00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:16.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nation of Syria
would often attack Israel,

00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:20.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
capturing many and making many their slaves

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:22.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even children.

00:47:22.235 --> 00:47:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the Bible describes
one of these raids

00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:27.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Kings chapter 5.

00:47:27.907 --> 00:47:31.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Kings chapter 5, and in verse 1,

00:47:31.786 --> 00:47:36.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are told that Naaman
was the army chief of the Syrians.

00:47:36.582 --> 00:47:41.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a mighty warrior,
but he was also very sick with leprosy.

00:47:41.212 --> 00:47:43.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verse 2:

00:47:43.214 --> 00:47:45.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On one of their raids,

00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:48.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Syrians had taken captive
from the land of Israel

00:47:48.052 --> 00:47:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little girl who became
a servant to Naaman’s wife.”

00:47:52.682 --> 00:47:56.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you picture this little girl
being ripped away from her parents?

00:47:56.227 --> 00:47:58.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was frightening for her.

00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:02.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was taken to a strange land
with people that were intimidating,

00:48:02.066 --> 00:48:04.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they worshipped many false gods.

00:48:06.195 --> 00:48:09.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that very difficult circumstance,

00:48:09.073 --> 00:48:13.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how was this little girl
required to exercise strong faith?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note the answer to this question
in the following video.

00:48:21.836 --> 00:48:25.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember the day the soldiers took me away.

00:48:25.882 --> 00:48:28.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never felt more alone.

00:48:29.093 --> 00:48:32.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My home, my friends,

00:48:32.346 --> 00:48:34.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything I knew was gone.

00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:37.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I still had Jehovah.

00:48:40.188 --> 00:48:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master of the house was very sick.

00:48:43.733 --> 00:48:45.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in pain.

00:48:46.778 --> 00:48:48.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha could help him.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about Elisha’s miracles.

00:48:52.158 --> 00:48:54.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had even raised the dead.

00:48:54.577 --> 00:48:57.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew Elisha could cure him,

00:48:57.371 --> 00:49:01.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah gave me the courage to speak up.

00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite being away from her parents,

00:49:08.591 --> 00:49:12.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this little girl exercised strong faith.

00:49:12.345 --> 00:49:14.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did she get that faith?

00:49:14.263 --> 00:49:16.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt her parents had inculcated

00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:19.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love and trust for Jehovah in her.

00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:22.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she also had things

00:49:22.063 --> 00:49:25.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were happening in her lifetime
that would build her faith.

00:49:25.024 --> 00:49:27.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:49:27.026 --> 00:49:31.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she would have known
about the miracles of the prophet Elisha

00:49:31.197 --> 00:49:35.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how, with Jehovah’s spirit,
he performed many miracles,

00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:39.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including raising a little boy from the dead.

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This little girl could have reasoned,

00:49:41.499 --> 00:49:45.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why, if Jehovah
can raise a little boy from death,

00:49:45.795 --> 00:49:50.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can certainly cure
my master from his disease.’

00:49:50.716 --> 00:49:53.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did she do
with this faith and trust?

00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:55.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She spoke up courageously.

00:49:55.847 --> 00:49:58.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice her words to her mistress

00:49:58.015 --> 00:50:02.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at 2 Kings 5:3:

00:50:02.937 --> 00:50:04.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She said to her mistress:

00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:09.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If only my lord would visit
the prophet in Samaria!

00:50:09.068 --> 00:50:12.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he would cure him of his leprosy.’”

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such boldness!

00:50:14.615 --> 00:50:19.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because she spoke up,
Naaman went to Israel,

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:23.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got in touch with Elisha the prophet,

00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:26.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbled himself,
listened to the instructions,

00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:30.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was completely cured of the leprosy.

00:50:30.256 --> 00:50:33.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else very important occurred.

00:50:33.634 --> 00:50:36.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of Naaman’s coming
to know about Jehovah,

00:50:36.596 --> 00:50:38.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did he declare?

00:50:38.639 --> 00:50:40.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Kings 5:15, he said:

00:50:40.975 --> 00:50:45.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that there is no God
anywhere in all the earth but in Israel.”

00:50:46.564 --> 00:50:48.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Naaman also vowed

00:50:48.566 --> 00:50:52.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would never serve
any other god but Jehovah.

00:50:53.487 --> 00:50:57.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How happy Naaman and his entire household
was when he went home!

00:50:57.575 --> 00:50:59.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only was he cured of his leprosy

00:50:59.785 --> 00:51:04.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now he was
a happy, joyful servant of Jehovah.

00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:07.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s not just in Bible times

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:11.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that good experiences
like this have occurred.

00:51:11.255 --> 00:51:13.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:51:13.966 --> 00:51:17.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how one of our sisters
showed strong faith,

00:51:17.803 --> 00:51:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under the most difficult
of circumstances.

00:51:25.728 --> 00:51:27.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was taken from my home,

00:51:30.274 --> 00:51:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband,

00:51:32.568 --> 00:51:34.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my spiritual family.

00:51:37.239 --> 00:51:39.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was imprisoned for my faith.

00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:50.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was another world.

00:51:50.503 --> 00:51:52.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy staying strong.

00:52:02.431 --> 00:52:07.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I asked for a Bible,
the answer was no.

00:52:14.735 --> 00:52:19.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s Word was already in my heart.

00:52:20.992 --> 00:52:24.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I did what I love the most;

00:52:24.203 --> 00:52:26.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked about God’s Kingdom.

00:52:28.374 --> 00:52:32.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of those I preached to
seemed cold at first,

00:52:33.421 --> 00:52:36.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but genuine love and the warmth of God’s Word

00:52:36.424 --> 00:52:38.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just seemed to melt their hearts.

00:52:40.386 --> 00:52:45.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes speaking up
took more courage than I thought I had,

00:52:45.391 --> 00:52:49.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not more courage
than Jehovah could give me.

00:53:04.702 --> 00:53:08.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to look
beyond the locks and uniforms.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s will is that “all sorts of people”
learn about him.

00:53:13.711 --> 00:53:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I spoke about my God, Jehovah.

00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:53.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that even behind prison bars,

00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:56.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would give me the strength

00:53:57.671 --> 00:53:59.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others.

00:54:05.888 --> 00:54:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, we’d like to address
our young ones in the audience.

00:54:10.518 --> 00:54:14.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too can have strong faith
like the little Israelite girl

00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:17.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tell others about Jehovah.

00:54:17.983 --> 00:54:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the words of Romans 10:13, 14.

00:54:22.571 --> 00:54:26.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is so important
that people know about Jehovah.

00:54:26.742 --> 00:54:29.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can they know about him
and gain salvation

00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:32.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there’s no one to preach?

00:54:32.331 --> 00:54:36.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You too can become a bold
and faithful preacher of the good news.

00:54:36.418 --> 00:54:37.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:42.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By taking in Bible truths
and building up strong faith in your heart,

00:54:42.675 --> 00:54:46.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then you’ll be able to do
like our sister did in the dramatization.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what she said?

00:54:48.722 --> 00:54:51.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I had God’s Word in my heart.

00:54:51.142 --> 00:54:54.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And as a result, even in prison

00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:57.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when I was surrounded
by all those difficulties,

00:54:57.189 --> 00:54:59.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I did what I love to do;

00:54:59.817 --> 00:55:01.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I talked about God’s Kingdom.’

00:55:02.778 --> 00:55:07.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing you can do
is pray for more courage and faith.

00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:09.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what our sister said?

00:55:09.201 --> 00:55:13.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It seemed that, at times,
to speak up required more courage than I had,

00:55:13.956 --> 00:55:17.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not more courage
than Jehovah could give me.’

00:55:18.794 --> 00:55:23.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear young ones,
don’t be afraid to talk about Jehovah

00:55:23.799 --> 00:55:27.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the truth to your schoolmates,

00:55:27.136 --> 00:55:30.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your unbelieving relatives,
to your teachers.

00:55:30.848 --> 00:55:32.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good results will happen.

00:55:32.558 --> 00:55:37.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there is an experience
of a schoolteacher here in the United States

00:55:37.563 --> 00:55:40.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been searching
for the basic questions

00:55:40.024 --> 00:55:43.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to the meaning of life,
but she could not find them.

00:55:43.235 --> 00:55:46.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then a 12-year-old student at school

00:55:46.113 --> 00:55:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked this teacher three questions.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:50.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first question:

00:55:50.117 --> 00:55:52.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know
that I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?”

00:55:52.578 --> 00:55:53.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes.”

00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Would you like to learn more
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”

00:55:56.665 --> 00:55:58.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes.”

00:55:58.042 --> 00:56:01.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third question:
“Where do you live?”

00:56:01.212 --> 00:56:05.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our 12-year-old sister
started a study with her teacher.

00:56:05.049 --> 00:56:07.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher loved what she was hearing,

00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:11.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made excellent progress, and was baptized.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:14.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister, the former schoolteacher,

00:56:14.934 --> 00:56:17.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been serving Jehovah now
for many decades.

00:56:17.478 --> 00:56:20.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, for the last 40 years,

00:56:20.314 --> 00:56:24.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she has been serving as a member
of the United States Bethel family.

00:56:24.485 --> 00:56:29.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So blessings come
when we speak up and show strong faith.

00:56:29.448 --> 00:56:32.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
in the case of the little Israelite girl,

00:56:32.451 --> 00:56:36.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Naaman would have never gone to Israel
if she had not spoken up.

00:56:36.538 --> 00:56:38.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result, he was cured,

00:56:38.958 --> 00:56:42.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also became a servant of Jehovah.

00:56:42.002 --> 00:56:44.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in harmony with the strong faith

00:56:44.797 --> 00:56:47.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that captive Israelite girl,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may Jehovah give all of us
the courage we need

00:56:51.512 --> 00:56:53.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to display our strong faith

00:56:53.973 --> 00:56:58.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under the most stressful
and frightening circumstances.

00:57:00.354 --> 00:57:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson will now consider
the next talk of this symposium,

00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:07.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!

00:57:07.319 --> 00:57:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mary the Mother of Jesus.”

00:57:17.746 --> 00:57:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah chose the young woman Mary

00:57:20.833 --> 00:57:23.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a difficult assignment.

00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:25.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a unique assignment,

00:57:25.462 --> 00:57:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that required great faith.

00:57:29.008 --> 00:57:32.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was to care for and raise

00:57:32.344 --> 00:57:37.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only-begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ.

00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing privilege that was!

00:57:41.353 --> 00:57:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, it required strong faith
on the part of Mary

00:57:45.357 --> 00:57:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only because this was
a very serious responsibility

00:57:49.945 --> 00:57:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would involve quite a number of years

00:57:52.823 --> 00:57:57.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because initially Mary,
before accepting this assignment,

00:57:57.411 --> 00:57:59.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had some concerns, no doubt.

00:57:59.997 --> 00:58:02.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them would have been the concern

00:58:02.333 --> 00:58:06.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to the reaction of her friends,

00:58:06.045 --> 00:58:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
neighbors, relatives and, yes, of course,
her fiancé, Joseph.

00:58:10.507 --> 00:58:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, the angel didn’t say to her:
“Don’t worry.

00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:18.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll go and inform this
to all the ones involved

00:58:18.223 --> 00:58:20.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they don’t get upset.”

00:58:20.517 --> 00:58:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was a very difficult

00:58:23.479 --> 00:58:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and overwhelming assignment for Mary.

00:58:26.273 --> 00:58:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
how she approached this assignment?

00:58:29.777 --> 00:58:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to help us do that,
let’s watch this short video.

00:58:35.783 --> 00:58:38.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was engaged to marry Joseph.

00:58:38.327 --> 00:58:41.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we would have
a simple and quiet life.

00:58:41.038 --> 00:58:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, suddenly, everything changed.

00:58:45.376 --> 00:58:49.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that God sometimes asks us
to do what is difficult.

00:58:49.505 --> 00:58:54.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this seemed impossible,
beyond anything we could handle.

00:58:54.259 --> 00:58:58.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I was safe in Jehovah’s hands.

00:58:58.055 --> 00:59:00.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we remained loyal to Him

00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:03.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and did our best
to care for his precious Son,

00:59:03.769 --> 00:59:06.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would always be loyal to us

00:59:06.313 --> 00:59:08.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give us what we needed.

00:59:11.944 --> 00:59:14.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we think of Mary’s situation,

00:59:14.863 --> 00:59:19.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that she was interested in was having
a quiet, simple life.

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then suddenly everything changed for her,

00:59:22.246 --> 00:59:25.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may have seemed impossible for her

00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:28.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to accept that assignment.

00:59:28.293 --> 00:59:30.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, what was her reaction?

00:59:30.754 --> 00:59:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please take your Bibles,
and turn with me

00:59:33.632 --> 00:59:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the first chapter of Luke and verse 38

00:59:38.429 --> 00:59:42.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 1:38.

00:59:42.724 --> 00:59:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we see Mary’s reaction: “Look!

00:59:47.146 --> 00:59:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s slave girl!

00:59:49.523 --> 00:59:54.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May it happen to me
according to your declaration.”

00:59:54.278 --> 00:59:58.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, in full faith and with humility,

00:59:58.031 --> 01:00:01.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she accepted this difficult assignment.

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knew that Jehovah would be with her

01:00:04.455 --> 01:00:06.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he would help her.

01:00:06.832 --> 01:00:11.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was it that gave Mary
such a strong faith?

01:00:11.086 --> 01:00:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we get a clue if we look down

01:00:13.464 --> 01:00:17.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the same chapter but at verse 46.

01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:20.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s Luke 1:46.

01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:22.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re not going to read the verse

01:00:22.973 --> 01:00:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the study note associated with the verse.

01:00:26.435 --> 01:00:29.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice it says: “Mary’s words of praise

01:00:29.771 --> 01:00:33.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that follow in verses 46-55

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:37.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“contain well over 20 references to

01:00:37.154 --> 01:00:39.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or allusions to the Hebrew Scriptures . . .

01:00:39.948 --> 01:00:43.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mary’s words give evidence
of her spirituality

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and her knowledge of the Scriptures.

01:00:45.954 --> 01:00:48.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They show her appreciative attitude.

01:00:48.749 --> 01:00:52.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Her words also reveal
the depth of her faith,

01:00:52.336 --> 01:00:56.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as she spoke of Jehovah as abasing
the haughty and powerful

01:00:56.924 --> 01:01:01.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as helping the lowly and poor
who seek to serve him.”

01:01:01.845 --> 01:01:04.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Mary’s faith

01:01:04.681 --> 01:01:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was based on her knowledge of God’s Word,

01:01:07.768 --> 01:01:10.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Holy Scriptures that she had.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it seems that she
didn’t have personal copies

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:16.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these writings.

01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, she must have memorized

01:01:19.154 --> 01:01:22.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what she heard being read at the synagogue.

01:01:22.574 --> 01:01:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:26.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Mary’s heart was full

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:30.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all of these expressions
from the Hebrew Scriptures

01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:35.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so much so that when
she spontaneously praised Jehovah,

01:01:35.045 --> 01:01:37.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these expressions came out

01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:41.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she had treasured them in her heart.

01:01:41.093 --> 01:01:44.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, yes, Mary had strong faith

01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was based on the Holy Writings,

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:51.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is what made her qualified
for this assignment.

01:01:52.354 --> 01:01:54.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about us?

01:01:54.439 --> 01:01:59.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate this strong faith of Mary?

01:01:59.236 --> 01:02:01.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look at this dramatization,

01:02:01.905 --> 01:02:05.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that although
our assignments may be different,

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:08.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we likewise need to have
that same strong faith.

01:02:11.999 --> 01:02:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they first told me,
I thought it must have been a mistake.

01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, me

01:02:18.463 --> 01:02:22.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—oversee a department
at an international convention?

01:02:29.558 --> 01:02:33.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was just too much to handle,

01:02:42.237 --> 01:02:46.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I remembered that I thought
the same thing years ago

01:02:47.534 --> 01:02:50.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was asked to serve
on a Disaster Relief Committee

01:03:10.682 --> 01:03:13.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I served
on the Hospital Liaison Committee.

01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I’ve always felt that way

01:03:32.412 --> 01:03:34.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I’ve received
an assignment from Jehovah.

01:03:38.502 --> 01:03:40.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I’ve learned is

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:44.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s always ready to help.

01:03:55.394 --> 01:03:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jehovah asks me
to do something that seems difficult,

01:03:59.773 --> 01:04:02.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just remind myself

01:04:02.901 --> 01:04:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pray,

01:04:04.361 --> 01:04:05.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay loyal,

01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:07.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith

01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’ll give me what I need.

01:04:35.392 --> 01:04:38.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you feel sorry for that young brother?

01:04:38.103 --> 01:04:41.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we can really understand
his expressions,

01:04:41.398 --> 01:04:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When they told me of the assignment,
I thought it was a mistake.’

01:04:45.861 --> 01:04:49.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt some of us have felt
the same way at times too.

01:04:49.823 --> 01:04:52.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped this young brother?

01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:55.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he remembered how Jehovah
had helped him

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:58.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in similar situations in the past.

01:04:58.457 --> 01:05:01.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember how he
thought back to the time

01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:04.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was with the Disaster Committee?

01:05:04.129 --> 01:05:07.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there he was, standing as a young man,
and all these other men

01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:10.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were looking to him for some direction.

01:05:10.343 --> 01:05:12.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was very overwhelming.

01:05:12.345 --> 01:05:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then what about when he was
to make the presentation

01:05:16.224 --> 01:05:18.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an HLC member?

01:05:18.518 --> 01:05:20.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember him sitting there
in the corridor by himself,

01:05:20.979 --> 01:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then this young woman
ushers him into the room.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t look very friendly at all,
did she?

01:05:26.359 --> 01:05:29.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And certainly the medical staff
didn’t look very friendly.

01:05:29.821 --> 01:05:33.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So assignments like that can be overwhelming.

01:05:33.325 --> 01:05:35.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did the young brother say?

01:05:35.786 --> 01:05:39.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that the things
that helped him were prayer,

01:05:39.247 --> 01:05:44.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
staying loyal, and having faith.

01:05:44.002 --> 01:05:46.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, like Mary,

01:05:46.713 --> 01:05:51.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we likewise can have this strong faith
that pleases Jehovah.

01:05:51.635 --> 01:05:53.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to display humility

01:05:53.929 --> 01:05:57.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have absolute confidence in Jehovah,

01:05:57.516 --> 01:06:01.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a type of confidence that’s expressed
in the book of Psalms.

01:06:01.561 --> 01:06:03.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me

01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:07.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Psalm 56:3, 4

01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 56:3, 4.

01:06:13.698 --> 01:06:17.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

01:06:17.953 --> 01:06:20.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In God
—whose word I praise—

01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:24.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.

01:06:24.835 --> 01:06:27.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can mere man do to me?”

01:06:29.506 --> 01:06:33.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, just like the psalmist
and just like Mary,

01:06:33.552 --> 01:06:36.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can have full confidence in Jehovah.

01:06:36.805 --> 01:06:40.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, let us demonstrate this strong faith

01:06:40.684 --> 01:06:43.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are faced with difficult assignments,

01:06:43.311 --> 01:06:47.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting in Jehovah,
knowing that he will bless us

01:06:47.232 --> 01:06:49.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same as he blessed Mary.

01:06:50.485 --> 01:06:52.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next part in our symposium

01:06:52.779 --> 01:06:55.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be handled by Brother Leonard Myers,

01:06:55.448 --> 01:06:57.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’s a helper to the Writing Committee.

01:06:57.993 --> 01:06:59.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll discuss the theme

01:06:59.995 --> 01:07:04.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!
—The Phoenician Woman.”

01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Passover of 32 C.E.,

01:07:15.051 --> 01:07:18.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus and his disciples were
in Phoenicia of Syria,

01:07:18.388 --> 01:07:20.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
north of the borders of Israel.

01:07:20.932 --> 01:07:25.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in this non-Israelite territory,
Jesus couldn’t escape notice.

01:07:25.687 --> 01:07:28.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 15

01:07:28.607 --> 01:07:30.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and you may want to put
a place marker there—

01:07:30.775 --> 01:07:34.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew chapter 15, starting in verse 22.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Greek woman born in Phoenicia

01:07:36.448 --> 01:07:39.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found Jesus and begged him
to heal her daughter.

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The verse says that the girl was
“cruelly demon possessed.”

01:07:44.873 --> 01:07:49.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 23 says that Jesus did not say
a word in answer to the mother.

01:07:50.128 --> 01:07:53.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, his disciples urged him:

01:07:53.298 --> 01:07:58.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Send her away,
because she keeps crying out after us.”

01:07:58.219 --> 01:08:00.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mother was persistent.

01:08:00.847 --> 01:08:03.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In response, Jesus explained his reason

01:08:03.391 --> 01:08:06.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for ignoring her in verse 24:

01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:09.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was not sent to anyone
except to the lost sheep

01:08:09.189 --> 01:08:11.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the house of Israel.”

01:08:11.775 --> 01:08:14.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would the woman respond?

01:08:14.152 --> 01:08:16.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Jesus’ seeming rejection
discourage her?

01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:18.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would she lose faith?

01:08:19.616 --> 01:08:22.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, look for evidence

01:08:22.035 --> 01:08:24.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Phoenician woman’s
extraordinary faith.

01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:31.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I was not Jewish,

01:08:31.169 --> 01:08:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I saw that this Jesus
was no ordinary man.

01:08:35.215 --> 01:08:37.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had heard about his power to help others,

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my daughter was suffering.

01:08:40.387 --> 01:08:43.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t take no for an answer.

01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:44.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t.

01:08:44.516 --> 01:08:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was from God.

01:08:47.227 --> 01:08:50.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was nowhere else to turn.

01:08:50.105 --> 01:08:52.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had faith in Jesus.

01:08:52.983 --> 01:08:55.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he heard me, he said:

01:08:55.443 --> 01:08:58.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let it happen to you as you wish.”

01:08:59.364 --> 01:09:01.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it did!

01:09:01.908 --> 01:09:04.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My beautiful, precious daughter

01:09:04.119 --> 01:09:07.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was healthy and smiling again.

01:09:13.753 --> 01:09:17.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of her faith, the Phoenician woman
overcame the fear of prejudice

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:20.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could have prevented her
from approaching Jesus.

01:09:20.468 --> 01:09:25.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she was of Greek descent;
Jesus was Jewish.

01:09:25.056 --> 01:09:27.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as stated in the video,

01:09:27.058 --> 01:09:29.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she heard reports of Jesus’ power
to help others

01:09:29.936 --> 01:09:33.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she realized that this man was from God.

01:09:33.732 --> 01:09:36.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in verse 22, she addressed Jesus

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:39.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “Lord, Son of David.”

01:09:39.654 --> 01:09:44.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She publicly acknowledged
that Jesus was the promised Messiah.

01:09:44.659 --> 01:09:47.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though at first
he didn’t respond to her

01:09:47.245 --> 01:09:49.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then explained his reason for doing so,

01:09:49.539 --> 01:09:52.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she didn’t become discouraged.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:54.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue with the account in verse 25

01:09:54.878 --> 01:09:57.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the strong faith of this woman:

01:09:59.215 --> 01:10:02.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the woman came
and did obeisance to him, saying:

01:10:02.302 --> 01:10:05.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Lord, help me!’”

01:10:05.638 --> 01:10:09.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Jesus must have been moved
by the woman’s heartfelt appeal!

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:14.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, though,
Jesus wanted to test her faith.

01:10:14.522 --> 01:10:17.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like a parent who plans to grant
a child’s request

01:10:17.859 --> 01:10:20.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but doesn’t give an outward sign of that plan

01:10:20.278 --> 01:10:22.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to test the child’s seriousness,

01:10:22.864 --> 01:10:25.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what Jesus tells her in verse 26:

01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:29.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is not right to take the bread
of the children

01:10:29.662 --> 01:10:32.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throw it to the little dogs.”

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:36.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the Greeks and Romans,
the dog was often a beloved pet

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lived in its owner’s house
and played with the children.

01:10:40.423 --> 01:10:44.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The expression “little dogs,”
or perhaps a house dog,

01:10:44.677 --> 01:10:49.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might have reminded the woman
of a warm, endearing picture.

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:54.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By likening the Israelites to children
and non-Jews to little dogs,

01:10:54.104 --> 01:10:58.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus evidently wanted to indicate
an order of priority.

01:10:58.483 --> 01:11:01.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a household with both children and dogs,

01:11:01.111 --> 01:11:03.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the children would be fed first.

01:11:03.905 --> 01:11:07.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus meant that he couldn’t care
for non-Israelites

01:11:07.117 --> 01:11:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the expense of deserving Jews.

01:11:10.912 --> 01:11:15.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than take offense, the woman
discerned the point of the illustration

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:18.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and humbly stated in verse 27:

01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:22.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, Lord, but really the little dogs do eat

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:25.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the crumbs falling from the table
of their masters.”

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:28.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful response!

01:11:28.179 --> 01:11:31.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result
of the woman’s remarkable faith?

01:11:31.599 --> 01:11:33.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 28:

01:11:33.852 --> 01:11:36.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jesus replied to her:

01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:39.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O woman, great is your faith;

01:11:39.232 --> 01:11:41.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let it happen to you as you wish.’

01:11:41.985 --> 01:11:45.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And her daughter was healed
from that hour on.”

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:51.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The woman’s faith was rewarded
when Jesus healed her daughter.

01:11:51.035 --> 01:11:54.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an example of strong faith!

01:11:55.373 --> 01:11:57.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:01.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how someone who has just started
to have a good relationship with God

01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:05.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might need to display strong faith
like that of the Phoenician woman.

01:12:08.136 --> 01:12:10.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought it would happen.

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I finally found what I’d been searching for

01:12:16.895 --> 01:12:19.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a good relationship with God.

01:12:22.817 --> 01:12:24.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then one day,

01:12:24.277 --> 01:12:26.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a coworker texted an article

01:12:26.362 --> 01:12:28.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that claimed to expose Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:37.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was tempted to read it,

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:41.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I thought back

01:12:42.337 --> 01:12:45.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to when I first met Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:12:53.306 --> 01:12:56.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so excited about what they taught me
from the Bible

01:12:57.352 --> 01:13:00.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that God’s name is Jehovah,

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom is a real government,
and so much more.

01:13:05.985 --> 01:13:09.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I want to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies?

01:13:14.535 --> 01:13:16.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my friends?

01:13:22.168 --> 01:13:23.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not so much.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw people who really loved one another.

01:13:44.148 --> 01:13:46.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a real brotherhood.

01:13:48.403 --> 01:13:50.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it wasn’t just the people.

01:13:52.699 --> 01:13:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the truth!

01:14:20.727 --> 01:14:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t need to learn
about Jehovah’s Witnesses from their enemies.

01:14:30.445 --> 01:14:32.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had seen for myself

01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:36.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they worship the true God, Jehovah.

01:14:41.581 --> 01:14:44.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the young man recognized

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put faith in Jehovah’s organization?

01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:51.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a protection,
so he wasn’t misled by lies from our enemies.

01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:55.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith might have reminded you
of the Phoenician woman.

01:14:55.887 --> 01:14:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, she recognized and put faith

01:14:58.681 --> 01:15:01.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s representative, his Son.

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question we need to consider is,

01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate
the Phoenician woman’s strong faith?

01:15:10.318 --> 01:15:14.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that woman, we need to recognize
Jehovah’s representatives

01:15:14.614 --> 01:15:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and associate with them.

01:15:17.116 --> 01:15:21.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 24:45,
Jesus identified these representatives.

01:15:21.996 --> 01:15:25.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He foretold that in our day he would use
“the faithful and discreet slave”

01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:29.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide
spiritual “food at the proper time.”

01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:31.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have strong faith

01:15:31.798 --> 01:15:36.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body is filling that role
of “the faithful and discreet slave”?

01:15:36.469 --> 01:15:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three lines of evidence.

01:15:39.138 --> 01:15:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there’s evidence
of holy spirit guiding these brothers.

01:15:43.684 --> 01:15:46.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, holy spirit
has helped the Governing Body

01:15:46.896 --> 01:15:50.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grasp Scriptural truths
not previously understood.

01:15:50.775 --> 01:15:53.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These brothers feel as the apostle Paul did,

01:15:53.194 --> 01:15:56.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wrote at 1 Corinthians 2:13:

01:15:56.155 --> 01:16:01.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These things we also speak,
not with words taught by human wisdom,

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with those taught by the spirit.”

01:16:05.081 --> 01:16:09.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we see evidence
of angelic assistance.

01:16:09.252 --> 01:16:11.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has the immense task

01:16:11.712 --> 01:16:14.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of overseeing an international preaching work

01:16:14.632 --> 01:16:18.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving over eight million evangelizers.

01:16:18.261 --> 01:16:21.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The overall growth of the preaching
and disciple-making work,

01:16:21.681 --> 01:16:24.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite fierce opposition in some lands,

01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:28.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been possible
only with superhuman assistance.

01:16:29.897 --> 01:16:34.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A third line of evidence
is reliance on God’s Word.

01:16:34.235 --> 01:16:36.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some religions may revise teachings

01:16:36.571 --> 01:16:40.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to appease beliefs and opinions
of their members.

01:16:40.283 --> 01:16:42.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our dear brothers of the Governing Body

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow their decisions to be guided
by God’s Word,

01:16:46.122 --> 01:16:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than popular opinion.

01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:53.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have strong faith
that Jehovah, through his Son,

01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:55.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is directing the Governing Body.

01:16:55.548 --> 01:16:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to remain loyal
to these faithful brothers

01:16:58.801 --> 01:17:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s organization,

01:17:00.803 --> 01:17:04.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite attempts by opposers
to discredit them.

01:17:05.016 --> 01:17:07.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will be the outcome if we do?

01:17:07.685 --> 01:17:10.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to the example
of the Phoenician woman.

01:17:10.605 --> 01:17:13.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was she rewarded for her strong faith?

01:17:13.399 --> 01:17:17.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes—when her beloved daughter was healed.

01:17:17.445 --> 01:17:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, if you display strong faith

01:17:20.323 --> 01:17:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow the direction
of our Leader, Jesus,

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:26.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will lead you to everlasting life.

01:17:28.164 --> 01:17:30.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother William Malenfant,
a helper to the Teaching Committee,

01:17:30.958 --> 01:17:33.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present the next talk
of this symposium,

01:17:33.586 --> 01:17:37.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!—Martha.”

01:17:45.056 --> 01:17:47.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Martha, Martha”

01:17:47.683 --> 01:17:52.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she was a hard-working, hospitable woman.

01:17:52.063 --> 01:17:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us that “Jesus loved Martha

01:17:56.275 --> 01:18:01.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her sister [Mary]
and [their brother] Lazarus.”

01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:03.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Lazarus took ill,

01:18:03.407 --> 01:18:08.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha surely did everything
in her power to soothe his discomfort.

01:18:09.455 --> 01:18:12.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was so concerned
with her brother’s condition

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:17.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she and her sister,
Mary, sent a message to Jesus,

01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:21.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 11:3, saying:

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Lord, see!

01:18:23.302 --> 01:18:26.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one for whom you have affection is sick.”

01:18:28.015 --> 01:18:32.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha knew that Lazarus was seriously ill.

01:18:32.144 --> 01:18:34.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She must have felt helpless

01:18:34.272 --> 01:18:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Lazarus sank deeper
into his illness and then died.

01:18:40.069 --> 01:18:42.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Martha do?

01:18:42.947 --> 01:18:45.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would she give in to despair,

01:18:45.366 --> 01:18:49.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would grief overpower her
and weaken her faith?

01:18:50.329 --> 01:18:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you watch the following video,

01:18:53.249 --> 01:18:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to imagine Martha’s grief
when her brother died.

01:19:00.089 --> 01:19:02.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those first few days,

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was a blur.

01:19:04.468 --> 01:19:08.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My sister, Mary, and I
had never felt so empty and lost.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that if our Lord had been here,

01:19:13.269 --> 01:19:15.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brother would not have died.

01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:18.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through the tears and the pain,

01:19:20.026 --> 01:19:24.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt
that the resurrection was real,

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:26.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someday

01:19:26.073 --> 01:19:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—someday—
he would live again.

01:19:29.452 --> 01:19:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who could have imagined

01:19:31.454 --> 01:19:34.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could happen that very day

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right before our eyes?

01:19:36.959 --> 01:19:39.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wept tears of joy

01:19:39.378 --> 01:19:43.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thanked
our loving Father in heaven, Jehovah.

01:19:47.053 --> 01:19:50.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Empathy helps us to feel the pain

01:19:50.348 --> 01:19:55.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the distress that Martha
felt when Lazarus died.

01:19:55.019 --> 01:20:00.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible account tells us that Jesus
traveled to Bethany, where Martha lived,

01:20:00.024 --> 01:20:04.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did not arrive before Lazarus died.

01:20:04.654 --> 01:20:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he came four days
after Lazarus had died.

01:20:10.117 --> 01:20:12.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus met with Martha,

01:20:12.370 --> 01:20:16.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she expressed faith that Jesus
could have healed Lazarus,

01:20:16.874 --> 01:20:20.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she felt that Jesus
might yet help her brother.

01:20:21.754 --> 01:20:25.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show that she also believed

01:20:25.299 --> 01:20:28.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the future resurrection.

01:20:28.469 --> 01:20:33.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha must have been thinking
about miracles that Jesus had performed

01:20:33.307 --> 01:20:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the people who had been healed by him.

01:20:36.352 --> 01:20:38.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she had no doubt

01:20:38.562 --> 01:20:43.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was the Christ
and that he could perform miracles.

01:20:44.652 --> 01:20:47.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me what the Bible says

01:20:47.279 --> 01:20:50.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Martha’s faith in the resurrection

01:20:50.449 --> 01:20:53.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her confidence in Jesus.

01:20:53.494 --> 01:20:58.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s found at John 11:21-26.

01:20:58.499 --> 01:21:00.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads as follows:

01:21:02.044 --> 01:21:04.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Martha then said to Jesus:

01:21:04.839 --> 01:21:08.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, if you had been here,

01:21:08.008 --> 01:21:10.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my brother would not have died.’”

01:21:10.803 --> 01:21:15.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t say this to reproach Jesus;
she merely stated a fact.

01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she goes on.

01:21:17.393 --> 01:21:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She says: “‘Yet even now

01:21:19.395 --> 01:21:23.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know that whatever you ask God for,

“God will give you.’

“‘Your brother will rise.’

01:21:30.906 --> 01:21:32.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Martha said to him:

01:21:32.908 --> 01:21:37.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I know he will rise
in the resurrection on the last day.’

01:21:37.371 --> 01:21:39.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to her:

01:21:39.457 --> 01:21:43.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am the resurrection and the life.

01:21:43.002 --> 01:21:45.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The one who exercises faith in me,

01:21:45.546 --> 01:21:49.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘even though he dies, will come to life;

01:21:49.049 --> 01:21:53.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and everyone who is living
and exercises faith in me

01:21:53.179 --> 01:21:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘will never die at all.

01:21:55.806 --> 01:21:58.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you believe this?’”

01:21:58.851 --> 01:22:01.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 27,

01:22:01.145 --> 01:22:04.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha makes
one of the most important statements

01:22:04.607 --> 01:22:07.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would ever pass her lips.

01:22:07.109 --> 01:22:10.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads: “She said to him,

01:22:10.738 --> 01:22:15.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, Lord, I have believed
that you are the Christ,

01:22:15.493 --> 01:22:20.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of God,
the one coming into the world.’”

01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:23.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine

01:22:23.292 --> 01:22:27.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much her faith was appreciated by Jesus.

01:22:27.963 --> 01:22:32.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus Christ has the same appreciation for us

01:22:32.009 --> 01:22:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we show our faith in his promises.

01:22:36.889 --> 01:22:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:22:39.475 --> 01:22:43.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
observe how a sister’s faith
brings her comfort.

01:23:20.266 --> 01:23:22.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I lost my son,

01:23:24.186 --> 01:23:26.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost part of myself.

01:23:34.363 --> 01:23:36.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to stay busy,

01:23:40.327 --> 01:23:42.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything felt empty.

01:24:10.482 --> 01:24:13.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my darkest times,

01:24:13.027 --> 01:24:15.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s words brought me comfort.

01:24:48.312 --> 01:24:51.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by
that I don’t think about Brandon

01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:58.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just memories of how it was

01:24:59.698 --> 01:25:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but even more how wonderful it’ll be
to see him soon

01:25:05.663 --> 01:25:07.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s new world.

01:25:12.628 --> 01:25:16.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We deeply sympathize
with the sister in the video

01:25:16.048 --> 01:25:18.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the loss of her son

01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with any in the congregation

01:25:20.552 --> 01:25:24.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have suffered the loss of a loved one.

01:25:24.181 --> 01:25:28.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you take note
of how the sister imitated Martha’s faith

01:25:28.769 --> 01:25:32.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by putting her complete trust in Jehovah God

01:25:32.231 --> 01:25:35.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and going to him in prayer?

01:25:36.819 --> 01:25:41.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Martha,
we can build our faith in the resurrection

01:25:41.532 --> 01:25:46.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by carefully considering
all that God’s Word says about it.

01:25:47.329 --> 01:25:50.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of all the evidence there is

01:25:50.374 --> 01:25:53.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was resurrected.

01:25:53.919 --> 01:25:58.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures show clearly
that after his death and resurrection,

01:25:58.924 --> 01:26:02.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus “showed himself alive”
to his disciples.

01:26:03.429 --> 01:26:07.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also appeared to Saul of Tarsus,
who became the apostle Paul.

01:26:08.809 --> 01:26:11.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his letter to the Corinthians,

01:26:11.395 --> 01:26:15.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul points out that “more than 500 brothers”

01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:18.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saw the resurrected Jesus.

01:26:18.235 --> 01:26:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to show that it was not just hearsay,

01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul tells us that most
of those eyewitnesses were still alive

01:26:27.036 --> 01:26:29.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he wrote to the Corinthians.

01:26:29.997 --> 01:26:35.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were living witnesses
who could verify the fact

01:26:35.002 --> 01:26:38.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was resurrected from the dead.

01:26:39.673 --> 01:26:43.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about the inspired
assurance that we have

01:26:43.969 --> 01:26:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4

01:26:47.556 --> 01:26:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that the time is coming

01:26:49.933 --> 01:26:52.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when “death will be no more.”

01:26:53.896 --> 01:26:55.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think about it,

01:26:55.898 --> 01:26:59.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is it that declares
that “death will be no more”

01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:02.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Revelation 21:3, 4?

01:27:02.988 --> 01:27:07.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None other than the resurrected Jesus Christ.

01:27:07.493 --> 01:27:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do well to imitate Martha

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by maintaining strong faith

01:27:12.498 --> 01:27:15.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we face the loss of a loved one.

01:27:15.417 --> 01:27:20.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s not easy; it’s painful.

01:27:20.047 --> 01:27:22.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can do it,

01:27:22.049 --> 01:27:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing full well
that this life is not all there is.

01:27:28.222 --> 01:27:30.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All true Christians

01:27:30.349 --> 01:27:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must have faith in the resurrection

01:27:33.769 --> 01:27:36.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith that the dead will live again

01:27:36.897 --> 01:27:41.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that death
will be done away with in God’s new world.

01:27:43.403 --> 01:27:47.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and his Son
rewarded the faith of Martha,

01:27:47.699 --> 01:27:50.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary, and Lazarus.

01:27:50.369 --> 01:27:52.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be rewarded too

01:27:52.704 --> 01:27:57.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we build strong faith like that of Martha.

01:27:59.294 --> 01:28:03.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch,
a member of the Governing Body,

01:28:03.006 --> 01:28:07.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will now present
the final talk of this symposium,

01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:11.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!

01:28:11.223 --> 01:28:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Modern-Day Examples.”

01:28:22.025 --> 01:28:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, there were
many sisters with outstanding faith.

01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:31.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Matsue Ishii was one of them.

01:28:31.285 --> 01:28:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was born in Japan in 1909.

01:28:35.164 --> 01:28:37.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although she grew up in a Buddhist family,

01:28:37.958 --> 01:28:41.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had a thirst for Bible knowledge.

01:28:41.086 --> 01:28:45.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1918, the Spanish flu hit her area

01:28:45.424 --> 01:28:49.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she saw lots of coffins with dead bodies.

01:28:49.094 --> 01:28:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and her elder sister
both also caught the Spanish flu,

01:28:54.016 --> 01:28:56.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a week later, her sister died.

01:28:56.894 --> 01:28:59.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wondered, ‘Why do people die,

01:28:59.771 --> 01:29:03.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what happens to them at death?’

01:29:03.734 --> 01:29:08.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1928, when Matsue was 19,

01:29:08.363 --> 01:29:10.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her father arranged for her

01:29:10.365 --> 01:29:15.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to marry Jizo Ishii, a zealous Buddhist.

01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:18.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was introduced to the truth in Osaka

01:29:18.665 --> 01:29:21.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the book <i>The Harp of God.</i>

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was given to her by a brother
who lived in a neighboring house

01:29:26.924 --> 01:29:31.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that belonged to the International Bible
Students Association.

01:29:31.386 --> 01:29:35.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was baptized in March 1929,

01:29:35.265 --> 01:29:40.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her husband, Jizo,
was baptized a short time later.

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:44.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In June 1939, when she was 30 years old,

01:29:44.107 --> 01:29:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she and her husband were arrested

01:29:47.236 --> 01:29:50.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were separated from each other.

01:29:50.781 --> 01:29:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This certainly called for faith.

01:29:53.909 --> 01:29:56.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said that she nearly died

01:29:56.036 --> 01:30:00.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she was in solitary confinement
for almost a year.

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:06.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matsue was released
toward the end of 1944,

01:30:06.213 --> 01:30:11.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was reunited with Jizo
after World War II ended.

01:30:11.218 --> 01:30:15.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both she and her husband
had remained faithful.

01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:22.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us now consider
another encouraging example.

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after World War II ended,
far away from Japan,

01:30:26.358 --> 01:30:29.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Estonia, northeastern Europe,

01:30:29.486 --> 01:30:32.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ella Toom was introduced to the truth

01:30:32.197 --> 01:30:34.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in April 1945

01:30:34.491 --> 01:30:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was baptized in August 1946,

01:30:38.161 --> 01:30:40.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at age 20.

01:30:40.163 --> 01:30:42.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was arrested by the Communists

01:30:42.582 --> 01:30:45.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on December 27, 1950,

01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:48.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to imprisonment.

01:30:48.839 --> 01:30:52.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was sent
to a slave labor camp in Russia,

01:30:52.384 --> 01:30:55.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the infamous Vorkuta camp

01:30:55.095 --> 01:30:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
above the Arctic Circle,

01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later to other prison camps

01:30:59.641 --> 01:31:04.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
250 miles, or 400 kilometers,
southeast of Moscow.

01:31:04.646 --> 01:31:08.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sisters continued
to be spiritually-minded.

01:31:08.775 --> 01:31:11.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made miniature copies
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

01:31:11.903 --> 01:31:16.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put them inside bars of soap
and resealed the soap.

01:31:16.825 --> 01:31:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This certainly called for faith.

01:31:19.995 --> 01:31:22.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She did not have to serve for 13 years

01:31:22.539 --> 01:31:27.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually was released on May 4, 1956,

01:31:27.044 --> 01:31:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after five and a half years.

01:31:30.213 --> 01:31:33.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The year after,
she married Brother Lembit Toom.

01:31:33.967 --> 01:31:38.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the threat
of searches and arrests continued

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:43.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the preaching work
was legalized in Estonia in 1991.

01:31:45.354 --> 01:31:48.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note some other details

01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:52.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the lives
of these two faithful women

01:31:52.694 --> 01:31:56.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matsue Ishii and Ella Toom.

01:32:05.916 --> 01:32:07.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For nearly a year,

01:32:07.959 --> 01:32:11.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had been held in solitary confinement

01:32:11.755 --> 01:32:16.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tiny, filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

01:32:20.722 --> 01:32:25.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five and a half years after my arrest,

01:32:25.143 --> 01:32:28.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was released.

01:32:28.271 --> 01:32:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we truly rely on Jehovah,

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really love him

01:32:33.402 --> 01:32:36.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cry out in our heart for his help,

01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:39.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did not forsake me,

01:32:39.324 --> 01:32:43.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will not forsake his servants.

01:32:55.382 --> 01:32:57.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrested me

01:32:57.384 --> 01:32:59.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and took me in for questioning.

01:32:59.845 --> 01:33:03.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An interrogator invited me to sign a document

01:33:03.098 --> 01:33:06.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stating that I would discontinue preaching.

01:33:07.936 --> 01:33:11.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I would rather live in prison

01:33:11.106 --> 01:33:13.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with my relationship with God intact

01:33:13.525 --> 01:33:15.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than be free and lose his approval.”

01:33:18.613 --> 01:33:20.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My determination

01:33:20.615 --> 01:33:23.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been to heed the Bible’s admonition:

01:33:23.285 --> 01:33:27.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do good.”

01:33:27.164 --> 01:33:29.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have learned that doing this

01:33:29.249 --> 01:33:31.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leads to receiving

01:33:31.251 --> 01:33:33.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the requests of your heart.”

01:33:40.218 --> 01:33:45.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Sisters Ishii and Toom show faith?

01:33:45.932 --> 01:33:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me to Psalm 37.

01:33:50.479 --> 01:33:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii had faith
that Jehovah would not abandon her,

01:33:54.483 --> 01:33:58.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in line with Psalm 37:25,

01:33:58.695 --> 01:34:01.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which reads:

01:34:01.072 --> 01:34:03.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was once young and now I am old,

01:34:03.867 --> 01:34:07.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I have not seen
any one righteous abandoned,

01:34:07.412 --> 01:34:10.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor his children looking for bread.”

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:14.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her faith helped her

01:34:14.211 --> 01:34:18.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to endure difficult tests of integrity.

01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:22.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was arrested on June 21, 1939,

01:34:22.636 --> 01:34:24.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taken to a police station

01:34:24.888 --> 01:34:28.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put into a dark cell

01:34:28.016 --> 01:34:30.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with soot hanging from the ceiling.

01:34:30.852 --> 01:34:34.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, she was transferred
to another location

01:34:34.231 --> 01:34:38.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put into solitary confinement.

01:34:38.485 --> 01:34:41.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her husband was also arrested,

01:34:41.029 --> 01:34:44.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she did not see him
until the war had ended.

01:34:45.742 --> 01:34:50.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I nearly died in that cell,’ she said.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she was exposed to another test too.

01:34:53.667 --> 01:34:57.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When interrogated,
she found out from the officials

01:34:57.546 --> 01:35:00.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Junzo Akashi,

01:35:00.215 --> 01:35:03.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the overseer of the Japan branch,

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:06.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had abandoned the truth.

01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:08.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii replied:

01:35:08.098 --> 01:35:12.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Akashi is only an imperfect human . . .

01:35:12.185 --> 01:35:14.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is no longer my brother.”

01:35:16.439 --> 01:35:20.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Ishii remained loyal.

01:35:20.193 --> 01:35:23.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly, Sister Toom from Estonia

01:35:23.446 --> 01:35:27.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refused to compromise
or to abandon her faith.

01:35:27.867 --> 01:35:31.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She prayed and meditated on Bible principles

01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:33.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to endure,

01:35:33.623 --> 01:35:37.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Psalm 119

01:35:37.085 --> 01:35:42.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 97, 98 say:

01:35:44.384 --> 01:35:46.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How I do love your law!

01:35:46.886 --> 01:35:50.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I ponder over it all day long.

01:35:50.348 --> 01:35:54.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your commandment
makes me wiser than my enemies,

01:35:54.894 --> 01:35:57.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it is with me forever.”

01:36:00.066 --> 01:36:03.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1949,

01:36:03.445 --> 01:36:06.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ella Toom was arrested by the Communists.

01:36:06.865 --> 01:36:09.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took her in for questioning.

01:36:09.284 --> 01:36:13.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She reports:
“Forced to remove all my clothing

01:36:13.413 --> 01:36:16.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [being watched]
by young police officers,

01:36:16.166 --> 01:36:19.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt humiliated.

01:36:19.336 --> 01:36:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yet, after I prayed to Jehovah,

01:36:21.671 --> 01:36:25.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“peace and calmness of heart came over me.

01:36:27.594 --> 01:36:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Next, I was put in a tiny cell,

01:36:30.263 --> 01:36:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where I could not even lie down.

01:36:33.016 --> 01:36:37.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was taken out only for interrogations.

01:36:37.562 --> 01:36:39.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The officers would say:

01:36:39.564 --> 01:36:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We aren’t asking you
to deny the existence of God.

01:36:43.193 --> 01:36:46.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Just stop your stupid preaching!

01:36:46.404 --> 01:36:49.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can have a promising future.’

01:36:51.159 --> 01:36:55.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And they would threaten:
‘Do you want to live?

01:36:55.413 --> 01:36:59.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do you want to die with your God
on the fields of Siberia?’”

01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:05.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said: “For three days,
I was prevented from falling asleep

01:37:05.632 --> 01:37:08.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“between the repeated interrogations.

01:37:08.677 --> 01:37:13.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meditation on Bible principles
helped me to endure.

01:37:14.349 --> 01:37:18.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, an interrogator
invited me to sign a document

01:37:18.812 --> 01:37:22.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stating that I would discontinue preaching.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:28.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have given this matter much thought,’
I said,

01:37:28.196 --> 01:37:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I would rather live in prison
with my relationship with God intact

01:37:33.076 --> 01:37:36.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than [to] be free and lose his approval.’

01:37:38.039 --> 01:37:41.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At that the interrogator shouted:

01:37:41.418 --> 01:37:43.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You fool!

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:47.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of you will be arrested
and sent to Siberia!’”

01:37:48.717 --> 01:37:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she was unexpectedly set free
at midnight.

01:37:53.096 --> 01:37:57.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, she was arrested again
sometime later.

01:37:57.434 --> 01:37:59.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

01:37:59.686 --> 01:38:01.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how a brother shows faith

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like that of Sisters Ishii and Toom.

01:38:15.785 --> 01:38:18.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the world went from bad to worse,

01:38:21.458 --> 01:38:24.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I dug deeper into God’s Word.

01:38:41.019 --> 01:38:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to stay strong,

01:38:42.645 --> 01:38:45.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like so many
brothers and sisters in the past.

01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:51.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who remained faithful
had no special abilities

01:38:51.488 --> 01:38:53.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were inconspicuous.

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Surely all of us
must always trust in Jehovah

01:38:58.203 --> 01:39:00.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all our heart.”

01:39:02.665 --> 01:39:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I memorized scriptures.

01:39:05.710 --> 01:39:08.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew these words would build my faith

01:39:12.383 --> 01:39:15.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give me the strength I needed
to face what was to come.

01:39:37.534 --> 01:39:39.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new wave of arrests occurred this week

01:39:39.536 --> 01:39:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as local authorities enforce new restrictions
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:39:43.373 --> 01:39:45.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is coming just 14 days
after the Supreme Court’s ruling . . .

01:39:59.472 --> 01:40:03.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah and do what is good;

01:40:11.943 --> 01:40:15.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.

01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Find exquisite delight in Jehovah,

01:40:18.867 --> 01:40:22.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will grant you
the desires of your heart.”

01:40:25.248 --> 01:40:27.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to be more discreet,

01:40:27.542 --> 01:40:29.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never stopped talking
about God’s Word.

01:40:35.049 --> 01:40:37.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to face many difficulties,

01:40:37.719 --> 01:40:40.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with God’s Word embedded in our hearts,

01:40:40.847 --> 01:40:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faithfully endured to the end.

01:40:49.772 --> 01:40:54.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and unbelieving family members.

01:41:43.701 --> 01:41:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can also imitate
the mother of Jesus, Mary.

How?

01:41:49.290 --> 01:41:53.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthen your faith, and trust in Jehovah.

all that God’s Word says
about his wonderful promises.

01:42:24.158 --> 01:42:26.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says:

01:42:26.285 --> 01:42:29.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mary . . . sat down at the feet of the Lord

01:42:29.247 --> 01:42:32.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

the “great cloud of witnesses
surrounding us,”

01:42:52.103 --> 01:42:56.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can “run with endurance

as Hebrews 12:1 encourages us to do.

Like these faithful women,

01:43:03.865 --> 01:43:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can all be included
in Jehovah’s “book of remembrance,”

as mentioned at Malachi 3:16,

Thank you, brothers,
for those motivating talks.

May we always cherish faithful women,

just as Jehovah does.

Let’s sing together song number 142,

01:43:32.727 --> 01:43:35.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Holding Fast to Our Hope.”

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, that’s song number 142.

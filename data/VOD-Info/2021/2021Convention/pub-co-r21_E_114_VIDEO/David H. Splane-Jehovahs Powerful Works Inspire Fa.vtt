00:00:01.564 --> 00:00:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a Miracle Worker.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s a miracle?

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you describe it?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s give a simple definition.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A miracle is a powerful work

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can’t be explained in human terms.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever Jehovah performs a miracle,
he has a purpose.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:28.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one reason might be
to strengthen the faith of his servants.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the title of this talk,

00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s Powerful Works Inspire Faith.”

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we love to consider
the miracles recorded in the Bible.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really faith-strengthening, isn’t it?

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:46.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during this talk,
we’re going to consider just a few.

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about this one?

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah leads the Israelites out of Egypt.

00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:55.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They arrive at the Red Sea,
and it seems they’re trapped.

00:00:55.826 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sea is ahead of them;
Pharaoh and his armies are behind.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah causes
the waters of the Red Sea to part,

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:06.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Israelites cross over on dry land.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:08.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Pharaoh and his armies follow,

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah brings the sea
back to its normal condition,

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cream of the crop
of Egyptian manhood drowns.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know what effect

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that miracle had on the Egyptians,

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what effect
did it have on the Israelites?

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 14:31

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(I’ll give you a moment
so you can find that),

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus chapter 14

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 31—it says:

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Israel also saw the great power

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that Jehovah wielded against the Egyptians,

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the people began to fear Jehovah

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to put faith in Jehovah.”

00:01:51.423 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that miracle

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired faith in the Israelites.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they weren’t the only ones
who were impressed by that miracle.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fast-forward 40 years.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two spies enter Jericho and go
to the house of Rahab the prostitute.

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:09.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she says to them:

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We heard how Jehovah

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“dried up the waters of the Red Sea . . .

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When we heard about it, we lost heart, . . .

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for Jehovah your God
is God in the heavens above

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on the earth beneath.”

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:26.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hearing about that miracle

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:29.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inspired faith in Rahab.

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another person whose faith was

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened by a powerful work
might surprise you:

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Queen of Sheba.

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Queen of Sheba,
what was the powerful work?

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outstanding wisdom.

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d heard about the wisdom of Solomon,

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her curiosity got the better of her.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just had to see if the report was true.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that involved a 1,200-mile trip

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from her country to Jerusalem.

00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trip turned out
to be well worth the effort.

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:07.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of the visit,
the Queen of Sheba said to Solomon:

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May Jehovah your God be praised,
who has taken pleasure in you 

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by putting you on the throne of Israel.”

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:18.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She gave credit to Jehovah for what she saw.

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:22.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t know if she ever
became a worshipper of Jehovah,

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jesus said
that she’d ‘rise up in the judgment’

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “condemn” those Jews

00:03:27.686 --> 00:03:32.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wouldn’t even cross the street
to listen to the Son of God.

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, those are just two examples

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as you know,
there are many more in the Bible.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul lists some of them

00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Hebrews chapter 11,

00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 32 to 34,

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:52.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11 (I’ll give you a moment),

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 32-34.

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m going to read verse 32 first,

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:05.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:32 (have you got it?):

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And what more will I say?

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For time will fail me
if I go on to relate about Gideon,

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Barak, Samson, Jephthah,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David, as well as Samuel
and the other prophets.”

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:24.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as I read verses 33 and 34,

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:27.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want you children

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:30.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at the events
that are being described

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:34.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can guess who was involved.

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:38.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was the object of this miracle?

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:41.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s read verse 33;

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:43.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Through faith

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:45.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they defeated kingdoms,

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:49.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“brought about righteousness,
obtained promises,

00:04:49.518 --> 00:04:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stopped the mouths of lions,

00:04:52.688 --> 00:04:55.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“quenched the force of fire,

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“escaped the edge of the sword,

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from a weak state were made powerful,

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:05.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became mighty in war,
routed invading armies.”

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:10.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go back and see
if we can identify individuals

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were involved in those miracles.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about “defeated kingdoms”?

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you come up with someone?

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about Gideon.

00:05:19.548 --> 00:05:21.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we like Gideon.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He reminds us of us.

00:05:23.552 --> 00:05:26.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t exactly brimming with confidence.

00:05:26.638 --> 00:05:28.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an angel approached him

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and indicated that Jehovah
had work for him to do,

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:35.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon said:
“My clan is the least in Manasseh,

00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:39.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am the most insignificant
in my father’s house.”

00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said something else,

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:46.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that has a bearing
on the theme of our discussion.

00:05:46.283 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to the angel:
“If Jehovah is with us, . . .

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:55.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where are all his wonderful acts
that our fathers related to us?”

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, where were the powerful works?

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:01.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before he was going to stick his neck out,

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:05.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon wanted some kind of reassurance
that he had Jehovah’s blessing.

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What to do?

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the angel going to do?

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:12.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He performed a powerful work,

00:06:12.976 --> 00:06:16.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that inspired faith in Gideon.

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:20.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, Gideon’s confidence
was further boosted

00:06:20.817 --> 00:06:22.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by three other remarkable signs

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—two involving a fleece

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:28.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and another involving a God-given dream.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with those powerful works
in mind and with Jehovah’s help,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon did the impossible.

00:06:35.874 --> 00:06:37.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With 300 men,

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:42.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he defeated an army of 135,000.

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what’s the takeaway?

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:46.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:49.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah on our side,

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:52.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are never outnumbered.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to verse 33.

00:06:55.018 --> 00:06:57.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you children,
I’m sure you’re going to get this next one,

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 33:

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:03.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stopped the mouths of lions.”

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:05.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who did that?

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was the same one
who helped Gideon defeat the Midianites.

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:11.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was the circumstance?

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:14.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know.

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:17.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was when Daniel
was thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:21.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Daniel was condemned to die,

00:07:21.003 --> 00:07:24.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t know for sure
that Jehovah was going to rescue him.

00:07:24.631 --> 00:07:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he knew that Jehovah
would do the right thing.

00:07:28.176 --> 00:07:30.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could have that confidence because Jehovah

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been with him throughout his life.

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:37.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:41.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wait a minute; let’s think about that.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:46.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel had been condemned to die once before.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:48.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was that?

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was when
the king of Babylon had a dream,

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he decreed that unless Daniel

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other wise men of Babylon
could tell him what he dreamed

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then relate the meaning of the dream,

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would all be put to death.

00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:04.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That called for a powerful work.

00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:09.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided Daniel
with the information he needed,

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:12.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Daniel’s life was saved.

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:14.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was Babylon.

00:08:14.348 --> 00:08:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re in Persia, and Daniel

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:21.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is once more facing death—death by a lion.

00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:25.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once again, Jehovah comes to the rescue.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:29.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He temporarily shuts
the mouths of those lions.

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:33.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can imagine
what effect that had on Daniel.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:34.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about us today?

00:08:34.284 --> 00:08:36.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?
What’s the lesson?

00:08:37.704 --> 00:08:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Satan

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:44.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “[walking] about like a roaring lion,
seeking to devour someone.”

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:49.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may never know how often
Jehovah shuts the mouth of that lion

00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how often Jehovah protects his people

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:54.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a group from Satan.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:57.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re working from door to door,
for example.

00:08:57.099 --> 00:08:59.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s dangerous out there!

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we probably have no idea

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:04.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how busy the angels are in our behalf.

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:07.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if someone does lose his life

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:09.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in Jehovah’s service or at a meeting

00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:11.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and it has happened—

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his loved ones can be sure of two things.

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:16.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their loved one did not
lose Jehovah’s approval.

00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:24.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, the loss is only temporary.

00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:28.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan can never do us any lasting harm.

00:09:28.713 --> 00:09:31.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day Jehovah will shut

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lion’s mouth permanently.

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:37.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, back to Hebrews 11,

00:09:37.013 --> 00:09:39.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this time we’re reading verse 34,

00:09:39.307 --> 00:09:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure you kids
are going to guess this one,

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:44.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 34:

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:47.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“quenched the force of fire.”

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:48.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:54.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were court officials in Babylon.

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:56.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll recall that one day,
King Nebuchadnezzar

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a huge image of gold
and demanded that everybody worship it.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:06.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyone who refused would be thrown
into the burning fiery furnace.

00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:11.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was a time to remember
Jehovah’s powerful works of the past.

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:14.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the three men had experienced that,

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:17.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably when they were just teenagers.

00:10:17.304 --> 00:10:19.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think of how?

00:10:19.723 --> 00:10:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they arrived in Babylon,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were taken to the palace
for special training,

00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:27.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were told to eat whatever
was put in front of them.

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this case, some of the food
was prohibited under the Mosaic Law.

00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:35.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:37.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
refused to eat those foods,

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:41.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they asked to be given
vegetables and water instead.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for some of you children,

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just the thought of having
to eat vegetables all the time

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is probably quite a test.

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:52.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think of the results of this diet.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:54.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After only 10 days,

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:56.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the three young men
were in much better health

00:10:56.843 --> 00:10:59.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than those who had followed the king’s diet.

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’ve ever had to follow a diet,

00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:04.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that there’s no way
that you can show improvement

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:06.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just 10 days.

00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:09.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had to have been involved.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they were facing death.

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:15.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew their God.

00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:18.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew what he was capable of.

00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:22.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told the king that if it
was the will of God, they would be rescued,

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:27.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if not, they still wouldn’t worship
the image of gold.

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:32.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew that if Jehovah
chose not to intervene miraculously,

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:36.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was not a sign of his disapproval.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you know what happened.

00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:41.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were thrown into the fiery furnace,

00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:45.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God sent his angel to protect them.

00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they stepped out of the furnace,

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:50.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there wasn’t even the smell of fire on them.

00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:54.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their integrity also resulted
in a great witness.

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:57.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the king saw
that they were alive and well, 

00:11:57.237 --> 00:12:00.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he praised Jehovah; he said:
“Praised be the God of Shadrach,

00:12:00.699 --> 00:12:02.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meshach, and Abednego . . .

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:06.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is no other god who is able to rescue

00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:08.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like this one.”

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a witness that gave!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s what happened back then.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?
What’s the lesson?

00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:20.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, many brothers are facing

00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:24.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heat of adversity—Russia, for example.

00:12:24.055 --> 00:12:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many brothers
have been given long prison sentences

00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:30.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they won’t bow down to the state.

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:34.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah doesn’t prevent
this from happening 

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:37.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any more than he prevented
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:39.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from being thrown into the furnace.

00:12:39.321 --> 00:12:41.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he does help them.

00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:45.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we notice about them
as they’re being led off to prison?

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:47.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re smiling.

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:48.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re serene.

00:12:48.663 --> 00:12:50.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re at peace.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They know their God.

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:56.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they come out, there won’t
even be the smell of fire on them.

00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:59.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith will be intact.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their fine conduct also results
in a good witness to the jailers

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:06.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others who hear about the persecution.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll take one more example
in verse 34:

00:13:09.726 --> 00:13:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“escaped the edge of the sword.”

00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking of Elisha.

00:13:15.732 --> 00:13:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the days of the prophet Elisha,

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:21.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of Syria went to war against Israel,

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:23.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he called a war council,

00:13:23.698 --> 00:13:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Syrians
secretly planned their strategy.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah kept telling Elisha
what the Syrians were up to,

00:13:31.164 --> 00:13:34.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Elisha kept telling the king of Israel.

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Syrians were furious,

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:40.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the king sent a large army
to capture Elisha.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What ingratitude!

00:13:43.301 --> 00:13:45.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we say that?

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:48.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because in the previous chapter,
we read that Elisha

00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had cured the leprosy of Naaman,

00:13:50.183 --> 00:13:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a chief of the Syrian army, and now

00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:56.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large Syrian army was hunting Elisha down.

00:13:56.606 --> 00:14:00.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope Naaman wasn’t among them.

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:02.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the Syrians found

00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the city where Elisha was,
and they surrounded it.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:08.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha’s attendant was scared to death,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Elisha wasn’t afraid.

00:14:10.704 --> 00:14:13.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Kings chapter 6,

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:16.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 16, 17 explains why.

00:14:16.835 --> 00:14:18.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is encouraging—faith-strengthening.

00:14:18.837 --> 00:14:22.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look it up—2 Kings chapter 6,

00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:25.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 16, 17.

00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:29.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is Elisha talking to his attendant:

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid!

00:14:31.307 --> 00:14:33.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For there are more who are with us

00:14:33.935 --> 00:14:36.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than those who are with them.’

00:14:36.563 --> 00:14:39.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Elisha began to pray and say:

00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:44.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah, open his eyes,
please, that he may see.’

00:14:44.654 --> 00:14:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately Jehovah opened
the attendant’s eyes and he saw,

00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:52.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and look! the mountainous region

00:14:52.245 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was full of horses and war chariots of fire

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all around Elisha.”

00:14:58.001 --> 00:15:02.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was a miraculous occurrence.

00:15:02.088 --> 00:15:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was faith-strengthening indeed.

00:15:04.507 --> 00:15:06.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the takeaway?

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:15:08.636 --> 00:15:11.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one day we’ll be faced

00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:14.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with hosts of modern-day Syrians.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s going to help us
to remain calm, unafraid?

00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:23.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll look heavenward
and with our eyes of faith,

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see myriads
of angels encamped all around us.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that Jehovah will do the right thing,

00:15:30.575 --> 00:15:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever is in harmony with his will.

00:15:35.538 --> 00:15:38.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hear you say: “I’d like to see a miracle.

00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:41.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would help a lot
to strengthen my faith.”

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see miracles every day.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s a miracle?

00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:50.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a powerful work
that can’t be explained in human terms.

00:15:51.262 --> 00:15:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A modern example of that is prayer.

00:15:54.057 --> 00:15:56.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t prayer amazing?

00:15:56.226 --> 00:15:58.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you explain it?

00:15:58.228 --> 00:16:00.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can listen to millions

00:16:00.313 --> 00:16:02.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of prayers in any language all at once.

00:16:02.774 --> 00:16:05.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a miracle!

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does prayer build our faith?

00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:12.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we pray about a problem
that nobody but Jehovah knows about

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:17.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our prayer is answered,
our faith is strengthened.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is powerful.

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:22.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about all the experiences we hear

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone desperately prayed to God:

00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:28.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you exist, please send someone
to teach me about you”

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:33.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ten minutes later,
a Witness knocks on the door?

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:37.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coincidence or a miracle?

00:16:39.018 --> 00:16:43.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another miracle: our Christian brotherhood
—isn’t it remarkable?

00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can explain it?

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Former enemies become fast friends.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can go to a Kingdom Hall
anywhere in the world

00:16:51.114 --> 00:16:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will find your brothers and sisters.

00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll be glad to see you.
You’ll feel at ease.

00:16:56.953 --> 00:17:01.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll know what they believe and what
they’ll be studying at the meetings.

00:17:01.082 --> 00:17:04.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see and feel the love.

00:17:05.962 --> 00:17:08.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In times of ethnic cleansing,

00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:12.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how often do we read
of brothers and sisters who risk their lives

00:17:12.218 --> 00:17:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hide fellow believers who happen
to be from another tribe?

00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:19.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, when I think
of a loving brotherhood,

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:24.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always think of the experience
Jack Johansson related in his life story.

00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:28.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Johansson
was a missionary serving in Malawi

00:17:28.276 --> 00:17:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when the country was experiencing

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:35.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tremendous political unrest and violence.

00:17:35.158 --> 00:17:37.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he and a young African brother
set out to check on

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the welfare of Witnesses
in another part of the country.

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:46.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But along the way, they encountered
a soldier who wasn’t friendly.

00:17:46.294 --> 00:17:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to the African brother,
“I have to shoot the white man.”

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was serious.

00:17:53.343 --> 00:17:55.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he raised his gun to fire,

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the young African brother thrust himself

00:17:58.181 --> 00:18:00.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the gunman
and Brother Johansson and said:

00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:03.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shoot me!
Shoot me, instead!”

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:07.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that soldier was so touched
by the love of our young African brother,

00:18:07.941 --> 00:18:10.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he put his gun down.

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:13.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hear experiences like that,

00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:16.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes you proud
to be part of Jehovah’s organization.

00:18:16.991 --> 00:18:21.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it that Jehovah
is gathering us into an organization?

00:18:21.162 --> 00:18:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an interesting detail recorded

00:18:23.998 --> 00:18:27.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Isaiah 43:10.

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:28.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to look it up.

00:18:28.836 --> 00:18:32.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when you hear Isaiah 43:10,
you say: “I know that.

00:18:32.924 --> 00:18:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about ‘“You are my witnesses,”
says Jehovah.’”

00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s true.

00:18:36.552 --> 00:18:39.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re going to focus
on another part of the verse.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Isaiah 43:10:

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:46.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah,

00:18:46.187 --> 00:18:49.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, my servant whom I have chosen,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[now notice this] so that you may know

00:18:53.152 --> 00:18:56.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have faith in me.’”

00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we can have faith in Jehovah,

00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to get to know him.

00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:04.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to learn about his powerful works,

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:07.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those past and those present.

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we study his dealings
with his people in the past,

00:19:10.086 --> 00:19:13.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Jehovah
always keeps his promises.

00:19:13.965 --> 00:19:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s promised to bring
about a righteous new world.

00:19:16.592 --> 00:19:19.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can take that promise to the bank.

00:19:19.512 --> 00:19:23.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And through prayer and association
with his organization,

00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can experience the modern-day miracles

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is performing.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we know about Jehovah,
the more we’ll love him.

00:19:35.028 --> 00:19:39.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we love him,
the more we’ll want to tell others about him.

00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:43.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we preach,
the stronger our faith will become,

00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:47.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made powerful by faith.

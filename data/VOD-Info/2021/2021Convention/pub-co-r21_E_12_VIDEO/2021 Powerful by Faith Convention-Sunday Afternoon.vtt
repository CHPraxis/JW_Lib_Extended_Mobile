00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our convention program contains

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 100 audio and video productions,

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:22.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the one we just enjoyed.

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:27.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These videos are made
at various locations around the world.

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have the privilege of supporting this

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other aspects of the Kingdom work.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For your convenience,
donations can be made online

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at donate.jw.org.

00:00:43.814 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Daniel maintained his faith

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:51.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite tests and infirmities.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we do the same?

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:58.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What strength can we gain
from the prophetic visions given to Daniel?

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay close attention

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother Stephen Lett of the Governing Body

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he answers those questions
in the final talk

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this convention, entitled 

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:11.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become Powerful by Your Faith!”

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A building constructed
with steel-reinforced concrete

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can withstand powerful earthquakes.

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:30.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A tree with strong, deep roots

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can remain standing
in the face of many powerful storms.

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An athlete made powerful by rigorous training

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can successfully complete a decathlon

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:47.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a ten-event athletic contest.

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as a building, a tree,

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an athlete can be powerful,

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as Jehovah’s people

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be powerful by means of our faith.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will discuss during this talk
how faith

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:09.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a product of holy spirit,
the most powerful force in the universe—

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can reinforce, or fortify, us

00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:15.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for any (and I mean any)

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
test, trial, or temptation

00:02:18.242 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes our way.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, even though
we may not feel powerful physically

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or emotionally,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith can make us powerful spiritually.

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And spiritual power is much more valuable

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than physical or emotional power.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With spiritual power, we can be like Abraham.

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please go to Romans chapter 4,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice what was said about Abraham,
beginning in verse number 18:

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Although beyond hope, yet based on hope,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he had faith that he would become
the father of many nations

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:04.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to what had been said:
‘So your offspring will be.’

00:03:04.705 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And although he did not grow weak in faith,

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:11.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he considered his own body,
now as good as dead

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(since he was about 100 years old),

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as well as the deadness
of the womb of Sarah.

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:20.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But because of the promise of God,

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he did not waver in a lack of faith;

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he [now notice]

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:30.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“became powerful by his faith,

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:34.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“giving God glory and being fully convinced

00:03:34.568 --> 00:03:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that what He [Jehovah] had promised

00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He [Jehovah] was also able to do.”

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though almost 100 years old

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and Abraham likely
would have been frail physically

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and emotionally weak at times—

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faith made him powerful.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, his faith made him so powerful

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he believed this extraordinary promise
with all his heart

00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that his almost 90-year-old wife, Sarah,

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:10.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would give birth to a son
and that it would definitely come true.

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:15.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though that promise
was unbelievable from a human standpoint,

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:19.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had no doubt whatsoever.

00:04:19.113 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, if our faith
makes us powerful,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will fully believe
all of Jehovah’s promises

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how extraordinary they may seem.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will do so without doubting whatsoever.

00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think about this comparison
to Abraham:

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:44.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An older, frail,
chronically ill servant of Jehovah

00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:46.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may seem weak,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but outward appearance can be very deceptive.

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:53.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that one has been empowered by faith,

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then he is truly strong, just like Abraham.

00:04:59.278 --> 00:05:01.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this wonderful convention

00:05:01.613 --> 00:05:04.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was designed to fortify our faith

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:08.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it will empower us to be so strong

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll be able to endure
whatever test, trial, and temptation

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes against us.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there will actually be no breaking point

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:20.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our integrity.

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s talk about how each day
of our convention

00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:28.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our outstanding drama

00:05:28.182 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have strengthened our faith.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about Friday.

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:38.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The day’s theme was a quote from Luke 17:5:

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:41.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give us more faith.”

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were the humble words
of Jesus’ apostles

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:48.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who recognized their need for more faith,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were humbly pleading for such.

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:53.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we feel the same way, don’t we?

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:55.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know we need more faith,

00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we humbly ask Jehovah for it.

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is,

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:05.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah answer our pleas for more faith?

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:07.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he will.

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:11.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Friday revealed
some of the ways Jehovah answers

00:06:11.683 --> 00:06:15.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our humble plea for more faith.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As illuminated on Friday,

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:19.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gives us faith

00:06:19.816 --> 00:06:22.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
primarily by means of two books

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:26.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible and the book of creation.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first symposium showed
how the Bible builds faith

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s existence;

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it builds faith in itself,
that it’s the Word of God;

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:40.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it builds faith in God’s moral standards;

00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:45.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it builds faith in God’s love for us.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask that first part,

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:50.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does the Bible build faith
in God’s existence?

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:54.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, within its pages,

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it gives us common sense,
reasoning from scriptures

00:06:57.646 --> 00:06:59.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Hebrews 3:4.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you know what that says?

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Of course,

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every house is constructed by someone,

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one
who constructed all things is God.”

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:15.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could never convince
any sane person

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a beautiful house
designed and built itself.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even more so,

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it should not be possible
to convince any rational person

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the beautiful creations around us

00:07:30.387 --> 00:07:34.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just designed and built themselves

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:37.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that they’re the product of blind chance.

00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where there is design,

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:43.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is always a designer.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s illustrate this:

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many times

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you have to throw
black paint from a can

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onto a white ceiling

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:55.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until you produced

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:58.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a perfect map of New York City,

00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the paint particles scattered
accurately identifying all of the streets,

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:08.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the highways, the tunnels, the bridges,
the overpasses, and the landmarks

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:11.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and correctly named each one?

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:14.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you could do that
for billions of times,

00:08:14.222 --> 00:08:18.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and never would you produce
a perfect map of New York City.

00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to add a little humor:

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s say you tried doing this
for 100 billion years, and you get excited.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:27.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You finally got a city map.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh, no!

00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:33.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not New York City;
it’s Warwick, New York.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’ve got to start all over,
going for that map of New York City.

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:39.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to give you a little humor.

00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think of this: One living human cell

00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:47.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is much more complex,

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intricately designed,

00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:51.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than a map of New York City.

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:53.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one human body

00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is made up of about 100 trillion
of such amazing cells

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:01.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all working together harmoniously.

00:09:01.686 --> 00:09:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the second part,
how does the Bible build faith in itself

00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:08.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that it is the Word of God?

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:13.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing,
everything the Bible recommends

00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:16.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
works and brings superior results

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how to raise children,
how to have a happy marriage, and so forth.

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:24.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:
Humans simply aren’t smart enough

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:28.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recommend only what works,

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:33.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their advice is constantly being revised
and updated, isn’t it?

00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:36.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though written hundreds,
thousands, of years ago,

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible has never needed to be revised.

00:09:39.182 --> 00:09:41.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, everything it recommends works.

00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:46.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to be from a higher source
than humans.

00:09:46.773 --> 00:09:49.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the third part, how does the Bible

00:09:49.484 --> 00:09:52.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build faith in God’s moral standards?

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:54.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it tells us what they are.

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It encourages us to obey them,

00:09:57.242 --> 00:09:59.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we do,

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:03.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it protects us physically,
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:05.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get happiness;
we get a good conscience;

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience the benefits.

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:11.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, we don’t have to learn
the painful process

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of trial and error.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:19.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a saying
that “experience is the best teacher”

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:21.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—completely wrong.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:25.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Experience is a school of hard knocks.

00:10:25.103 --> 00:10:27.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the best Teacher.

00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is . . . making
the inexperienced one wise,”

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:35.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Psalm 19:7.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in the fourth part, how does the Bible

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build faith in God’s love for us?

00:10:41.203 --> 00:10:43.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most powerful way is,

00:10:43.205 --> 00:10:48.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it explains how Jehovah gave
his firstborn Son to die for us

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could have everlasting life.

00:10:50.962 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about it:
What do most people give away

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they give something away?

00:10:56.343 --> 00:11:00.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something they don’t need
or at least something they can do without.

00:11:00.514 --> 00:11:03.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave at great cost,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great pain to himself.

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:08.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evolution teaches

00:11:08.396 --> 00:11:12.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our ancestors were apes.

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:16.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could we feel happy and feel loved

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking that an ape was our father?

00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:23.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our real Father, Jehovah,

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:27.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the personification of love.

00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:31.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, on Friday afternoon,

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had our second symposium,

00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:37.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which opened the book of creation.

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:40.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And peering into this book

00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:42.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can empower our faith.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:47.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about that first talk
that dealt with the stars.

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:26 tells us

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah created all of them

00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:58.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘he calls all of them by name.’

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s ponder this for a moment:

00:12:01.366 --> 00:12:03.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long would it take you

00:12:03.743 --> 00:12:08.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to name just the stars
in the Milky Way galaxy

00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:10.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you named one every second?

00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:14.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joseph, Paul, Rachel, Sarah.

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:17.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, scientists estimate

00:12:17.048 --> 00:12:21.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are perhaps 400 billion stars

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you named one a second,
it would take you 400 billion seconds.

00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:29.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how long is that?

00:12:29.477 --> 00:12:33.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twelve thousand six hundred
and eighty four years

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—more than twice the time that has passed

00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:38.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the creation of Adam.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you could go to the next galaxy.

00:12:41.906 --> 00:12:44.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And scientists estimate

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:48.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there may be two trillion galaxies
in the universe.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s five times the number of galaxies

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:56.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our individual stars in the Milky Way.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you ponder that,
it will really give you a headache.

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:03.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah created, sustains,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and calls every one of them by name.

00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:09.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the talk made the point
that if Jehovah can do that,

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:13.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will have no problem
remembering and recreating

00:13:13.521 --> 00:13:18.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:21.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second talk examined
the page in the book of creation

00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:24.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the oceans.

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:26.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How powerful they are!

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the One who made them
is vastly more powerful.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our powerful God
definitely can protect us now

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:39.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right through the great tribulation.

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:44.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third talk examined
the page in creation about the forests,

00:13:44.386 --> 00:13:49.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was discussed how forests
have the amazing ability

00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to repair and renew themselves.

00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the point was made that the One
who has the wisdom to create such forests

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surely knows how to undo all the damage

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that man has done to the planet Earth.

00:14:05.657 --> 00:14:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fourth talk focused on wind and water,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it talked about how Jehovah
has in the past used wind and water

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and especially water in the form of hail—

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:22.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to defeat his enemies and deliver his people.

00:14:22.674 --> 00:14:27.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he will use them again at Armageddon.

00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fifth talk took a glimpse

00:14:29.472 --> 00:14:32.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the fascinating world of sea creatures,

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:36.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we looked at the largest animal alive
on earth today

00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:38.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the blue whale.

00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:41.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what an appetite

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:43.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that blue whale has!

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:46.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can eat, according to the video,

00:14:46.156 --> 00:14:49.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tons of food every day.

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:51.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jehovah feeds it.

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:53.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if he can do that,

00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can he not feed and care for us,

00:14:56.666 --> 00:15:00.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continue to seek first the Kingdom?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our faith was strengthened

00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:05.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he can and he will.

00:15:05.425 --> 00:15:10.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last talk examined our amazing bodies.

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:14.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed, it’s miraculous

00:15:14.017 --> 00:15:18.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how our bodies heal
and repair themselves when damaged.

00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:21.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think of this:
If you damage, scrape, or dent your car,

00:15:21.858 --> 00:15:23.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it heal itself?

00:15:23.902 --> 00:15:25.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hardly!

00:15:25.403 --> 00:15:28.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if every time we bruised, scraped,

00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:30.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or damaged our body

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just stayed that way?

00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:37.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a short time,
we’d get to looking pretty rough.

00:15:37.957 --> 00:15:42.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the God who made our bodies
in this miraculous way

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly can heal all infirmities,

00:15:45.048 --> 00:15:47.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reverse aging,

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prevent sickness in his new world.

00:15:50.094 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he has promised to do that.

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the third symposium

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went back to our main book that builds faith
—the Bible.

00:15:59.687 --> 00:16:01.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed those

00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:04.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who acquired strong faith,

00:16:04.943 --> 00:16:07.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we discussed how they did it.

00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though their contemporaries
were faithless,

00:16:11.574 --> 00:16:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they developed this faith.

00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:16.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our faith was empowered

00:16:16.204 --> 00:16:19.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we discussed Abel, Enoch, Noah,

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:23.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses, and Jesus’ disciples,

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:26.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we became more determined than ever

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:28.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate these faithful ones

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not their faithless contemporaries.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know we can be successful

00:16:34.973 --> 00:16:38.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we have the same Father, Helper,

00:16:38.101 --> 00:16:42.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supplier of holy spirit as they had.

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our three symposiums on Friday

00:16:46.234 --> 00:16:48.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly showed us

00:16:48.278 --> 00:16:52.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah answers our pleas for more faith
by means of two books

00:16:52.824 --> 00:16:55.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Bible and the book of creation.

00:16:55.994 --> 00:16:59.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But regarding our drama, we ask,

00:16:59.372 --> 00:17:01.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah answer

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:05.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel’s pleas for more faith?

00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:09.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way was
he gave Daniel his written Word.

00:17:09.507 --> 00:17:14.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the drama, if you recall,
Daniel’s father gave him a scroll

00:17:14.512 --> 00:17:17.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he regularly referred to.

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you recognize that scroll?

00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:22.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scroll depicted in the drama

00:17:22.353 --> 00:17:25.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is known today as Psalm 27.

00:17:25.565 --> 00:17:28.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When enemies tried to discredit Daniel,

00:17:28.776 --> 00:17:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw him reflect on Psalm 27:11, 12,
which says in part:

00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:37.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not hand me over to my adversaries,

00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for false witnesses
have risen up against me,

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they threaten me with violence.”

00:17:44.792 --> 00:17:47.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was threatened with execution,

00:17:47.045 --> 00:17:49.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw him reflect

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:52.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Psalm 27:7-9,

00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:54.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says in part:

00:17:54.594 --> 00:17:56.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are my helper;

00:17:56.596 --> 00:17:59.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not forsake me or leave me,

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:03.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my God of salvation.”

00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How those verses

00:18:05.063 --> 00:18:09.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have bolstered Daniel’s faith!

00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we cannot say for sure
that Daniel reflected

00:18:12.528 --> 00:18:15.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on those specific verses,

00:18:15.114 --> 00:18:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Bible does reveal that Daniel’s faith

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indeed was strengthened by the Scriptures.

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:24.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that Daniel

00:18:24.248 --> 00:18:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a keen student of Bible prophecy.

00:18:27.377 --> 00:18:30.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even said of himself at Daniel 9:2:

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:33.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Daniel, discerned by the books

00:18:33.758 --> 00:18:36.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[that is, the sacred books]
the number of years.”

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:40.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he talks about the desolation
(restoration) of Jerusalem

00:18:40.598 --> 00:18:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“namely, 70 years.”

00:18:44.352 --> 00:18:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, Will Jehovah answer

00:18:47.146 --> 00:18:49.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our pleas for more faith?

00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:52.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most definitely he will.

00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one outstanding way he has done this

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:59.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by providing us with Bible prophecy.

00:18:59.826 --> 00:19:04.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prophecies in the book of Daniel alone
have helped millions

00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:07.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build rock-solid faith.

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the fulfilled prophecies

00:19:09.961 --> 00:19:13.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the king of the north
and the king of the south

00:19:13.464 --> 00:19:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been very faith-strengthening.

00:19:16.092 --> 00:19:20.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s review the video on this topic

00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:24.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that appeared in Brother Kenneth Cook’s
May broadcast.

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:26.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy this powerful video.

00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:32.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel received a prophecy

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coming of two rivals:

00:19:34.652 --> 00:19:36.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:38.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the king of the south.”

00:19:38.948 --> 00:19:40.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it been fulfilled?

00:19:47.707 --> 00:19:50.710 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s, the German Empire

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.754 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:54.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That government brought

00:19:54.213 --> 00:19:55.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
its “power and . . . heart

00:19:55.506 --> 00:19:56.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“against the king of the south

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a large army.”

00:19:59.427 --> 00:20:01.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, its navy was

00:20:01.637 --> 00:20:04.098 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the second largest on earth.

00:20:05.975 --> 00:20:09.103 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who became the king of the south?

00:20:09.103 --> 00:20:11.105 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The alliance between Britain

00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:13.316 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States.

00:20:13.316 --> 00:20:15.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He fought during World War I

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:17.320 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“with an exceedingly large

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and mighty army.”

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:21.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He “swept away” and “humbled”

00:20:21.616 --> 00:20:23.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north.

00:20:24.994 --> 00:20:26.412 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that was not the end

00:20:26.412 --> 00:20:28.498 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:30.625 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He turned his attention to and then hurled

00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:33.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“denunciations against the holy covenant.”

00:20:35.254 --> 00:20:37.507 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He removed “the constant feature”

00:20:37.507 --> 00:20:39.509 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by limiting the freedom of God’s people

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:42.303 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to preach,

00:20:42.303 --> 00:20:44.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning many,

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:46.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even killing hundreds

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.809 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s anointed ones

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:49.811 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their fellow workers.

00:20:51.896 --> 00:20:54.398 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:56.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:58.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:00.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It worked with the king of the south

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “put in place the disgusting thing

00:21:02.907 --> 00:21:05.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that causes desolation”

00:21:05.409 --> 00:21:07.620 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the United Nations.

00:21:17.088 --> 00:21:19.715 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in the early 1900’s,

00:21:19.715 --> 00:21:22.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:24.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
religion in the lands under its control,

00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:27.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling the words

00:21:27.765 --> 00:21:29.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he would “show no regard

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the God of his fathers.”

00:21:35.565 --> 00:21:38.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,

00:21:38.442 --> 00:21:41.320 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but “to the god of fortresses.”

00:21:42.363 --> 00:21:43.948 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied,

00:21:43.948 --> 00:21:45.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he used this military might

00:21:45.783 --> 00:21:47.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
against the king of the south

00:21:47.326 --> 00:21:50.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by engaging “with him in a pushing.”

00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:51.956 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Anglo-America competed

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:53.082 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Soviet Union

00:21:53.082 --> 00:21:55.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for world domination,

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:57.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fighting in and supporting wars

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and political struggles around the globe.

00:22:04.177 --> 00:22:07.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:10.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was unclear who would fill the role
of the king of the north.

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:13.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a time, God’s people there

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:16.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been able to preach
and worship peacefully.

00:22:17.523 --> 00:22:20.568 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years, Russia and its allies

00:22:20.568 --> 00:22:23.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have pushed back at the king of the south.

00:22:23.487 --> 00:22:25.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both kings have accused each other

00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:28.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:22:29.535 --> 00:22:31.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the king of the north has not limited

00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:34.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his attacks to the king of the south.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.375 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As foretold, he also entered

00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:39.754 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“into the land of the Decoration”

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:41.964 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—our realm of spiritual activity.

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:45.468 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russian authorities continue

00:22:45.468 --> 00:22:47.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attack true worship.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.558 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We expect such persecution,

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:55.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we also expect it to end.

00:23:14.163 --> 00:23:16.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our King, Jesus Christ,

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more powerful than any human government.

00:23:21.754 --> 00:23:26.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he will destroy
not only the kings of the north and the south

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all of his enemies,

00:23:29.345 --> 00:23:33.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will deliver God’s loyal people.

00:24:01.711 --> 00:24:04.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful video!

00:24:05.256 --> 00:24:08.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the unerring accuracy of those prophecies

00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthened your faith?

00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re confident that it has.

00:24:13.848 --> 00:24:17.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re absolutely convinced
that the rest of that prophecy,

00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:19.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including our deliverance,

00:24:19.687 --> 00:24:21.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be fulfilled.

00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:26.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christ soon will defend God’s people

00:24:26.027 --> 00:24:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring an end
to this entire wicked system.

00:24:30.573 --> 00:24:33.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us continue to study

00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:36.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these and other prophecies.

00:24:36.871 --> 00:24:39.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, our faith

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our wise, our all-powerful,
our loving Father

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will definitely be strengthened.

00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s move to Saturday’s program,

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:54.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which had the theme taken from Jude 3:

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Put up a hard fight for the faith.”

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:03.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The symposium
“Successful Fighters for the Faith”

00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:07.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed that many who do not have a spouse

00:25:07.485 --> 00:25:11.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many whose spouse
is not yet serving Jehovah

00:25:11.364 --> 00:25:14.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are winning their fight for the faith.

00:25:14.658 --> 00:25:17.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we warmly commend

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:21.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you dear, beloved ones.

00:25:21.123 --> 00:25:25.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The baptism discourse
encouraged new disciples

00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:28.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue strengthening their faith,

00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:33.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we warmly welcome
all newly baptized ones.

00:25:33.594 --> 00:25:36.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves you very much.

00:25:36.013 --> 00:25:38.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body loves you very much.

00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:41.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brothers and sisters love you very much.

00:25:41.394 --> 00:25:45.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re so happy to have you join us

00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:47.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our united family

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:51.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense fighters for the faith.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two afternoon symposiums

00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:59.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped us to analyze
how we can show our faith

00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:01.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving of our time,

00:26:01.872 --> 00:26:04.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
energy, and material things

00:26:04.959 --> 00:26:08.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work
and to help others.

00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:13.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we discussed some specific things
that we may be able to do.

00:26:13.175 --> 00:26:17.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, learn a new language,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move and serve where the need is greater,

00:26:20.891 --> 00:26:24.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:27.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assist with a building project,

00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:31.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “set something aside” for Jehovah’s work.

00:26:33.112 --> 00:26:36.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The talk “Put Up a Hard Fight for the Faith!”

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminded us that as is true in all fights

00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in our fight—

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:45.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have enemies.

00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:49.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, we must reject apostate lies

00:26:49.336 --> 00:26:52.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the false stories of other opposers,

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are designed to sow doubt
and weaken faith.

00:26:57.303 --> 00:26:59.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is very skilled

00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:03.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at using innuendo, half-truths, and lies.

00:27:03.684 --> 00:27:07.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not surprising that the news media

00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:12.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which is often manipulated by apostates,
clergymen, and other opposers—

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:16.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likewise often employs innuendo,

00:27:16.947 --> 00:27:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
half-truths, and lies

00:27:19.408 --> 00:27:22.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Jehovah’s organization.

00:27:22.244 --> 00:27:26.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:
Faith is a product of holy spirit.

00:27:26.832 --> 00:27:31.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a provision from Jehovah
to strengthen us,

00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:33.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas doubt

00:27:33.714 --> 00:27:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a tool of the Devil designed to weaken us.

00:27:38.802 --> 00:27:42.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall how Satan approached Eve?

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it really so

00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:49.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God said you must not eat
from every tree of the garden?”

00:27:49.146 --> 00:27:51.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is that really so?’

00:27:51.398 --> 00:27:53.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he present it that way?

00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:55.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To plant doubt

00:27:55.569 --> 00:27:58.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘shipwreck her faith,’ and he succeeded.

00:27:58.864 --> 00:28:01.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, likewise, if we’re not careful,

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:04.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubt can shipwreck our faith.

00:28:04.245 --> 00:28:06.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But strong faith

00:28:06.288 --> 00:28:10.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keeps doubt out of our hearts and minds.

00:28:10.543 --> 00:28:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, in talking just a little bit more
about apostates,

00:28:14.129 --> 00:28:18.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what if an apostate knocked
at your front door and said,

00:28:18.342 --> 00:28:22.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’d like to come into your home,
I’d like to sit down with you,

00:28:22.429 --> 00:28:27.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d like to teach you
some apostate ideas”?

00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:30.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, you would immediately
get rid of him, wouldn’t you?

00:28:30.437 --> 00:28:33.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would send him down the highway.

00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:36.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now think of this:
What if that same apostate

00:28:36.068 --> 00:28:39.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tries to come into your home
by means of the television

00:28:39.697 --> 00:28:41.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or computer?

00:28:41.699 --> 00:28:44.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, hopefully, we reject him

00:28:44.785 --> 00:28:47.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as decisively.

00:28:47.538 --> 00:28:50.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second John 10 says:

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:54.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If anyone comes to you
and does not bring this teaching,

00:28:54.962 --> 00:28:58.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[never] receive him into your homes”

00:28:58.924 --> 00:29:01.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that would mean not through the front door,

00:29:01.135 --> 00:29:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not through the television, or computer.

00:29:05.014 --> 00:29:08.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, though, some have reasoned foolishly:

00:29:08.684 --> 00:29:12.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I listen to this apostate
on television or the computer

00:29:12.396 --> 00:29:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘or perhaps read his book,

00:29:14.523 --> 00:29:17.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll recognize how wrong he is.

00:29:17.443 --> 00:29:19.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It’ll build up my faith.

00:29:19.528 --> 00:29:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And if I ever encounter this teaching
in the ministry,

00:29:23.073 --> 00:29:26.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll better be able to refute it.’

00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:30.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is foolish thinking indeed.

00:29:30.247 --> 00:29:32.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be like reasoning,

00:29:32.499 --> 00:29:37.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If I eat stinky, rotten, food
from a garbage can,

00:29:37.004 --> 00:29:39.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘it will really help me in the future

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:42.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recognize bad food.’

00:29:42.343 --> 00:29:44.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not very good reasoning, is it?

00:29:45.763 --> 00:29:50.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than feed our minds
poisonous, apostate ideas,

00:29:50.351 --> 00:29:52.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read God’s Word daily

00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:57.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen and safeguard our faith.

00:29:57.399 --> 00:30:00.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, How did Daniel

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put up a hard fight for the faith?

00:30:02.821 --> 00:30:07.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one thing, he resisted pressure

00:30:07.242 --> 00:30:09.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compromise.

00:30:09.244 --> 00:30:12.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine the pressure
he must have faced

00:30:12.414 --> 00:30:16.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when offered the king’s delicacies and wine?

00:30:16.627 --> 00:30:19.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was he able to refuse?

00:30:19.213 --> 00:30:24.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for the answer,
let’s go to Daniel chapter 1, please,

00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:28.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse number 8.

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:31.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 1:8: “But Daniel

00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:34.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“resolved in his heart

00:30:34.603 --> 00:30:39.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he would not defile himself
with the king’s delicacies

00:30:39.066 --> 00:30:41.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or with the wine he drank.

00:30:41.402 --> 00:30:45.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he asked the principal court official
for permission

00:30:45.072 --> 00:30:48.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to defile himself in this way.”

00:30:48.742 --> 00:30:51.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So notice, in advance,

00:30:51.286 --> 00:30:54.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel “resolved in his heart”

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the course he was going to take.

00:30:56.792 --> 00:31:00.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did so because he was fully convinced

00:31:00.462 --> 00:31:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that whatever Jehovah had commanded

00:31:03.132 --> 00:31:05.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for his good.

00:31:07.386 --> 00:31:12.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, like Daniel, we must put up
a hard fight for the faith.

00:31:13.267 --> 00:31:16.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you facing pressure right now

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:20.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—at school, at work, or even at home—

00:31:20.274 --> 00:31:22.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to compromise?

00:31:22.317 --> 00:31:26.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, please don’t give up

00:31:26.113 --> 00:31:28.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t give in.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on Daniel’s example,

00:31:31.368 --> 00:31:34.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fight for your faith.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:38.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be resolved to obey Jehovah because doing so

00:31:38.667 --> 00:31:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always the right thing,

00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:44.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you do, you will have no regrets.

00:31:45.924 --> 00:31:50.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pressure was also put on Daniel
by means of threats.

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine how Daniel felt
when he became aware

00:31:53.849 --> 00:31:58.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his next prayer
could lead to his execution?

00:31:58.562 --> 00:32:01.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped him to stay loyal?

00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go to Daniel chapter 6

00:32:04.526 --> 00:32:06.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get some help with that question.

00:32:06.695 --> 00:32:09.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 6

00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:13.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, please, let’s read together
verse number 10:

00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:17.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as soon as Daniel knew

00:32:17.331 --> 00:32:20.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the decree had been signed,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he went to his house,

00:32:22.002 --> 00:32:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which had the windows of his roof chamber
open toward Jerusalem.

00:32:26.048 --> 00:32:29.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And three times a day
he got down on his knees

00:32:29.802 --> 00:32:34.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and prayed and offered praise
before his God,

00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:38.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice] as he had regularly done

00:32:38.435 --> 00:32:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to this.”

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:43.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Daniel knew what was right,

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:45.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he didn’t hesitate to do it,

00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:48.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was consistent in his worship.

00:32:48.237 --> 00:32:51.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 6:16 tells us

00:32:51.824 --> 00:32:56.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Daniel
was “continually serving” his God.

00:32:56.036 --> 00:32:59.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And <i>The Watchtower </i> explains
that the original Bible word

00:32:59.248 --> 00:33:01.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
translated “continually serving”

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:05.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
basically means to “move in a circle,”

00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which suggests continuity.

00:33:08.924 --> 00:33:12.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how well that describes
Daniel’s unbroken worship!

00:33:12.845 --> 00:33:14.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, there’s no end to a circle.

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:17.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s unbroken, is it not?

00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:21.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following dramatization

00:33:21.645 --> 00:33:26.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that depicts a brother
who faces a threat of being arrested.

00:33:26.316 --> 00:33:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by reflecting on Daniel’s example,

00:33:29.778 --> 00:33:34.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is helped to continue serving Jehovah
with constancy

00:33:34.783 --> 00:33:38.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the face
of this intimidating circumstance.

00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:44.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s still chaos in many parts of the city,

00:33:44.376 --> 00:33:47.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with armed soldiers detaining and arresting

00:33:47.296 --> 00:33:48.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 those not pledging support

00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:49.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the new government.

00:33:51.174 --> 00:33:53.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we still going to the meeting tonight?

00:33:55.762 --> 00:33:57.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to do what was best

00:33:57.764 --> 00:33:59.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for my wife and daughter.

00:34:03.562 --> 00:34:05.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a few of the elders

00:34:05.188 --> 00:34:07.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have already been arrested.

00:34:07.524 --> 00:34:09.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if I was arrested?

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would happen to my family?

00:34:48.148 --> 00:34:50.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not going home to pray, are you?

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I pray at my window three times a day,

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:56.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day.

00:34:56.823 --> 00:35:00.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I even appear to compromise,

00:35:02.287 --> 00:35:04.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would they think?

00:35:05.082 --> 00:35:07.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know Jehovah.

00:35:07.167 --> 00:35:09.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if I trust him,

00:35:10.003 --> 00:35:12.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll reward me.

00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know how,

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:19.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will.

00:35:19.262 --> 00:35:21.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray that I keep my faith

00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:25.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that we all keep our faith—

00:35:25.727 --> 00:35:28.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter how this ends.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures are clear.

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:35.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must continue to meet together,

00:35:35.946 --> 00:35:37.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in small groups if necessary.

00:35:38.657 --> 00:35:40.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s just pray that whatever happens,

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:43.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the strength to endure it.

00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:49.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear Jehovah God, please . . .

00:35:49.209 --> 00:35:51.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I was arrested.

00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:05.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We miss you so much,

00:36:05.142 --> 00:36:08.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re very proud of you.

00:36:08.186 --> 00:36:10.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know whatever the outcome of your trial,

00:36:10.897 --> 00:36:12.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll maintain your faith,

00:36:12.941 --> 00:36:15.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will we.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you scared?

00:36:19.781 --> 00:36:21.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very scared,

00:36:23.702 --> 00:36:26.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah helps us when we’re scared.

00:36:30.584 --> 00:36:32.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I would be OK

00:36:32.794 --> 00:36:34.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah

00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:36.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would take care of my family.

00:36:39.176 --> 00:36:42.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As was true of the brother in our video,

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:45.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be persecuted.

00:36:45.682 --> 00:36:48.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 3:12 says:

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All those desiring to live
with godly devotion

00:36:51.563 --> 00:36:54.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in association with Christ Jesus

00:36:54.274 --> 00:36:57.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also be persecuted.”

00:36:57.944 --> 00:37:01.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t say maybe, good chance, probably

00:37:01.198 --> 00:37:03.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘will be persecuted.’

00:37:03.241 --> 00:37:04.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s guaranteed.

00:37:04.993 --> 00:37:08.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like our brother in the video,

00:37:08.121 --> 00:37:12.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when persecuted,
let’s reflect on Daniel’s example

00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:15.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s fight for our faith.

00:37:15.087 --> 00:37:19.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then let’s pray,
confident that our God

00:37:19.091 --> 00:37:23.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always mightier than our enemies.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be like young David
when he went out to meet Goliath.

00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, David saw the big picture, didn’t he?

00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:32.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure, he saw how big Goliath was,

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the big picture,

00:37:34.022 --> 00:37:37.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw how puny Goliath was

00:37:37.442 --> 00:37:41.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to his almighty God, Jehovah.

00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:46.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a unique way, Daniel also experienced

00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how mighty Jehovah is

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was thrown into the lions’ pit.

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:55.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sent an angel
to shut the mouths of those lions.

00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:59.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about it: Those lions
obviously were very hungry

00:37:59.005 --> 00:38:02.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because a little bit later
when people were thrown in there,

00:38:02.342 --> 00:38:05.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were consumed
before they hit the bottom of the pit.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they were very hungry,

00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:11.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Daniel would have looked
like a tasty morsel.

00:38:11.143 --> 00:38:13.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter how hard they tried,

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those lions couldn’t get their mouths open

00:38:17.399 --> 00:38:20.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to harm Daniel.

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:22.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel also set a good example

00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in remaining hopeful despite old age

00:38:26.616 --> 00:38:28.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and infirmities.

00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:33.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can you imagine how Daniel felt
when he was almost 100 years old

00:38:33.456 --> 00:38:36.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many Jews left
for their beloved homeland, Judah,

00:38:36.877 --> 00:38:39.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was unable to go with them?

00:38:39.296 --> 00:38:43.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped him to keep his hope alive?

00:38:43.175 --> 00:38:46.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go to Daniel chapter 10, please.

00:38:46.469 --> 00:38:49.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see one thing that helped Daniel.

00:38:49.472 --> 00:38:54.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Daniel chapter 10 and beginning
in verse 18, Daniel says:

00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:57.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who looked like a man
touched me again

00:38:57.772 --> 00:38:59.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and strengthened me.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:04.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he said: ‘Do not be afraid,
O very precious man.

00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:06.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May you have peace.

00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:10.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be strong, yes, be strong.’

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As he spoke with me I was strengthened

00:39:14.414 --> 00:39:18.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I said: ‘Let my lord speak,

00:39:18.293 --> 00:39:21.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you have strengthened me.’”

00:39:21.338 --> 00:39:25.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So through an angel, Jehovah reassured Daniel

00:39:25.842 --> 00:39:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was precious
and still very useful to Him.

00:39:30.847 --> 00:39:33.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Daniel accepted
the encouragement, didn’t he?

00:39:33.934 --> 00:39:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thereafter, Jehovah
gave him a thrilling prophecy

00:39:37.854 --> 00:39:41.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the king of the north
and the king of the south, which he recorded

00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:43.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our benefit.

00:39:43.235 --> 00:39:47.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although old and infirm, this precious man

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was still very useful to Jehovah.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following dramatization

00:39:55.413 --> 00:39:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which an older brother who feels helpless

00:39:59.668 --> 00:40:03.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflects on how the angel reassured Daniel.

00:40:12.305 --> 00:40:15.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all went by so quickly

00:40:17.978 --> 00:40:19.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pioneering,

00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:24.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foreign language,

00:40:25.735 --> 00:40:27.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circuit work.

00:40:29.572 --> 00:40:31.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was even a time

00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:34.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was the one encouraging older ones.

00:40:35.453 --> 00:40:39.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss those days so much.

00:40:40.417 --> 00:40:44.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now I’m the one in a nursing home.

00:40:48.174 --> 00:40:50.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I feel like I have

00:40:50.552 --> 00:40:52.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing left to offer.

00:40:58.852 --> 00:41:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Daniel,

00:41:02.063 --> 00:41:04.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you very precious man.

00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:09.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been sent to you.

00:41:11.406 --> 00:41:13.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your words have been heard

00:41:14.993 --> 00:41:16.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the first day you gave your heart

00:41:16.244 --> 00:41:17.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understanding.

00:41:17.662 --> 00:41:19.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no strength.

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:22.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no breath left in me.

00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be afraid, O very precious man.

00:41:25.879 --> 00:41:27.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you have peace.

00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:29.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong.

00:41:30.633 --> 00:41:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be strong!

00:41:36.848 --> 00:41:39.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

00:41:40.352 --> 00:41:41.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go on to the end.

00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:44.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will rest, but you will stand up

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:48.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.

00:41:51.112 --> 00:41:52.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, just checking on you.

00:41:53.448 --> 00:41:54.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a minute?

00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:55.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something I’ve been wanting

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share with you.

00:41:57.786 --> 00:41:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sure.

00:42:08.963 --> 00:42:12.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah does remember me,

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I still have much to offer.

00:42:19.516 --> 00:42:23.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very touching video indeed!

00:42:23.395 --> 00:42:25.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask, Do you have infirmities

00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:29.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that keep you from doing
what you would like to do?

00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, reflect on Daniel’s example

00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and accept Jehovah’s reassurance.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember that what you used to do

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is still viewed as valuable to Jehovah.

00:42:42.372 --> 00:42:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will not forget it.

00:42:44.874 --> 00:42:48.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your present acts of faithfulness,

00:42:48.086 --> 00:42:50.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if small,

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are very precious to him.

00:42:53.049 --> 00:42:55.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We entreat all of you:

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether young or old,

00:42:57.303 --> 00:43:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Daniel, do not stop

00:43:00.223 --> 00:43:03.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting up a hard fight for the faith.

00:43:04.644 --> 00:43:07.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s talk about today’s program,

00:43:07.772 --> 00:43:12.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has the theme taken from Matthew 21:21:

00:43:12.068 --> 00:43:16.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you have faith . . . , it will happen.”

00:43:16.865 --> 00:43:21.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the morning, we enjoyed
the faith-strengthening symposium

00:43:21.578 --> 00:43:25.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate Women of Strong Faith!”

00:43:25.707 --> 00:43:27.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in each of the eight parts,

00:43:27.792 --> 00:43:31.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the exemplary women of faith
who were discussed

00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:35.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced mountainlike obstacles.

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:39.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah had to leave a comfortable lifestyle

00:43:39.554 --> 00:43:41.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a nomadic lifestyle,

00:43:41.556 --> 00:43:45.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for many years, she suffered barrenness.

00:43:45.602 --> 00:43:50.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rahab had to take decisive action
—risk her life—

00:43:50.607 --> 00:43:53.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect the Israelite spies

00:43:53.193 --> 00:43:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take a stand with God’s people.

00:43:55.278 --> 00:44:00.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, she had to give up
an immoral lifestyle.

00:44:00.283 --> 00:44:03.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah continued to serve Jehovah

00:44:03.036 --> 00:44:07.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while enduring many years of barrenness
and harassment from Peninnah.

00:44:08.374 --> 00:44:10.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The captive Israelite girl

00:44:10.418 --> 00:44:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was forcibly separated from her family

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Syrian marauders

00:44:16.758 --> 00:44:20.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nevertheless continued
to fearlessly witness

00:44:20.595 --> 00:44:23.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to others about Jehovah.

00:44:23.848 --> 00:44:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary accepted the difficult assignment

00:44:27.644 --> 00:44:29.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving birth to, caring for,

00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:33.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and training God’s Son.

00:44:33.191 --> 00:44:37.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Phoenician woman
courageously and persistently

00:44:37.445 --> 00:44:39.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sought help from Jesus

00:44:39.864 --> 00:44:42.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her demon-possessed daughter.

00:44:42.283 --> 00:44:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she got that help, didn’t she?

00:44:45.161 --> 00:44:49.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martha, after the painful loss
of her brother to the enemy death,

00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:53.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintained faith in Jesus’ ability

00:44:53.253 --> 00:44:55.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to raise the dead.

00:44:55.755 --> 00:44:59.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two modern-day examples
that we discussed in the last talk,

00:44:59.634 --> 00:45:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters Ishii and Toom,

00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:06.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both steadfastly refused to compromise

00:45:06.057 --> 00:45:09.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being imprisoned for many years

00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:12.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply because they were
Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:45:12.897 --> 00:45:16.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each one of these dear sisters faced

00:45:16.734 --> 00:45:19.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mountainlike obstacles

00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:23.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah rewarded their faith.

00:45:23.992 --> 00:45:28.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faith moved them
to expect good things from Jehovah,

00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:33.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah never ever let them down.

00:45:33.084 --> 00:45:36.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what good things
do we expect from Jehovah

00:45:36.379 --> 00:45:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we maintain strong faith?

00:45:39.048 --> 00:45:41.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about some of the events

00:45:41.134 --> 00:45:44.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we expect to unfold in the near future.

00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:48.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for one thing, the final part
of Nebuchadnezzar’s image dream

00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussed in Daniel chapter 2
will be fulfilled.

00:45:53.021 --> 00:45:57.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As represented by the four upper parts
of that image,

00:45:57.442 --> 00:46:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
four world powers have come and gone,

00:46:02.363 --> 00:46:04.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as prophesied.

00:46:04.574 --> 00:46:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Anglo-American World Power,

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:11.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
symbolized by the feet of iron and clay,

00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:13.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is dominating.

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:16.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more than ever,
we see this last world power

00:46:16.502 --> 00:46:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living up to being a noncohesive mixture

00:46:20.089 --> 00:46:22.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of iron and clay.

00:46:22.383 --> 00:46:25.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as iron mixed with clay

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:27.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is weaker than solid iron,

00:46:27.722 --> 00:46:31.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so too the Anglo-American World Power
is weaker

00:46:31.934 --> 00:46:36.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the ironlike Roman Empire
from which it emerged.

00:46:36.314 --> 00:46:41.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ability of the Anglo-American World Power
to act with ironlike strength

00:46:41.027 --> 00:46:44.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is weakened by claylike elements,

00:46:44.906 --> 00:46:48.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as people rising up
to claim their rights

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through insurrection,

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
civil rights campaigns,

00:46:53.581 --> 00:46:56.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and independence movements.

00:46:56.501 --> 00:47:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Daniel foretold in chapter 2, verse 42:

00:47:00.088 --> 00:47:04.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The kingdom will be partly strong

00:47:04.175 --> 00:47:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and partly fragile.”

00:47:06.469 --> 00:47:11.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see that is
more and more evident today than ever.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite the weakened condition
of this final world power,

00:47:17.021 --> 00:47:22.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will not simply disintegrate
into self-destruction.

00:47:22.026 --> 00:47:27.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Daniel chapter 2,
and let’s notice how it comes to its end.

00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:31.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very familiar scripture here
—Daniel 2:44:

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the days of those kings the God of heaven

00:47:34.622 --> 00:47:38.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will set up a kingdom
that will never be destroyed.

00:47:38.668 --> 00:47:42.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And this kingdom will not be passed on
to any other people.

00:47:42.797 --> 00:47:47.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It will crush and put an end
to all these kingdoms,

00:47:47.677 --> 00:47:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it alone will stand forever,

00:47:51.347 --> 00:47:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as you saw that out of the mountain
a stone was cut not by hands

00:47:56.352 --> 00:48:00.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, not by human hands,
but by Jehovah’s hands],

00:48:00.022 --> 00:48:03.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that it crushed the iron, the copper,

00:48:03.234 --> 00:48:06.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the clay, the silver, and the gold.

00:48:06.654 --> 00:48:11.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Grand God has made known to the king
what will happen in the future.

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:13.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dream is true,

00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its interpretation is trustworthy.”

00:48:17.206 --> 00:48:20.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture describes how God’s Kingdom,

00:48:20.626 --> 00:48:22.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represented by that stone,

00:48:22.962 --> 00:48:26.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will crush all human governments

00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:28.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Armageddon.

00:48:28.843 --> 00:48:33.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And interestingly, at Daniel 2:34,

00:48:33.848 --> 00:48:36.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us that ‘the stone [God’s Kingdom]

00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:40.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will strike the image
[representing human governments]

00:48:40.146 --> 00:48:43.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the feet of iron and clay,’

00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly identifying that Armageddon will come

00:48:47.236 --> 00:48:52.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power

00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:56.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the final human world power.

00:48:56.162 --> 00:48:59.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Daniel, we have strong faith

00:48:59.832 --> 00:49:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last sentence of verse 45, which says:

00:49:03.211 --> 00:49:06.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dream is true, and its interpretation

00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:08.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is trustworthy.”

00:49:08.966 --> 00:49:12.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt about it:
God’s Kingdom will destroy

00:49:12.637 --> 00:49:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all human governments at Armageddon

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:19.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power.

00:49:20.144 --> 00:49:23.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, just as the final part
of the image dream

00:49:23.439 --> 00:49:25.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be fulfilled,

00:49:25.566 --> 00:49:30.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final part of Daniel’s vision
in chapter 7

00:49:30.112 --> 00:49:32.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be fulfilled.

00:49:32.114 --> 00:49:37.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in chapter 7,
Daniel describes four wild beasts,

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:42.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which symbolize four world powers
that have come and gone.

00:49:42.124 --> 00:49:46.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And appropriately,
they’re described as wild beasts

00:49:46.045 --> 00:49:48.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they haven’t ruled kindly

00:49:48.089 --> 00:49:51.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, in a harsh, beastly way.

00:49:51.926 --> 00:49:54.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those four world powers

00:49:54.303 --> 00:49:57.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome

00:49:57.723 --> 00:50:00.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very same four world powers

00:50:00.184 --> 00:50:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
represented by the four upper metal parts

00:50:03.938 --> 00:50:08.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the image dream we discussed previously.

00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:13.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in verse 8, Daniel describes a horn

00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:17.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that grew out of the head
of that fourth beast—out of Rome;

00:50:17.118 --> 00:50:21.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that horn had eyes; that horn had a mouth;

00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:24.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mouth spoke arrogantly.

00:50:24.959 --> 00:50:28.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this arrogant horn symbolizes

00:50:28.796 --> 00:50:31.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Anglo-American World Power

00:50:31.173 --> 00:50:34.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, the last world power.

00:50:34.719 --> 00:50:38.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was foretold to happen next?

00:50:38.431 --> 00:50:41.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll go to Daniel chapter 7, please.

00:50:41.475 --> 00:50:43.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what happens next.

00:50:43.603 --> 00:50:45.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 7,

00:50:45.646 --> 00:50:49.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please let’s begin in verse number 26:

00:50:49.483 --> 00:50:52.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the Court sat,

00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:56.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they took away his rulership
[that is, that horn’s rulership],

00:50:56.908 --> 00:51:01.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in order to annihilate him
and to destroy him completely.

00:51:01.495 --> 00:51:05.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the kingdom and the rulership
and the grandeur

00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:08.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the kingdoms under all the heavens

00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:10.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were given to the people

00:51:10.504 --> 00:51:14.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who are the holy ones of the Supreme One.

00:51:14.008 --> 00:51:17.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,

00:51:17.595 --> 00:51:22.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all rulerships will serve and obey them.”

00:51:22.516 --> 00:51:26.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rulership of this arrogant horn
is taken away,

00:51:26.687 --> 00:51:29.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is annihilated and destroyed

00:51:29.023 --> 00:51:32.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and replaced by God’s Kingdom.

00:51:32.485 --> 00:51:37.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just as described
in the imagery in this vision,

00:51:37.406 --> 00:51:41.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that God’s Kingdom
destroys all human governments

00:51:41.953 --> 00:51:45.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the time
of the Anglo-American World Power

00:51:45.581 --> 00:51:49.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then takes over rulership of the earth.

00:51:49.502 --> 00:51:52.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How exciting that event,

00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:57.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which will take place
in the near future, will be!

00:51:57.134 --> 00:52:02.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think about it: Every preceding part
of that prophecy has come true.

00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have complete confidence, strong faith,

00:52:06.102 --> 00:52:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the final part of it
will also come true.

00:52:11.107 --> 00:52:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are many other prophecies
in the book of Daniel

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we didn’t have time to discuss

00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:20.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come true in amazing detail.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:24.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fulfillment of so many prophecies

00:52:24.578 --> 00:52:26.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
totally convinces us

00:52:26.831 --> 00:52:31.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are deep, deep
in “the time of the end.”

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very soon, we’re going to witness

00:52:33.879 --> 00:52:37.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fulfillment of Daniel 12:1,

00:52:37.758 --> 00:52:41.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which talks about ‘Michael the great prince

00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:43.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing up.’

00:52:43.347 --> 00:52:46.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur
a time of [great] distress.”

00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:50.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s “people will escape,

00:52:50.312 --> 00:52:54.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who is found
written down in the book.”

00:52:54.942 --> 00:52:57.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the video near the beginning of this talk,

00:52:57.695 --> 00:53:01.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw Michael, the glorified Jesus Christ,

00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:05.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicted as coming with the angels

00:53:05.202 --> 00:53:07.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to rescue Jehovah’s people

00:53:07.538 --> 00:53:10.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and destroy this wicked system.

00:53:10.332 --> 00:53:13.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, if you notice carefully
in that video,

00:53:13.335 --> 00:53:17.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wicked were actually shooting
their weapons

00:53:17.548 --> 00:53:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the sky at Michael.

00:53:21.844 --> 00:53:24.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s laughable
—isn’t it?—

00:53:24.472 --> 00:53:27.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because mankind’s most powerful weapons

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:29.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are like wet firecrackers

00:53:29.935 --> 00:53:32.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared to Michael’s mighty power.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:37.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in the video,
Michael was depicted as coming

00:53:37.234 --> 00:53:40.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with no defensive equipment,
such as a breastplate or shield.

00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:42.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t need it.

00:53:42.907 --> 00:53:45.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was depicted only with a sword

00:53:45.993 --> 00:53:48.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an offensive weapon.

00:53:48.037 --> 00:53:52.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes in our illustrations,
he’s depicted with a bow and arrow

00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:56.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—again, only an offensive weapon.

00:53:56.045 --> 00:54:00.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his offensive weapons are powerful

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:03.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—much, much more powerful

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:08.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than needed to do the job
of rescuing Jehovah’s people

00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:10.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sweeping out of existence

00:54:10.059 --> 00:54:14.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s entire wicked system.

00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:16.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then after Armageddon,

00:54:16.524 --> 00:54:18.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glorious Thousand Year Reign

00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:21.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Christ Jesus will begin.

00:54:21.904 --> 00:54:24.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during that marvelous time,

00:54:24.698 --> 00:54:26.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the last verse

00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:30.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the book of Daniel will be fulfilled.

00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:31.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s read it.

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:35.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last verse of this book, chapter 12,

00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 13.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:40.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s what was said to Daniel:

00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:44.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But as for you, go on to the end.

00:54:44.677 --> 00:54:48.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will rest, but you will stand up

00:54:48.556 --> 00:54:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your lot at the end of the days.”

00:54:52.268 --> 00:54:55.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Daniel served Jehovah faithfully

00:54:55.729 --> 00:54:57.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the end of his life.

00:54:57.857 --> 00:54:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went “to the end,” didn’t he?

00:54:59.942 --> 00:55:02.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he’s resting in death,

00:55:02.778 --> 00:55:06.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but soon he “will stand up”
in the resurrection

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during Christ’s Millennial Reign

00:55:08.742 --> 00:55:13.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for [his] lot”—his place in the new world.

00:55:13.581 --> 00:55:16.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we ask, Did Daniel have faith
in that promise

00:55:16.792 --> 00:55:19.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah gave him through the angel?

00:55:19.545 --> 00:55:22.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, he did!

00:55:22.339 --> 00:55:25.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had already demonstrated
faith for decades.

00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remained clean when tempted to eat food

00:55:28.971 --> 00:55:31.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 that would defile him.

00:55:31.265 --> 00:55:33.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was diligent in prayer,

00:55:33.267 --> 00:55:37.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when praying meant
that he would be executed.

00:55:37.438 --> 00:55:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never stopped building his faith
through Bible study.

00:55:42.443 --> 00:55:46.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can be sure
he believed with all his heart

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that promise Jehovah gave him
through the angel

00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:51.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that he would stand up in the resurrection

00:55:51.827 --> 00:55:55.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take his place in the new world.

00:55:55.414 --> 00:55:57.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,

00:55:57.416 --> 00:56:00.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we maintain our faith

00:56:00.669 --> 00:56:02.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Daniel did?

00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:06.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by staying morally
and spiritually clean,

00:56:06.217 --> 00:56:09.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not allowing anything to corrupt our faith;

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by praying constantly

00:56:12.306 --> 00:56:17.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with full confidence that Jehovah
will answer our prayers;

00:56:17.102 --> 00:56:19.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by listening to Jehovah

00:56:19.271 --> 00:56:23.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by diligent study of his Word.

00:56:23.317 --> 00:56:26.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to have faith

00:56:26.445 --> 00:56:29.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he is our Rewarder.

00:56:29.406 --> 00:56:31.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 11:6 says:

00:56:31.575 --> 00:56:36.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever approaches God must believe
that he is [that he’s really there]

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:40.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that he becomes the rewarder

00:56:40.501 --> 00:56:44.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those earnestly seeking him.”

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about our two brothers
shown earlier in this talk:

00:56:48.509 --> 00:56:52.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian father and the sick brother.

00:56:52.513 --> 00:56:55.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian father ended up behind bars,

00:56:55.808 --> 00:56:59.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our sick brother
was not miraculously healed.

00:56:59.603 --> 00:57:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was their faith in vain?

00:57:02.398 --> 00:57:05.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, no!

00:57:05.484 --> 00:57:07.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will Jehovah reward them?

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty, yes!

00:57:10.948 --> 00:57:14.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are facing a similar situation,

00:57:14.243 --> 00:57:16.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will Jehovah reward you?

00:57:16.328 --> 00:57:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most definitely yes!

00:57:19.748 --> 00:57:22.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video

00:57:22.668 --> 00:57:25.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which features the song that we will sing

00:57:25.963 --> 00:57:28.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conclude our convention.

00:57:28.465 --> 00:57:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy this video.

00:57:52.197 --> 00:57:57.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I fear the lion?

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:04.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should I fear any foe?

00:58:04.918 --> 00:58:08.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah by my side,

00:58:08.839 --> 00:58:12.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will not run and hide.

00:58:12.259 --> 00:58:18.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My God is with me; this I know.

00:58:18.182 --> 00:58:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:27.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

there’s nothing more to fear.

With eyes of faith.

00:59:00.974 --> 00:59:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those faithful ones before us

00:59:07.356 --> 00:59:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lived their lives in loyalty.

00:59:13.529 --> 00:59:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By their faith they endured.

00:59:17.324 --> 00:59:20.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their future is assured.

00:59:20.744 --> 00:59:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll stand again for all to see.

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith,

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

With eyes of faith, I can move a mountain.

01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eyes of faith, my hope is sure.

01:00:12.421 --> 01:00:14.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would I be

01:00:14.673 --> 01:00:19.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the faith that helps me see

01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beyond the trials I endure?

01:00:29.771 --> 01:00:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see the wondrous future

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:41.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has in store for me.

01:00:43.118 --> 01:00:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need to be strong.

01:00:46.288 --> 01:00:49.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it won’t be long

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:55.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Till Jehovah claims his victory.

01:00:55.881 --> 01:00:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we look forward to singing that song

01:01:59.194 --> 01:02:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conclude our convention.

01:02:02.656 --> 01:02:04.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

01:02:04.992 --> 01:02:06.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful children,

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:09.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cherished interested ones,

01:02:09.538 --> 01:02:12.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no doubt that right now

01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:16.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we face powerful enemies.

01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:19.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one thing, we have a powerful enemy

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside our bodies

01:02:21.633 --> 01:02:23.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—inherited sin.

01:02:23.635 --> 01:02:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wages an intense war
against our desire to do what is right.

01:02:29.683 --> 01:02:33.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Secondly, we have the formidable foes:

01:02:33.687 --> 01:02:36.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan and his demons.

01:02:36.773 --> 01:02:40.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is described as a devouring lion,

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a cunning serpent,

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fierce dragon,

01:02:44.448 --> 01:02:46.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sneaky birdcatcher,

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:49.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s given other evil descriptions.

01:02:49.161 --> 01:02:51.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 6:12 says:

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have a struggle
[the footnote, literally “a wrestling”]

01:02:56.084 --> 01:03:01.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . against the wicked spirit forces
in the heavenly places.”

01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:05.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as mentioned in our publications,
there may be tens of thousands

01:03:05.385 --> 01:03:08.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of these powerful, evil spirit creatures

01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:10.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the invisible realm

01:03:10.807 --> 01:03:15.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
waging war against us.

01:03:15.145 --> 01:03:19.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirdly, we have this wicked world
all around us

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is trying to assimilate us

01:03:22.402 --> 01:03:26.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into joining them in ungodly conduct.

01:03:26.782 --> 01:03:28.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking at the ratio,

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:33.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as Jehovah’s people
are outnumbered by people of the world

01:03:33.205 --> 01:03:37.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by about 900 to 1.

01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:42.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite the power
of those three great enemies,

01:03:42.547 --> 01:03:47.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith—this product
of Jehovah’s invincible holy spirit—

01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:53.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us stronger and stronger individually

01:03:53.266 --> 01:03:57.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than all of those three enemies combined.

01:03:58.605 --> 01:04:00.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the near future,

01:04:00.649 --> 01:04:03.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another powerful enemy will come against us.

01:04:03.985 --> 01:04:06.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This formidable foe

01:04:06.863 --> 01:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a coalition of nations
called Gog in Ezekiel chapter 38.

01:04:11.868 --> 01:04:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Ezekiel chapter 38 says
that Gog will come with “a great assembly,

01:04:16.873 --> 01:04:18.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vast army.”

01:04:18.959 --> 01:04:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Like clouds covering the land,”

01:04:21.545 --> 01:04:25.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will come against God’s people.

01:04:25.215 --> 01:04:28.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this could be
a very intimidating situation.

01:04:28.802 --> 01:04:30.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But dear brothers and sisters,

01:04:30.804 --> 01:04:35.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your faith will make you stronger than Gog

01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:38.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will keep you strong

01:04:38.103 --> 01:04:42.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until Jehovah miraculously intervenes
at Armageddon.

01:04:42.023 --> 01:04:45.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it,
Armageddon really is a rescue operation.

01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:47.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will intervene,

01:04:47.654 --> 01:04:52.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will sweep attacking Gog away forever

01:04:52.492 --> 01:04:56.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a “broom of annihilation.”

01:04:56.538 --> 01:05:00.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, faith has helped God’s people

01:05:00.876 --> 01:05:05.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to overcome the most powerful obstacles,

01:05:05.046 --> 01:05:08.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that same product of holy spirit

01:05:08.008 --> 01:05:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us do the same.

01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:14.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, throughout the centuries,
just like today,

01:05:14.514 --> 01:05:16.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s servants, such as Daniel,

01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:20.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been made powerful,

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not by natural strength, but through faith.

01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:27.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So dear brothers and sisters,

01:05:27.736 --> 01:05:30.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faithful children,

01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:32.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cherished interested ones,

01:05:32.616 --> 01:05:35.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray earnestly for faith.

01:05:35.118 --> 01:05:38.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put up a hard fight to maintain your faith.

01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:41.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And trust with all your heart

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:43.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if you have faith,

01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:46.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maintain your faith, and walk by faith,

01:05:46.379 --> 01:05:49.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you definitely will see

01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:54.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of Jehovah’s promises fulfilled.

01:05:57.057 --> 01:05:59.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lett.

01:05:59.184 --> 01:06:02.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your talk and this entire convention

01:06:02.729 --> 01:06:06.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have strengthened our faith
and prepared us for future events.

01:06:09.277 --> 01:06:11.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All in attendance will be pleased to know

01:06:11.613 --> 01:06:14.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

and his Son, Jesus Christ,

01:06:36.471 --> 01:06:39.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite difficult world conditions.

01:06:39.558 --> 01:06:43.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

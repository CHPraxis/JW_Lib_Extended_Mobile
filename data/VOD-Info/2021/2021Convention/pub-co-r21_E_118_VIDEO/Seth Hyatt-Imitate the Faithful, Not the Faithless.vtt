00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For almost 40 years,

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses enjoyed a life of comfort and privilege

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the adopted son of Pharaoh’s daughter.

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:15.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Among the advantages were material prosperity

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and advanced education.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How might those advantages

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have affected Moses’ outlook?

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:27.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gain some insight
from an incident that took place

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Moses was 80 years of age.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s recorded in Exodus chapter 5.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:36.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, in a conversation with the Pharaoh,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Pharaoh is reported
to have said to Moses:

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who is Jehovah,
that I should obey his voice . . . ?

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know Jehovah at all.”

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No truer words have ever been spoken

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Pharaoh did not know Jehovah 

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result, had no faith in him.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was faithless.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His haughty words,

00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dismissive of Jehovah,

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt reflected the Egyptian belief

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Pharaoh was himself a god.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Moses’ outlook

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected in a negative way
by that Egyptian culture?

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:17.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see a refreshing contrast.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was a humble man,

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man of faith who, at the age of 40,

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:31.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a decision that reflected
the depth of that faith

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that changed his life forever.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why should you and I

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be interested in Moses’ example of faith?

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because like Moses,

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:47.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we face situations that require choices

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—decisions that reflect
the quality of our faith.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, note how an elder

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faces a test of his faith
in the following dramatization.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny is going to look after the business

00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while we’re away.

00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:19.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only scheduled a few small jobs.

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure he can handle it.

00:02:30.796 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our assigned convention,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I planned as best I could
for us to go together.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some things

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you just can’t see coming.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:45.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny was in a panic.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got trouble calls
from my two biggest accounts.

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was bad.

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t lose their business.

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For just a few minutes,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider what the Scriptures
have to say about Moses’ faith

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider four ways
that we can imitate him.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn, please, to Hebrews chapter 11,

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:22.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to begin reading in verse 24

00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Hebrews 11:24:

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Moses, when grown up,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“refused to be called
the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,

00:03:33.817 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“choosing to be
mistreated with the people of God

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to have
the temporary enjoyment of sin.”

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first thing that Moses did?

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He rejected the proud,
selfish thinking of that Egyptian world.

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:56.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He chose to be mistreated

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:59.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Israelites who were slaves

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:02.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to align himself with a culture

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:04.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that dismissed Jehovah.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What prompted that decision?

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening words of verse 24 tell us

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Moses was a man of faith,

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his faith shaped his decisions

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not his culture, not community pressure—

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his faith.

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s our second point.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s continue reading in verse 26:

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because he considered
the reproach of the Christ

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be riches greater
than the treasures of Egypt,

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:43.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses received an assignment,

00:04:49.393 --> 00:04:52.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a commission, from Jehovah,

00:04:52.646 --> 00:04:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he viewed
that commission as more valuable

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than anything that Egypt had to offer.

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned his back on the comforts of Egypt

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and aligned himself with Jehovah
and the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:11.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third point:

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had clear spiritual vision.

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:17.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:21.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses could see outside the “Egypt box,”

00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:23.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could see the fulfillment

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:28.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s wonderful promises
to Abraham and Abraham’s descendants.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:34.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual vision
is commented on further in verse 27:

00:05:35.397 --> 00:05:37.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith he left Egypt,

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:40.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not fearing the anger of the king,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he continued steadfast

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as seeing the One who is invisible.”

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Moses could see the Pharaoh,

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with his clear spiritual vision,

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could see Jehovah.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses had an unbreakable friendship
with Jehovah,

00:06:00.505 --> 00:06:02.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so can you.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:05.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The quality of any friendship can be measured

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:09.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the quality of communication
that characterizes it.

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:15.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regular heartfelt prayer
and meaningful study of the Bible

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constitute two-way communication

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between an individual and Jehovah.

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we get to know Jehovah better and better

00:06:24.988 --> 00:06:29.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as our faith strengthens and deepens,

00:06:29.326 --> 00:06:34.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then our decisions reflect that faith.

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:38.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in our words and actions,

00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we give evidence of that faith.

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:44.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that brings us to the fourth point:

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:48.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the opening words of verse 27:

00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:52.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith [Moses] left Egypt.”

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His faith was of such quality

00:06:56.103 --> 00:06:59.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was evidenced
in his words and his actions.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, Moses was a man of action

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:05.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he left Egypt.

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:10.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was also a man
who expressed his convictions.

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Moses and the Israelites
stood on the shore of the Red Sea

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:17.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Pharaoh
and his armies behind them

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Red Sea in front of them

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:22.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seemingly nowhere to go,

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:26.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did Moses strengthen the people?

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be afraid.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stand [still] and see
the salvation of Jehovah.”

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:38.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words must have
strengthened the Israelites.

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
we can strengthen those around us,

00:07:42.816 --> 00:07:47.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether in the preaching work, in our
dealings with our family, or with others.

00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our faith is voiced

00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:55.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and evidenced
in the things that we say and do,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re a blessing to those around us.

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s important
that we stay humble as Moses did

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:08.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ever receptive
to Jehovah’s direction and counsel

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he provides
through his Word and his organization.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how about that elder who we met earlier.

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in and see how he imitates Moses

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:23.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making a decision.

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:28.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, just find the parts,

00:08:28.195 --> 00:08:30.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll call you back.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:33.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will take all weekend.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want us to go?

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:37.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you get the program later?

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:41.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, and I’ll have to text John
that I can’t be an attendant.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will I miss that I can’t get later?

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:59.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:26 it says

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:04.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses “considered the reproach of the Christ

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:08.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be riches greater
than the treasure of Egypt,

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:12.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

00:09:12.948 --> 00:09:15.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt

Honey, what do you think?

Danny?

00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:34.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:36.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what I want you to do for now,

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll pick up the pieces when I get back.

00:09:43.645 --> 00:09:46.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how the elder

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:50.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a decision based on his faith?

00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:52.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With his eyes of faith,

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:56.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could see the blessings
that he and his family would enjoy

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:59.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they attended the convention together, 

00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:04.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he made a decision as a spiritual man.

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way, if we imitate Moses

00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:10.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by rejecting the proud,
selfish thinking of the world

00:10:10.297 --> 00:10:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowing our decisions
to be shaped by our faith

00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:18.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not by culture or community pressure,

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:21.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we maintain clear spiritual vision,

00:10:21.308 --> 00:10:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if our faith is evidenced
in our words and actions,

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:29.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can be confident of Jehovah’s support

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his hand of salvation in our behalf,

00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:34.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he did for Moses.

Brother Robert Ciranko,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:42.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will consider
the final talk of this symposium,

00:10:42.662 --> 00:10:46.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Imitate the Faithful, Not the Faithless

00:10:46.666 --> 00:10:50.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Jesus’ Disciples, Not the Pharisees.”

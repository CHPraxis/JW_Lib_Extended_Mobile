Have you experienced
an unexpected financial setback?

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your child struggling
to resist peer pressure

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unwholesome influences from the Internet?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been diagnosed
with a life-threatening disease?

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life in this wicked system
can seem like a dark wilderness.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may feel alone, discouraged,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like we just don’t know where to turn.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is why more than ever,

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to strengthen
our faith in God’s Word.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we study the Bible and take it to heart,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in God grows
and something amazing happens.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out what that is
at 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 13

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:45.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Thessalonians 2:13:

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Indeed, that is why

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:52.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we also thank God unceasingly,

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because when you received God’s word,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which you heard from us,

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:00.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you accepted it not as the word of men

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but, just as it truthfully is,

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as the word of God,

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:09.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is also at work in you believers.”

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does God’s Word work in us?

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has already transformed us
into faithful servants of Jehovah God,

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it also gives us
the power to remain strong

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under difficult circumstances.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This subject is timely

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we live in a world where so many

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:32.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant seeds of doubt about the Bible.

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They say it is something outdated
or inaccurate.

00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is our determination not to allow
the world’s mistaken views

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to erode our faith in the Bible.

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this talk, we’re going to look
at three proofs

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:50.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us maintain our love and confidence

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God’s inspired Word:

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its prophecies,
what it says about the earth,

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its survival against all odds.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take the first point
—Bible prophecies.

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:05.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beyond man’s reach

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the ability
to foresee the future in detail.

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Almighty God can do this.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, secular history tells us

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the year 539 B.C.E.,

00:02:18.158 --> 00:02:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a man named Cyrus
conquered the land of Babylon

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowed thousands of Jewish captives
to return home

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible also tells us about these events,

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one notable exception.

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:38.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While secular history recounts these events
after they happened,

00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:42.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible foretold these events
before they took place

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in fact, some 200 years before.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:48.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a closer look
and see for ourselves.

00:02:48.564 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to Isaiah chapter 44

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 44—

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:59.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verses 27 and 28.

00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read these verses,
please take special notice

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how many times the word “will” appears.

00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The One saying to the deep waters,

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Be evaporated,
and I will dry up all your rivers’;

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,

00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will completely carry out
all my will’;

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the One saying of Jerusalem,
‘She will be rebuilt,’

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:32.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the temple,
‘Your foundation will be laid.’”

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This isn’t Jehovah God just guessing

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or trying to figure out the future.

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s decided what will happen,

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will make it happen.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could the Bible predict
this kind of detail

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 200 years in advance?

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is only one explanation.

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn a couple of chapters over
to Isaiah chapter 46,

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 10.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From the beginning I foretell the outcome,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from long ago
the things that have not yet been done.

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I say, ‘My decision will stand,

00:04:11.563 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will do whatever I please.’”

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s fulfilled prophecies like these

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that build trust and confidence
in God’s Word.

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another reason
we have faith in the Bible

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:29.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of what it says about the earth.

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider an example at Job chapter 26,

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse 7.

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job 26:7:

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:46.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He stretches out the northern sky
over empty space,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
suspending the earth upon nothing.”

00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was stated some 3,500 years ago.

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Job’s statement
would have appeared ridiculous

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Greek philosopher Aristotle,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who taught that an object must rest upon

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be attached to something
or else it will fall.

00:05:07.953 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not until 1687

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:13.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the scientist Isaac Newton explained

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:17.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the earth is held in orbit
by an invisible force

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appearing as if it were suspended on nothing.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did the Bible know the truth
more than 3,000 years ago?

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer:

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:32.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the Word of God,
and “God . . . cannot lie.”

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take our third line of evidence,

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is the Bible’s survival.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the original books of the Bible
have disappeared,

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accurate copies of the Bible manuscripts
have survived to our day

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite natural decay, fierce opposition,

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:54.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and deliberate tampering with its message.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 40:8 tells us:

00:05:57.294 --> 00:06:01.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:05.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible has not endured
as a mere museum display;

00:06:05.802 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its message has endured.

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That inspired message

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been conveyed in over 3,000 languages.

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is irrefutable proof
of its divine origin.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:21.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following video
presents additional evidence

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:24.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible is God’s Word.

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:26.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay attention to this.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t that faith-strengthening

00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:19.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see more evidence
that the Bible is God’s Word?

00:10:19.723 --> 00:10:22.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen
our conviction in God’s Word?

00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do so by creating
study projects to build our faith.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One fascinating project involves

00:10:29.274 --> 00:10:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy at Genesis 3:15.

00:10:33.028 --> 00:10:35.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you can quote it by heart,

00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:39.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but have you ever sat down
and taken the time to make a timeline,

00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:43.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listing key scriptures that show
how God bit by bit shed light

00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:47.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the individuals and the arrangement
referred to in this verse?

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:50.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we take time to really study the Bible

00:10:50.378 --> 00:10:54.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on these golden threads
running through the Bible,

00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:58.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our faith in God’s Word will be strengthened.

00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you had doubts about something?

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:01.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then write it down.

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:05.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then use our research tools
such as the <i>Study Bible</i>,

00:11:05.143 --> 00:11:09.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>JW Library®</i>, <i>Watchtower ONLINE Library</i>®
to dig deeper.

00:11:09.814 --> 00:11:11.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s worth the effort.

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:15.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you’re a parent,
help your children come to know

00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fall in love
with the Author of the Bible.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so close to begin
the real life in the new world.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:29.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time to strengthen
our trust and confidence in the Bible.

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:32.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we have strong faith in God’s Word,

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:36.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can feel as did our young brother Ruslan
from Turkmenistan

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:41.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who faces his second prison term
because of his faith.

00:11:41.137 --> 00:11:43.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He declared:

00:11:43.181 --> 00:11:47.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have strong faith
that Jehovah will reward me. . . .

00:11:47.477 --> 00:11:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where there is a strong hope,
there is endless joy;

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:54.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where there is joy,
there is strength and endurance.

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:59.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a strong person can never be broken.”

00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:02.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
